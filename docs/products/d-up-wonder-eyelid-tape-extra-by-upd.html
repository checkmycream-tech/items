            <li>Great adhesion.  </li>
            <li>Great packaging and great item</li>
            <li>Need to pratice more!!</li>
            <li>I have used so many types of eyelid tapes and that&#x27;s the best one I ever used!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>They are good for my eyes ,, but i need to use olive oil when i want to wear off them or i will burn lol</li>
            <li>I have tried many and this is the best out there.</li>
            <li>nice and sticky!</li>
            <li>Hehe :-P</li>
            <li>Great price for so many!  </li>
            <li>work very good, even I put it on top of my make up,</li>
            <li>(Since I like this version of eye tape the best (´∀｀)♡ It doesn&#x27;t show since it&#x27;s sticky on both sides and you are able to make almost any kind of crease.)</li>
            <li>really good eyelid tape which I have bought a lot of times</li>
            <li>It is really good product for me.</li>
            <li>Good work for Asia Women.</li>
            <li>Good.</li>
            <li>I do think this is a good product and the stickiness</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li>One good thing was it did not make my eye irritated.</li>
            <li>but if I want to put eye make up on, one sticky side always comes off and start to show --- still a good product but not quite for me.</li>
            <li>I worked with them for a while and got good at applying them, but still couldn&#x27;t acheive the desired effect.</li>
            <li>Work really good.</li>
            <li>and hopefully in 3 months time will see the good result.</li>
            <li>The seller took care to wrap each one into it&#x27;s own plastic wrap/warnings and it was all very nicely done and it arrived safely to my home!</li>
            <li>It shipped quick and on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>Very magic eyelid tape.</li>
            <li>I never knew these products existed until I tried this one, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely one of the best products for creating natural, beautiful eye creases out there!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good effective eyelid tape.</li>
            <li>I love using this eyelid tape!</li>
            <li>Satisfied!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Still love them to this day!</li>
            <li>beginning is OK ,but after a while the bothering me!</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>You gotta love it!</li>
            <li>i love this product!</li>
            <li>As a testament to this item, I just ordered 2 more packages!</li>
            <li>After a couple weeks of wearing it, the tape created a crease on my eyelid that resulted in a more symmetric look without having to use the tape non-stop!  </li>
            <li>I love them!</li>
            <li>and I have to say they are amazing.</li>
            <li>Take off with warm water to loosen the adhesive and to wash residue off your eye.</li>
            <li>.. they can tend to irritate the lid at that edge and also start to peel off at that edge - comes in handy when you want to take them off</li>
            <li>, I just blame my own eyelids for not working with this product.</li>
            <li>; but I&#x27;m grateful for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my own experiences, this tape was a pain in the ass to use but worked.</li>
            <li>So, these strips work kind of like an eye lift surgery.</li>
            <li>Despite the high price, this product is the best.</li>
            <li>This is my first time to use this product, and it is very good as what i thought.</li>
            <li>Great for monolids, but also great for 50 year old saggy eyelids!</li>
            <li>;  it worked ok under makeup if i did a really good job, but for the most part it was visible.  </li>
            <li>kinda easy to apply ,good product anyway</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li>I think this eyelid tape is very easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t show if you don&#x27;t close your eyes.</li>
            <li>Anyway, the adhesive is very strong.</li>
            <li>day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very strong adhesive, so</li>
            <li>is very strong like how they said it would</li>
            <li>Tape is very strong and stays put.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and practice makes perfect&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also fell off my eyelid very easily.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best product i&#x27;ve tried!!  </li>
            <li>They provide a plastic tweezer that is good for getting one edge of the tape onto the tweezer for easy application without touching the sticky side.  </li>
            <li>glad I chose this brand and product, couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is strong and will hold your eyelid in place!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve never worn eyelid tape before, but this product was unbelievably easy to use even without the instructions, and the outcome looks absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li>when it sounds too good to be true..........</li>
            <li>Also , they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This is probably a very good product, but I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Very comfortable wearing them</li>
            <li>This eyelid tape is super good.</li>
            <li>Using these is actually easy and effective.</li>
            <li>Very natural it&#x27;s very easy to put on your eyes and it sticks on all day !!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t stick well with eyeshadow on already so make sure to put tapes on before eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>i purchased these strips in the hope of creating a look that opens my eyes more.  </li>
            <li>These stay on all day on top of my makeup.</li>
            <li>but i practiced on that one with much more times.</li>
            <li>Love this product..</li>
            <li>so I have experimented many glues and tapes.  </li>
            <li>As a single-lidder, I love this product.</li>
            <li>product is great, shipping is fast.</li>
            <li>love this product.</li>
            <li>but it worked and looked better with practice.  </li>
            <li>I just need more practice and it will work much better...</li>
            <li>Better than all others I tried.</li>
            <li>and I have tried many types..</li>
            <li>I guess, for me, if the strips were witderit would have done a better job.</li>
            <li>NO ONE will be able to tell you have it on.</li>
            <li>Simply the best eyelid tape ever.</li>
            <li>Tried many times since it has 120pcs, I don&#x27;t have to worry about how many I tried.</li>
            <li>I can already see the difference in pictures, and I&#x27;m so glad that I can fix this problem that I thought I&#x27;d never be able to fix.</li>
            <li>My favorite brand for eyelid tape.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>But till then, these are fantastic!</li>
            <li>Just be sure to practice</li>
            <li>For those days when my eyelids seem to droop a bit (age is taking its toll), this is the best product, next to surgery, to look rested and alert.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>So make sure everything is even before you start jabbing your eyes with the prong.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Gives me the confidence i need to buy agian :)</li>
            <li>More important, it&#x27;s not visible!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really good and useful</li>
            <li>The tape seems to stay on for almost a day and if you can get it in a good position, I dont think you could tell it was there (which is a good thing because it looked natural).</li>
            <li>(and the eyelid tape itself comes on sheets, with many to a sheet)</li>
            <li>but overall I am very happy.</li>
            <li>However the left always comes out perfect</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that they cant be seen.</li>
            <li>and i would have to spend a bit more time on it than i wanted to.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found anything better than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many eye-tapes and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li>Love love love this.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great quality product.</li>
            <li>These are okay for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li>I might experiment with it more</li>
            <li>, the more it works to hide the tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>Like the title says, wondereye eyelid tape is probably the best double eyelid tool that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;After many months of experimenting, I have noticed the following is the best routine on putting on eye makeup with this tape:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just ordered more because I plan to use them whenever I go out.</li>
            <li>Just love with what you were born with and</li>
            <li>These did not stick to me for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>and i have oily skin too! :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;-the package comes with a lot of tapes great pricing&lt;br /&gt;- pretty easy to apply</li>
            <li>It really work on me!!!!</li>
            <li>and it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>As many have menioned before, this is a STRONG tape.</li>
            <li>buying from Amazon, I found out they&#x27;re selling it near my place lol)</li>
            <li>plus, the longer you have it on the chances of it becoming permanent</li>
            <li>It took about three tries to figure what works best for me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard some stories of peoples creases becoming permanent after years of use.</li>
            <li>I find the tweezers good for getting the tape on, but the instructions show them used to press the lid inward, but that does not work because you end up sticking the tweezer onto the very sticky tape.</li>
            <li>In the morning, I just wash my fash and eye area with face wash and warm water and the tape just comes right off.</li>
            <li>This Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and was easy to remove</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Easily placed and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>so its easy to store.</li>
            <li>As people said, it is easy to use because the instruction is provided.</li>
            <li>i is easy to use and it is almost invisible even if you dont put on make up.</li>
            <li>Extremely easy to apply compared with the Fiber tape.</li>
            <li>It works like a charm, easy to.apply and take off.</li>
            <li>They are easy to remove if you need to replace - but the stickiness does run out if you keep messing with it.</li>
            <li>At night, it easily slips off as I remove my eye makeup with a makeup wipe.</li>
            <li>sure you have CLEAN skin ...</li>
            <li>The tape is easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and stick well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and there is a lot.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t need anything too strong.</li>
            <li>, this tape is strong, but I don&#x27;t have any issue of removing it.</li>
            <li>It is strong as well I can sweat a storm during a workout and it still stays on.</li>
            <li>Strong adhesive quality.</li>
            <li>It takes some practice to know where to apply it based on how your eyelid fold fall, but it sticks all day and is comfortable, and it is easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It works fine, but the tape wears off after 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li>and it is fine with makeup on, the darker the makeup</li>
            <li>After that it is fine.</li>
            <li>It worked fine</li>
            <li>/&gt;I bought this to help even out my lids and it has helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li>It did take me a little while to figure out the best placement</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a huge difference in your look.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Do not expect to have huge doe eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not 100percenf comfortable</li>
            <li>This eyelid tape is double sided and great for my hooded lids.  </li>
            <li>It is very sticky and I would recommend to take it off with warm water and makeup remover to avoid pulling on the eyelid and causing it to become saggy.</li>
            <li>The adhesive holds well and is relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li>In fact, if you want to get a permanent double eyelid, I recommend wearing this (one sided tape just doesn&#x27;t work on me lol).</li>
            <li>Cheap materials.</li>
            <li>They last all day and can&#x27;t be seen which is great.</li>
            <li>They stay on, but people do notice when the light catches the end of it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price, it is a lot more than the $2.00 ones</li>
            <li>I was already hesitant in making the step to use these (even if they were translucent), but read such great reviews that I thought I&#x27;d just TRY and see.</li>
            <li>I am an Asian and it worked great for my eyes.</li>
            <li>Very sticky but did not work for me, maybe because of my own problem.</li>
            <li>Great product for Asian girls.</li>
            <li>; LOL If he only knew I had taped lids.  </li>
            <li>And it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li>Though it took 20 or so pieces to actually get it ON for me and EVEN, it was great.</li>
            <li>No one can even tell the difference and people say that it looks so natural and good on me.</li>
            <li>looks natural, once you get used to use it , it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li>But the older I get the more hooded my eyelids get, so I turned to the internet for some solutions!</li>
            <li>I was able to put makeup right over it and it was truly invisible.</li>
            <li>the product actually really works!!!</li>
            <li>really amazing, feels so natural double eyelid looking, strongly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>It is very convenient to bring, and it is very easy to use</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews so believe me people!</li>
            <li>They stay on great and even when I&#x27;m sweating or having long stressful days.  </li>
            <li>It did make the eye look more pretty.</li>
            <li>Went from &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; to O_O. good stuff</li>
            <li>I was excited to try these</li>
            <li>well worth the price!  </li>
            <li>Jap product is good in general</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good product, though I wouldn&#x27;t pay the new price of $20 for it.</li>
            <li>pretty easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product, very well designed, easy to use and its looks very natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li>BUT  it sometimes hurts if it is not in the right spot !.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the product, I hope it can actuallly help make a crease for my left eyelid:)) will definitely buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li>Wayyy better than the glue and so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I have a full monolid and my eyelids are sorta of chunky.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for those with a monolid without any trace of a double lid.</li>
            <li>This is not a use full product for every one.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>This might be a problem for first time users, but if you&#x27;re familiar with the process, you should be fine.  </li>
            <li>I found many brands of this particular product on amazon, but this one not only had the most reviews, it had the most positive reviews - in fact, most of the reviews were raving.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The cons are pretty easily handled with some eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>after wearing the tape every night for two months both eyelids are equally thick and i am one happy girl :)</li>
            <li>And thank you to the seller for the pricing and the quick delivery.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of glueing both skins together on ur eyelid so it really doesnt show much in public..</li>
            <li>eyelid tape is very strong, sticks very well, and is double sided, which is great for those without any sort of natural crease in the eye.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for droopy eyes like mine :)</li>
            <li>After a few tries, I find it to be the best product of its kind that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>But i don&#x27;t know why this one is not as good as before, it can&#x27;t stick my eyelid for a long time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for so long, and the price is good too.</li>
            <li>I love it, and I&#x27;ve found stores where I live that sell it</li>
            <li>Love the product, brand new, and unused.</li>
            <li>Learn to love the way you look, and trust me, it&#x27;ll be a love that saves you hundreds of dollars in the long run.</li>
            <li>Very helpful and easy to use~</li>
            <li>The eyelid tape is great for those who have Missmatching eyelid curves, or have very little crease and want your eyes to look bigger, is a good product</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>It just really works!!</li>
            <li>and it WORKED - the first time!</li>
            <li>The new crease is beginning to stay on its own and it is really giving me the look that I&#x27;ve always desired.</li>
            <li>These are very light weight and clear.</li>
            <li>Even though I thought this was a great product it is a little pricey</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and all other aspects of the purchase was good.</li>
            <li>very useful, good item,just a little expensive.i like it.</li>
            <li>this is actually useful.</li>
            <li>I cut about 2mm off each side to make them fit my smaller eyes better.</li>
            <li>Since the directions are not in English, it requires a bit of practice on your own to see where on your eyelid</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, overall - a really effective product.</li>
            <li>For the price I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also kind of short, so if you have a longer eye, the tape might be problematic.</li>
            <li>tried a few, best so far ,works well.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost and time to apply.</li>
            <li>I like this product a lot, the only thing I dislike is MY OWN eyelids.</li>
            <li>When I got these though, they made me laugh.  </li>
            <li>this one is the most useful one so far.</li>
            <li>Sounds grueling, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Many people don&#x27;t notice my eyelid size difference when they&#x27;re looking at me, but in pictures, it&#x27;s extremely noticeable, and it becomes even more noticeable when I wear makeup.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and glues and nothing works as good as this one.</li>
            <li>Plenty of practice required to get it on just right.</li>
            <li>I use these when my right eye turns into a mono lid.</li>
            <li>If I apply them the right way, they&#x27;ll stick for 12 hours easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but my right eye does.</li>
            <li>I might end up with a monolid on my right eye.</li>
            <li>I just got it today and tried it right away.</li>
            <li>Today specifically, my friend noticed something wasn&#x27;t quite right and told me to close my eyes...</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>First I thought I just didn&#x27;t apply them right.</li>
            <li>Complete invisible and easy to use</li>
            <li>The results of wearing this product with my glue was really nice, my eyelids were big and my eyes looked a lot wider people didn&#x27;t really notice the glue and the tape until I told them.</li>
            <li>It was really good when you put make up on, but sometimes I feel like it is kinda &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; for the result I want.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very easy to peel the tape off from the plastic</li>
            <li>I have tried a few kinds of eyelid tapes/glue but most of them have many drawbacks.</li>
            <li>So far, this is fine, however, I hope they make the tapes 50% wider.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and seller ships fast, it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li>The applicator is very user-friendly!</li>
            <li>Love that the tape is double sided!</li>
            <li>This product is a must have if you love the double eye lid look!</li>
            <li>Say that 10 times fast!  </li>
            <li>I would suggest purchasing an inexpensive one to use first before purchasing this if this will be the first time using eyelid tape.  </li>
            <li>After reading many YouTube reviews and online blogs about this \\&quot;miracle item\\&quot; that does wonders for those in the Asian community who want a \\&quot;higher crease\\&quot; or who want an alternative to blepharoplasty (eye-lid surgery), I felt that I needed to try this \\&quot;holy-grail-ed\\&quot; item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Struggled a bit at first</li>
            <li>becomes higher.</li>
            <li>Never used Eyelid Tape before, and try this for my first product.</li>
            <li>After being applied, they work exactly as they say they will--for three or four hours, then the adhesive seems to give up.</li>
            <li>but I wish they had instructions in English but still love the product.</li>
            <li>/blended very well, but the crease stopped about two thirds of the way across my eyes!</li>
            <li>I do find that if I wear them consistently, the eyelid tends to stay for a while.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first week.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Thanks for the reviews from the users!</li>
            <li>I use tweezers to remove the white paper that covers the top side of the tape.</li>
            <li>the first type of eyelid tape</li>
            <li>I first thought &amp;</li>
            <li>Will forever be a customer ;)</li>
            <li>stays on the whole day for me!</li>
            <li>, Michelle Phan said to be prepared to wear the tape consistently for months.</li>
            <li>i find using tweezers was easier than using their funny protractor device it came with.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to get this double sided tape.</li>
            <li>This is the first eyelid tape i&#x27;d bought</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other things, but this tape really is amazing.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting kind of self conscious whenever I wore it and thus only used it consistently at night.</li>
            <li>The price on amazon is reasonable and I&#x27;m glad there is such a convenient way to purchase these in the States!</li>
            <li>The tape definitely holds up and it pretty strong.  </li>
            <li>So it is plausible to believe that with long term use, you can have semi-permanent results with continued use.</li>
            <li>The packaging and wording are pretty much identical</li>
            <li>im southeast asian and have nicely pronounced eyelids (however my right lid has always been thicker and fuller than the left) and</li>
            <li>) make sure lid area is oil free (use a blotting paper to remove excess oils)&lt;br /&gt;2) position tape directly ontop of your natural crease, if you have \\&quot;hooded\\&quot; double lids</li>
            <li>This is not just for Asian gals, but for anyone who has older, droopy lids, anyone with hooded lids, anyone of any age who wants to look naturally better.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, the tape will become less sticky and effective.</li>
            <li>hopefully after wearing it long enough my lid will stay creased for good.</li>
            <li>Thanks to a youtube demo, I can now  easily apply the tape to open up my hooded eyes.  </li>
            <li>shade in eyeshow with a fine brush WITH EYES OPEN (this will prevent the shadow powder from unsticking</li>
            <li>My eyes looked fine when I was younger</li>
            <li>The stickiness is pretty decent.. &amp; the application is tricky.</li>
            <li>and when I got a professional makeup artist, she had single sided taped that worked beautifully all day long.</li>
            <li>It was tricky at first, but after a few times it became very easy to use.</li>
            <li>me, however, the tape was a bit on the weaker side, but importantly, it was much too short!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very noticeable when I put eyeliner on.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t rub your eyes too much, it won&#x27;t get irritated</li>
            <li>Sticks on really well for a whole day.</li>
            <li>It absolutely does its job.</li>
            <li>I have very hooded eyes.</li>
            <li>Shipping  came fast..</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>It works really well</li>
            <li>But you can figure out how to use the tapes without too much</li>
            <li>It does not stick very well.</li>
            <li>It really does stick and lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t really know how to put these on</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the style of sticky on both side</li>
            <li>shipping was fast</li>
            <li>They work very well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very grateful.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I have very hooded eyelids.  </li>
            <li>and I threw it away after using one whole page of tape.</li>
            <li>so she thinks I&#x27;m attentively listening to her the entire time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product by itself did do much by itself so I would have to use my eye glue to layer the strip</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow with this product because your brush might separate the skin</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I am very self-conscious about one of my droopy eyes, and this product has helped a lot.</li>
            <li>Very sticky so they stay in place.</li>
            <li>Did not stick very well to my eyelids through out the day, and the applicator wasn&#x27;t what I was use to.</li>
            <li>I do have oily skin, so that may have contributed to it not sticking very well through the day.</li>
            <li>and you can see the tape, not to mention it really irritates my skin....fail.</li>
            <li>I used this for that eye, but it was too much for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just gently rub the makeup remover all over it, and start working it in at one of the corners until it begins to lift.</li>
            <li>Continue rubbing and working the makeup remover under the tape until the whole thing comes off.</li>
            <li>When i use it, it can stick my eyelid, it is really invisible.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would wear it under makeup to work and it held very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li>I really, really wanted to like this tape</li>
            <li>My eyelids got really irritated and itchy when using the tape.</li>
            <li>This tape is very helpful.</li>
            <li>life will be much easier.</li>
            <li>I have one double lid and one eyelid that likes to switch off between monolid and double lid on its own.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me and you like a more natural eyelid look, don&#x27;t get double sided tape.</li>
            <li>Pictures are available but the product really doesn&#x27;t do much for the age-droop of an older American eye.</li>
            <li>It takes quite a bit to learn to put the tape on correctly as well as creating the right type of crease that looks natural.  </li>
            <li>I used to use the koi eyelid glue, and while I still think it is better than these, these are probably better in the long run as they are faster to apply once you get the hang of it, and also, you can actually get real double-lids if you continue using these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>long lasting, love it!</li>
            <li>You will probably have adhesive left on your eyelid when you take these off, and because of the strength of the tape, it is very easy to leave red welts on your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have tried other tapes bought from Japan which works much better</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re cheaper than all the other options on amazon and they work better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Noticed a difference immediately, and it helps even out when one eye has a more significant double eyelid than the other.</li>
            <li>Even though it costs a bit more compared to the other brand, I don&#x27;t mind spending money on this wonder products which is made from Japan, not China.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to apply, but it Really works!</li>
            <li>I wanted to even out my uneven creases and hopefully give a slightly more defined crease and that&#x27;s exactly what it does.  </li>
            <li>I even used alcohol to clean the skin prior to use.</li>
            <li>The packaging is clean - the individual pieces of tape are covered with a sheet of paper that is perforated in the center for easy removal.</li>
            <li>and so far have worked pretty well.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately one of my lid has more skin than the other and it doesn&#x27;t look like a good crease, it looks like I have 2 or 3 creases &amp;#34;broken crease&amp;#34; when I apply the eyelid tape to my right eye.</li>
            <li>My new crease has stayed put for the whole day.</li>
            <li>loved it, i have uneven eye lids, and it help me even out, especially when putting make up on</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of Vietnamese decent and have had one monolid and one doublelid forever.</li>
            <li>Overall, I will definitely be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li>This is definitely for a young ,wrinkle free eye.</li>
            <li>It works, but you need a steady hand to apply.</li>
            <li>These in the other hand either though they long very narrow are strong enough to hold for up to 12 hours on my eyelids and the best part is that you can&#x27;t see I have it on.</li>
            <li>Not comfortable at all, super sticky and invisbile!!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest those to use an oil based makeup remover in removing this tape.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this eyelid tape.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product😊</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I hope it could be a little more sticky.</li>
            <li>Kind of hard to use</li>
            <li>The thing is, it is still pretty noticeable, and I highly suggest don&#x27;t wear it in public, or else it&#x27;s really embarrassing,</li>
            <li>The reviews are right that it does take a little practice to find the right spot in needs to go on your eyelid for the best results - but as I had been playing around with plain tape prior to receiving, it only took me about 5 tries before I got it right.</li>
            <li>It really makes a noticeable and natural crease.</li>
            <li>Wow the difference is real</li>
            <li>so far didnt see anything about how to take it off gently.</li>
            <li>[like, not that the person is fat but that there is too much fat near the eyelid]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is too expensive, but before I find anything can compare with its great effect, I will stay with it.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday :)</li>
            <li>Description should state that for normal eyelids, it takes 2 strips for each eyelid.</li>
            <li>Confused by the good reviews.</li>
            <li>So easy and better than other products out there that are only single sided tape.  </li>
            <li>The following is a list of issues I experienced after only having successfully worn the strips once (ended up removing before outing was over as strips began to irritate eyes)only to have used up half a sheet of strips on failed attempts:    </li>
            <li>If anyone can suggest a tape that gives a more defined crease or is slightly longer, I&#x27;m all ears!</li>
            <li>It was less flexible and more of a complete &amp;#34;V&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>They last all day long, and I love getting such a large supply at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Much better than the single side double eye lips tape</li>
            <li>now I use this on my right eye and have been wearing it only during the night.</li>
            <li>It works for me to even out my right eye lid with the left one</li>
            <li>is to put it just right above the folds on my lids.</li>
            <li>I used this product to correct my left side eyelid so that it matches with my right side eyelid.  </li>
            <li>also after removing, some adhesive is left, so you can get by for a few hours on just that, which is sometimes refreshing!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does take work, but I&#x27;ve noticed after about a month of use that even if I don&#x27;t wear the strips, my new crease stays.</li>
            <li>I now live my eyes.</li>
            <li>Now, I can put makeup over the new crease.</li>
            <li>I am a lot more confident in showing my eyes because I used to have my bangs cover my left eye since I feel that my uneven eyelids are extremely noticeable.</li>
            <li>Being Asian, as I imagine most of you are, my eyes aren&#x27;t particularly wide or tall, and the tape itself hid</li>
            <li>Comes in a cute little plastic box that you can pop in your medicine cabinet or your purse!</li>
            <li>The tape strips come with an applicator and very clear instructions.  </li>
            <li>I would wake up some days with beautiful natural double lids on both eyes, but whenever I slept weird or was stressed or rubbed my eyes too much</li>
            <li>my left eye was naturally doubled lidded and my right fluctuated.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised to have maintained a permanent double eyelid on my right eye!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I use the tape, my eyelid hood disappears &amp; both of my eyes look exactly the same -</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I am not Asian.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more for REALLY small eyes</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it, application is pretty simple.</li>
            <li>My eyes are pretty Asian though.</li>
            <li>It was quite a nuisance to use actually - I would always be too aware of the plastic poking into my eyelid</li>
            <li>But this tape works fine as long as you want some visible double eyelids.</li>
            <li>I gave them a try and can say they are great for my everyday usage when I&#x27;m not using other eye tapes for a wider younger look.  </li>
            <li>, I very careful take a q-tip and clean that part of the eyelid to get</li>
            <li>They are completely unnoticeable and they look very natural.</li>
            <li>I have tried many product, but finally settled down to this product.</li>
            <li>, I simply watch some tutorials on YouTube and by my 2nd try, I pretty much knew what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also does not help that they pile on 10-15 pieces on a plastic backing as when you remove one, you start peeling off the glue off the others and exposing it to air which makes them less sticky, its a big pain in the butt and could probably use better packing for the tape.</li>
            <li>too much skin on the left vs. the right side), because as with me....I can fold the skin and tape it to make my eyelids even but no matter what unless I have surgery that extra skin causing the major unevenness is not going away.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m asian and i have mono-eyelids, These were my very first double eyelid tapes and they are literally...</li>
            <li>product definitely works for you if you don&#x27;t have too much fat near your eyelid!</li>
            <li>But over the last 5 years as I approached 30, I noticed that the hood  above my upper eyelid sagged very quickly and noticeably.</li>
            <li>There are 120 pieces for 60 uses minus your trial &amp; error throw-aways the first week!</li>
            <li>I love these little things and use them almost daily.  </li>
            <li>Stays on most of the day and hardly noticeable with makeup</li>
            <li>Its a little tricky to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it truly is pretty seamless.</li>
            <li>Do not place the tape too far up from your natural crease or it will not fold and stick naturally.</li>
            <li>I guess it depends on how you apply it &amp; also what makeup you wear, but for me these are clearly visible..</li>
            <li>There were picture instructions included that were fairly clear about how to apply the product.</li>
            <li>The tape was very sticky and created a natural looking double eyelid.</li>
            <li>They are completely clear.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want it on my eye for a long time on my first try.</li>
            <li>The double sided tape on this really makes the product invisible-try it</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>, you cant see them when you use them properly, and they stick very well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m truly surprised Amazon has affiliation with this product.</li>
            <li>So far, these are working well</li>
            <li>I recommend an eye glue as an alternative choice for people with sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li>It is sticky enough to hold the eyelid for the whole day, but not too sticky to harm the eyelid skin.</li>
            <li>I wear this under my make up and it looks natural.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s a millionaire, she probably got her eyelid fixed through plastic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for two years now and have developed a fold on each eye.</li>
            <li>Overall very well product.</li>
            <li>Therefore, this product works very well to make my monolid look just like my double lidded eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nothing works nearly as well as this ultra-sticky double-sided tape.</li>
            <li>While that hasn&#x27;t happened to me completely, there are days I don&#x27;t need to use these and still have creases.</li>
            <li>I know it&#x27;s not really good to keep it on that long, but i think its a good thing because it means i wont have to change it (pulling/stretching my skin)</li>
            <li>Meant mostly for Asian women wanting to get rid of their mono lids, but will also work for uneven eyelids.</li>
            <li>have hooded double eyelids which are fairly narrow, which limits the amount of space I am able to apply eyeshadow/liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My right eye crease is smaller than my left.</li>
            <li>Finally i found the right double eyelid for me...</li>
            <li>These would probably work better on someone with only very slightly hooded eyes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really looks good the first time I used it, but it made me uncomfortable when I used it for whole day because it&#x27;s too sticky and hard to take off.</li>
            <li>It does take a couple of tries to get it right.  </li>
            <li>Or I can get surgery which it not really an option right now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply, in just a few seconds, already done!</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great, inexpensive and quick way to fix an annoying problem and</li>
            <li>Some parts held the skin very well, but the ends didnt hold well at all making the eyelid look a bit strange.</li>
            <li>This one somehow does not work that well in my first couple of tries.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many and this thin two sided tape is absolutely the only brand that stays on all day!</li>
            <li>Its kind of annoying, I am thinking about switching back to glue because (although its time consuming) it works a lot better plus you dont end up misplacing where it goes on the eyelid and having to start over again.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Any advice would be appreciated seems like the other ones work perfectly fine kind of disappointed</li>
            <li>They tuck away extra skin into the crease, the skin from the hood and the eyelid stick together and create a new crease.</li>
            <li>only cons are the ones listed... and they are pretty minor..</li>
            <li>Michelle Phan said you have to wear them 22 hours a day for I think 4 months straight before thecrease becomes semi-permanent and only needs an occasional (one day a week, maybe) application of the tape to renew the strength.</li>
            <li>so they last pretty long.</li>
            <li>The only caveat is that it does not look very natural when looked closely.</li>
            <li>I just got it today and put it on; my double eyelids look very natural.</li>
            <li>There is a proper way to remove the tape - use lotion and water to take away the stickiness, don&#x27;t pull and tug your eyelids since that area is very sensitive.</li>
            <li>Eyes are suddenly open and alive!</li>
            <li>I LOVE how small they are and how they are actually invisible once placed properly!</li>
            <li>but I have no other choice.</li>
            <li>However, this product is nearly perfect!They look super natural on my lids, and I can hardly feel it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also one use only, and pretty hard (not impossible) to get back on if you take it off, even if you placed it incorrectly and want to take it off immediately to correct the placement.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Extended use, like any other eyelid sticker (*apparently*), also means there&#x27;s a chance of your eyelid being trained to retain the crease even after you take the stickers off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say this product did not stay or not natural or not creating a double eyelid or something, for me it is natural as long as I just want  visible double-eyelids, not like  deep set huge Western eyelids.</li>
            <li>I like it in general.</li>
            <li>So I believe that if you are religious about applying them for the 3 months as it says, you could permanently change your crease as long as you don&#x27;t have too much of a difference in your two lids (ie.</li>
            <li>However, the double lids do not look natural.</li>
            <li>I had no trouble peeling off the white backing and applying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and you can&#x27;t see it and makes a big difference</li>
            <li>Barely feel it too.</li>
            <li>as far as progress on my double eyelid....</li>
            <li>The strips are very tiny and must be handled carefully, although they are not difficult to apply.</li>
            <li>not Great product - have not found better ...</li>
            <li>You will find you need to place it lower than you may think, and I also realized that I cannot place it exactly on one eye as I do the other because my eyelids are a bit different</li>
            <li>so I prefer it as I feel that they really stick from one end to the other</li>
            <li>it can make natural double eyelids above my eyes</li>
            <li>It changed the shape of my eyes, made them look smaller, tired and the make up didn&#x27;t help any more.</li>
            <li>This one has extra adhesiveness so it sticks to my eyelids and its barely noticeable!</li>
            <li>I had major eyelid asymmetry prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li>i can barely remember that i&#x27;m wearing eyelid tape, and after removing the tape, the eyelid crease stays in place for several hours!</li>
            <li>I guess, that just barely hit above my eyelash, so</li>
            <li>Although if you misplace the tape the first time you&#x27;ve wasted a piece of tape.</li>
            <li>My only problem with them is that they&#x27;re too thin to really give me a nice double eyelid, I go from droopy monolids to a really small double eyelid.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve written an amazon review - but first time I&#x27;ve bought and been stuck with such a ridiculous item!</li>
            <li>It helps get a double eyelid but it also helps makes your eyes bigger in general!</li>
            <li>I have tried other eyelids tapes and glues in the past and most of them are either visible or they didn&#x27;t stick for long on my oily skin</li>
            <li>Also because my lids arent very oily, these stayed on for like over a day and a half.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;ve only been consistently at it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m Chinese with double eyelids, but last year the crease on my left eyelid somehow switched higher and it just made my eyes look uneven.</li>
            <li>I clean my eyelid with the eye makeup remover after having taken the strips off, and if the adhesive oozes down to a part of the eyelid it isn&#x27;t supposed to be on</li>
            <li>However, because it looks very natural, the only downside is that it won&#x27;t change your eyes much either--it creates a very small crease, but don&#x27;t expect your eyes to become bigger.</li>
            <li>But I like it, nothing good nothing bad.</li>

            <li> Need to pratice more!!</li>
            <li> I have used so many types of eyelid tapes and that&#x27;s the best one I ever used!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> They are good for my eyes ,, but i need to use olive oil when i want to wear off them or i will burn lol</li>
            <li> I have tried many and this is the best out there.</li>
            <li> nice and sticky!</li>
            <li> Hehe :-P</li>
            <li> Great price for so many!  </li>
            <li> work very good, even I put it on top of my make up,</li>
            <li> (Since I like this version of eye tape the best (´∀｀)♡ It doesn&#x27;t show since it&#x27;s sticky on both sides and you are able to make almost any kind of crease.)</li>
            <li> really good eyelid tape which I have bought a lot of times</li>
            <li> It is really good product for me.</li>
            <li> Good work for Asia Women.</li>
            <li> Good.</li>
            <li> I do think this is a good product and the stickiness</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good.</li>
            <li> One good thing was it did not make my eye irritated.</li>
            <li> but if I want to put eye make up on, one sticky side always comes off and start to show --- still a good product but not quite for me.</li>
            <li> I worked with them for a while and got good at applying them, but still couldn&#x27;t acheive the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Work really good.</li>
            <li> and hopefully in 3 months time will see the good result.</li>
            <li> The seller took care to wrap each one into it&#x27;s own plastic wrap/warnings and it was all very nicely done and it arrived safely to my home!</li>
            <li> It shipped quick and on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Very magic eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> I never knew these products existed until I tried this one, and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely one of the best products for creating natural, beautiful eye creases out there!!!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good effective eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> I love using this eyelid tape!</li>
            <li> Satisfied!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Still love them to this day!</li>
            <li> beginning is OK ,but after a while the bothering me!</li>
            <li> I love this product!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> You gotta love it!</li>
            <li> i love this product!</li>
            <li> As a testament to this item, I just ordered 2 more packages!</li>
            <li> After a couple weeks of wearing it, the tape created a crease on my eyelid that resulted in a more symmetric look without having to use the tape non-stop!  </li>
            <li> I love them!</li>
            <li> and I have to say they are amazing.</li>
            <li> Take off with warm water to loosen the adhesive and to wash residue off your eye.</li>
            <li> .. they can tend to irritate the lid at that edge and also start to peel off at that edge - comes in handy when you want to take them off</li>
            <li> , I just blame my own eyelids for not working with this product.</li>
            <li> ; but I&#x27;m grateful for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my own experiences, this tape was a pain in the ass to use but worked.</li>
            <li> So, these strips work kind of like an eye lift surgery.</li>
            <li> Despite the high price, this product is the best.</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use this product, and it is very good as what i thought.</li>
            <li> Great for monolids, but also great for 50 year old saggy eyelids!</li>
            <li> ;  it worked ok under makeup if i did a really good job, but for the most part it was visible.  </li>
            <li> kinda easy to apply ,good product anyway</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very easy to apply and remove.</li>
            <li> I think this eyelid tape is very easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t show if you don&#x27;t close your eyes.</li>
            <li> Anyway, the adhesive is very strong.</li>
            <li> day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very strong adhesive, so</li>
            <li> is very strong like how they said it would</li>
            <li> Tape is very strong and stays put.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and practice makes perfect&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also fell off my eyelid very easily.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best product i&#x27;ve tried!!  </li>
            <li> They provide a plastic tweezer that is good for getting one edge of the tape onto the tweezer for easy application without touching the sticky side.  </li>
            <li> glad I chose this brand and product, couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> This stuff is strong and will hold your eyelid in place!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never worn eyelid tape before, but this product was unbelievably easy to use even without the instructions, and the outcome looks absolutely lovely!</li>
            <li> when it sounds too good to be true..........</li>
            <li> Also , they are very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This is probably a very good product, but I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Very comfortable wearing them</li>
            <li> This eyelid tape is super good.</li>
            <li> Using these is actually easy and effective.</li>
            <li> Very natural it&#x27;s very easy to put on your eyes and it sticks on all day !!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t stick well with eyeshadow on already so make sure to put tapes on before eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> i purchased these strips in the hope of creating a look that opens my eyes more.  </li>
            <li> These stay on all day on top of my makeup.</li>
            <li> but i practiced on that one with much more times.</li>
            <li> Love this product..</li>
            <li> so I have experimented many glues and tapes.  </li>
            <li> As a single-lidder, I love this product.</li>
            <li> product is great, shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> love this product.</li>
            <li> but it worked and looked better with practice.  </li>
            <li> I just need more practice and it will work much better...</li>
            <li> Better than all others I tried.</li>
            <li> and I have tried many types..</li>
            <li> I guess, for me, if the strips were witderit would have done a better job.</li>
            <li> NO ONE will be able to tell you have it on.</li>
            <li> Simply the best eyelid tape ever.</li>
            <li> Tried many times since it has 120pcs, I don&#x27;t have to worry about how many I tried.</li>
            <li> I can already see the difference in pictures, and I&#x27;m so glad that I can fix this problem that I thought I&#x27;d never be able to fix.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand for eyelid tape.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> But till then, these are fantastic!</li>
            <li> Just be sure to practice</li>
            <li> For those days when my eyelids seem to droop a bit (age is taking its toll), this is the best product, next to surgery, to look rested and alert.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> So make sure everything is even before you start jabbing your eyes with the prong.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Gives me the confidence i need to buy agian :)</li>
            <li> More important, it&#x27;s not visible!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good and useful</li>
            <li> The tape seems to stay on for almost a day and if you can get it in a good position, I dont think you could tell it was there (which is a good thing because it looked natural).</li>
            <li> (and the eyelid tape itself comes on sheets, with many to a sheet)</li>
            <li> but overall I am very happy.</li>
            <li> However the left always comes out perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that they cant be seen.</li>
            <li> and i would have to spend a bit more time on it than i wanted to.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye-tapes and this is my favorite one.</li>
            <li> Love love love this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great quality product.</li>
            <li> These are okay for a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> I might experiment with it more</li>
            <li> , the more it works to hide the tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> Like the title says, wondereye eyelid tape is probably the best double eyelid tool that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;After many months of experimenting, I have noticed the following is the best routine on putting on eye makeup with this tape:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just ordered more because I plan to use them whenever I go out.</li>
            <li> Just love with what you were born with and</li>
            <li> These did not stick to me for more than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> and i have oily skin too! :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;-the package comes with a lot of tapes great pricing&lt;br /&gt;- pretty easy to apply</li>
            <li> It really work on me!!!!</li>
            <li> and it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> As many have menioned before, this is a STRONG tape.</li>
            <li> buying from Amazon, I found out they&#x27;re selling it near my place lol)</li>
            <li> plus, the longer you have it on the chances of it becoming permanent</li>
            <li> It took about three tries to figure what works best for me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard some stories of peoples creases becoming permanent after years of use.</li>
            <li> I find the tweezers good for getting the tape on, but the instructions show them used to press the lid inward, but that does not work because you end up sticking the tweezer onto the very sticky tape.</li>
            <li> In the morning, I just wash my fash and eye area with face wash and warm water and the tape just comes right off.</li>
            <li> This Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and was easy to remove</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Easily placed and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> so its easy to store.</li>
            <li> As people said, it is easy to use because the instruction is provided.</li>
            <li> i is easy to use and it is almost invisible even if you dont put on make up.</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to apply compared with the Fiber tape.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm, easy to.apply and take off.</li>
            <li> They are easy to remove if you need to replace - but the stickiness does run out if you keep messing with it.</li>
            <li> At night, it easily slips off as I remove my eye makeup with a makeup wipe.</li>
            <li> sure you have CLEAN skin ...</li>
            <li> The tape is easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and stick well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and there is a lot.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t need anything too strong.</li>
            <li> , this tape is strong, but I don&#x27;t have any issue of removing it.</li>
            <li> It is strong as well I can sweat a storm during a workout and it still stays on.</li>
            <li> Strong adhesive quality.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice to know where to apply it based on how your eyelid fold fall, but it sticks all day and is comfortable, and it is easy to remove at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but the tape wears off after 4-5 hours.</li>
            <li> and it is fine with makeup on, the darker the makeup</li>
            <li> After that it is fine.</li>
            <li> It worked fine</li>
            <li> /&gt;I bought this to help even out my lids and it has helped tremendously!  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> It did take me a little while to figure out the best placement</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a huge difference in your look.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Do not expect to have huge doe eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not 100percenf comfortable</li>
            <li> This eyelid tape is double sided and great for my hooded lids.  </li>
            <li> It is very sticky and I would recommend to take it off with warm water and makeup remover to avoid pulling on the eyelid and causing it to become saggy.</li>
            <li> The adhesive holds well and is relatively comfortable.</li>
            <li> In fact, if you want to get a permanent double eyelid, I recommend wearing this (one sided tape just doesn&#x27;t work on me lol).</li>
            <li> Cheap materials.</li>
            <li> They last all day and can&#x27;t be seen which is great.</li>
            <li> They stay on, but people do notice when the light catches the end of it.</li>
            <li> Worth the price, it is a lot more than the $2.00 ones</li>
            <li> I was already hesitant in making the step to use these (even if they were translucent), but read such great reviews that I thought I&#x27;d just TRY and see.</li>
            <li> I am an Asian and it worked great for my eyes.</li>
            <li> Very sticky but did not work for me, maybe because of my own problem.</li>
            <li> Great product for Asian girls.</li>
            <li> ; LOL If he only knew I had taped lids.  </li>
            <li> And it feels fantastic.</li>
            <li> Though it took 20 or so pieces to actually get it ON for me and EVEN, it was great.</li>
            <li> No one can even tell the difference and people say that it looks so natural and good on me.</li>
            <li> looks natural, once you get used to use it , it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> But the older I get the more hooded my eyelids get, so I turned to the internet for some solutions!</li>
            <li> I was able to put makeup right over it and it was truly invisible.</li>
            <li> the product actually really works!!!</li>
            <li> really amazing, feels so natural double eyelid looking, strongly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> It is very convenient to bring, and it is very easy to use</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews so believe me people!</li>
            <li> They stay on great and even when I&#x27;m sweating or having long stressful days.  </li>
            <li> It did make the eye look more pretty.</li>
            <li> Went from &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; to O_O. good stuff</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these</li>
            <li> well worth the price!  </li>
            <li> Jap product is good in general</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product, though I wouldn&#x27;t pay the new price of $20 for it.</li>
            <li> pretty easy and pain free.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, very well designed, easy to use and its looks very natural and easy to use.</li>
            <li> BUT  it sometimes hurts if it is not in the right spot !.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the product, I hope it can actuallly help make a crease for my left eyelid:)) will definitely buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> Wayyy better than the glue and so much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I have a full monolid and my eyelids are sorta of chunky.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for those with a monolid without any trace of a double lid.</li>
            <li> This is not a use full product for every one.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> This might be a problem for first time users, but if you&#x27;re familiar with the process, you should be fine.  </li>
            <li> I found many brands of this particular product on amazon, but this one not only had the most reviews, it had the most positive reviews - in fact, most of the reviews were raving.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The cons are pretty easily handled with some eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> after wearing the tape every night for two months both eyelids are equally thick and i am one happy girl :)</li>
            <li> And thank you to the seller for the pricing and the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of glueing both skins together on ur eyelid so it really doesnt show much in public..</li>
            <li> eyelid tape is very strong, sticks very well, and is double sided, which is great for those without any sort of natural crease in the eye.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for droopy eyes like mine :)</li>
            <li> After a few tries, I find it to be the best product of its kind that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> But i don&#x27;t know why this one is not as good as before, it can&#x27;t stick my eyelid for a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for so long, and the price is good too.</li>
            <li> I love it, and I&#x27;ve found stores where I live that sell it</li>
            <li> Love the product, brand new, and unused.</li>
            <li> Learn to love the way you look, and trust me, it&#x27;ll be a love that saves you hundreds of dollars in the long run.</li>
            <li> Very helpful and easy to use~</li>
            <li> The eyelid tape is great for those who have Missmatching eyelid curves, or have very little crease and want your eyes to look bigger, is a good product</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> It just really works!!</li>
            <li> and it WORKED - the first time!</li>
            <li> The new crease is beginning to stay on its own and it is really giving me the look that I&#x27;ve always desired.</li>
            <li> These are very light weight and clear.</li>
            <li> Even though I thought this was a great product it is a little pricey</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and all other aspects of the purchase was good.</li>
            <li> very useful, good item,just a little expensive.i like it.</li>
            <li> this is actually useful.</li>
            <li> I cut about 2mm off each side to make them fit my smaller eyes better.</li>
            <li> Since the directions are not in English, it requires a bit of practice on your own to see where on your eyelid</li>
            <li> /&gt;But, overall - a really effective product.</li>
            <li> For the price I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also kind of short, so if you have a longer eye, the tape might be problematic.</li>
            <li> tried a few, best so far ,works well.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost and time to apply.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, the only thing I dislike is MY OWN eyelids.</li>
            <li> When I got these though, they made me laugh.  </li>
            <li> this one is the most useful one so far.</li>
            <li> Sounds grueling, but worth it.</li>
            <li> Many people don&#x27;t notice my eyelid size difference when they&#x27;re looking at me, but in pictures, it&#x27;s extremely noticeable, and it becomes even more noticeable when I wear makeup.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands and glues and nothing works as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Plenty of practice required to get it on just right.</li>
            <li> I use these when my right eye turns into a mono lid.</li>
            <li> If I apply them the right way, they&#x27;ll stick for 12 hours easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but my right eye does.</li>
            <li> I might end up with a monolid on my right eye.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and tried it right away.</li>
            <li> Today specifically, my friend noticed something wasn&#x27;t quite right and told me to close my eyes...</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> First I thought I just didn&#x27;t apply them right.</li>
            <li> Complete invisible and easy to use</li>
            <li> The results of wearing this product with my glue was really nice, my eyelids were big and my eyes looked a lot wider people didn&#x27;t really notice the glue and the tape until I told them.</li>
            <li> It was really good when you put make up on, but sometimes I feel like it is kinda &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; for the result I want.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very easy to peel the tape off from the plastic</li>
            <li> I have tried a few kinds of eyelid tapes/glue but most of them have many drawbacks.</li>
            <li> So far, this is fine, however, I hope they make the tapes 50% wider.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and seller ships fast, it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> The applicator is very user-friendly!</li>
            <li> Love that the tape is double sided!</li>
            <li> This product is a must have if you love the double eye lid look!</li>
            <li> Say that 10 times fast!  </li>
            <li> I would suggest purchasing an inexpensive one to use first before purchasing this if this will be the first time using eyelid tape.  </li>
            <li> After reading many YouTube reviews and online blogs about this \\&quot;miracle item\\&quot; that does wonders for those in the Asian community who want a \\&quot;higher crease\\&quot; or who want an alternative to blepharoplasty (eye-lid surgery), I felt that I needed to try this \\&quot;holy-grail-ed\\&quot; item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Struggled a bit at first</li>
            <li> becomes higher.</li>
            <li> Never used Eyelid Tape before, and try this for my first product.</li>
            <li> After being applied, they work exactly as they say they will--for three or four hours, then the adhesive seems to give up.</li>
            <li> but I wish they had instructions in English but still love the product.</li>
            <li> /blended very well, but the crease stopped about two thirds of the way across my eyes!</li>
            <li> I do find that if I wear them consistently, the eyelid tends to stay for a while.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first week.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the reviews from the users!</li>
            <li> I use tweezers to remove the white paper that covers the top side of the tape.</li>
            <li> the first type of eyelid tape</li>
            <li> I first thought &amp;</li>
            <li> Will forever be a customer ;)</li>
            <li> stays on the whole day for me!</li>
            <li> , Michelle Phan said to be prepared to wear the tape consistently for months.</li>
            <li> i find using tweezers was easier than using their funny protractor device it came with.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to get this double sided tape.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyelid tape i&#x27;d bought</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things, but this tape really is amazing.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting kind of self conscious whenever I wore it and thus only used it consistently at night.</li>
            <li> The price on amazon is reasonable and I&#x27;m glad there is such a convenient way to purchase these in the States!</li>
            <li> The tape definitely holds up and it pretty strong.  </li>
            <li> So it is plausible to believe that with long term use, you can have semi-permanent results with continued use.</li>
            <li> The packaging and wording are pretty much identical</li>
            <li> im southeast asian and have nicely pronounced eyelids (however my right lid has always been thicker and fuller than the left) and</li>
            <li> ) make sure lid area is oil free (use a blotting paper to remove excess oils)&lt;br /&gt;2) position tape directly ontop of your natural crease, if you have \\&quot;hooded\\&quot; double lids</li>
            <li> This is not just for Asian gals, but for anyone who has older, droopy lids, anyone with hooded lids, anyone of any age who wants to look naturally better.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, the tape will become less sticky and effective.</li>
            <li> hopefully after wearing it long enough my lid will stay creased for good.</li>
            <li> Thanks to a youtube demo, I can now  easily apply the tape to open up my hooded eyes.  </li>
            <li> shade in eyeshow with a fine brush WITH EYES OPEN (this will prevent the shadow powder from unsticking</li>
            <li> My eyes looked fine when I was younger</li>
            <li> The stickiness is pretty decent.. &amp; the application is tricky.</li>
            <li> and when I got a professional makeup artist, she had single sided taped that worked beautifully all day long.</li>
            <li> It was tricky at first, but after a few times it became very easy to use.</li>
            <li> me, however, the tape was a bit on the weaker side, but importantly, it was much too short!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very noticeable when I put eyeliner on.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t rub your eyes too much, it won&#x27;t get irritated</li>
            <li> Sticks on really well for a whole day.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does its job.</li>
            <li> I have very hooded eyes.</li>
            <li> Shipping  came fast..</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> It works really well</li>
            <li> But you can figure out how to use the tapes without too much</li>
            <li> It does not stick very well.</li>
            <li> It really does stick and lasts quite a while.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t really know how to put these on</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the style of sticky on both side</li>
            <li> shipping was fast</li>
            <li> They work very well.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very grateful.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I have very hooded eyelids.  </li>
            <li> and I threw it away after using one whole page of tape.</li>
            <li> so she thinks I&#x27;m attentively listening to her the entire time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product by itself did do much by itself so I would have to use my eye glue to layer the strip</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow with this product because your brush might separate the skin</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> I am very self-conscious about one of my droopy eyes, and this product has helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Very sticky so they stay in place.</li>
            <li> Did not stick very well to my eyelids through out the day, and the applicator wasn&#x27;t what I was use to.</li>
            <li> I do have oily skin, so that may have contributed to it not sticking very well through the day.</li>
            <li> and you can see the tape, not to mention it really irritates my skin....fail.</li>
            <li> I used this for that eye, but it was too much for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just gently rub the makeup remover all over it, and start working it in at one of the corners until it begins to lift.</li>
            <li> Continue rubbing and working the makeup remover under the tape until the whole thing comes off.</li>
            <li> When i use it, it can stick my eyelid, it is really invisible.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would wear it under makeup to work and it held very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really working</li>
            <li> I really, really wanted to like this tape</li>
            <li> My eyelids got really irritated and itchy when using the tape.</li>
            <li> This tape is very helpful.</li>
            <li> life will be much easier.</li>
            <li> I have one double lid and one eyelid that likes to switch off between monolid and double lid on its own.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you like a more natural eyelid look, don&#x27;t get double sided tape.</li>
            <li> Pictures are available but the product really doesn&#x27;t do much for the age-droop of an older American eye.</li>
            <li> It takes quite a bit to learn to put the tape on correctly as well as creating the right type of crease that looks natural.  </li>
            <li> I used to use the koi eyelid glue, and while I still think it is better than these, these are probably better in the long run as they are faster to apply once you get the hang of it, and also, you can actually get real double-lids if you continue using these on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> long lasting, love it!</li>
            <li> You will probably have adhesive left on your eyelid when you take these off, and because of the strength of the tape, it is very easy to leave red welts on your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have tried other tapes bought from Japan which works much better</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re cheaper than all the other options on amazon and they work better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Noticed a difference immediately, and it helps even out when one eye has a more significant double eyelid than the other.</li>
            <li> Even though it costs a bit more compared to the other brand, I don&#x27;t mind spending money on this wonder products which is made from Japan, not China.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to apply, but it Really works!</li>
            <li> I wanted to even out my uneven creases and hopefully give a slightly more defined crease and that&#x27;s exactly what it does.  </li>
            <li> I even used alcohol to clean the skin prior to use.</li>
            <li> The packaging is clean - the individual pieces of tape are covered with a sheet of paper that is perforated in the center for easy removal.</li>
            <li> and so far have worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately one of my lid has more skin than the other and it doesn&#x27;t look like a good crease, it looks like I have 2 or 3 creases &amp;#34;broken crease&amp;#34; when I apply the eyelid tape to my right eye.</li>
            <li> My new crease has stayed put for the whole day.</li>
            <li> loved it, i have uneven eye lids, and it help me even out, especially when putting make up on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Vietnamese decent and have had one monolid and one doublelid forever.</li>
            <li> Overall, I will definitely be ordering more of this.</li>
            <li> This is definitely for a young ,wrinkle free eye.</li>
            <li> It works, but you need a steady hand to apply.</li>
            <li> These in the other hand either though they long very narrow are strong enough to hold for up to 12 hours on my eyelids and the best part is that you can&#x27;t see I have it on.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all, super sticky and invisbile!!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest those to use an oil based makeup remover in removing this tape.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product😊</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I hope it could be a little more sticky.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to use</li>
            <li> The thing is, it is still pretty noticeable, and I highly suggest don&#x27;t wear it in public, or else it&#x27;s really embarrassing,</li>
            <li> The reviews are right that it does take a little practice to find the right spot in needs to go on your eyelid for the best results - but as I had been playing around with plain tape prior to receiving, it only took me about 5 tries before I got it right.</li>
            <li> It really makes a noticeable and natural crease.</li>
            <li> Wow the difference is real</li>
            <li> so far didnt see anything about how to take it off gently.</li>
            <li> [like, not that the person is fat but that there is too much fat near the eyelid]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is too expensive, but before I find anything can compare with its great effect, I will stay with it.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday :)</li>
            <li> Description should state that for normal eyelids, it takes 2 strips for each eyelid.</li>
            <li> Confused by the good reviews.</li>
            <li> So easy and better than other products out there that are only single sided tape.  </li>
            <li> The following is a list of issues I experienced after only having successfully worn the strips once (ended up removing before outing was over as strips began to irritate eyes)only to have used up half a sheet of strips on failed attempts:    </li>
            <li> If anyone can suggest a tape that gives a more defined crease or is slightly longer, I&#x27;m all ears!</li>
            <li> It was less flexible and more of a complete &amp;#34;V&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They last all day long, and I love getting such a large supply at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Much better than the single side double eye lips tape</li>
            <li> now I use this on my right eye and have been wearing it only during the night.</li>
            <li> It works for me to even out my right eye lid with the left one</li>
            <li> is to put it just right above the folds on my lids.</li>
            <li> I used this product to correct my left side eyelid so that it matches with my right side eyelid.  </li>
            <li> also after removing, some adhesive is left, so you can get by for a few hours on just that, which is sometimes refreshing!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does take work, but I&#x27;ve noticed after about a month of use that even if I don&#x27;t wear the strips, my new crease stays.</li>
            <li> I now live my eyes.</li>
            <li> Now, I can put makeup over the new crease.</li>
            <li> I am a lot more confident in showing my eyes because I used to have my bangs cover my left eye since I feel that my uneven eyelids are extremely noticeable.</li>
            <li> Being Asian, as I imagine most of you are, my eyes aren&#x27;t particularly wide or tall, and the tape itself hid</li>
            <li> Comes in a cute little plastic box that you can pop in your medicine cabinet or your purse!</li>
            <li> The tape strips come with an applicator and very clear instructions.  </li>
            <li> I would wake up some days with beautiful natural double lids on both eyes, but whenever I slept weird or was stressed or rubbed my eyes too much</li>
            <li> my left eye was naturally doubled lidded and my right fluctuated.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised to have maintained a permanent double eyelid on my right eye!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I use the tape, my eyelid hood disappears &amp; both of my eyes look exactly the same -</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I am not Asian.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more for REALLY small eyes</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, application is pretty simple.</li>
            <li> My eyes are pretty Asian though.</li>
            <li> It was quite a nuisance to use actually - I would always be too aware of the plastic poking into my eyelid</li>
            <li> But this tape works fine as long as you want some visible double eyelids.</li>
            <li> I gave them a try and can say they are great for my everyday usage when I&#x27;m not using other eye tapes for a wider younger look.  </li>
            <li> , I very careful take a q-tip and clean that part of the eyelid to get</li>
            <li> They are completely unnoticeable and they look very natural.</li>
            <li> I have tried many product, but finally settled down to this product.</li>
            <li> , I simply watch some tutorials on YouTube and by my 2nd try, I pretty much knew what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also does not help that they pile on 10-15 pieces on a plastic backing as when you remove one, you start peeling off the glue off the others and exposing it to air which makes them less sticky, its a big pain in the butt and could probably use better packing for the tape.</li>
            <li> too much skin on the left vs. the right side), because as with me....I can fold the skin and tape it to make my eyelids even but no matter what unless I have surgery that extra skin causing the major unevenness is not going away.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and i have mono-eyelids, These were my very first double eyelid tapes and they are literally...</li>
            <li> product definitely works for you if you don&#x27;t have too much fat near your eyelid!</li>
            <li> But over the last 5 years as I approached 30, I noticed that the hood  above my upper eyelid sagged very quickly and noticeably.</li>
            <li> There are 120 pieces for 60 uses minus your trial &amp; error throw-aways the first week!</li>
            <li> I love these little things and use them almost daily.  </li>
            <li> Stays on most of the day and hardly noticeable with makeup</li>
            <li> Its a little tricky to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it truly is pretty seamless.</li>
            <li> Do not place the tape too far up from your natural crease or it will not fold and stick naturally.</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on how you apply it &amp; also what makeup you wear, but for me these are clearly visible..</li>
            <li> There were picture instructions included that were fairly clear about how to apply the product.</li>
            <li> The tape was very sticky and created a natural looking double eyelid.</li>
            <li> They are completely clear.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want it on my eye for a long time on my first try.</li>
            <li> The double sided tape on this really makes the product invisible-try it</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> , you cant see them when you use them properly, and they stick very well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m truly surprised Amazon has affiliation with this product.</li>
            <li> So far, these are working well</li>
            <li> I recommend an eye glue as an alternative choice for people with sensitive skin like me.  </li>
            <li> It is sticky enough to hold the eyelid for the whole day, but not too sticky to harm the eyelid skin.</li>
            <li> I wear this under my make up and it looks natural.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a millionaire, she probably got her eyelid fixed through plastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two years now and have developed a fold on each eye.</li>
            <li> Overall very well product.</li>
            <li> Therefore, this product works very well to make my monolid look just like my double lidded eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nothing works nearly as well as this ultra-sticky double-sided tape.</li>
            <li> While that hasn&#x27;t happened to me completely, there are days I don&#x27;t need to use these and still have creases.</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not really good to keep it on that long, but i think its a good thing because it means i wont have to change it (pulling/stretching my skin)</li>
            <li> Meant mostly for Asian women wanting to get rid of their mono lids, but will also work for uneven eyelids.</li>
            <li> have hooded double eyelids which are fairly narrow, which limits the amount of space I am able to apply eyeshadow/liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My right eye crease is smaller than my left.</li>
            <li> Finally i found the right double eyelid for me...</li>
            <li> These would probably work better on someone with only very slightly hooded eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really looks good the first time I used it, but it made me uncomfortable when I used it for whole day because it&#x27;s too sticky and hard to take off.</li>
            <li> It does take a couple of tries to get it right.  </li>
            <li> Or I can get surgery which it not really an option right now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to apply, in just a few seconds, already done!</li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great, inexpensive and quick way to fix an annoying problem and</li>
            <li> Some parts held the skin very well, but the ends didnt hold well at all making the eyelid look a bit strange.</li>
            <li> This one somehow does not work that well in my first couple of tries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many and this thin two sided tape is absolutely the only brand that stays on all day!</li>
            <li> Its kind of annoying, I am thinking about switching back to glue because (although its time consuming) it works a lot better plus you dont end up misplacing where it goes on the eyelid and having to start over again.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Any advice would be appreciated seems like the other ones work perfectly fine kind of disappointed</li>
            <li> They tuck away extra skin into the crease, the skin from the hood and the eyelid stick together and create a new crease.</li>
            <li> only cons are the ones listed... and they are pretty minor..</li>
            <li> Michelle Phan said you have to wear them 22 hours a day for I think 4 months straight before thecrease becomes semi-permanent and only needs an occasional (one day a week, maybe) application of the tape to renew the strength.</li>
            <li> so they last pretty long.</li>
            <li> The only caveat is that it does not look very natural when looked closely.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and put it on; my double eyelids look very natural.</li>
            <li> There is a proper way to remove the tape - use lotion and water to take away the stickiness, don&#x27;t pull and tug your eyelids since that area is very sensitive.</li>
            <li> Eyes are suddenly open and alive!</li>
            <li> I LOVE how small they are and how they are actually invisible once placed properly!</li>
            <li> but I have no other choice.</li>
            <li> However, this product is nearly perfect!They look super natural on my lids, and I can hardly feel it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also one use only, and pretty hard (not impossible) to get back on if you take it off, even if you placed it incorrectly and want to take it off immediately to correct the placement.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Extended use, like any other eyelid sticker (*apparently*), also means there&#x27;s a chance of your eyelid being trained to retain the crease even after you take the stickers off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say this product did not stay or not natural or not creating a double eyelid or something, for me it is natural as long as I just want  visible double-eyelids, not like  deep set huge Western eyelids.</li>
            <li> I like it in general.</li>
            <li> So I believe that if you are religious about applying them for the 3 months as it says, you could permanently change your crease as long as you don&#x27;t have too much of a difference in your two lids (ie.</li>
            <li> However, the double lids do not look natural.</li>
            <li> I had no trouble peeling off the white backing and applying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and you can&#x27;t see it and makes a big difference</li>
            <li> Barely feel it too.</li>
            <li> as far as progress on my double eyelid....</li>
            <li> The strips are very tiny and must be handled carefully, although they are not difficult to apply.</li>
            <li> not Great product - have not found better ...</li>
            <li> You will find you need to place it lower than you may think, and I also realized that I cannot place it exactly on one eye as I do the other because my eyelids are a bit different</li>
            <li> so I prefer it as I feel that they really stick from one end to the other</li>
            <li> it can make natural double eyelids above my eyes</li>
            <li> It changed the shape of my eyes, made them look smaller, tired and the make up didn&#x27;t help any more.</li>
            <li> This one has extra adhesiveness so it sticks to my eyelids and its barely noticeable!</li>
            <li> I had major eyelid asymmetry prior to using this product.  </li>
            <li> i can barely remember that i&#x27;m wearing eyelid tape, and after removing the tape, the eyelid crease stays in place for several hours!</li>
            <li> I guess, that just barely hit above my eyelash, so</li>
            <li> Although if you misplace the tape the first time you&#x27;ve wasted a piece of tape.</li>
            <li> My only problem with them is that they&#x27;re too thin to really give me a nice double eyelid, I go from droopy monolids to a really small double eyelid.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve written an amazon review - but first time I&#x27;ve bought and been stuck with such a ridiculous item!</li>
            <li> It helps get a double eyelid but it also helps makes your eyes bigger in general!</li>
            <li> I have tried other eyelids tapes and glues in the past and most of them are either visible or they didn&#x27;t stick for long on my oily skin</li>
            <li> Also because my lids arent very oily, these stayed on for like over a day and a half.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;ve only been consistently at it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Chinese with double eyelids, but last year the crease on my left eyelid somehow switched higher and it just made my eyes look uneven.</li>
            <li> I clean my eyelid with the eye makeup remover after having taken the strips off, and if the adhesive oozes down to a part of the eyelid it isn&#x27;t supposed to be on</li>
            <li> However, because it looks very natural, the only downside is that it won&#x27;t change your eyes much either--it creates a very small crease, but don&#x27;t expect your eyes to become bigger.</li>
            <li> But I like it, nothing good nothing bad.</li>
            <li> The application might seem a little complicated at first, but once you try you will realize how easy it is.</li>
            <li> For me it took a few tries t get it on right</li>
            <li> However, it is not hidden when the eye is closed or while blinking, so I would not recommend wearing this in public where you will be close to people.</li>
            <li> I wonder if other reviewers received clear ones?</li>
            <li> Ultimately it looks like I have no crease, just one flat surface.</li>
            <li> Overall they are easy to apply and practice was not as complicated without English instructions.  </li>
            <li> small enough not to show too much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably not a good idea to use it everyday and for many hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get on the eye fork thing plus to get good results you have to wear them 22 hours everyday for at least 3 months</li>
            <li> if i&#x27;m lazy haha)</li>
            <li> I can use make up over it and it tends to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t send back as I&#x27;ve already spent enough money for something I thought was a 60 day supply &amp; turns out to be only a 30 day supply.</li>
            <li> then it would work, but it was such a long process that I didn&#x27;t feel like doing anymore.</li>
            <li> But that is plenty long enough for me!</li>
            <li> I have tired few other products, but this one is my favorite!</li>
            <li> I have noticed that they create a new crease that stays there a little while after they are removed.</li>
            <li> this D.U.P brand is very thin, strong, and DOUBLE SIDED (WHICH IS A MUST).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried using Scotch tape on my own and it was a little difficult to maneuver.</li>
            <li> The tape also made my eyelid a little bit puffy so that my crease changed a little bit and made applying it in the exact same spot</li>
            <li> If you wear these everyday you can probably create a new permanent crease.</li>
            <li> like I do, they will not last very long.</li>
            <li> i feel much less self conscious wearing it to work.</li>
            <li> I have natural double lid creases that sometimes change so this idea helped to keep them and or to help even out when my eyelids were uneven.</li>
            <li> ( I already have double eye lid but some time one of them turn single if I don&#x27;t sleep well.</li>
            <li> Unlike every other tape, once you get the hang of it, you can use any sort of makeup over it and it will barely show.</li>
            <li> The only gripe I have is that I am noticing that it doesn&#x27;t hide as well and will come loose quicker than I would like.  </li>
            <li> You will find out the big difference between this and other double eyelip products!</li>
            <li> Since I have a small crease with some strabismus, I place my strip just above my natural crease.  </li>
            <li> There really is no way to apply these perfectly enough to go unnoticeable.  </li>
            <li> It took some practice and wasted product to place the tape correctly on, but the results ended up being natural looking.</li>
            <li> I had to trim the sides, so that it would not poke my skin when I was wearing the tape, besides that minor thing</li>
            <li> Instead it just looked like a strange transparent line on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m used to the long one</li>
            <li> It does by stay long like glue</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelid folds and was considering surgery-but this fixed it instantly,can&#x27;t see the tape.</li>
            <li> I find the tape to be too long and too sticky.</li>
            <li> It does take some practice at first so be prepared to waste a few because I did.</li>
            <li> Press down firmly to ensure the strip comes off the application tool and sticks firmly to the skin and then use the tips of the tool or the opposite end to tap down securely.  </li>
            <li> Prior to ordering these, I took plain ole scotch tape and cut a small piece, to see if the &#x27;tape&#x27; theory really worked - it did!</li>
            <li> The instructions come in Japanese, which are useless, luckily you tube had demonstration videos on it.</li>
            <li> can totally understand it if this product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, and if some might actually prefer one-sided stickers (though i find them to be soooo obvious within 2 feet of the person&#x27;s face) or glue (messy messy) because they work better for different eyes, but as a Chinese person with tight, fatty monolids, (god, what an unappealing way to describe myself)</li>
            <li> The tape lasts all day, lifts the lid slightly, a little tricky when you first remove the small tape and add to the plastic applicator, but&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> where as before I had a monolid on one side and double on the other.</li>
            <li> She, like me, has one eyelid that is smaller than the other one, and she showed how to use strips like these to fix that.</li>
            <li> it stays long !</li>
            <li> As a white guy with asian like eyes I am a little dissapointed</li>
            <li> The only one thing I would suggest, you have to be careful with eye makeup - after wearing it for while, your eye liners might (!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s never happened to me after using other brands/types of stickers, but it might be a personal thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, it most likely might not happened to you, maybe I&#x27;m just using bad makeup,&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have oily lids but even when they are dry they didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin to start off the day</li>
            <li> Difficult to impossible to place strips properly even after several attempts; does not stick to lids with eyeshawdow; ruins adhesive ability to apply makeup on top of strip; must get placement on first application because removing &amp; reapplying quickly renders adhesive useless; can tell there is a strip or something that sticks out on eyelid; minimal affect if any; cannot return product &amp; as such is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Only slightly too long.</li>
            <li> They are just about invisible, too, since they are clear and small.</li>
            <li> The ONLY negative, the instructions are all in Japanese - no English.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if its the doing of the tape or if my natural crease just &amp;#34;came in&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It starts to loose it&#x27;s effect by the end of the night</li>
            <li> I just did not like how unnatural it felt to have it on and having to be constantly paranoid that someone might see the tape when I looked down</li>
            <li> I am just your typical white girl.</li>
            <li> I do have a small crease on both lids but its almost not visible because its so low (close to my upper eyelid)</li>
            <li> its only been about a month and a half</li>
            <li> it did make my eyelids doubled, but the inner corners are slightly droopy now...</li>
            <li> It takes a little time to learn how to get the strips off the backing and positioned correctly on the lid, but once you master that, it is simple.</li>
            <li> so I have a little bit of a different approach for each eye.</li>
            <li> However, I just cut a little bit of the side that was closer to the inner corner so that it doesn&#x27;t irritate it&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
            <li> it is a little bit trickier to put on since it&#x27;s double sided.</li>
            <li> only downside to this product is that it may be a little tricky to apply eyeshadow over it, since applying anything over the \\&quot;tape area\\</li>
            <li> cause I still had a little bit of upper eyelid showing.</li>
            <li> Although i arrived little late, the product serves as i was described and i is very convenient to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these every day, but when my allergies are bad or I have not had enough rest, these little tapes do an excellent job of removing that dull, tired look from my eyes.</li>
            <li> because what a joke to have people see white strips when you look down and around!</li>
            <li> I use them because of the excessive amount of lid I have and it makes it easier to read and see in general.</li>
            <li> so I use one every few days to try and remake a larger crease in my eye.</li>
            <li> The tape is double sided and helps even out my uneven eyelids.</li>
            <li> Its really expensive, but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> so it works as I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> Overall if you want a heavy duty tape this one will do the trick.</li>
            <li> However, after using this these eyelid tapes, I realized that changes are absolutely minimal.</li>
            <li> If I get any water on the adhesive, the glue part becomes gunky and starts slipping, so I had to switch it out whenever I showered or washed my face.</li>
            <li> I tried to use another eye tape before, but it was not very sticky.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with my eyes, but I wanted to try this because I was curious; however, it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m asian and have uneven eye lids.  </li>
            <li> Also, no matter how carefully I applied it, my friends would notice it and comment on it while talking to me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just you have to be careful not to put your finger when applying.</li>
            <li> The tape&#x27;s slim, so it can&#x27;t fold back your lid into a defined crease, but if you&#x27;re looking for a tape that appears natural or if you have a thin eyelid, this might be the one for you.</li>
            <li> It looks completely natural and is slowly improving my eyelids.</li>
            <li> Though I prefer making a subtle, low crease with little makeup for a natural, I-totally-have-big-eyes-for-an-asian look.</li>
            <li> Not strong enough, doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Plus they are impossible to use as well, especially with their cheap little plastic tweezer.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a little expensive, but works really well for asian people.</li>
            <li> Other tapes end up losing it&#x27;s adhesiveness.</li>
            <li> Product does what it states: it&#x27;ll pull your monolid into a double lid, but it&#x27;s a small crease.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried out any other tape, but if you&#x27;re looking for a sharp defined crease, you might want to try something else.</li>
            <li> no thanks!</li>
            <li> Some people&#x27;s eyes are hooded, and other people eyes have thicker eyelid skin.</li>
            <li> and I have used 3 different products for the past years before buying DUP Wonder Eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in the hopes of lifting my droopy eyelids due to age and they work.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sticky and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> It seems this is targeted for women with mono lids, but based on reviews from other women who use it for hooded lids I decided to give them a try.</li>
            <li> My issue is just that I have one small double lid and one monolid.</li>
            <li> i tried this other brand that amazon sold...</li>
            <li> I do like it and definitely made a difference in my uneven lids!  </li>
            <li> Just what I expected!</li>
            <li> be very careful when putting the tape on your eye because if the other eye lid doesn&#x27;t match your first eyelid then your eyelids will look slanted and wrong.</li>
            <li> I certainly do not recommend it to anyone, its very tiny and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually falling asleep while she&#x27;s talking about getting her hair/nails done, or telling me about the local gossip down at</li>
            <li> But it would make sense that D.U.P does not use medical grade tape due to all the negative reviews stating that this product didn&#x27;t stick and for the irritation to the eyelids.</li>
            <li> as some others said, it is hard to reuse the same sticker, and</li>
            <li> They are extremely hard to remove from the white tape for application.  </li>
            <li> Even after removing white strip, it was extremely hard to put on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the equivalent of seeing someone shoddily taping their face back for a face lift.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve worn this everyday (minus bed time) for a week</li>
            <li> The tapes, however,  weren&#x27;t as sticky as I hoped them to be,  and approximately an hour of wearing the tapes, they slowly started to loose its adhesiveness mainly around the corners of my eyes.</li>
            <li> Since the tape is so strong, it is very difficult to remove without pulling on your eyelid, which is not good in the long run.</li>
            <li> Must be oil based to break down the adhesive.</li>
            <li> have slept on it, rubbed it, and down all sorts of things to it</li>
            <li> , i tried to use make up to make the upper side not sticky, but the inner side always got dirty too, and it actually shows a little</li>
            <li> I have heard about eyelid tape before, but thought - umm tape on my eyelids, not comfortable, no thanks!</li>
            <li> So I just stick them under my eye lid which there no way any one can tell your using tape or not, not even myself since its hidden under my eyelid)</li>
            <li> One of my eyelids has a slight hood, so I thought that I&#x27;d give these a try.  </li>
            <li> It is transparent and typically lasts a couple of hours.</li>
            <li> This will only work if you want subtle enhancement of your eyelids.</li>
            <li> and I would advise against shimmery eye shadow when using them because it does tend to highlight them where they may otherwise appear hidden.</li>
            <li> Not, good... DIdn&#x27;t know it was double sided...</li>
            <li> but it stays tight.</li>
            <li> My one complaint is that they are too long for my eyes and the edges are a little pointy.</li>
            <li> I have used this tape quite a few times and its a lot less time consuming then the glue.</li>
            <li> and after I&#x27;ve applied eye shadow and it makes little difference either way.  </li>
            <li> These have helped a little bit.</li>
            <li> A little bit itch, but work well.</li>
            <li> but my eyes gets a little irritated whenever i blink</li>
            <li> a little tricky to figure out in the beginning, but just takes practice.</li>
            <li> After I removed them, there was a little glue&lt;br /&gt;reside</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to learn how to apply them but once I got the hang of it, these worked.</li>
            <li> It takes a little practice to get it in the correct place on eyelid.</li>
            <li> VERY difficult to place though, no matter how many times I do it, I still have trouble because they are so thin.  </li>
            <li> one side has a small crease while the other side is a monolid.  </li>
            <li> a little</li>
            <li> It does need a little playing with where to place it, but it lifted the lid up, and was virtually invisible.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use plus instructions are not in English</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make you feel awkward because people won&#x27;t really notice that you are wearing it.</li>
            <li> Maybe my drooping lids are just too heavy.</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelids</li>
            <li> I watched a few videos before trying and this helped.  </li>
            <li> I wasted my money and time.</li>
            <li> STAYED ON ALL DAY - EVEN WITH HEAVY EYE MAKE UP ON.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat narrow eyes, so I had to cut off the ends of the tape.</li>
            <li> What a waste of $20 or</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t mind wasting a few just to try and get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try these as an alternative to plastic surgery for uneven eyelids.  </li>
            <li> She doesn&#x27;t wear them everyday</li>
            <li> I can usually go a few weeks without it.</li>
            <li> I practiced a few times but never got the knack of it.</li>
            <li> I do feel it&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tape for a few years.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelid.  </li>
            <li> The tape is less noticeable compare to others that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The tape is tiny and thin so it makes it a small challenge to peel off and put on.</li>
            <li> not really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these, but for practical reasons it&#x27;s not easy to use.</li>
            <li> the affect it has works like the glue where it sticks your eyelid skin at the desired crease location together, but without the mess!  </li>
            <li> The tape is also very thin, which is well hidden when the eye is open.</li>
            <li> the tapes were a little thin - not much eyelid reduction&lt;</li>
            <li> Also, the tapes didn&#x27;t help my eyes form crisp lines, so my eyes looked odd like I had failed plastic surgery (not attractive at all!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still practicing the placement and sometimes it looks a little bit weird in personal, so maybe for now I&#x27;ll use this at home.</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to put on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have not mastered the technique or if this product is shot.  </li>
            <li> Once you remove both sides of the white tape (it&#x27;s double-stick tape)it&#x27;s difficult to re-adjust it once it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> It comes with a small container (1X 1.5)</li>
            <li> At 50 years old I desperately needed an uplift.</li>
            <li> they do what I expected it to, just a bit irritating</li>
            <li> You should change them every 24 hours, but I will admit I have been lazy a couple of times and they have lasted a couple of days...</li>
            <li> so maybe I destined for my small lids.</li>
            <li> and then your eyelid would look very messy.</li>
            <li> It stings sides of my eye lids but this maybe due to my poor coordination ability.</li>
            <li> Maybe someone with less skin would work, but for me, it made me look worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;can be hard to get the tape to get onto the applicator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> learned that the hard way XD.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I used it and it was hard to hold up my droopy eyes</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work and hard to take off.</li>
            <li> but it is reality hardly noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> Really confusing to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard that I need to keep using this product at least 22 hours a day for consecutive 3 months to correct my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying I have mono lids (no lines, just plain), and I have thin eyelid skin.</li>
            <li> They are either difficult to apply ,difficult to remove, do not stay long, or look really obvious and fake.</li>
            <li> Ah so I always use this product to make eyelids so it was a usual buy for me!</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use</li>
            <li> They work as described and I&#x27;m no longer insecure about my uneven eyes.</li>
            <li> I purchased this one in hope to balance my lids in both of my eyes without surgery by doing it everyday, but it felt so uncomfortable that I gave up.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was not good at this, but it took me quite some time to put it on.</li>
            <li> You will probably spend several sets to practice, but removing &amp; reapplying is painful.</li>
            <li> Any way don&#x27;t get fooled by those dumb ppl review and it stays on to you</li>
            <li> IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING TO CREATE A PERMANENT CREASE, I RECOMMENDED PUTTING IT ON FOR AT LEAST 60-90DAYS!</li>
            <li> When I put it on, it has no side affects and is very hard to tell it is even there.</li>
            <li> When I say all day I mean 24 hours!</li>
            <li> What she said resonated with me: She was tired of having to do two types of makeup, one on each eye, to make them match, and so she used these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since I have oily eyelids, the glue on the tape wears out faster and I have to keep reapplying it throughout the day, irritating my eyelids.  </li>
            <li> I have thin eyelids</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too irritating and I feel that I may get a looser eyelid if I use it for months.</li>
            <li> this tape is sticky on both sides and is so thin that it literally disappeared into my eyelid.  </li>
            <li> it is thin and two side adhesive.</li>
            <li> It opened up my eyes and made my eyes look not that tired anymore as they were always looked like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, this product IS NOT plastic surgery and will not deliver dramatic results.</li>
            <li> difference in eyelid appearance is very subtle and for the price, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> However it is a bit difficult with eyeshadow on.</li>
            <li> that difficult.  </li>
            <li> Product was difficult to use and did not stick to my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I think this is useless.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re probably just as insecure about your mono-lids, just like I was before buying this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to put on</li>
            <li> I suggest you give it a try, for the price, it can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this tape too, but I have used it every day since I&#x27;ve had it with no</li>
            <li> It makes my makeup go on weird</li>
            <li> anyone who says it doesnt work, the reason could be that they&#x27;re using it wrong and should look at a youtube tutorial OR that their eyelid is a monolid because of eyelid fat.</li>
            <li> wtf was on my eyelids..</li>
            <li> Stay all day without weird looking.</li>
            <li> Also the double-sided glue makes my eyelid sticky and eye shadow looked weird.</li>
            <li> I started cutting thin scotch tape stripes and use them to lift my hood.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s terrible because you can&#x27;t close your eyes properly.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to apply</li>
            <li> Tape was horrible if you have heavy , droopy eyelid like me.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that it would show when worn</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s me, but is just too darn difficult to use!</li>
            <li> They were awful, too small.</li>
            <li> Is very difficult to apply and just doesn&#x27;t work as intended.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad .</li>
            <li> I was getting frustrated and was considering Botox, which is a toxin...</li>
            <li> However, it takes me awhile to get the tape off the backing :(.</li>
            <li> It was really annoying to have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointed ..</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> The strips are virtually invisible so the worst that can happen is that the adhesive lets go</li>
            <li> My wifes conversations are boring as all get-out.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this project for two years, it works the best for me! I will recommend you to try!</li>
            <li> A little difficult to use and you can see it on.</li>
            <li> Best eyelid tape I have ever used. Will buy it again.</li>
            <li> really good eyelid tape which I have bought a lot of times</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t gotten the hang of using these.  I&#x27;ve tried applying them before and after I&#x27;ve applied eye shadow and it makes little difference either way.  There really is no way to apply these perfectly enough to go unnoticeable.  Just save your pennies and get an eyelift...... lol.......</li>
            <li> Did not work at all for me. Maybe my drooping lids are just too heavy.</li>
            <li> My right eye crease is smaller than my left. It&#x27;s very noticeable when I put eyeliner on. I put this tape on to work today. The product stayed on and you couldn&#x27;t see it. I took it off after only having it on for four hours. I didn&#x27;t want it on my eye for a long time on my first try. My new crease has stayed put for the whole day.</li>
            <li> best eyelid tape I bought</li>
            <li> I love using this eyelid tape! Been using it for over a year now. If you don&#x27;t rub your eyes too much, it won&#x27;t get irritated and it&#x27;s very easy to apply and remove. The applicator is very user-friendly!</li>
            <li> Is very difficult to apply and just doesn&#x27;t work as intended. Still searching for the perfect eyelid &amp;#34;lifter&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I think this eyelid tape is very easy to use, and it doesn&#x27;t show if you don&#x27;t close your eyes. However, because it looks very natural, the only downside is that it won&#x27;t change your eyes much either--it creates a very small crease, but don&#x27;t expect your eyes to become bigger. The price is very reasonable and seller ships fast, it is definitely worth a try.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable at all, super sticky and invisbile!!</li>
            <li> Sticks on really well for a whole day. The tape is less noticeable compare to others that I have tried in the past. However it is a bit difficult with eyeshadow on. Doesn&#x27;t stick well with eyeshadow on already so make sure to put tapes on before eyeshadows. The tape is tiny and thin so it makes it a small challenge to peel off and put on. Overall, I would buy it again. It helped correct my eye crease in one eye to make both eyelids look symmetrical. It shipped quick and on time in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend when you learn how to do this . After a few tries, I find it to be the best product of its kind that I have ever used. It&#x27;s not 100percenf comfortable but it is indeed natural-looking! Satisfied!</li>
            <li> Still working at using these correctly.  I&#x27;m a novice at this and it must take practice.  These are very light weight and clear.</li>
            <li> loved it, i have uneven eye lids, and it help me even out, especially when putting make up on</li>
            <li> Cannot see any trace of the tape when used properly. Love that the tape is double sided! Do not place the tape too far up from your natural crease or it will not fold and stick naturally.</li>
            <li> My eyes are deepset &amp; have lots of excess skin hanging over the crease.  i purchased these strips in the hope of creating a look that opens my eyes more.  The following is a list of issues I experienced after only having successfully worn the strips once (ended up removing before outing was over as strips began to irritate eyes)only to have used up half a sheet of strips on failed attempts:    Difficult to impossible to place strips properly even after several attempts; does not stick to lids with eyeshawdow; ruins adhesive ability to apply makeup on top of strip; must get placement on first application because removing &amp; reapplying quickly renders adhesive useless; can tell there is a strip or something that sticks out on eyelid; minimal affect if any; cannot return product &amp; as such is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelids so I use one every few days to try and remake a larger crease in my eye. This stuff works! I was so happy and amazed. May not have to look at surgery as an option for this may lead to permanent changes! I rarely write reviews so believe me people!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get ppl who say this is not transparent like they not peel the white layer off or what? Any way don&#x27;t get fooled by those dumb ppl review and it stays on to you, I bet I can leave it on for a week( I already have double eye lid but some time one of them turn single if I don&#x27;t sleep well. So I just stick them under my eye lid which there no way any one can tell your using tape or not, not even myself since its hidden under my eyelid) great product and it well last you a while</li>
            <li> This takes some getting used to and I recommend using tweezers to remove the tape from the wrapping and for placing on the eyelid. It took some practice and wasted product to place the tape correctly on, but the results ended up being natural looking. The results do not last though and in a couple of hours you can start to see the tape start to show on the eyelid. This Didn&#x27;t irritate my eyes and was easy to remove</li>
            <li> I gave them a try and can say they are great for my everyday usage when I&#x27;m not using other eye tapes for a wider younger look.  Overall they are easy to apply and practice was not as complicated without English instructions.  They stay on great and even when I&#x27;m sweating or having long stressful days.  I rub my eyes sometimes and forget they are there and amazed how well intact they stay.  YAY..!</li>
            <li> work very good, even I put it on top of my make up,</li>
            <li> It was tricky at first, but after a few times it became very easy to use. I experienced no irritation. You will need tweezers to pick up the tape. I had to trim the sides, so that it would not poke my skin when I was wearing the tape, besides that minor thing I will purchase it again!</li>
            <li> The tape strips come with an applicator and very clear instructions.  And at a very good price!  It arrived promptly and in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> This product was designed for the Asian market.  The instructions are only in Chinese or Japanese etc.. Pictures are available but the product really doesn&#x27;t do much for the age-droop of an older American eye.</li>
            <li> this is actually useful. I didn&#x27;t know how to use it before but with the help of the instruction inside I have bigger eyes now!</li>
            <li> These stay on all day on top of my makeup. Take off with warm water to loosen the adhesive and to wash residue off your eye.</li>
            <li> Great! I&#x27;m Asian and saw this with Michelle  Phan YouTube.  I wanted to get it.  I&#x27;m going to try  for 3 months</li>
            <li> make your eyes much bigger</li>
            <li> i have tried other tapes bought from Japan which works much better but i practiced on that one with much more times. This one somehow does not work that well in my first couple of tries. will keep trying and hopefully it works one day and forever.     getting rid of the clue just takes a Q tip and some alcohol. pretty easy and pain free.</li>
            <li> It absolutely does its job. However, the double lids do not look natural. Despite that, I would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really looks good the first time I used it, but it made me uncomfortable when I used it for whole day because it&#x27;s too sticky and hard to take off.</li>
            <li> This product is a must have if you love the double eye lid look! So easy and better than other products out there that are only single sided tape.  The double sided tape on this really makes the product invisible-try it and you&#x27;ll see! Never worry that someone will see the tape now!</li>
            <li> Does not work.  Will not let me return item.  Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have very hooded eyes. These have helped a little bit. These would probably work better on someone with only very slightly hooded eyes. I have noticed that they create a new crease that stays there a little while after they are removed. If you wear these everyday you can probably create a new permanent crease. My one complaint is that they are too long for my eyes and the edges are a little pointy. I cut about 2mm off each side to make them fit my smaller eyes better.</li>
            <li> Very good product . Easy to use</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;holds well&lt;br /&gt;fixes my creases&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;can be hard to get the tape to get onto the applicator&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to help even out my lids and it has helped tremendously!  The tape definitely holds up and it pretty strong.  Other tapes end up losing it&#x27;s adhesiveness.</li>
            <li> Love this product.. It does get sticky at the end of the day.. but it does hide the tape.. Shipping  came fast..</li>
            <li> It moisturizes my face and it is perfect! I use it everyday :) This one has extra adhesiveness so it sticks to my eyelids and its barely noticeable! fast shipping</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried and tried and just cannot get these darn things to work at all.  Finally just gave up.  Shipping was quick and all other aspects of the purchase was good.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good product, though I wouldn&#x27;t pay the new price of $20 for it. I got it, both times, when it was $13 - $14 dollars. The tape is double sided and helps even out my uneven eyelids.</li>
            <li> This is my HG product for creating double-eyelids!  I&#x27;m a &#x27;just eye-liner and mascara&#x27; make-up style Korean born with mono-lids so I have experimented many glues and tapes.  I found DUP wonder eyelid tape to work the best.  It takes quite a bit to learn to put the tape on correctly as well as creating the right type of crease that looks natural.  These are not recommended if you will be using eyeshadow over or under these tapes.</li>
            <li> Very hard to use plus instructions are not in English</li>
            <li> These are tricky to get on correctly for the best look.  Since the directions are not in English, it requires a bit of practice on your own to see where on your eyelid they look best on you.  I watched a few videos before trying and this helped.  Even, when you know where to apply them, it still takes some time to do. I do like them and think they  improve the extra skin on my puffy/baggy eyelids.</li>
            <li> Its really expensive, but it was worth it. It works really well once you figure out how to use this properly, but still it takes a while to see permanent results, everything has a process. The thing is, it is still pretty noticeable, and I highly suggest don&#x27;t wear it in public, or else it&#x27;s really embarrassing, learned that the hard way XD.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Vietnamese decent and have had one monolid and one doublelid forever. It&#x27;s been bothering me for YEARS until I bought these. They work as described and I&#x27;m no longer insecure about my uneven eyes. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of my eyelids has a slight hood, so I thought that I&#x27;d give these a try.  They work great, you cant see them when you use them properly, and they stick very well.  When I use the tape, my eyelid hood disappears &amp; both of my eyes look exactly the same - which is great.  The ONLY negative, the instructions are all in Japanese - no English.  But you can figure out how to use the tapes without too much difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, overall - a really effective product.</li>
            <li> It does not stick very well. I purchased this one in hope to balance my lids in both of my eyes without surgery by doing it everyday, but it felt so uncomfortable that I gave up.</li>
            <li> It is really good product for me. I will try next time. A little bit itch, but work well.Good work for Asia Women.</li>
            <li> I have hooded, almond shaped, downward, eyes. Sheesh. Say that 10 times fast!  This product did not work well for me and I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I have not mastered the technique or if this product is shot.  I also have oily lids but even when they are dry they didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The tape lasts all day, lifts the lid slightly, a little tricky when you first remove the small tape and add to the plastic applicator, but&lt;br /&gt;not that difficult.  Arrived promptly, well-packaged.</li>
            <li> As a single-lidder, I love this product. It&#x27;s double-sided sticky and unlike eyelid glue, I can wear it to bed and not worry about irritated, red and puffy eyes the next morning. It really makes a noticeable and natural crease. This company is great. All their tape is double-sided and is also water proof. I wear it in the shower (and provided I don&#x27;t rub and scrub my eyes) it stays on. I love it, and I&#x27;ve found stores where I live that sell it so I&#x27;ve bought it again and again and will continue to do so.</li>
            <li> This eyelid tape is double sided and great for my hooded lids.  It does take a couple of tries to get it right.  It really does stick and lasts quite a while.  I can use make up over it and it tends to last a long time.</li>
            <li> product is great, shipping is fast.</li>
            <li> love this product. im southeast asian and have nicely pronounced eyelids (however my right lid has always been thicker and fuller than the left) and after wearing the tape every night for two months both eyelids are equally thick and i am one happy girl :)</li>
            <li> I love this product!  However, it takes me awhile to get the tape off the backing :(. I think it&#x27;ll get easier as time passes. Another downside is that it leaves sticky residue on my eyelids. Overall it&#x27;s what I was expecting...no complaints.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just an inexperience user so I didn&#x27;t really know how to put these on but it worked and looked better with practice.  I would suggest purchasing an inexpensive one to use first before purchasing this if this will be the first time using eyelid tape.  I have dry skin to start off the day but I do tend to get oily towards the evening.  It stays on until I decide to peel it off so it works as I expected it to work.</li>
            <li> Easily placed and lasts all day.  I do get itchy by the end of day but it&#x27;s time then to remove them anyway.  Although I have kept them on for a couple of days and not had a problem with them.  I can swim, bike and work in them.  I use them because of the excessive amount of lid I have and it makes it easier to read and see in general.</li>
            <li> This product works and I would recommend to others who have no eyelids...I just need more practice and it will work much better...but practice makes perfect...right?</li>
            <li> After reading many YouTube reviews and online blogs about this \\&quot;miracle item\\&quot; that does wonders for those in the Asian community who want a \\&quot;higher crease\\&quot; or who want an alternative to blepharoplasty (eye-lid surgery), I felt that I needed to try this \\&quot;holy-grail-ed\\&quot; item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched several videos on how to apply this item (instructions are in Japanese) and after using up several strips, I found that it did not stick well to my eyelid. Once you remove both sides of the white tape (it&#x27;s double-stick tape)it&#x27;s difficult to re-adjust it once it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference in eyelid appearance is very subtle and for the price, I will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I used to use the koi eyelid glue, and while I still think it is better than these, these are probably better in the long run as they are faster to apply once you get the hang of it, and also, you can actually get real double-lids if you continue using these on a regular basis. I don&#x27;t follow the instructions that came in the package though. Instead of using the fork to pick up the tape, I use a plastic tweeze, place it on the desired fold line, and then press it in with the included fork. The price on amazon is reasonable and I&#x27;m glad there is such a convenient way to purchase these in the States!</li>
            <li> It is a little hard to put on. I use it occasionally.</li>
            <li> Product was difficult to use and did not stick to my eyelid. Instead it just looked like a strange transparent line on my eyelid.</li>
            <li> I guess it depends on how you apply it &amp; also what makeup you wear, but for me these are clearly visible.. Especially with makeup. What I started to do was just wear them for the morning before I apply makeup then take it off because it leaves a crease resemblance. The stickiness is pretty decent.. &amp; the application is tricky.</li>
            <li> I used this stuff for about three months to try and even out my eyelids and it did work. Now I have a crease on both eyes where as before I had a monolid on one side and double on the other. It is very sticky and I would recommend to take it off with warm water and makeup remover to avoid pulling on the eyelid and causing it to become saggy. Even though I thought this was a great product it is a little pricey that&#x27;s why I gave it a four. Also I bought a cheaper one when I ran out for $2 and it was not a double sided tape which I actually prefer now since I only use it once in a while and is easier to remove. Overall if you want a heavy duty tape this one will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a huge difference in your look.  It starts to loose it&#x27;s effect by the end of the night so you might want to retouch.  For the price I don&#x27;t think it is worth it.</li>
            <li> as some others said, it is hard to reuse the same sticker, and I don&#x27;t really like the style of sticky on both side, i tried to use make up to make the upper side not sticky, but the inner side always got dirty too, and it actually shows a little</li>
            <li> Better than all others I tried.</li>
            <li> Struggled a bit at first but I think im getting the hang of it.  I had to get the instructions online because these instructions are in another language</li>
            <li> Product does what it states: it&#x27;ll pull your monolid into a double lid, but it&#x27;s a small crease. The tape&#x27;s slim, so it can&#x27;t fold back your lid into a defined crease, but if you&#x27;re looking for a tape that appears natural or if you have a thin eyelid, this might be the one for you. I have a relatively hooded lid, so I can see why the tape isn&#x27;t quite working. I haven&#x27;t tried out any other tape, but if you&#x27;re looking for a sharp defined crease, you might want to try something else. It&#x27;s also kind of short, so if you have a longer eye, the tape might be problematic. It&#x27;s also one use only, and pretty hard (not impossible) to get back on if you take it off, even if you placed it incorrectly and want to take it off immediately to correct the placement. This might be a problem for first time users, but if you&#x27;re familiar with the process, you should be fine.  If anyone can suggest a tape that gives a more defined crease or is slightly longer, I&#x27;m all ears!</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelid tape that works for me.  I&#x27;ve tried many and this thin two sided tape is absolutely the only brand that stays on all day! its been over a year since I&#x27;ve using them. Still love them to this day!</li>
            <li> beginning is OK ,but after a while the bothering me!</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-the package comes with a lot of tapes great pricing&lt;br /&gt;- pretty easy to apply once you get the hang of it&lt;br /&gt;- shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;-glue is sturdy says on until you want to take it off especially if you use a make up remover pad before hand to ensure excess oils are gone - AlSO - avoid trying to use eye shadow in area of application.. with any of these tapes and I have tried many types.. the shadow powder causes the tape to lose adherence....&lt;br /&gt;-truly double sided invisible once on&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- the tapes were a little thin - not much eyelid reduction&lt;br /&gt;-the outer edges taper to a point.. they can tend to irritate the lid at that edge and also start to peel off at that edge - comes in handy when you want to take them off but I could feel them at times and wondered oh man are they showing?? At times they did show by the end of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall not Great product - have not found better ... only cons are the ones listed... and they are pretty minor..</li>
            <li> Ah so I always use this product to make eyelids so it was a usual buy for me! (Since I like this version of eye tape the best (´∀｀)♡ It doesn&#x27;t show since it&#x27;s sticky on both sides and you are able to make almost any kind of crease.) I was really impressed with how lovingly packaged it was! The seller took care to wrap each one into it&#x27;s own plastic wrap/warnings and it was all very nicely done and it arrived safely to my home! I will definitely be buying again once I run out~</li>
            <li> This idea is great.  Unfortunatley, it did not work well for me.  I guess, for me, if the strips were witderit would have done a better job.</li>
            <li> i like it because it actually sticks well but my eyes gets a little irritated whenever i blink</li>
            <li> Good. The adhesive holds well and is relatively comfortable. It is transparent and typically lasts a couple of hours. Plenty of practice required to get it on just right.</li>
            <li> The application instructions are written in Chinese.  They are extremely hard to remove from the white tape for application.  I would NOT recommend this product, nor will I EVER purchase again.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;m used to using double eyelid tape, I have no problem with the tape. I even wear it while sleeping. In fact, if you want to get a permanent double eyelid, I recommend wearing this (one sided tape just doesn&#x27;t work on me lol). Anyway, the adhesive is very strong. I bought the point double sided tape (which is shorter) from a supermarket nearby(after buying from Amazon, I found out they&#x27;re selling it near my place lol) and it was pretty good. Maybe I&#x27;m used to the long one so I prefer it as I feel that they really stick from one end to the other</li>
            <li> Even after removing white strip, it was extremely hard to put on. Instructions in chinese didn&#x27;t help either. Even after applying strip, didn&#x27;t notice any difference on droopiness if my eye. Definately made for asian eyes.</li>
            <li> I have double eyelids already but this product makes my eyes even bigger! It is double sided! That is definitely a PLUS! I have tired few other products, but this one is my favorite! It last all day. When I say all day I mean 24 hours! No touch up needed! And it is is totally invisible! NO ONE will be able to tell you have it on.</li>
            <li> Wow the difference is real</li>
            <li> I think this is useless. I wasted my money and time. Not strong enough, doesn&#x27;t work. I certainly do not recommend it to anyone, its very tiny and hard to use.</li>
            <li> I have used so many types of eyelid tapes and that&#x27;s the best one I ever used!!!!!!!!!!!! it&#x27;s just working so well!!!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product. Total rip off. Cheap materials. Instructions in Chinese only. DO NOT BUY !  Plus they are impossible to use as well, especially with their cheap little plastic tweezer.  Their cost per unit is probably $.05 cents, IF THAT.  TRASH.  I&#x27;m truly surprised Amazon has affiliation with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian and i have mono-eyelids, These were my very first double eyelid tapes and they are literally... PERFECT. They are completely unnoticeable and they look very natural. Also because my lids arent very oily, these stayed on for like over a day and a half. I know it&#x27;s not really good to keep it on that long, but i think its a good thing because it means i wont have to change it (pulling/stretching my skin) plus, the longer you have it on the chances of it becoming permanent becomes higher. I messed up a couple of times (once or twice) but now i have the hang of it. Also , they are very comfortable. It comes with a small container (1X 1.5) so its easy to store. Despite the high price, this product is the best.</li>
            <li> Description should state that for normal eyelids, it takes 2 strips for each eyelid. The instructions come in Japanese, which are useless, luckily you tube had demonstration videos on it. I didn&#x27;t send back as I&#x27;ve already spent enough money for something I thought was a 60 day supply &amp; turns out to be only a 30 day supply.</li>
            <li> Simply the best eyelid tape ever. Complete invisible and easy to use</li>
            <li> Good effective eyelid tape. I like it in general. The only caveat is that it does not look very natural when looked closely.</li>
            <li> very useful, good item,just a little expensive.i like it. It is the best one in my used. If you need it,highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> got this to try before my blepharoplasty, and they do work well. a little tricky to figure out in the beginning, but just takes practice.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted! It works great, glad I chose this brand and product, couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied with it!</li>
            <li> Never used Eyelid Tape before, and try this for my first product. As people said, it is easy to use because the instruction is provided. But, it&#x27;s always tricky for a beginner, especially using the eyelid tape. Tried many times since it has 120pcs, I don&#x27;t have to worry about how many I tried. I think it works well, and you cannot see yourself wearing eyelid tape when you put it on. Need to pratice more!!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re reading this, you&#x27;re probably just as insecure about your mono-lids, just like I was before buying this product. However, after using this these eyelid tapes, I realized that changes are absolutely minimal. Learn to love the way you look, and trust me, it&#x27;ll be a love that saves you hundreds of dollars in the long run.</li>
            <li> Maybe I was not good at this, but it took me quite some time to put it on. It did make the eye look more pretty.</li>
            <li> I used this tape to help hide the droopy eyelids that age has given me, and it worked perfectly! It takes some practice to know where to apply it based on how your eyelid fold fall, but it sticks all day and is comfortable, and it is easy to remove at the end of the day. Great for monolids, but also great for 50 year old saggy eyelids!</li>
            <li> the product is the best. i is easy to use and it is almost invisible even if you dont put on make up.</li>
            <li> They last all day and can&#x27;t be seen which is great. My only problem with them is that they&#x27;re too thin to really give me a nice double eyelid, I go from droopy monolids to a really small double eyelid.</li>
            <li> Went from &amp;#62;_&amp;#60; to O_O. good stuff</li>
            <li> I use these when my right eye turns into a mono lid. It&#x27;s good to have, just wish I didn&#x27;t need them!</li>
            <li> As a sixty-something I bought this eyelid tape after watching several youtube examples of how to apply it. The strips are very tiny and must be handled carefully, although they are not difficult to apply. After being applied, they work exactly as they say they will--for three or four hours, then the adhesive seems to give up. The strips are virtually invisible so the worst that can happen is that the adhesive lets go and I go back to looking like a sixty-something with baggy eyelids. For that reason, I cannot recommend them.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I am not Asian. I am just your typical white girl. These strips are not just for Asians. In fact, I heard about them through Michelle Phan, who is actually Asian but doesn&#x27;t have tiny eyelids. She, like me, has one eyelid that is smaller than the other one, and she showed how to use strips like these to fix that. I figured, eh, why not? Many people don&#x27;t notice my eyelid size difference when they&#x27;re looking at me, but in pictures, it&#x27;s extremely noticeable, and it becomes even more noticeable when I wear makeup. What she said resonated with me: She was tired of having to do two types of makeup, one on each eye, to make them match, and so she used these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. They work very well. If I apply them the right way, they&#x27;ll stick for 12 hours easily.&lt;br /&gt;2. They&#x27;re not noticeable at all when you have them on (usually).&lt;br /&gt;3. They&#x27;re cheaper than all the other options on amazon and they work better, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The adhesive seems to &amp;#34;ooze&amp;#34; after a bit. I don&#x27;t know how else to describe it. I apply the strip, and sometimes the adhesive spreads to a lower part of my eyelid that the tape isn&#x27;t on. Then that lower part will stick, too, and it throws the crease way off.&lt;br /&gt;2. You will probably have adhesive left on your eyelid when you take these off, and because of the strength of the tape, it is very easy to leave red welts on your eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons are pretty easily handled with some eye makeup remover. I clean my eyelid with the eye makeup remover after having taken the strips off, and if the adhesive oozes down to a part of the eyelid it isn&#x27;t supposed to be on, I very careful take a q-tip and clean that part of the eyelid to get the adhesive off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does take work, but I&#x27;ve noticed after about a month of use that even if I don&#x27;t wear the strips, my new crease stays. Michelle Phan said you have to wear them 22 hours a day for I think 4 months straight before thecrease becomes semi-permanent and only needs an occasional (one day a week, maybe) application of the tape to renew the strength. So far, these are working well and I&#x27;m very grateful. I can already see the difference in pictures, and I&#x27;m so glad that I can fix this problem that I thought I&#x27;d never be able to fix.</li>
            <li> takes a bit to get used to using, and the edges are too pointy so i have to cut them off or they irritate my eyelids. but the double sided tape works wonders!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get on the eye fork thing plus to get good results you have to wear them 22 hours everyday for at least 3 months but once you get use to it it&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> They are good for my eyes ,, but i need to use olive oil when i want to wear off them or i will burn lol</li>
            <li> It stings sides of my eye lids but this maybe due to my poor coordination ability. Does the job!</li>
            <li> I wear these every time I leave the house. They stay on, but people do notice when the light catches the end of it. My problem with it is that it does not help form a double eyelid. It just make a temporary one. The double eyelid never stays.</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s me, but is just too darn difficult to use! no thanks!</li>
            <li> Thanks to a youtube demo, I can now  easily apply the tape to open up my hooded eyes.  I don&#x27;t use these every day, but when my allergies are bad or I have not had enough rest, these little tapes do an excellent job of removing that dull, tired look from my eyes.</li>
            <li> My favorite brand for eyelid tape.  Works very well.</li>
            <li> Love it.  I have very hooded eyelids.  It took about three tries to figure what works best for me.  After I removed them, there was a little glue&lt;br /&gt;reside on the lids and it continued the lift effect.  I will continue buying these.  Great product...small enough not to show too much.</li>
            <li> STAYED ON ALL DAY - EVEN WITH HEAVY EYE MAKE UP ON. IF YOU&#x27;RE LOOKING TO CREATE A PERMANENT CREASE, I RECOMMENDED PUTTING IT ON FOR AT LEAST 60-90DAYS!</li>
            <li> Didnt work for me wery disapointed</li>
            <li> This is probably a very good product, but I have very sensitive skin.  Since I have oily eyelids, the glue on the tape wears out faster and I have to keep reapplying it throughout the day, irritating my eyelids.  I recommend an eye glue as an alternative choice for people with sensitive skin like me.  This tape is a very good product otherwise.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to learn how to apply them but once I got the hang of it, these worked. I have thin eyelids so I didn&#x27;t need anything too strong. They stay put for me even after applying eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> Tape did not stay on at all, especially if you want to put eye shadow over it. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product, very well designed, easy to use and its looks very natural and easy to use. Highly recommended for droopy eyes like mine :)</li>
            <li> tried a few, best so far ,works well.</li>
            <li> My third pack. Extremely easy to apply compared with the Fiber tape. I always use it when I m in a hurry and need a perfect eye shape.</li>
            <li> I bought this before and it makes my eyelid look perfect. But i don&#x27;t know why this one is not as good as before, it can&#x27;t stick my eyelid for a long time.</li>
            <li> There were picture instructions included that were fairly clear about how to apply the product. The tape was very sticky and created a natural looking double eyelid. I have somewhat narrow eyes, so I had to cut off the ends of the tape. Otherwise, it would poke me, making my eyelid itchy, and also show in the corners. If I get any water on the adhesive, the glue part becomes gunky and starts slipping, so I had to switch it out whenever I showered or washed my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to put on and I threw it away after using one whole page of tape. The applicator that it came with has pointy edges and hurts.</li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered this product years ago. I will probably have a blepharoplasty some day. But till then, these are fantastic! I had no trouble peeling off the white backing and applying. They last all day long, and I love getting such a large supply at a reasonable price. To whoever invented these: THANK YOU! And thank you to the seller for the pricing and the quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I have tried many and this is the best out there. Worth the price, it is a lot more than the $2.00 ones but it stays for 24 hrs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other things, but this tape really is amazing. I just got it today and put it on; my double eyelids look very natural. I tried to use another eye tape before, but it was not very sticky. This stuff is strong and will hold your eyelid in place! Overall, I will definitely be ordering more of this. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works fine, but the tape wears off after 4-5 hours. Also, it looks kinda obvious you have something on your eyelid.</li>
            <li> it gave me the look I wanted but about 4hours in it starts to irritated. But I like it, nothing good nothing bad.</li>
            <li> It does by stay long like glue and it have you itchiness on the eyelids</li>
            <li> Works so well! Lasts overnight as well.</li>
            <li> My wifes conversations are boring as all get-out. I&#x27;m usually falling asleep while she&#x27;s talking about getting her hair/nails done, or telling me about the local gossip down at the strip-club&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this and tape my eyelids open so she thinks I&#x27;m attentively listening to her the entire time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has done wonders for our relationship</li>
            <li> Let me start this review by saying I have mono lids (no lines, just plain), and I have thin eyelid skin. I&#x27;ve never had problems with my eyes, but I wanted to try this because I was curious; however, it didn&#x27;t work for me. I understand everyone&#x27;s eyes are different. Some people&#x27;s eyes are hooded, and other people eyes have thicker eyelid skin. The tapes, however,  weren&#x27;t as sticky as I hoped them to be,  and approximately an hour of wearing the tapes, they slowly started to loose its adhesiveness mainly around the corners of my eyes. Also, the tapes didn&#x27;t help my eyes form crisp lines, so my eyes looked odd like I had failed plastic surgery (not attractive at all!). Overall, this product did not work for ME, but the reasons could vary from my eyes not being hooded, not having enough support on my lids(thickness of eyelid skin), or the product itself.</li>
            <li> At 50 years old I desperately needed an uplift. This takes some practice but it does work!! Just be sure to practice</li>
            <li> they do what I expected it to, just a bit irritating so I eventually cant take having it on my eyelid anymore</li>
            <li> For those days when my eyelids seem to droop a bit (age is taking its toll), this is the best product, next to surgery, to look rested and alert. It takes a little time to learn how to get the strips off the backing and positioned correctly on the lid, but once you master that, it is simple. The &amp;#34;look&amp;#34; lasts all day. Well worth the cost and time to apply. This is not just for Asian gals, but for anyone who has older, droopy lids, anyone with hooded lids, anyone of any age who wants to look naturally better. They are just about invisible, too, since they are clear and small. Eyes are suddenly open and alive!</li>
            <li> They were not as functional as I had hoped they would be for my eyelids.</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelid folds and was considering surgery-but this fixed it instantly,can&#x27;t see the tape. Lasts all day and even through a shower so I know I can go swimming with it on.  Wayyy better than the glue and so much easier to use.  Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> It helps even out my eyelids when one is larger than another on some mornings. It also keeps my eyelids even for the next couple of days after using it only for one day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a very strong adhesive, so it&#x27;s hard to remove. There is a proper way to remove the tape - use lotion and water to take away the stickiness, don&#x27;t pull and tug your eyelids since that area is very sensitive. It&#x27;s probably not a good idea to use it everyday and for many hours. The packaging is clean - the individual pieces of tape are covered with a sheet of paper that is perforated in the center for easy removal. A tong is also included. It will take some time to learn how to apply the tape. The instructions are in Japanese, so looking up Youtube videos on how to use this product is helpful.</li>
            <li> I used it and it was hard to hold up my droopy eyes and I ended up throwing it away</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot, the only thing I dislike is MY OWN eyelids. I have a full monolid and my eyelids are sorta of chunky. This product by itself did do much by itself so I would have to use my eye glue to layer the strip then it would work, but it was such a long process that I didn&#x27;t feel like doing anymore. The results of wearing this product with my glue was really nice, my eyelids were big and my eyes looked a lot wider people didn&#x27;t really notice the glue and the tape until I told them. You can&#x27;t really wear eyeshadow with this product because your brush might separate the skin and then your eyelid would look very messy. be very careful when putting the tape on your eye because if the other eye lid doesn&#x27;t match your first eyelid then your eyelids will look slanted and wrong. So make sure everything is even before you start jabbing your eyes with the prong.&lt;br /&gt;so yeah I do think this is a good product and the stickiness is very strong like how they said it would, I just blame my own eyelids for not working with this product.</li>
            <li> I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It really work on me!!!! It invisible! I it stays long ! My eye look perfect when i wear make up!! Recomended product</li>
            <li> Its great ! It the best there is. No one can even tell the difference and people say that it looks so natural and good on me. Gives me the confidence i need to buy agian :)</li>
            <li> I love this product!  Only one side of my eye have the eyelid crease so I use this only on the side that does not have an eyelid to even out my eyes.</li>
            <li> dup wonder eyelid tape only had directions in Chinese and when you only understand English there is a big problems,</li>
            <li> Finally i found the right double eyelid for me... It&#x27;s easy to apply, in just a few seconds, already done! unlike the fiber one... More important, it&#x27;s not visible! even u don&#x27;t put any make up(-;</li>
            <li> Gr8 products. I am buying again. Instructions can be found on youtube.</li>
            <li> It just really works!! Best eyelid tape I have ever used! Will definitely buy it again!!</li>
            <li> It works BUT  it sometimes hurts if it is not in the right spot !.  As a white guy with asian like eyes I am a little dissapointed but it&#x27;s not that bad . it&#x27;s more for REALLY small eyes like  really really asian (no offence ) .</li>
            <li> Works very well.  It takes a little practice to get it in the correct place on eyelid. Centering it towards the outer edge of the eyelid works for me.  Does not come off until you pull it off.  It is totally invisible.  Can use eye shadow with no problem after applying the tape.  Great product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten them on correctly yet.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to apply, but it Really works! Eyes become significantly bigger. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good and useful</li>
            <li> the product actually really works!!! i have asians eyes and it makes such  difference and you can&#x27;t even see the tape!</li>
            <li> Love the product, brand new, and unused. Very comfortable wearing them but I wish they had instructions in English but still love the product.</li>
            <li> the tapes do show some unless eye is completely open</li>
            <li> not really easy to use.</li>
            <li> It works like a charm, easy to.apply and take off. It&#x27;s soft and you can&#x27;t see it and makes a big difference</li>
            <li> Love it! My go to eyelid tape of all time.</li>
            <li> Very magic eyelid tape. I have tried many product, but finally settled down to this product. It is sticky enough to hold the eyelid for the whole day, but not too sticky to harm the eyelid skin. Will keep buying.</li>
            <li> I thought for the price which is inexpensive and w the reviews this product would work but it doesnt!!!!!!! Just bought one at an Asian market and it worked... What a waste of $20 or maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any advice would be appreciated seems like the other ones work perfectly fine kind of disappointed</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good. I&#x27;ve been using this for so long, and the price is good too. Try it! You will find out the big difference between this and other double eyelip products! You gotta love it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve never worn eyelid tape before, but this product was unbelievably easy to use even without the instructions, and the outcome looks absolutely lovely! i can barely remember that i&#x27;m wearing eyelid tape, and after removing the tape, the eyelid crease stays in place for several hours! i love this product! ( ´ ▽ &#x60; )</li>
            <li> I have used this tape quite a few times and its a lot less time consuming then the glue. Although if you misplace the tape the first time you&#x27;ve wasted a piece of tape. It also does not help that they pile on 10-15 pieces on a plastic backing as when you remove one, you start peeling off the glue off the others and exposing it to air which makes them less sticky, its a big pain in the butt and could probably use better packing for the tape. I do want to say if the piece of tape doesnt stay where it its suppose to it starts sticking out and becomes quite obvious. Its kind of annoying, I am thinking about switching back to glue because (although its time consuming) it works a lot better plus you dont end up misplacing where it goes on the eyelid and having to start over again.</li>
            <li> Tape was horrible if you have heavy , droopy eyelid like me.  Maybe someone with less skin would work, but for me, it made me look worse.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try these and so far have worked pretty well. The tape seems to stay on for almost a day and if you can get it in a good position, I dont think you could tell it was there (which is a good thing because it looked natural). I am very self-conscious about one of my droopy eyes, and this product has helped a lot. I never knew these products existed until I tried this one, and I am very pleased. It takes a lot of practice to put it on though.</li>
            <li> Another GLOWING review for this product! I found many brands of this particular product on amazon, but this one not only had the most reviews, it had the most positive reviews - in fact, most of the reviews were raving. I have heard about eyelid tape before, but thought - umm tape on my eyelids, not comfortable, no thanks! But the older I get the more hooded my eyelids get, so I turned to the internet for some solutions! Prior to ordering these, I took plain ole scotch tape and cut a small piece, to see if the &#x27;tape&#x27; theory really worked - it did! I was amazed! So I ordered these with 2 day shipping and couldn&#x27;t WAIT to get them! I LOVE how small they are and how they are actually invisible once placed properly! And the best part is - you can&#x27;t even feel them after a minute! I was able to put makeup right over it and it was truly invisible. Plus, it comes with 120 - so I didn&#x27;t mind wasting a few just to try and get the hang of it. The reviews are right that it does take a little practice to find the right spot in needs to go on your eyelid for the best results - but as I had been playing around with plain tape prior to receiving, it only took me about 5 tries before I got it right. They are easy to remove if you need to replace - but the stickiness does run out if you keep messing with it. Mine lasted the duration of a day before it started peeling when I rubbed my eye. But that is plenty long enough for me! And, I actually did notice after removing that my eyelid stayed the same - it did not immediately drop. So it is plausible to believe that with long term use, you can have semi-permanent results with continued use. I am sold!</li>
            <li> Works great on droopy eyelids! Stays on all day</li>
            <li> This was one of the highest rated/recommended eyelid tapes out on the market. My mother&#x27;s eyes already have a heavy crease that was starting to unfold itself, much to her discomfort, so the product worked on her already creased eyes.&lt;br /&gt;For me, however, the tape was a bit on the weaker side, but importantly, it was much too short! Being Asian, as I imagine most of you are, my eyes aren&#x27;t particularly wide or tall, and the tape itself hid/blended very well, but the crease stopped about two thirds of the way across my eyes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always dislike my mismatched eyelids. Yes, I&#x27;m Chinese, but I wasn&#x27;t looking for the \\&quot;doubld-lid\\&quot; fold, I just wanted my eyelids to match so I wouldn&#x27;t struggle to put my eye makeup on. I never realized eyelid tape was invented until I accidentaly came across this item as I researched. I thought the only option was plastic surgery. This product works great and I didn&#x27;t even have to read the directions, I simply watch some tutorials on YouTube and by my 2nd try, I pretty much knew what I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product IS NOT plastic surgery and will not deliver dramatic results. This will only work if you want subtle enhancement of your eyelids. I didn&#x27;t try it for the double eyelids since I don&#x27;t care, I have monolids... I guess, that just barely hit above my eyelash, so I&#x27;m not complaining about that. I suggest you give it a try, for the price, it can&#x27;t go wrong. If it doesn&#x27;t work, you can just trash it and not feel like you just toss a fortune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this tape is strong, but I don&#x27;t have any issue of removing it. In the morning, I just wash my fash and eye area with face wash and warm water and the tape just comes right off. At night, it easily slips off as I remove my eye makeup with a makeup wipe. Simple and easy. No problems, two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> Great product. Meant mostly for Asian women wanting to get rid of their mono lids, but will also work for uneven eyelids. I wanted to try these as an alternative to plastic surgery for uneven eyelids.  Great price for so many!  VERY difficult to place though, no matter how many times I do it, I still have trouble because they are so thin.  I have to use my fingers to place them and not to the tool, though I use the tool to finish.  I do find that if I wear them consistently, the eyelid tends to stay for a while.  So I believe that if you are religious about applying them for the 3 months as it says, you could permanently change your crease as long as you don&#x27;t have too much of a difference in your two lids (ie. too much skin on the left vs. the right side), because as with me....I can fold the skin and tape it to make my eyelids even but no matter what unless I have surgery that extra skin causing the major unevenness is not going away.....so that won&#x27;t work for me!  You should change them every 24 hours, but I will admit I have been lazy a couple of times and they have lasted a couple of days...also after removing, some adhesive is left, so you can get by for a few hours on just that, which is sometimes refreshing! Comes in a cute little plastic box that you can pop in your medicine cabinet or your purse! (and the eyelid tape itself comes on sheets, with many to a sheet) Overall, this is a great, inexpensive and quick way to fix an annoying problem and well worth the price!  Shipped quickly!</li>
            <li> This eyelid tape is super good. It doesn&#x27;t make you feel awkward because people won&#x27;t really notice that you are wearing it. Good!</li>
            <li> If you go with the Extra hold version, they hold quite well. Instructions are in Japanese but there are pictures and they are simple to follow. They provide a plastic tweezer that is good for getting one edge of the tape onto the tweezer for easy application without touching the sticky side.  Remember to leave the white paper on until you have positioned it on your eyelid. The white paper will separate at the middle and will come off easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you have CLEAN skin ... NO lotions, makeup, or anything on your lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update*** After a week I have gone through 36 pieces simply because of trial and error but I think I&#x27;ve got the hang of it now. You will find you need to place it lower than you may think, and I also realized that I cannot place it exactly on one eye as I do the other because my eyelids are a bit different so I have a little bit of a different approach for each eye. Using these is actually easy and effective. Tape is very strong and stays put. There are 120 pieces for 60 uses minus your trial &amp; error throw-aways the first week! I find the tweezers good for getting the tape on, but the instructions show them used to press the lid inward, but that does not work because you end up sticking the tweezer onto the very sticky tape. The biggest challenge I have now is getting it off. It sticks that well! As a testament to this item, I just ordered 2 more packages!</li>
            <li> I love it!!! For me it took a few tries t get it on right but overall I am very happy. It is strong as well I can sweat a storm during a workout and it still stays on. I used Michelle Phan&#x27;s youtube video on how to apply eyelid tape and that helps alot.</li>
            <li> Best eyelid tape I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it, application is pretty simple. Noticed a difference immediately, and it helps even out when one eye has a more significant double eyelid than the other.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine recommended this as I was looking for some way to make my eyelids even. I&#x27;m Chinese with double eyelids, but last year the crease on my left eyelid somehow switched higher and it just made my eyes look uneven. My friend told me there&#x27;s a Michelle Phan tutorial online about how to change your crease. And here I come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now I use this on my right eye and have been wearing it only during the night. As many have menioned before, this is a STRONG tape. You will probably spend several sets to practice, but removing &amp; reapplying is painful. It&#x27;s too irritating and I feel that I may get a looser eyelid if I use it for months. but it stays tight. I&#x27;m still trying to find a way to remove it, as I can only read those Chinese characters on the instruction (it&#x27;s a Japanese product) and so far didnt see anything about how to take it off gently. I think water helps, yet it&#x27;s still irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on my first week. Will update when I see a result!</li>
            <li> This actually works if applied correctly. Unfortunately one of my lid has more skin than the other and it doesn&#x27;t look like a good crease, it looks like I have 2 or 3 creases &amp;#34;broken crease&amp;#34; when I apply the eyelid tape to my right eye. However the left always comes out perfect so maybe I destined for my small lids. Or I can get surgery which it not really an option right now.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast! I am planning to use this to train my eyes because I have ptosis (droopy eyelid). It&#x27;s okay, it holds my eyelid. I&#x27;m still practicing the placement and sometimes it looks a little bit weird in personal, so maybe for now I&#x27;ll use this at home. Overall it does the job.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;1) It is double sided so it not only holds the fold but it also allows it to be discrete.&lt;br /&gt;2) It is very easy to use and practice makes perfect&lt;br /&gt;3) It comes with a V shaped tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;1) It hurts the inner corner of my eyes... However, I just cut a little bit of the side that was closer to the inner corner so that it doesn&#x27;t irritate it&lt;br /&gt;2) Can be itchy</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t specified here but these strips are WHITE. I looked at reviews for this product on beauty blog sites and they were always clear/invisible, which I just assumed they should be..because what a joke to have people see white strips when you look down and around! It&#x27;s the equivalent of seeing someone shoddily taping their face back for a face lift. I was already hesitant in making the step to use these (even if they were translucent), but read such great reviews that I thought I&#x27;d just TRY and see. When I got these though, they made me laugh.  First time I&#x27;ve written an amazon review - but first time I&#x27;ve bought and been stuck with such a ridiculous item! This company does not allow returns, of course. I wonder if other reviewers received clear ones? Confused by the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I have a drooping eyelid on the left side and I have used 3 different products for the past years before buying DUP Wonder Eyelid tape. Thanks for the reviews from the users! This product is the one!!! It works so well that I have just ordered it a second time from Amazon. The tape is easy to apply. It stays for 24 hours if you don&#x27;t touch it. One good thing was it did not make my eye irritated.Even though it costs a bit more compared to the other brand, I don&#x27;t mind spending money on this wonder products which is made from Japan, not China.</li>
            <li> Much better than that sorry american version. Very sticky so they stay in place. I recommend washing your lids off to get rid of any access oil before putting them on though. I also love the fact that they cant be seen. They are completely clear.</li>
            <li> I am mixed, Asian-Caucasian. My eyes are pretty Asian though. I do have a small crease on both lids but its almost not visible because its so low (close to my upper eyelid) and I also have a lot of excess skin that makes it seem like I have droopy eyelids.  Ultimately it looks like I have no crease, just one flat surface. I&#x27;ve tried using Scotch tape on my own and it was a little difficult to maneuver. I was skeptical about this tape too, but I have used it every day since I&#x27;ve had it with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tape is double sided. I use tweezers to remove the white paper that covers the top side of the tape. They&#x27;ve even perforated it in the middle for your ease. I find its the only way to remove it...I&#x27;ve tried pulling from one end and it just doesn&#x27;t work--pull the paper off from the perforation in the middle. Then use either tweezers or the white application tool to pick up your lid strip. Since I have a small crease with some strabismus, I place my strip just above my natural crease.  Press down firmly to ensure the strip comes off the application tool and sticks firmly to the skin and then use the tips of the tool or the opposite end to tap down securely.  It&#x27;s as simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YouTube has videos that help too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not expect to have huge doe eyes.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s purpose is to change the course of nature.  I wanted to even out my uneven creases and hopefully give a slightly more defined crease and that&#x27;s exactly what it does.  If you&#x27;re expecting to walk away with a face lift, this won&#x27;t do it--you will probably need to pay for a face lift.</li>
            <li> Did not stick very well to my eyelids through out the day, and the applicator wasn&#x27;t what I was use to. It was less flexible and more of a complete &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; shape instead of a &amp;#34;Y&amp;#34; shape. I do have oily skin, so that may have contributed to it not sticking very well through the day. I would not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work at all .. Very disappointed .. Is there a 0 star rating ?</li>
            <li> You can see the tape on your lid.  Didn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Very nice! Easy to apply and stick well. Only slightly too long. I would recommend the shorter ver of the same brand.</li>
            <li> My got this for my younger sister and she loves it. I don&#x27;t use it but I&#x27;ve asked her how she likes it. It&#x27;s easy to use and there is a lot. She doesn&#x27;t wear them everyday so they last pretty long.</li>
            <li> Why is sticky on BOTH sides? It makes my makeup go on weird and you can see the tape, not to mention it really irritates my skin....fail.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for those with a monolid without any trace of a double lid. I have one double lid and one eyelid that likes to switch off between monolid and double lid on its own. I used this for that eye, but it was too much for my needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelid tape is very strong, sticks very well, and is double sided, which is great for those without any sort of natural crease in the eye. The tape is also very thin, which is well hidden when the eye is open. However, it is not hidden when the eye is closed or while blinking, so I would not recommend wearing this in public where you will be close to people. Since the tape is so strong, it is very difficult to remove without pulling on your eyelid, which is not good in the long run. I highly suggest those to use an oil based makeup remover in removing this tape. Must be oil based to break down the adhesive. Just gently rub the makeup remover all over it, and start working it in at one of the corners until it begins to lift. Continue rubbing and working the makeup remover under the tape until the whole thing comes off.</li>
            <li> Although i arrived little late, the product serves as i was described and i is very convenient to use. I like it</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m asian and have uneven eye lids.  one side has a small crease while the other side is a monolid.  i&#x27;ve tried all different types of eyelid tape, regular tape and eyelid glue.  this is by far the best product i&#x27;ve tried!!  the first type of eyelid tape i tried was only sticky on one side and the non-sticky side was textured or kinda &amp;#34;bumpy?&amp;#34;  it worked ok under makeup if i did a really good job, but for the most part it was visible.  i even had a child call me out on the tape on my eye!  (uhm, embarrassing)  eyelid glue worked well, but it was hit or miss whether or not it would crease the way i wanted it to.  sometimes my eye lashes would get stuck in the glue and i would have to spend a bit more time on it than i wanted to.  this tape is sticky on both sides and is so thin that it literally disappeared into my eyelid.  the affect it has works like the glue where it sticks your eyelid skin at the desired crease location together, but without the mess!  i will definitely be repurchasing this item after i run out.  hopefully after wearing it long enough my lid will stay creased for good.</li>
            <li> I ordered these in the hopes of lifting my droopy eyelids due to age and they work. I have tried other eyelids tapes and glues in the past and most of them are either visible or they didn&#x27;t stick for long on my oily skin These in the other hand either though they long very narrow are strong enough to hold for up to 12 hours on my eyelids and the best part is that you can&#x27;t see I have it on.</li>
            <li> These are extremely sticky and stays on all day. I wear this under my make up and it looks natural. Even when I blink you cannot see the tape. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and glues and nothing works as good as this one.</li>
            <li> This is the best pruduct I hav ever used. Much better than the single side double eye lips tape I used before</li>
            <li> This is my first time to use this product, and it is very good as what i thought. Also, it is every adhesive. When i use it, it can stick my eyelid, it is really invisible.</li>
            <li> The eyelid tape is great for those who have Missmatching eyelid curves, or have very little crease and want your eyes to look bigger, is a good product</li>
            <li> Takes time to figure it out and put it on like a pro.</li>
            <li> I just started using these a week ago and I have to say they are amazing. I was always bothered by my left eye because it doesnt have a double eyelid but my right eye does. This double sided eyelid tape did wonders for me, it is practically invisible, no one will ever notice that I even have it on. I am a lot more confident in showing my eyes because I used to have my bangs cover my left eye since I feel that my uneven eyelids are extremely noticeable. Very satisfied with the product, I hope it can actuallly help make a crease for my left eyelid:)) will definitely buy more when I run out!</li>
            <li> I had major eyelid asymmetry prior to using this product.  Although it will not fix eyelid asymmetry permanently, it can provide semi-permanent results that you will need to maintain through wearing this tape. I head about this product on Michelle Phan&#x27;s YouTube channel.  She also struggled with eyelid asymmetry.  I first thought &amp;#34;There&#x27;s no way this worked for her.  She&#x27;s a millionaire, she probably got her eyelid fixed through plastic surgery!&amp;#34; But I figured I had nothing to lose by trying this inexpensive product.  After a couple weeks of wearing it, the tape created a crease on my eyelid that resulted in a more symmetric look without having to use the tape non-stop!  I continue to maintain my results with the eyelid tape. I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, no one could ever tell I was wearing this product (I would ask!).  I would wear it under makeup to work and it held very well. I highly recommend this eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work and hard to take off.</li>
            <li> I bought this product thinking it was the brand D-Up. The packaging and wording are pretty much identical but I don&#x27;t think this is the same product as D-Up. D-Up uses medical grade tape which is why I wanted it and it is unclear if D.U.P does because I can&#x27;t find extensive info on this product.  But it would make sense that D.U.P does not use medical grade tape due to all the negative reviews stating that this product didn&#x27;t stick and for the irritation to the eyelids.</li>
            <li> i have tried different types of tapes. this one is the most useful one so far. it is thin and two side adhesive. it can make natural double eyelids above my eyes</li>
            <li> Did not work.  I tried four times to get them on correctly and never could.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years. I haven&#x27;t found anything better than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many eye-tapes and this is my favorite one. I have asian mono eyelids with no folds. I&#x27;ve been using this for two years now and have developed a fold on each eye. I only use this once in a while when the folds decrease otherwise I can usually go a few weeks without it. Love love love this. Will forever be a customer ;)</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great quality product. Definitely would repurchase!</li>
            <li> Great adhesion.  Stays put all day and does not budge until you take it off with eye makeup remover.  Highly recommend this product😊</li>
            <li> kinda easy to apply ,good product anyway</li>
            <li> It works for me to even out my right eye lid with the left one but if I want to put eye make up on, one sticky side always comes off and start to show --- still a good product but not quite for me.</li>
            <li> They were awful, too small. They did not serve the purpose I was looking to achieve. They didn&#x27;t work at all. I would not recommend this product  as an eye lid lifter.</li>
            <li> stays on the whole day for me! Barely feel it too. I touch my eyes often, but the tape will still stay on! can&#x27;t even see it too</li>
            <li> wife loves this...Jap product is good in general</li>
            <li> I bought this instead of the brands targeted for droopy eyelids. It seems this is targeted for women with mono lids, but based on reviews from other women who use it for hooded lids I decided to give them a try. I worked with them for a while and got good at applying them, but still couldn&#x27;t acheive the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Kind of hard to use and sometimes it works and sometimes It doesn&#x27;t for me.</li>
            <li> really amazing, feels so natural double eyelid looking, strongly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> not the type I want, because I can&#x27;t see detail before I order, I just try it.</li>
            <li> You deserve it! Very helpful and easy to use~</li>
            <li> I love these little things and use them almost daily.  It did take me a little while to figure out the best placement and I would advise against shimmery eye shadow when using them because it does tend to highlight them where they may otherwise appear hidden.</li>
            <li> This is definitely for a young ,wrinkle free eye. Hoped it might lift an aging,hooded lid. Terrible,scary result. Looked like my lid was melting. It did work as advertised though. Strong adhesive quality.</li>
            <li> It can stay longer than I think.  I not use it every day, but it is working. I like it.</li>
            <li> Those tapes are really wonderful. I am an Asian and it worked great for my eyes. It opened up my eyes and made my eyes look not that tired anymore as they were always looked like. I would recomend it to all ladies no matter Asians or not. The size is perfect, or you can alterate it some, also invisibility is great too. The only one thing I would suggest, you have to be careful with eye makeup - after wearing it for while, your eye liners might (! I&#x27;m saying - might) can get somewhat \\&quot;leaky\\&quot;. However, it most likely might not happened to you, maybe I&#x27;m just using bad makeup,&lt;br /&gt;So, good luck to everybody !</li>
            <li> good, very good. This is the best tape I have used. It is very convenient to bring, and it is very easy to use</li>
            <li> I got this for my friend. It&#x27;s really working and she likes it a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s did the job but wear out after 3 hrs and it start hurting.</li>
            <li> These are okay for a couple of hours. If you have oily eyelids like I do, they will not last very long. Some parts held the skin very well, but the ends didnt hold well at all making the eyelid look a bit strange. It takes a bit of practice to find the optimal spot for application. I threw them out and wont repurchase.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a way to change the crease in my eyelid so my eyes aren&#x27;t so hooded, but this wasn&#x27;t quite the fix I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I used to have unbalanced eyes were my left eye was naturally doubled lidded and my right fluctuated. I would wake up some days with beautiful natural double lids on both eyes, but whenever I slept weird or was stressed or rubbed my eyes too much or WHATEVER I might end up with a monolid on my right eye. I would complain about it to my friends but none of them would see or get it. It was really annoying to have to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I saw this product recommended by Michelle Phan in one of her youtube videos and I bought a package. It was quite a nuisance to use actually - I would always be too aware of the plastic poking into my eyelid and I couldn&#x27;t wear eye shadow with it or else the tape might lose it&#x27;s stickiness. Also, no matter how carefully I applied it, my friends would notice it and comment on it while talking to me. I ended up getting kind of self conscious whenever I wore it and thus only used it consistently at night. The tape also made my eyelid a little bit puffy so that my crease changed a little bit and made applying it in the exact same spot a little challenging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In her video, Michelle Phan said to be prepared to wear the tape consistently for months. However, I gave up and stopped wearing the tape after a while and I was pleasantly surprised to have maintained a permanent double eyelid on my right eye!&lt;br /&gt;I have slept on it, rubbed it, and down all sorts of things to it but the crease has not gone away. I&#x27;m not entirely sure if its the doing of the tape or if my natural crease just &amp;#34;came in&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m grateful for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my own experiences, this tape was a pain in the ass to use but worked. Yay!</li>
            <li> I want to use product but cant the product directions are in Chinese. What a waist of money.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> I watched videos and read some people&#x27;s blogs of how to apply it. I practiced a few times but never got the knack of it. I do feel it&#x27;s a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It was really good when you put make up on, but sometimes I feel like it is kinda &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; for the result I want.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very easy to peel the tape off from the plastic paper.&lt;br /&gt;It looks natural, once you get used to use it , it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> As others have said the instructions are not in English. I find the tape to be too long and too sticky. I really, really wanted to like this tape but it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be working for me. I might experiment with it more but I feel like I don&#x27;t have the hang of how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> I like this design. People will not see my eyelid tape anymore like when I used one-side eyelid tape.</li>
            <li> Work really good. I now live my eyes. They r even now.</li>
            <li> Not, good... DIdn&#x27;t know it was double sided...I&#x27;ve never used them.</li>
            <li> Very sticky but did not work for me, maybe because of my own problem. Overall very well product.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. It came as described.</li>
            <li> It depends what you&#x27;re using it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like, for me. My issue is just that I have one small double lid and one monolid.Therefore, this product works very well to make my monolid look just like my double lidded eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for anyone who says it doesnt work, the reason could be that they&#x27;re using it wrong and should look at a youtube tutorial OR that their eyelid is a monolid because of eyelid fat. [like, not that the person is fat but that there is too much fat near the eyelid]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product definitely works for you if you don&#x27;t have too much fat near your eyelid!</li>
            <li> i tried this other brand that amazon sold... umm talk about having to explain to strangers wtf was on my eyelids.. this D.U.P brand is very thin, strong, and DOUBLE SIDED (WHICH IS A MUST). It does a great job of glueing both skins together on ur eyelid so it really doesnt show much in public.. i feel much less self conscious wearing it to work. it is a little bit trickier to put on since it&#x27;s double sided. i find using tweezers was easier than using their funny protractor device it came with. give it a try! as far as progress on my double eyelid.... i wear the cheaper crappier ones to bed and use the D.U.P brand during the day... my lids are still not staying in by themselves but i&#x27;ve only been consistently at it for a few weeks. will update in future....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;biggest tip on applying these tapes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** get all lotion/grease off ur eyelid... i use a cotton swab and use that pore astringent stuff to get rid of excess oils.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly! It&#x27;s just you have to be careful not to put your finger when applying. Otherwise, the tape will become less sticky and effective.</li>
            <li> Great product for Asian girls. I&#x27;ve been using this tape for a few years. This is the best for me. Stay all day without weird looking.</li>
            <li> I could not get these to work for me at all.  And once you attempt to apply them, getting them off is quite a chore.</li>
            <li> This product stays on my lids all day, yes, before work, during 8 hrs of work and after work. I am Asian and have hooded eyelids. I don&#x27;t know how it works on monolids but for me, the way I make this stay on my lids and create a double eyelid is to put it just right above the folds on my lids. I&#x27;ve read some reviews that say this product did not stay or not natural or not creating a double eyelid or something, for me it is natural as long as I just want  visible double-eyelids, not like  deep set huge Western eyelids. I tried to create a bigger lids and the tape did not work as well. So I guess if you want big double eyelids, you have to buy bigger tapes. But this tape works fine as long as you want some visible double eyelids. Unlike the glue, I can apply the eyelid tape prior to makeup and it is fine with makeup on, the darker the makeup, the more it works to hide the tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that if you wear the tape religiously, you&#x27;ll have a permanent double eyelids. Well, I&#x27;ve worn this everyday (minus bed time) for a week and it does create a fold on my eyelids. If I tuck the fold in, it actually stays there for a while. So I will keep doing it for a couple weeks and will let you know if using tape will help you create a permanent lid. Keep in mind that I have hooded eyelids, not monolids, so it might work differently for you, esp girls with monolids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One small drawback of the tape is that my lids don&#x27;t get used to the tape yet, so I had some itching going on for the first couple of days. After that it is fine.</li>
            <li> nice and sticky! love it</li>
            <li> when it sounds too good to be true..........IT IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE!!!!!  Also fell off my eyelid very easily.</li>
            <li> Like the title says, wondereye eyelid tape is probably the best double eyelid tool that I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;I have hooded double eyelids which are fairly narrow, which limits the amount of space I am able to apply eyeshadow/liner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to this product is that it may be a little tricky to apply eyeshadow over it, since applying anything over the \\&quot;tape area\\&quot; may cause the tape to become undone.&lt;br /&gt;After many months of experimenting, I have noticed the following is the best routine on putting on eye makeup with this tape:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) make sure lid area is oil free (use a blotting paper to remove excess oils)&lt;br /&gt;2) position tape directly ontop of your natural crease, if you have \\&quot;hooded\\&quot; double lids&lt;br /&gt;3) shade in eyeshow with a fine brush WITH EYES OPEN (this will prevent the shadow powder from unsticking the tape&lt;br /&gt;4) apply eye liner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of the best products for creating natural, beautiful eye creases out there!!!!&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
            <li> My eyelids got really irritated and itchy when using the tape. First I thought I just didn&#x27;t apply them right. Then I tried 2nd pairs, 3rd pairs and even the 4th, they all made my eyelids itchy and a bit swollen. Also the double-sided glue makes my eyelid sticky and eye shadow looked weird. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product. You can&#x27;t return it once you buy it!</li>
            <li> Very natural it&#x27;s very easy to put on your eyes and it sticks on all day !! I will purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Its a little tricky to use at first, but once you get the hang of it, it truly is pretty seamless. I used it to cure my mismatched eyelids and its only been about a month and a half and i already have no need to use them! Use overnight and during your daily activities is a must for this to happen though. Sounds grueling, but worth it. I would recommend this strength of stickiness also for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Stays on most of the day and hardly noticeable with makeup</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews but this product deserves one from me. I owe it to these stickers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an asian with monolids I&#x27;ve tried just about every tape and brand I can get my hands on, and after a couple of years of searching, have settled on this very awesome product. I&#x27;ve been using this tape for YEARS, which gets to be tortuous on the wallet considering I run through one pack every 1-2 months but I have no other choice. Nothing works nearly as well as this ultra-sticky double-sided tape. Unlike every other tape, once you get the hang of it, you can use any sort of makeup over it and it will barely show. Though I prefer making a subtle, low crease with little makeup for a natural, I-totally-have-big-eyes-for-an-asian look. Yes, it&#x27;s all a lie, but I&#x27;m addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Extended use, like any other eyelid sticker (*apparently*), also means there&#x27;s a chance of your eyelid being trained to retain the crease even after you take the stickers off. I&#x27;ve heard some stories of peoples creases becoming permanent after years of use. While that hasn&#x27;t happened to me completely, there are days I don&#x27;t need to use these and still have creases. That&#x27;s never happened to me after using other brands/types of stickers, but it might be a personal thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can totally understand it if this product doesn&#x27;t work for everyone, and if some might actually prefer one-sided stickers (though i find them to be soooo obvious within 2 feet of the person&#x27;s face) or glue (messy messy) because they work better for different eyes, but as a Chinese person with tight, fatty monolids, (god, what an unappealing way to describe myself) these were the answer for me.</li>
            <li> This tape is very helpful. I was afraid that it would show when worn but it is reality hardly noticeable at all. It looks completely natural and is slowly improving my eyelids. The new crease is beginning to stay on its own and it is really giving me the look that I&#x27;ve always desired. It does take some practice at first so be prepared to waste a few because I did. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just got it today and tried it right away. It works! I&#x27;m a Caucasian and I have hooded eyes. Both my parents have hooded eyes. My eyes looked fine when I was younger cause I still had a little bit of upper eyelid showing. So, I could put make up and enhance my eyes with it. But over the last 5 years as I approached 30, I noticed that the hood  above my upper eyelid sagged very quickly and noticeably. So that it started resting on my eyelashes. It changed the shape of my eyes, made them look smaller, tired and the make up didn&#x27;t help any more. I was getting frustrated and was considering Botox, which is a toxin... omg, I didn&#x27;t want to do it. I started cutting thin scotch tape stripes and use them to lift my hood. It worked fine but I couldn&#x27;t use it with the makeup because it would become noticeable. So, these strips work kind of like an eye lift surgery. They tuck away extra skin into the crease, the skin from the hood and the eyelid stick together and create a new crease. Now, I can put makeup over the new crease. I love them!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me and you like a more natural eyelid look, don&#x27;t get double sided tape. It&#x27;s terrible because you can&#x27;t close your eyes properly. I gave up on these and when I got a professional makeup artist, she had single sided taped that worked beautifully all day long.</li>
            <li> I do like it and definitely made a difference in my uneven lids!  The only gripe I have is that I am noticing that it doesn&#x27;t hide as well and will come loose quicker than I would like.  Maybe it&#x27;s my makeup primer!  Today specifically, my friend noticed something wasn&#x27;t quite right and told me to close my eyes... of course I said no and he said &amp;#34;there is something gold(?) on your eye, but it&#x27;s gone now&amp;#34; LOL If he only knew I had taped lids.  Hehe :-P</li>
            <li> Just what I expected! Great packaging and great item</li>
            <li> This is not a use full product for every one. Better to try some cream , as using it is difficult.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T waste your money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t use this to create a double lid like intended. I am caucasion and have one drooping lid, I used this to lift that lid and it WORKED - the first time! It does need a little playing with where to place it, but it lifted the lid up, and was virtually invisible. I just ordered more because I plan to use them whenever I go out.</li>
            <li> Really confusing to use.</li>
            <li> Too difficult to apply</li>
            <li> I like the idea of these, but for practical reasons it&#x27;s not easy to use. I couldn&#x27;t get the hang of how to apply it and it just felt unnatural. I have natural double lid creases that sometimes change so this idea helped to keep them and or to help even out when my eyelids were uneven. I just did not like how unnatural it felt to have it on and having to be constantly paranoid that someone might see the tape when I looked down so I&#x27;m going au naturel. And it feels fantastic. Just love with what you were born with and life will be much easier.</li>
            <li> People can tell when I wear them.  So now I&#x27;m only wearing them at home.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few kinds of eyelid tapes/glue but most of them have many drawbacks. They are either difficult to apply ,difficult to remove, do not stay long, or look really obvious and fake. However, this product is nearly perfect!They look super natural on my lids, and I can hardly feel it. The application might seem a little complicated at first, but once you try you will realize how easy it is. The only drawback is the price.This is too expensive, but before I find anything can compare with its great effect, I will stay with it.</li>
            <li> This product came as the delivery said it would. I was pleased to get this double sided tape. When I put it on, it has no side affects and is very hard to tell it is even there. It helps get a double eyelid but it also helps makes your eyes bigger in general! Also it&#x27;s a plus that it is made in Japan and not China.</li>
            <li> So far, this is fine, however, I hope they make the tapes 50% wider.</li>
            <li> Although it is a little expensive, but works really well for asian people. I hope it could be a little more sticky.</li>
            <li> long lasting, love it!</li>
            <li> I have uneven eyelid.  I used this product to correct my left side eyelid so that it matches with my right side eyelid.  I&#x27;ve heard that I need to keep using this product at least 22 hours a day for consecutive 3 months to correct my eyelid.  I&#x27;ve already started using it and hopefully in 3 months time will see the good result.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know anything like this was out there for us &amp;#34;no eyelid crease&amp;#34; asians.  It works, but you need a steady hand to apply. Takes some practice.</li>
            <li> I got them and i was ECSTATIC. Though it took 20 or so pieces to actually get it ON for me and EVEN, it was great. The only problem is 1. It made my eyelids itch because of the shape of the tape and 2. because of the way it created DROOPY eyelids later. UGHHHH overall it did make my eyelids doubled, but the inner corners are slightly droopy now...</li>
            <li> Maybe my skin is just too oily. These did not stick to me for more than 5 minutes. I even used alcohol to clean the skin prior to use.</li>
            <li> The problem is that the directions that came with it are in Chinese, I think.  I have to try to figure out how to use this without directions.</li>
            <li> This is the first eyelid tape i&#x27;d bought and it definitely works on my eyes. It takes a bit of practice to position the tape right but these will hold for an entire day (or 2 if i&#x27;m lazy haha) and i have oily skin too! :)</li>
