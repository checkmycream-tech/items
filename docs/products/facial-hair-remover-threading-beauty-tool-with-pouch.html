            <li>This product works great.</li>
            <li>works great.</li>
            <li>we shall see... over all, $5 bucks won&#x27;t break the bank, and the seller was great.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This was a great alternative to waxing</li>
            <li>I LOVE this thing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never waxed, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this was very effective</li>
            <li>I think the product seems good, well made.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing ..</li>
            <li>After having it for a couple months, I honestly don&#x27;t use it often though as it gets to be tiring.</li>
            <li>Affordable and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>first of all the price is great, so theres no harm in trying this product</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty great.</li>
            <li>I would say it works best on the upper lip.</li>
            <li>Over all, it is an ok product and the description does match the product.  </li>
            <li>ok.  </li>
            <li>I say its worth the try and good to have.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing.</li>
            <li>pieces - rubber would better</li>
            <li>This hurts like hell till you get used to it, it is so much faster then tweezers, definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li>I just am not so sure about holding this spring.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never had more ease than with this tool.</li>
            <li>Can be challenging.</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend this product, works great and very cheap!</li>
            <li>the price it is worth trying it, for I was very satisfied with it, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>its not bad!  </li>
            <li>just read the directions and was so easy to use.</li>
            <li>This was easy to use.</li>
            <li>With both ends off turn it up to the light</li>
            <li>IMPORTANT * How to clean?</li>
            <li>Very good adaptation, is necessary only will get skilled at.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing to tell more, it works.</li>
            <li>I noticed it works best when I hold one end, and twist the other before touching it to my face to snag the hairs because it gets better grip and pulls the harder to grab hairs way more efficiently.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about this product.</li>
            <li>pros: easy to clean (the ends screw off) and hasn&#x27;t rusted at all after 4-5 months of consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you are looking for something for your full face, id suggest investing in a epilator.</li>
            <li>I was originally going to buy the more expensive version but after reading all the wonderful reviews I decided to go with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A good tip is to bend (no twist) and hit on side of table or any flat surface.</li>
            <li>but once you get the hang of it its pretty neat!   </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li>... ideal for only your upper lip&lt;</li>
            <li>Great quality, not easy to use</li>
            <li>Problem is, I have no idea how to use this thing right.  </li>
            <li>For just a small area it is great.</li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s a really great product for a low price.</li>
            <li>Good little tool.</li>
            <li>I did practiced for a while to do better, but it does not pull out the hair I want, it pulls out only baby hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s basically a small spring that grabs the hair, comes with NO instructions, so you&#x27;re up to your own devices to figure out how it works!  </li>
            <li>but it works so much better for getting facial hair than any of the waxing or creams I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>I watched some YouTube videos to see how it worked, and was interested in trying.</li>
            <li>i bought it on a whim because i thought it looked cool, but now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved this facial hair remover product it works without giving any rashes on my facial skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast to use, has good results on different types of facial hair and was inexpensive to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across a review for this type of product on a beauty website (a mass marketed version called spring-it) and decided to order one from Amazon, just to try it out.</li>
            <li>It does, however, take a while if you plan to do large areas.</li>
            <li>, you can certainly see them in a 10x mirror.</li>
            <li>Cleaning and maintainability is very easy as well, just tap the spring to knock out any hair and wipe it down with rubbing alcohol to sterilize</li>
            <li>product is really a \\&quot;you get what you pay</li>
            <li>have really light fuzz on my cheeks and upper lip hair.</li>
            <li>Just go over the whole area and it will get everything.</li>
            <li>But I have to say once I realize how to work it, it really cleans the hair off my chin and lip without any pulling like with a tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It really is just a spring with handles</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>And since its a spring, its super easy to fold in half and throw in your bag or in a drawer.</li>
            <li>Other brands are better.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get this in the mail as someone who has unsightly and bothersome facial hair.</li>
            <li>The first few swipes hurt the most, but then it didn&#x27;t really bother me and I was able to finish in less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>I shelled out 2 bucks and was pretty surprised,   </li>
            <li>This is so much better than the waxing strips and creams I&#x27;ve tried that have left me red and peeling around my lips.</li>
            <li>It can sting for a moment when you rip out a hair but the sensation is just a mild sting and it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Glad I stumbled on this little gem.</li>
            <li>Product arrived early and brand new...</li>
            <li>often or pain occurs when multiple large hairs are plucked at once.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that you can&#x27;t really aim it for a specific area.  </li>
            <li>This came in the mail and it was rusted when I received it, I did not like the fact that it looked so old too,</li>
            <li>does not get all hair - space too far apart in wire - and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a problem with hair since I was young.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t see how it could function any differently.</li>
            <li>so far no luck??</li>
            <li>That being said and given the fact that it&#x27;s only $5, I really recommend you try it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s effective on thin, blond hairs as well as thicker hair.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long to learn how to use and by watching the video reviews of some of the other users by the time I received it (which was very quick)</li>
            <li>It took a little while to get the hang of it, but once I did, I was removing several fine hairs</li>
            <li>trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair plucking with Springs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than blades in the long run&lt;br /&gt;Lasts much longer (it will be lost before it breaks)&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>Once satisfied disinfect it with alcohol , allow to dry, after totally dry place in black sleeve.</li>
            <li>At first, it was a little hard to coordinate the twisting and the rolling, but you get the hang of it pretty fast.</li>
            <li>It hurts a little at first, but you get used to it</li>
            <li>I tried this on my upper lip, and on the tip of a YouTube video, I put an ice pack on the area for a few minutes first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It takes a little getting used to, but it really does the job when it comes to facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>too bad pain wise.</li>

            <li> too bad pain wise.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first but the results are fantastic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no real prep work needed and after use the skin above my upper lip is red just briefly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and everything I&#x27;ve tried to get rid of the little hairs around my lips and on my chin have caused rashes, redness and peeling.</li>
            <li> It is EXTREMELY painful to use on the upper-lip area and isn&#x27;t able to completely remove all the hair</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t done it long enough to see how long the hair stays away, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath, as a matter of fact</li>
            <li> Easier than actual threading as the thread cut into my fingers and was harder to do.</li>
            <li> It is a pity that it is not necessary for eyebrows, stir eyelashes.</li>
            <li> it only took a couple of tries to use.</li>
            <li> It takes some practice and sometimes it&#x27;s tough to get the right angle</li>
            <li> I got really excited, but unfortunately it was not what I expected, it actually does nothing.</li>
            <li> It does not hurt anymore than plucking, just remember to make the skin as tight as possible to ease use.</li>
            <li> It has also worked well on even short length hair removal; no more waiting until it&#x27;s noticeably long before I can wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got like 2 or 3 hairs out per round and kept having to go over the same spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you have heavy duty facial hair like me this just wont cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would waste tons of time plucking individual hairs with tweezers, or use nair and risk burning myself instead.</li>
            <li> hurt a bit, but thats expected</li>
            <li> This was a cheaper version of the Bellabe, which I found browsing the Health and Beauty section, and became curious about.</li>
            <li> Rather than spending $7 every few weeks to get my upper lip threaded or waxed, I can just pull out this little gizmo whenever I see a single hair!</li>
            <li> I got this facial hair remover as an alternative to bleaching my facial hair, which was getting somewhat tiresome.</li>
            <li> Was pretty skeptical about this thing but guess what?!</li>
            <li> I was tired of walking around with a red face for two days after waxing so</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money with this product.</li>
            <li> it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I have a few hairs there that bother me, though they are probably invisible to everyone else</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little painful at first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly been less painful than chapped skin from hair removal creams or burnt skin from waxing.</li>
            <li> Painful at first though.</li>
            <li> Pulls out very little hair at a time&lt;br /</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY happy with my purchase. In just a couple of seconds all the hair was gone. I did not use anything on my face just read the directions and was so easy to use. Wish all things could work as well and be low cost as this was. It does not hurt anymore than plucking, just remember to make the skin as tight as possible to ease use. The item should last a lifetime. Easier than actual threading as the thread cut into my fingers and was harder to do.</li>
            <li> Great quality, not easy to use</li>
            <li> I was so excited about this product. I was originally going to buy the more expensive version but after reading all the wonderful reviews I decided to go with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is really a \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, It does grab hairs BUT it doesn&#x27;t necessarily pull them all out. I got like 2 or 3 hairs out per round and kept having to go over the same spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is nearly impossible to grab the hairs under my chin. I would say it works best on the upper lip. If thats your only issue then this is for you but if you have heavy duty facial hair like me this just wont cut it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  Excellent shipping time&lt;br /&gt;  Cheap&lt;br /&gt;  Gets rid of all upper lip hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  Sucks on jaw&lt;br /&gt;  Pulls out very little hair at a time&lt;br /&gt;  Misses hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So yea. I will be purchasing the REM one to see the difference. :/</li>
            <li> Very good adaptation, is necessary only will get skilled at.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing to tell more, it works. It is a pity that it is not necessary for eyebrows, stir eyelashes.</li>
            <li> thankful I only wasted about 4 bucks for this worthless item. don&#x27;t know why I even thought it would work!! brain fart I guess!</li>
            <li> Other brands are better.</li>
            <li> This was easy to use. I bought this because I got tired of waxing. Painful at first though. Overall it&#x27;s a really great product for a low price.</li>
            <li> Product arrived early and brand new...you can definitely feel it working and the pain isn&#x27;t as bad as I thought but it takes a lot of patience to remove everything you want.  It works, but I don&#x27;t like the fact that you can&#x27;t really aim it for a specific area.  Over all, it is an ok product and the description does match the product.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t beat a wax or shave but works ok.  DO NOT expect real threading results because you WILL be disappointed.</li>
            <li> amazing!! i bought it on a whim because i thought it looked cool, but now I can&#x27;t live without it.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a little getting used to, but it really does the job when it comes to facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have really light fuzz on my cheeks and upper lip hair. It hurts a little at first, but you get used to it and it&#x27;s definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Other pros: easy to clean (the ends screw off) and hasn&#x27;t rusted at all after 4-5 months of consistent use.&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my boyfriend and it plucked even the thickets hairs out!</li>
            <li> Was pretty skeptical about this thing but guess what?! its not bad!  I was tired of walking around with a red face for two days after waxing so I shelled out 2 bucks and was pretty surprised,   Yes, its painful and takes a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it its pretty neat!   Gave it 5 cause I had the more expensive ones and this is identical.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this in the mail as someone who has unsightly and bothersome facial hair. It didn&#x27;t take long to learn how to use and by watching the video reviews of some of the other users by the time I received it (which was very quick) it only took a couple of tries to use. I noticed it works best when I hold one end, and twist the other before touching it to my face to snag the hairs because it gets better grip and pulls the harder to grab hairs way more efficiently. It does, however, take a while if you plan to do large areas. For just a small area it is great. And since its a spring, its super easy to fold in half and throw in your bag or in a drawer. After having it for a couple months, I honestly don&#x27;t use it often though as it gets to be tiring. And in terms of pain, if you are used to plucking hairs, its nothing worse than that. And nothing to flinch at! I say its worth the try and good to have.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than the waxing strips and creams I&#x27;ve tried that have left me red and peeling around my lips. I have very sensitive skin and everything I&#x27;ve tried to get rid of the little hairs around my lips and on my chin have caused rashes, redness and peeling. This is a great product. Affordable and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Good little tool. It does work without even having to see what you are doing. No trying to squint in the mirror to find errand hairs. Just go over the whole area and it will get everything. Inexpensive and appears that it is well made and will last. No chemical removers needed and is only as uncomfortable as tweezing. I do it in multiple sessions as it does remove a lot at a time and can be uncomfortable but tweezing takes a long time and is just as uncomfortable. Glad I stumbled on this little gem.</li>
            <li> This came in the mail and it was rusted when I received it, I did not like the fact that it looked so old too, I mean I just ordered it!</li>
            <li> IMPORTANT * How to clean? The ends are removable. I use alcohol to disinfect. With both ends off turn it up to the light see if any hair particles are inside. I use a nail cleaning brush to brush out all the hair. A good tip is to bend (no twist) and hit on side of table or any flat surface. Loosen any stuck hairs. Once satisfied disinfect it with alcohol , allow to dry, after totally dry place in black sleeve.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or your money with this product. Just move on to something else because its junk, a waste of your hard earned money.</li>
            <li> This threading tool works, but it does hurt.  It gets easier to use after some practice and a little less painful.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt any more than tweezing.</li>
            <li> does not get all hair - space too far apart in wire - and worse part is: slippery end pieces - rubber would better</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a problem with hair since I was young. Thankfully, nothing extreme but enough to be annoying. I would waste tons of time plucking individual hairs with tweezers, or use nair and risk burning myself instead. I LOVE this thing!! It took a little while to get the hang of it, but once I did, I was removing several fine hairs I couldn&#x27;t even see at a time! Awesome!</li>
            <li> This product works great. It&#x27;s a little painful at first but you get used to it (same with plucking). I haven&#x27;t tried the \\&quot;name brand\\&quot; alternative but I really can&#x27;t see how it could function any differently. It&#x27;s a basic concept, spring with handles....works great.</li>
            <li> When I watched tutorials abut it I got really excited, but unfortunately it was not what I expected, it actually does nothing. I did practiced for a while to do better, but it does not pull out the hair I want, it pulls out only baby hair</li>
            <li> This product i thought would work but it does not work pulling the facial hair. it was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> first of all the price is great, so theres no harm in trying this product&lt;br /&gt;it works well... ideal for only your upper lip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does sting/hurt a bit, but thats expected&lt;br /&gt;overall i like the product, it works, its cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for something for your full face, id suggest investing in a epilator.</li>
            <li> This hurts like hell till you get used to it, it is so much faster then tweezers, definitely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I got this facial hair remover as an alternative to bleaching my facial hair, which was getting somewhat tiresome. It is EXTREMELY painful to use on the upper-lip area and isn&#x27;t able to completely remove all the hair you want it to. It works, so to speak, but is so painful that I am now searching for an alternative method of hair removal.</li>
            <li> I have too say, once I got it I didn&#x27;t know how too use it, for there are no instructions with it, and I never seen anything like this before. But I have to say once I realize how to work it, it really cleans the hair off my chin and lip without any pulling like with a tweezer.&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is worth trying it, for I was very satisfied with it, and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a small spring that grabs the hair, comes with NO instructions, so you&#x27;re up to your own devices to figure out how it works!  It can hurt and does at times.  Haven&#x27;t done it long enough to see how long the hair stays away, but I&#x27;m not holding my breath, as a matter of fact, I hope I don&#x27;t get any ingrown hair!!  YIKES!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast to use, has good results on different types of facial hair and was inexpensive to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled across a review for this type of product on a beauty website (a mass marketed version called spring-it) and decided to order one from Amazon, just to try it out. This thing is pretty great. It really is just a spring with handles but it works so much better for getting facial hair than any of the waxing or creams I&#x27;ve tried before. It&#x27;s effective on thin, blond hairs as well as thicker hair. It has also worked well on even short length hair removal; no more waiting until it&#x27;s noticeably long before I can wax!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no real prep work needed and after use the skin above my upper lip is red just briefly. I have had to watch for any pore clogging that can come up the next day. Cleaning and maintainability is very easy as well, just tap the spring to knock out any hair and wipe it down with rubbing alcohol to sterilize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t find it to be too bad pain wise. It can sting for a moment when you rip out a hair but the sensation is just a mild sting and it doesn&#x27;t last. It&#x27;s certainly been less painful than chapped skin from hair removal creams or burnt skin from waxing.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and as described.  Problem is, I have no idea how to use this thing right.  I tweeze, I shave, I wax, I epilate.  I just am not so sure about holding this spring.  It&#x27;s basically a spring with a holder on each end. I think the product seems good, well made.  I&#x27;m hoping once I get the hang of this thing it can take care of stray eyebrows between waxing.  hmmm.....we shall see... over all, $5 bucks won&#x27;t break the bank, and the seller was great. I gave it 4 stars for the quality and for dealing with the seller.  It would probably be 5 once I figure out how to use it.</li>
            <li> I got this product today and i had watched some tutorials on youtube on how to use it. so far no luck?? Can anyone help me??</li>
            <li> This was a cheaper version of the Bellabe, which I found browsing the Health and Beauty section, and became curious about. I watched some YouTube videos to see how it worked, and was interested in trying. This came well-packaged and the pouch is an added bonus.&lt;br /&gt;You can tell this is working when you feel the hair being ripped out. I tried this on my upper lip, and on the tip of a YouTube video, I put an ice pack on the area for a few minutes first. I have a few hairs there that bother me, though they are probably invisible to everyone else, you can certainly see them in a 10x mirror. At first, it was a little hard to coordinate the twisting and the rolling, but you get the hang of it pretty fast. The first few swipes hurt the most, but then it didn&#x27;t really bother me and I was able to finish in less than 3 minutes. I&#x27;ve never waxed, so I can&#x27;t compare, but this was very effective and I&#x27;m happy with my purchase. I&#x27;ve used Nair before, but it left a chemical burn, and tweezers just don&#x27;t ever get it all. This was a great alternative to waxing and I&#x27;ll definitely use again.</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first but the results are fantastic! It takes some practice and sometimes it&#x27;s tough to get the right angle but I&#x27;ve never had more ease than with this tool. That being said and given the fact that it&#x27;s only $5, I really recommend you try it.</li>
            <li> I began to regret my years of shaving with razor blades after i discovered spring hair trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair plucking with Springs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Much cheaper than blades in the long run&lt;br /&gt;Lasts much longer (it will be lost before it breaks)&lt;br /&gt;Does not break the skin or leave razor burns&lt;br /&gt;Does not hurt if used daily.&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels smoother&lt;br /&gt;Added benefits of plucking(hair takes longer to grow back)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Hard to learn&lt;br /&gt;First use can be very painful and leaves spotty marks&lt;br /&gt;Use often or pain occurs when multiple large hairs are plucked at once.&lt;br /&gt;Facial Hair follicles grow in every direction. Can be challenging.</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend this product, works great and very cheap! Rather than spending $7 every few weeks to get my upper lip threaded or waxed, I can just pull out this little gizmo whenever I see a single hair! Love it!</li>
            <li> I loved this facial hair remover product it works without giving any rashes on my facial skin. they definitely meet the expectation</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this product at all..  I tried using it and it doesn&#x27;t work.. It won&#x27;t remove any  hair at all..</li>
            <li> Amazing .. I had been using this item since 2 years. I nevr felt a need to spend money at parlour for these small things. Works really well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I tried it above lip and on chin.</li>
