            <li>Great scent for Christmas time.  </li>
            <li>It works well and has a great scent.  </li>
            <li>If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you!</li>
            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>Smells wonderful and as always shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li>They are the company I order most of my oils from!</li>
            <li>I love fir!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more, and the price was good.</li>
            <li>Kid safe and smells good</li>
            <li>This was a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Scent is excellent and of obviously high quality.</li>
            <li>My wife bought this to put in candles, where it seems to fill the room with a pleasant light aroma....</li>
            <li>Great oils at a very reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>I love doing business with this company.</li>
            <li>I wish I had purchased more than one.</li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed this Fir Needle scent.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve still enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>Lovely smell.</li>
            <li>I think it would be better blended with another scent.</li>
            <li>Came very quickly and was well protected.</li>
            <li>strong scent , opens sinus passages</li>
            <li>We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>They were fairly accurate in terms of their scent.   </li>
            <li>I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t quite fit that bill</li>
            <li>Love and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li>And the delivery is very fast!</li>
            <li>Edens Garden always has great service, and I will definitely be ordering more of their oils in the future.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with all my edens garden essential oils</li>
            <li>not fake at all!</li>
            <li>It really clears passages quickly!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot of fun.</li>
            <li>It does remind me of walking through a forest after a fresh rain.</li>
            <li>It smells like Christmas to me on its own but mixed with some of the citrus oils in a diffuser it smells like a citrus grove.</li>
            <li>and they also sent a lovely catalog of other interesting items and ideas.  </li>
            <li>I am practicing now mixing it with Balsam, and Pine scents, hoping to find just the right combination.</li>
            <li>Right off the tree.  </li>
            <li>I bought it right before Christmas hoping it would give off the scent of a Christmas tree.</li>
            <li>That said, you can buy a \\&quot;host\\&quot; oil for some essential oils used directly on the skin (grapeseed oil is good).  </li>
            <li>Sometimes I get mail order oils that are old and the smell is off, but this one was just fine.  </li>
            <li>I love all the essential oils I have gotten from Edens Garden.</li>
            <li>product received exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>This product is exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>It smells extremely close to Pine, though more crisp.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>The for needle worked very well for why I needed.</li>
            <li>Fast service</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  </li>
            <li>It is potent, and a few drops will make a large room smell like a conifer forest.</li>
            <li>Made my house smell like the holidays and live Christmas trees!</li>
            <li>I live in a very \\&quot;sinusy\\&quot; valley and allergies</li>
            <li>Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers.</li>
            <li>High quality Fir Needle.</li>
            <li>I have yet to find anything that entirely replicates a real Christmas tree scent, but this is pretty darned close.</li>
            <li>Products packaged well in small, glass bottles (This is VERY important.  </li>
            <li>This helps to relieve sinus pressure, helps to clear lungs and opens nasal passages!  </li>
            <li>Instead of Fir Needle Essential Oil 100% pure</li>
            <li>done Pihtovoe Maslo without marked date of expiration.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you can definitely smell the chemicals under the Pine Needle aroma if you use too much.</li>
            <li>Careful not to use too much essential oil directly on the skin unless you are familiar with its properties and how to use it.  </li>

            <li> ; is the name of the perfume scent, it&#x27;s not the scent of real Fir Needles, I was disappointed, I wanted the smell of Fir Needles in the house for Christmas, but this smells more like bathroom deoderizer</li>
            <li> It has a strong scent so a few drops are needed (at least in my 30ml beard oil batches).</li>
            <li> From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden.</li>
            <li> Effectiveness is not high.  </li>
            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living.</li>
            <li> I will use this over Pine in the future, however it seems redundant to order them both.</li>
            <li> Worked as expected.</li>
            <li> so I decided to put some on the floor of my truck as it smells of wet dog when wet.</li>
            <li> If the peppermint oil worked so well, what might other oils do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it was as expected, shipping was prompt!</li>
            <li> My only complaint was that it was not a very strong scent.</li>
            <li> Lifts your spirits, eases tension for just a few bucks!</li>
            <li> Not a potent as the Spruce oil scent alone.</li>
            <li> I use everyday or at night before going to bed!!</li>
            <li> This one smells terrible, definitely will be trying the spruce or pine next time!</li>
            <li> We have yet to find one that smells like  freshly broken needles from an evergreen, but still the smell does remind us of the tree itself.</li>
            <li> There was nothing wrong with what they advertised, I just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> Anyway - didnt work and just made the truck smell bad -</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> strong scent , opens sinus passages</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful and as always shipping is very fast.</li>
            <li> The fir needle oil and all of Edens Garden products are great.  They have high quality products at a reasonable price and this one is no exception.  I love doing business with this company.</li>
            <li> Love and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I ordered 10 essential oils from Edens Garden, having been given the gift of Peppermint Essential Oil from Edens Garden for use in migraine suppression.  If the peppermint oil worked so well, what might other oils do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the service was speedy.  Products packaged well in small, glass bottles (This is VERY important.  Purity of essential oils can be diminished by plastic or aluminum containers.), and well padded for shipping.  One of the oils I ordered was &#x27;Fir Needle&#x27; for sinus congestion.  I live in a very \\&quot;sinusy\\&quot; valley and allergies are a problem.  I place a drop or two of the oil on my fingertip and hold the fingertip to my nostril, inhaling deeply.  It really clears passages quickly!  You may even touch a drop--literally--to your sinuses at both sides of the bridge of the nose.  Careful not to use too much essential oil directly on the skin unless you are familiar with its properties and how to use it.  That said, you can buy a \\&quot;host\\&quot; oil for some essential oils used directly on the skin (grapeseed oil is good).  I also bought oils to try for the inflammation of arthritis and various muscle aches.</li>
            <li> Smells just like a fir tree to me. I have yet to find anything that entirely replicates a real Christmas tree scent, but this is pretty darned close. I am practicing now mixing it with Balsam, and Pine scents, hoping to find just the right combination. It&#x27;s a lot of fun. Would recommend this item--it smells great.</li>
            <li> I use these oils in my diffuser and wanted something festive for the holidays.  This one smells terrible, definitely will be trying the spruce or pine next time!</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Fir Needle&amp;#34; is the name of the perfume scent, it&#x27;s not the scent of real Fir Needles, I was disappointed, I wanted the smell of Fir Needles in the house for Christmas, but this smells more like bathroom deoderizer</li>

            <li> These oils by Eden&#x27;s Garden are not the least bit inferior to doTerra, Melaleuca, or Young Living. I say this because for most essential oil users, quality and purity is a concern, and many are under the impression that you can only get the best by joining an MLM. Many of the praises for Eden’s Garden come from current and / or former DT, Melaleuca, and YL customers. We have also used virtually every MLM essential oil brand known to man, and this is right up there with the best of them in quality and purity, at a fraction of the price. The reason it is a fraction of the price is because it does not have about 3 to 5 levels of compensations for its representatives built into the margins, which drastically reduces the overhead. That is why many former MLM essential oil distributors who still want to use a great product yet can’t afford the network marketing prices and aren’t making any money with them have tried and like Eden’s Garden. From my experience, and countless other essential oil enthusiasts who have also used doTerra, YL, and Melaleuca, there is no difference in quality, purity or smell with Eden’s Garden. If you are one of the 1 - 5% making great money with an MLM, more power to you! But for everyone else, this oil matches up well with the best of them.</li>
            <li> I love all the essential oils I have gotten from Edens Garden. They are the company I order most of my oils from! And the delivery is very fast!</li>
            <li> Great oils at a very reasonable priced. Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Great aroma!  Right off the tree.  I wish I had purchased more than one.</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed this Fir Needle scent. I bought it right before Christmas hoping it would give off the scent of a Christmas tree. It didn&#x27;t quite fit that bill but I&#x27;ve still enjoyed it. It does remind me of walking through a forest after a fresh rain. It&#x27;s a nice pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Instead of Fir Needle Essential Oil 100% pure I&#x27;ve received Russian done Pihtovoe Maslo without marked date of expiration.&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to business of sending back and forth, so I started using it.  Effectiveness is not high.  So, it has only two stars in my opinion.</li>
            <li> product received exactly as advertised. Smell is perfect (also as advertised) Would recommend purchasing for basic burning diffuser or even as a air freshener mister for around the house.</li>
            <li> This is Awesome stuff. I really like this stuff I will be ordering more, and the price was good. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Kid safe and smells good</li>
            <li> This stuff smells awesome. It has a strong scent so a few drops are needed (at least in my 30ml beard oil batches).</li>
            <li> Smells like a forest.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like a Christmas tree at all.</li>
            <li> when added  to carrier oil / liquid soap ....smells Great!!</li>
            <li> Smells like a cab driver.  Not a Christmas tree.</li>
            <li> I love fir! It smells like Christmas to me on its own but mixed with some of the citrus oils in a diffuser it smells like a citrus grove. Love this!</li>
            <li> Another great product from Edens Garden. This product is exactly what it says. Edens Garden always has great service, and I will definitely be ordering more of their oils in the future.</li>
            <li> My wife bought this to put in candles, where it seems to fill the room with a pleasant light aroma....so I decided to put some on the floor of my truck as it smells of wet dog when wet. Anyway - didnt work and just made the truck smell bad - you can definitely smell the chemicals under the Pine Needle aroma if you use too much. Not the end of the world.</li>
            <li> great manly smell of outdoors, would buy again</li>
            <li> Lovely smell. Fast service.</li>
            <li> We bought the Fir Needle, Spruce and Pine from Edens Garden. They were fairly accurate in terms of their scent.   We have yet to find one that smells like  freshly broken needles from an evergreen, but still the smell does remind us of the tree itself.</li>
            <li> Christmas in a tiny bottle!  Lifts your spirits, eases tension for just a few bucks!</li>
            <li> The for needle worked very well for why I needed. Very pleased with all my edens garden essential oils</li>
            <li> This was a nice scent. I used it combined with Spruce oil. My only complaint was that it was not a very strong scent. I was hoping to get pine scent through our apartment, but it seemed to stay in a 5ft. bubble around the burner.</li>
            <li> Great scent for Christmas time.  Fast service and they also sent a lovely catalog of other interesting items and ideas.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Smells just like a pine forest.</li>
            <li> High quality Fir Needle. I recommend</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care for the smell of this one.  There was nothing wrong with what they advertised, I just didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> This helps to relieve sinus pressure, helps to clear lungs and opens nasal passages!  This is used with a carrier oil and rubbed on the chest!  It works well and has a great scent.  I use everyday or at night before going to bed!!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil!</li>
            <li> Not a scent I was expecting. It does work well in my burner. I think it would be better blended with another scent.</li>
            <li> Kinda smells like a combination of White Pine and Spruce mixed together. It is potent, and a few drops will make a large room smell like a conifer forest. Not a potent as the Spruce oil scent alone.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my stuffy nose</li>
            <li> smells great! not fake at all!</li>
            <li> Sometimes I get mail order oils that are old and the smell is off, but this one was just fine.  I use oil in my bathwater and this was blended with spruce and rosemary.</li>
            <li> I hoped this would smell like a Christmaa tree. It doesnt, but definately is a pine scent.</li>
            <li> Love it! I use it in a pain capsule.</li>
            <li> Came very quickly and was well protected. The packaging was a bit difficult to get into but it kept the bottle safe. Scent is excellent and of obviously high quality. Part of my hunting cover scent and I think the deer did not smell me.</li>
            <li> it was as expected, shipping was prompt!</li>
            <li> Edens products are very good</li>
