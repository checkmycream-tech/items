            <li>Nice design but</li>
            <li>This is an outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>The construction is quite ingenious; you remove the brush, reverse the handle and screw the brush onto the handle.  </li>
            <li>My money could have been put to better use.</li>
            <li>Also, as I use it more and more bristles seem to come out.  </li>
            <li>I love the design and the construction of the metal portions.</li>
            <li>I would have to say that for the price is delivers a lot more than was promised.  </li>
            <li>It even seems fairly sturdy with a nice weight and a decent quality feel.  </li>
            <li>Super light weight perfect for travel and fast drying.</li>
            <li>Great item - highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t come out of its container easily either.  </li>
            <li>As a travel brush it is compact, hefty, well manufactured and easy to use and store.  </li>
            <li>On first appearance, it seems well made and looks nice.  </li>
            <li>The heft is also quite comfortable when using the brush.</li>
            <li>After about 8 months of light use (maybe 15 to 20 shaves)</li>
            <li>A little bit softer brissles than a boars brush but very good quality and feel.</li>
            <li>Really nice feel and classy look.</li>
            <li>I swa this item and it looked wonderful from the review, needless to say it far, far from wonderful.  </li>
            <li>I have owned this brush for a year now, so I feel I can give it an adequate review.  ...</li>
            <li>I have now opted to go with a normal brush in a protective case as it saves me precious ozs...  </li>
            <li>Brush is very heavy and large so not the best thing for travel.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Just to echo what other people say: it&#x27;s pretty cheap, good quality, and the travel-ready design is convenient when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As another reviewer mentioned, what you don&#x27;t see in the photo is that the brush part actually screws into the holder so you have a nice handle.</li>
            <li>and quality (case is solid and well-machined), make this is one of my most fortunate purchases.  </li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers said, the fact that the brush screws into its carrying handle make it very easy to work with but easy to travel with as well.  </li>
            <li>The badger hair is obviously not the finest grade and is fairly coarse, but creates a good lather and does a good job of raising facial hair and preparing the skin for shaving.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend spending a little more and get a better brush.</li>
            <li>This shipped super fast and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>Overall - they need to display this product better</li>
            <li>the quality is consistent with the price.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not likely to get much better.  </li>
            <li>I just hope this stops before the whole brush is gone!  </li>
            <li>The finish seems to be able to stand up to the task, only time will tell.  </li>
            <li>The Merchant deserves 5 stars for service and keep in mind that a proper badger brush would cost much more.  </li>
            <li>Hairs were falling out from the first shave and increased with time.  </li>
            <li>The threads for the knock and base are very good and operate flawlessly even after a year of heavy travel and use.  </li>
            <li>I can say on the positive side here</li>
            <li>receiving it (shipping was fast), the first thing I noticed was the build quality.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re OK with that, or if you always have time to let the brush dry before packing (I don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li>The brush unscrews and then you can slide it into the handle to make a nice, compact little package for your shave kit.</li>
            <li>It is extremely well made for the price point, the brush has performed flawlessly so far, wonderful lather and of better quality than I expected for this price; it&#x27;s softness and quality feels less than, but close to, my $60 silvertip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very scritchy, and after 10 lathers or so, I figure if it hasn&#x27;t softened up by now</li>
            <li>Only thing keeping me from giving this brush 5 stars is that I&#x27;ve noticed that the knot isn&#x27;t as secure as I would like</li>
            <li>This is a quality product that works very well.  </li>
            <li>So much lost hair.  </li>
            <li>I really dislike having to pick hair off my face after lathering.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I gave up shaving with</li>
            <li>When taken down, the size is perfect for a small Dopp kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I attempted various things; soaking in hot H2O with conditioner; even hot VO5...</li>
            <li>when the brush is put together for use, it&#x27;s huge and the handle is not very ergonomic</li>
            <li>but I quickly made this into my stay-at-home brush and bought a smaller and more expensive brush from Caswell-Massey which has much better (badger) bristles and is light and small.</li>
            <li>Mine is still fairly new, so I&#x27;ll revise the review if time changes things, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with hair shedding yet.  </li>
            <li>The brush, even when closed up is actually bigger than many non-portable brushes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>The first time I used it several fell out, of course, but</li>
            <li>Early on, it started losing bristles.</li>
            <li>Far from it, the portability (ventilation for drying with the brush inserted in the case, etc.</li>
            <li>After a few more uses, the dye started coming off when I died the brio styles with a white</li>
            <li>The bristles are exceptionally poor quality, doesn&#x27;t hold water well at all for creating a nice lather.  </li>
            <li>The small cap, pictured on the right side of the picture actually has slotted drain holes, so the brush is able to dry easier, and 2)</li>
            <li>I washed the brush in warm water and soap before using for the first time and have not experienced any \\&quot;wet</li>
            <li>OK, some of the one-star reviews have a point about the bristles being less pliable than more expensive brushes, like the one I use for every-day shaving.  </li>
            <li>the heavy brass/nickel tube is strong enough to require no concern as to its survival in all situations.</li>
            <li>The brush is cheap, loses bristles, but the gotcha for me was (and I should have known this)</li>
            <li>This brush has lovely chromed brass, but a poor boar bristle brush.  </li>
            <li>But a major defect is that the bristles are not attached properly.</li>
            <li>Once you remove the brush itself, the whole contraption reassembles again to create a single functional shaving brush piece (i.e.: the container now becomes the handle - and that&#x27;s about 4\\&quot; long).    </li>
            <li>Have lost four hairs from the brush so far, at this rate it will only last ten to fifteen years of daily use before needing replacement.  </li>
            <li>updated: A few large chunks of bristles came out of the middle.</li>

            <li> updated: A few large chunks of bristles came out of the middle.</li>
            <li> Too bad I have other shaving brushes but this one makes me happy to travel it</li>
            <li> The bristles are very stiff and lots of them started coming out from the first time I used it and kept coming out every time I used it.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;hairs\\&quot; are too long and coarse - when I used it</li>
            <li> And this is after a year of use and four-five long trips where it was my daily brush.  </li>
            <li> There are also holes to allow the brush to dry properly.</li>
            <li> As soon as the central clump came out, its neighbors were right behind.  </li>
            <li> It is not as soft as my everyday brush but works well.</li>
            <li> At first there were just a few random hairs falling out, as I said, but then recently large clumps started falling out.  </li>
            <li> The center of this brush is almost devoid of hair, and it&#x27;s like a big hole occupies the heart of the brush.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was a little smaller as it takes up a bit of space in the travel bags</li>
            <li> /&gt;Summation:  Great handle design; horrible knock and bristles.  </li>
            <li> The designers remembered to put holes in the end cap to allow air to circulate if your brush is still wet.</li>
            <li> There really is not much</li>
            <li> It is a travel brush and therefore is too small for daily use.  </li>
            <li> if the brush isn&#x27;t allowed to completely dry, the nickel will turn the bristles green where ever there is contact.</li>
            <li> The only thing that someone may not like it that there was a visible glue-line around the base of the brush part where the bristles meet the cap, but it looks like it&#x27;s pretty solid.    </li>
            <li> Initial thought was that they were very stiff.  </li>
            <li> It was not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> The only problem I thought I had with it was that the grip for the brush seemed very small (see product picture).  </li>
            <li> As others have noted, the metal parts seem extremely well made, although they are quite heavy, considering that the brush is intended for travel.</li>
            <li> If I saw it in a store, I would not expect to pay less than $50 for it.  </li>
            <li> dog\\&quot; smell that is typical with some types of bristle.  </li>
            <li> Initially I figured that the issue might be a few loose bristles, and that the situation would resolve itself over time, but if anything it has gotten worse, to the point that I will need to find a replacement.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an outstanding product.  If I saw it in a store, I would not expect to pay less than $50 for it.  The badger hair is obviously not the finest grade and is fairly coarse, but creates a good lather and does a good job of raising facial hair and preparing the skin for shaving.  The nickel-plated brass is substantial and the finish is excellent.  The construction is quite ingenious; you remove the brush, reverse the handle and screw the brush onto the handle.  This is a high-quality product, an extremely good value, and should provide many years of service.</li>
            <li> I was looking all over for a quality travel shaving soap brush and thought I found it here.  I think it made it in and out of my shopping cart 3 or 4 times before I finally decided to purchase it.  The only problem I thought I had with it was that the grip for the brush seemed very small (see product picture).  They don&#x27;t show you two crucial things (which if I had known about them, there would have been no hesitation in my purchase); 1) The small cap, pictured on the right side of the picture actually has slotted drain holes, so the brush is able to dry easier, and 2) Once you remove the brush itself, the whole contraption reassembles again to create a single functional shaving brush piece (i.e.: the container now becomes the handle - and that&#x27;s about 4\\&quot; long).    The only thing that someone may not like it that there was a visible glue-line around the base of the brush part where the bristles meet the cap, but it looks like it&#x27;s pretty solid.    Overall - they need to display this product better and/or communicate it better because this is a really good product for a really fair price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for 4 years now. Early on, it started losing bristles. I&#x27;m in the market for another version, as this one is disappointingly unusable.</li>
            <li> the quality is consistent with the price. If you need a travel shave brush you would have a hard time finding a better quality item for less!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with shave soap and brush for years, but had to do without my badger brush while on the road.  No more.  This is a great, compact brush that assembles quickly and builds a great lather. (While traveling through airport security, however, you&#x27;ll want to have it assembled and out, because of the metal cylinder in which the brush is ordinarily stored.)  Great item - highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Mine is still fairly new, so I&#x27;ll revise the review if time changes things, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with hair shedding yet.  The first time I used it several fell out, of course, but since then no problems.  Just to echo what other people say: it&#x27;s pretty cheap, good quality, and the travel-ready design is convenient when needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I used this brush as a travel brush for several months, then an everday brush for about five months.  At first there were just a few random hairs falling out, as I said, but then recently large clumps started falling out.  As soon as the central clump came out, its neighbors were right behind.  I had to give up on it.  The brush lasted about the equivalent of six/seven months of full-time use.  It was quite a nice one up until that point.</li>
            <li> The center of this brush is almost devoid of hair, and it&#x27;s like a big hole occupies the heart of the brush.  It&#x27;s also very scritchy, and after 10 lathers or so, I figure if it hasn&#x27;t softened up by now it&#x27;s not likely to get much better.  My money could have been put to better use.</li>
            <li> Brush is very heavy and large so not the best thing for travel. Works well for the price but I quickly made this into my stay-at-home brush and bought a smaller and more expensive brush from Caswell-Massey which has much better (badger) bristles and is light and small.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing travel brush. As another reviewer mentioned, what you don&#x27;t see in the photo is that the brush part actually screws into the holder so you have a nice handle. The brush unscrews and then you can slide it into the handle to make a nice, compact little package for your shave kit. There are also holes to allow the brush to dry properly. Really nice feel and classy look.</li>
            <li> I have used this as a travel brush, and have used it dozens of times. It is extremely well made for the price point, the brush has performed flawlessly so far, wonderful lather and of better quality than I expected for this price; it&#x27;s softness and quality feels less than, but close to, my $60 silvertip.</li>
            <li> I saw this was imported and it looked identical to a travel brush I got at Nordstroms that was made in Italy. That was a perfect travel brush and lasted for years. This one is made in Taiwan and the quality is lacking. I used it for three months and threw it away. The \\&quot;hairs\\&quot; are too long and coarse - when I used it I figured that must be how rat hair would feel against your skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Kingsley pure Bristle Shave Brush and have been very happy with its practicality and performance. I travel numerous times / year and it can be disassembled and thrown in the kit with no effort and the heavy brass/nickel tube is strong enough to require no concern as to its survival in all situations. The heft is also quite comfortable when using the brush.</li>
            <li> Thought about this getting this brush for a while and finally decided I had to try it out.  Like the other reviewers said, the fact that the brush screws into its carrying handle make it very easy to work with but easy to travel with as well.  The hair quality isn&#x27;t the best but for the price, what do you expect?  Only thing keeping me from giving this brush 5 stars is that I&#x27;ve noticed that the knot isn&#x27;t as secure as I would like and I&#x27;m continually losing one or two hairs everytime I shave.  Still makes decent lather, but its rather annoying to have pull a hair off your face everytime you later up.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product that works very well.  It is very sturdy and easy to use.  The design for inserting the brush into the handle while allowing for ventilation/drying is great.</li>
            <li> I swa this item and it looked wonderful from the review, needless to say it far, far from wonderful.  It is perhaps the worst shaving brush I have ever used.  The bristles are exceptionally poor quality, doesn&#x27;t hold water well at all for creating a nice lather.  It not easy to use, if you lather in a crcular motion the blasted thing will unscrew itself and fall apart as you&#x27;re trying to get your chaving cream on your face.  Doesn&#x27;t come out of its container easily either.  SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY and just but a travel tube for your nice at-home brush.</li>
            <li> To begin with this brush worked well...9 months later the bristle started to come out making shaving annoying and uncomfortable. Eventually I have had to throw it away. I would recommend spending a little more and get a better brush.</li>
            <li> After the second time I took this item on a trip, the collar that holds the brush in the handle came apart from the handle.  Looks like it was soldered in place and the solder failed.  Also, as I use it more and more bristles seem to come out.  I just hope this stops before the whole brush is gone!  If it didn&#x27;t come apart I would like this brush.  Too bad.</li>
            <li> The bristles are are a little softer than a previous compact brush.  Wish it was a little smaller as it takes up a bit of space in the travel bags but it works.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help me out when I travel. The brush stores neatly inside the cartridge to protect the brush. The designers remembered to put holes in the end cap to allow air to circulate if your brush is still wet. The bristles are great if you like them firmer.</li>
            <li> There really is not much I can say on the positive side here but here are some of the things to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- if you&#x27;re buying this brush because you want a compact, portable shave brush, think again.  The brush, even when closed up is actually bigger than many non-portable brushes.&lt;br /&gt;- when the brush is put together for use, it&#x27;s huge and the handle is not very ergonomic&lt;br /&gt;- the bristles are stiff, cut unevenly and have a tendency to fall out or just break.  Oh and they are poorly dyed.  After two uses, the bristles started to turn green. After a few more uses, the dye started coming off when I died the brio styles with a white towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this brush at any cost.</li>
            <li> OK, some of the one-star reviews have a point about the bristles being less pliable than more expensive brushes, like the one I use for every-day shaving.  But as a travel brush and for the price -- I cannot imagine any cause for complaint.  Far from it, the portability (ventilation for drying with the brush inserted in the case, etc. ec.) and quality (case is solid and well-machined), make this is one of my most fortunate purchases.  And this is after a year of use and four-five long trips where it was my daily brush.  Verdict: excellent value and product.</li>
            <li> Nice design but the glue stopped holding the bristle portion to the handle.  Disappointing considering the cost of the item. Cannot recommend.</li>
            <li> This brush is crap.  On first appearance, it seems well made and looks nice.  It even seems fairly sturdy with a nice weight and a decent quality feel.  Looks are only skin deep.  The bristles are very stiff and lots of them started coming out from the first time I used it and kept coming out every time I used it.  After about 8 months of light use (maybe 15 to 20 shaves) the entire brush came unglued from the handle.  The thing is ruined!  I guess Harry D Koenig &amp; Co didn&#x27;t think water proof glue was necessary.</li>
            <li> Too bad I have other shaving brushes but this one makes me happy to travel it feels great and works great as well.</li>
            <li> I love the design and the construction of the metal portions. The brush is cheap, loses bristles, but the gotcha for me was (and I should have known this) if the brush isn&#x27;t allowed to completely dry, the nickel will turn the bristles green where ever there is contact. If you&#x27;re OK with that, or if you always have time to let the brush dry before packing (I don&#x27;t) then it&#x27;s a great cheap travel brush.</li>
            <li> It is a travel brush and therefore is too small for daily use.  As a travel brush it is compact, hefty, well manufactured and easy to use and store.  Have lost four hairs from the brush so far, at this rate it will only last ten to fifteen years of daily use before needing replacement.  The finish seems to be able to stand up to the task, only time will tell.  The badger hair seems to be a fairly good quality.  I washed the brush in warm water and soap before using for the first time and have not experienced any \\&quot;wet dog\\&quot; smell that is typical with some types of bristle.  Remember it is a small brush with a heavy handle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this brush for a year and use it traveling.  It looses a lot of hair, though there is plenty left.  There is a tint of copper patina (green) on the brush as it is usually stored still damp.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the brush feel apart almost immediately.  My friend can no longer use it and I&#x27;m embarrassed.  :(:( :( :(</li>
            <li> This shipped super fast and was exactly as described. Super light weight perfect for travel and fast drying. A little bit softer brissles than a boars brush but very good quality and feel.</li>
            <li> I thought this was the greatest thing. Then the hairs started falling out. Then they came out in clumps. I still need a travel brush as this one is unusable.</li>
            <li> This brush has lovely chromed brass, but a poor boar bristle brush.  That said, the merchant is excellent and returned my money.  I recommend it as a display piece.  The Merchant deserves 5 stars for service and keep in mind that a proper badger brush would cost much more.  Some reviews say that it is badger but it isn&#x27;t and the merchant isn&#x27;t claiming that is it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for 9 months and only use this brush when I travel. It started off good, but now the bristles are falling out. I am now looking to replace it.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush about a year ago, and have used it on a half-dozen trips since then. As others have noted, the metal parts seem extremely well made, although they are quite heavy, considering that the brush is intended for travel. But a major defect is that the bristles are not attached properly. Bristles fall out every time I use the brush, sometimes in clumps that I have to catch before they clog the drain of the sink. Initially I figured that the issue might be a few loose bristles, and that the situation would resolve itself over time, but if anything it has gotten worse, to the point that I will need to find a replacement.</li>
            <li> The shave brush has a good heft too it and feels well made. I bought it as it was too good for the price and after four or five uses it came apart. The bristles became unglued and the entire brush fell apart in my hands. Also, when stored the damp brush would turn green from the metal. It was not worth the money to me.</li>
            <li> I have owned this brush for a year now, so I feel I can give it an adequate review.  ...but it&#x27;s not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving it (shipping was fast), the first thing I noticed was the build quality.  All parts of the handle are sturdy.  The threads for the knock and base are very good and operate flawlessly even after a year of heavy travel and use.  When taken down, the size is perfect for a small Dopp kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, that&#x27;s it for pros...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weight.  The build quality means heavy weight.  I am a &amp;#34;carry-on&amp;#34; traveler, and weight matters to me.  I have now opted to go with a normal brush in a protective case as it saves me precious ozs...  As well as the following reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knock.  So much lost hair.  I really dislike having to pick hair off my face after lathering.  It is tedious and irritating.  Hairs were falling out from the first shave and increased with time.  So much so that I gave up shaving with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bristles.  Initial thought was that they were very stiff.  To this day, my opinion remains the same.  I attempted various things; soaking in hot H2O with conditioner; even hot VO5... Nothing has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summation:  Great handle design; horrible knock and bristles.  Too heavy for carry-on travel (IMO).</li>
            <li> This is the best travel brush I have owned</li>
            <li> updated: A few large chunks of bristles came out of the middle. They didn&#x27;t just fall out one at a time the came out as a chunk still glued together. I am looking for a replacement brush for travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;original: I have used this for almost a year. It is not as soft as my everyday brush but works well. I have only had TSA screeners pull it out of my bag to examine it one time.</li>
            <li> I would have to say that for the price is delivers a lot more than was promised.  It is not as bushy as a home brush but for a travel brush it is totally what you are looking for.  great product.</li>
            <li> the brush constantly is loosing the bristles. stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;a rip-off!</li>
