            <li>It really is a lovely product.</li>
            <li>Just love it.  </li>
            <li>Prior to calling it Lavender Luminosity, it was the perfect moisturizer for me.  </li>
            <li>Try the night cream for bedtime it is more emollient but does not clog poors</li>
            <li>Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
            <li>I have truly enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for some time and still love it.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Gave it as gifts to family members and they love it.</li>
            <li>I love Avalon products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  </li>
            <li>Really nice, light moisturizer with lovely light fragrance.</li>
            <li>The item pictured and described is the old formula, which was a great product.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s just like any old moisturizer, nothing great.</li>
            <li>and I easily break out, have oily skin</li>
            <li>Easy on the nose fragrance.</li>
            <li>the smell is too strong.</li>
            <li>I have rosacea and it feels soothing, cool, and refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is a medium weight cream with a lovely mild lavender scent.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and leaves my face and neck feeling soft, not greasy.  </li>
            <li>I think this would be great for younger skin, though.</li>
            <li>However, the lotion is way too light for me.</li>
            <li>After about 10 minutes, the skin has absorbed the cream and feels very smooth and for some reason, more lively.</li>
            <li>Good if you live in a hot and humid climate.</li>
            <li>It is thick, rich, and makes my face feel wonderful</li>
            <li>I use it twice a week and love how smooth and soft my skin feels afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This moisturizer is light yet very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are some cons, it kind of burns when you initially put it on</li>
            <li>Bought this as a present as my husband liked this cream before.</li>
            <li>I can rarely find this for under $20 in the stores.</li>
            <li>The smell of the product is like forest soil, kind of gross for a face moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my friend as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;She said it was really useful.</li>
            <li>Perfect daily moisturizer for dry skin all year or normal skin during the winter.</li>
            <li>Great daily facial moisture cream.</li>
            <li>The old formula was just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the lavender moisturizer for 2 years, and the most recent package I bought had that on it.</li>
            <li>Pros: My skin does feel well hydrated and look clear and smooth...</li>
            <li>the weeks went on and I&#x27;ve developed what looks like rosacea, confirmed by my doctor.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this product (over a year ago), I almost cried.</li>
            <li>I love this facial cream</li>
            <li>And Amazon&#x27;s price beats Whole Foods!</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;New, More Sustained\\&quot; cream is nothing like the old formula.  </li>
            <li>The smell and feel is marvelous, but unfornautely my skin drank it down in just hours and ended up feeling tight and flaky before mid-day.</li>
            <li>Not so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very dissapointed!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li>Does not take much to cover face and neck.</li>
            <li>I use it at night and the lavender is very relaxing.</li>
            <li>When I turned back to the mirror and rubbed cream in, I noticed two bright red spots on my cheeks right where I left cream for a minute.</li>
            <li>I originally used the night cream version of this for occasional dryness.</li>
            <li>I have found so many reviews about other Avalon organics face products that corroborate the burning, the rash, and the irritation.</li>
            <li>Only problem I see is I wish it came in a larger  size because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>All the better ingredients that were at the top of the ingredient list, are now half way down.  </li>
            <li>Less is better and I can always add lavender to it</li>
            <li>will probably buy again unless price gets too high then</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I love this cream and have used it for a few years now.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few years and love it.  </li>
            <li>the lavender is slightly astringent and helps keep skin soft and light under makeup!</li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;m looking for a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I wake up with very soft skin.</li>
            <li>The high rated reviews refer to the old moisturizer, which I also used.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help with my skin imperfections like blackheads and rosacea along my jawline but the parts unaffected by those things look absolutely fresh and supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure which formulation I have because my label looks exactly the same except for &amp;#34;New More Sustainable&amp;#34; claim.</li>
            <li>I guess this product goes to a trash can today because I obviously developed an allergic reaction to it.</li>
            <li>I appreciate that it&#x27;s mostly natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts and</li>
            <li>It also does not aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The picture of the product is still the old one, but the jar that arrives is the new, more sustained product, and it is not good at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that many people are saying the new formula is worse than the old, which I cannot comment on because I never tried the old formula.</li>
            <li>It does not moisturize at all, instead, it dries on the skin very quickly, feels like a mask and very heavy.  </li>
            <li>The inital application caused a slight sting on my Rosacea but that quickly subsided.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer pictured here is the old formula, but what I got was thew new \\&quot;Lavender Luminosity\\&quot; daily mositurizer forumla</li>
            <li>Really hope they won&#x27;t change the formula as I plan on purchasing this for a long time.</li>
            <li>The whole situation is disappointing since EWG Skin Deep rating of this product is 3 out of 10, which is quite good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying Avalon Organics shampoo for over a year, and decided to try this moisturizer because it looked pretty good, but the fact is that it is pretty awful on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used this once so far because I just got it.</li>
            <li>I live in a dry place</li>
            <li>It actually keeps my skin pretty moisturized throughout my typical 10-hour work hours.</li>
            <li>Apparently Avalon (the manufacturer) has a mix up with these two product skus and no matter who I order it from will have the same issue.</li>
            <li>My 19 year old daughter also uses it (leans toward dry skin with some breakouts).</li>
            <li>I could pay $15 at my local Whole Foods but want to pay less on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Too bad because I&#x27;ve loved this stuff and used it for years.</li>

            <li> My 19 year old daughter also uses it (leans toward dry skin with some breakouts).</li>
            <li> I could pay $15 at my local Whole Foods but want to pay less on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Too bad because I&#x27;ve loved this stuff and used it for years.</li>
            <li> The new one arrived, with a different label, and wow, it&#x27;s no good.</li>
            <li> I am indeed allergic to certain trees, weeds and pollen, but none of them are in this product, at least according to the label.</li>
            <li> 2-Ounce Jar  is a gentle product, but a bit thick when applying - I probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> My face immediately felt dry and stretched and in the morning there was a residue on my skin that I could not wait to wash off.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re experiencing strange symptoms, this cream could be the culprit!</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry skin and this takes care of it.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin dry</li>
            <li> It worked wonders for my dry, hypersensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not experience any negative effects from it, however the next time i went back to the store I purchased this product- the daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The ingredients are natural and at least 70% organic.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried to use it yesterday after having stopped for a few weeks and the dang bumps are back.</li>
            <li> not much Lavendar smell at all.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> will look for other product</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t achieved this before with other face</li>
            <li> and almost feels itchy (although that may be due to the lack of moisturizing powers it has, not the formula itself).</li>
            <li> I also use an additional eye cream, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s really necessary ...</li>
            <li> It took about a half an hour for spots to go away.</li>
            <li> Now I will never buy it again, until they make a decision to return to previous formula.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have slightly oily skin and use this in daytime during summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m realizing that all along, as my face progressed to the mess</li>
            <li> I guess whatever they &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; was a typical marketing euphemism for &amp;#34;we cheaped out on a few things and now have an inferior product</li>
            <li> but it actually lasts me at least 3 months!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> not anywhere as thick as the night cream...stick with night cream.</li>
            <li> This new formula has a bad smell, sour. Maybe I just got a bad batch. I don&#x27;t  think I would order this again online.</li>
            <li> Tried to order this product through two different vendors now and each has shipped a lavender exfoliating product instead of the daily moisturizer shown. Apparently Avalon (the manufacturer) has a mix up with these two product skus and no matter who I order it from will have the same issue. Both vendors (Nutricity and AmericaRX) handled my return/refunds promptly but I guess I will not get to try this product until Avalon fixes things lol.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and have used it for a few years now.  It goes on nice, smells good and the lavender seems to heal some issues!!!</li>
            <li> Product has changed not happy with.</li>
            <li> been using product for a few years.  will probably buy again unless price gets too high then will look for other product</li>
            <li> Best face lotion I&#x27;ve ever used and I easily break out, have oily skin and this is hydrating while smelling amazing. I put it on before my make up. Love it</li>
            <li> good for sensitive skin, not greasy, soaks in wonderfully. paraben-free.  Been using 6 years, very happy, no break-outs.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light yet very moisturizing. It actually keeps my skin pretty moisturized throughout my typical 10-hour work hours. The ingredients are natural and at least 70% organic. Also, it wasn&#x27;t tasted on animals and is paraben-free. It seems pricey for a 2-oz jar but it actually lasts me at least 3 months!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that many people are saying the new formula is worse than the old, which I cannot comment on because I never tried the old formula. However, I rather like the current formula because it makes my face glow and have a transparent look. It almost looks ethereal. It doesn&#x27;t help with my skin imperfections like blackheads and rosacea along my jawline but the parts unaffected by those things look absolutely fresh and supple. I haven&#x27;t achieved this before with other face creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some cons, it kind of burns when you initially put it on, it is a bit greasy and leaves a little bit of greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so annoyed with this \\&quot;Now More Sustainable!\\&quot; crap. I&#x27;ve used the lavender moisturizer for 2 years, and the most recent package I bought had that on it. I didn&#x27;t even think about it when I started breaking out in these gross cystic acne bumps all on my neck. Well, I tried to use it yesterday after having stopped for a few weeks and the dang bumps are back. The old formula was just fine. I&#x27;m chunking this crud in the trash and refuse to by anymore of their products that have that labeling on them!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years and love it.  Perfect for morning or night, with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a present as my husband liked this cream before. I guess whatever they &amp;#34;improved&amp;#34; was a typical marketing euphemism for &amp;#34;we cheaped out on a few things and now have an inferior product but we&#x27;d still like you to buy this&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I can rarely find this for under $20 in the stores. I was so happy to find it on amazon prime. Love it! It makes my skin feel good and not like it&#x27;s coated in something unhealthy. I tend to have dry skin and this takes care of it.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product and uses it every night. It is one of best night creams you can find. Organic as well. Not greasy at all. Easy on the nose fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that only gets worse in the winter. My friend suggested this and I absolutely love it! When applying, it goes on a tad thick so your skin feels dewy, but I only put it on at night so I wake up with very soft skin. Highly recommend. Smells delightful, too!</li>
            <li> I could pay $15 at my local Whole Foods but want to pay less on Amazon. Unfortunately, I have ordered it from several vendors and get other products.&lt;br /&gt;As for the product itself, no stinging. Nice scent. No greasy feeling. And it has helped my skin to stay young-looking.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful as a night time moisturizer. I have rosacea and it feels soothing, cool, and refreshing. A lot of products irritate my fact. For me, this is the best.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which formulation I have because my label looks exactly the same except for &amp;#34;New More Sustainable&amp;#34; claim. It is made in Melville, NY. I used it for about 4 weeks and started noticing tingling in the T-zone and around my nose. I thought that my homemade tonic (two parts apple cider vinegar and one part water) was the culprit. I stopped using it for a week but tingling sensation didn&#x27;t go away. Today I put some cream on my cheeks and turned away to brush my teeth. When I turned back to the mirror and rubbed cream in, I noticed two bright red spots on my cheeks right where I left cream for a minute. It took about a half an hour for spots to go away. I guess this product goes to a trash can today because I obviously developed an allergic reaction to it. I am indeed allergic to certain trees, weeds and pollen, but none of them are in this product, at least according to the label. The whole situation is disappointing since EWG Skin Deep rating of this product is 3 out of 10, which is quite good.</li>
            <li> It really is a lovely product. The smell and feel is marvelous, but unfornautely my skin drank it down in just hours and ended up feeling tight and flaky before mid-day. I think this would be great for younger skin, though.</li>
            <li> Pros: My skin does feel well hydrated and look clear and smooth...eventually after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It BURNS like crazy going on, and turns quite pink. Hypoallergenic?? Not so much. I&#x27;m very dissapointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been buying Avalon Organics shampoo for over a year, and decided to try this moisturizer because it looked pretty good, but the fact is that it is pretty awful on my sensitive skin. :-/</li>
            <li> I got this for the warmer months. It is a medium weight cream with a lovely mild lavender scent. After about 10 minutes, the skin has absorbed the cream and feels very smooth and for some reason, more lively. I appreciate that AO did not overdue the lavender scent. Less is better and I can always add lavender to it is needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Too heavy for combination skin.  Doesn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
            <li> Feels good, not greasy, smells good.  Put it on after face washing morning and night.  Just love it.  Really hope they won&#x27;t change the formula as I plan on purchasing this for a long time.</li>
            <li> Prior to calling it Lavender Luminosity, it was the perfect moisturizer for me.  Now, they&#x27;ve changed the formula.  All the better ingredients that were at the top of the ingredient list, are now half way down.  And they added zinc oxide?  This stuff is terrible now!</li>
            <li> Delivered on time. Product is excellent for the price. Only problem I see is I wish it came in a larger  size because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> I am not impressed so far. I received Luminosity Daily Moisturizer several days ago. The container was not sealed well and of course it leaked some. The inital application caused a slight sting on my Rosacea but that quickly subsided. However the product has an earthy scent, not much Lavendar smell at all. The smell of the product is like forest soil, kind of gross for a face moisturizer. I am hoping the benefits will outweight the smell but today I am thinking I will not purchase this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this once so far because I just got it. It feels great, the lavender smells lovely, and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> The high rated reviews refer to the old moisturizer, which I also used.  It was great, and deserved a five star review.  The \\&quot;New, More Sustained\\&quot; cream is nothing like the old formula.  It does not moisturize at all, instead, it dries on the skin very quickly, feels like a mask and very heavy.  I wish they would not have messed with the formula, and left it alone.  Now I will never buy it again, until they make a decision to return to previous formula.  The picture of the product is still the old one, but the jar that arrives is the new, more sustained product, and it is not good at all.  I do not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the lavender smell! However, the lotion is way too light for me. Does nothing. Good if you live in a hot and humid climate. I live in a dry place so I need something stronger.</li>
            <li> Lovely scent and a great moisturizer. Works wonderfully well after a toner. A little goes a long way. I will definitely re-purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my friend as a gift.&lt;br /&gt;She said it was really useful.Good smell.&lt;br /&gt;And she liked the lavender.It would help her sleep well.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin dry and it says only 70 percent organic.</li>
            <li> I originally used the night cream version of this for occasional dryness. I did not experience any negative effects from it, however the next time i went back to the store I purchased this product- the daily moisturizer. My skin has been getting progressively worse throughout the winter with the lotion not helping with the Flakey dryness... the weeks went on and I&#x27;ve developed what looks like rosacea, confirmed by my doctor. Flakey acne in my t-zone, in between the eyebrows, the cheeks, and chin, along with an underlying red flush. This morning, I washed my face and applied the moisturizer and my face broke into a red rash, every area that had the lotion applied (my problem areas,  the tzone). My face feels sunburnt, it itches and stings.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m realizing that all along, as my face progressed to the mess it is now, I&#x27;ve been using this lotion. I have found so many reviews about other Avalon organics face products that corroborate the burning, the rash, and the irritation.Vitamin C Renewal Rejuvenating Oil-Free Moisturizer specifically.&lt;br /&gt;So, something is going on here with this cream. If you&#x27;re experiencing strange symptoms, this cream could be the culprit!</li>
            <li> this is great for under make up in the morning the lavender is slightly astringent and helps keep skin soft and light under makeup! It is now the only thing I will use. Try the night cream for bedtime it is more emollient but does not clog poors both are great!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer I have ever used! It  moisturizes without a oily buildup. I have truly enjoyed using this product.</li>
            <li> the smell is too strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for some time and still love it.  I appreciate that it&#x27;s mostly natural ingredients.  The smell is pleasant and leaves my face and neck feeling soft, not greasy.  I use it at night before bed and use a different moisturizer with SPF for daytime.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recall the product</li>
            <li> I love this face lotion!!! I have sensitive skin prone to breakouts and this lotion does a wonderful moisturizing it without causing any breakouts !</li>
            <li> The first time I used this product (over a year ago), I almost cried. A hypoallergenic moisturizer that was hydrating AND brightening AND from a brand that is organic and eco-friendly?? Heck yes! It worked wonders for my dry, hypersensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;However, this is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this and something seems… different. It&#x27;s less hydrating (I have to apply at least two layer for any moisture benefits) and almost feels itchy (although that may be due to the lack of moisturizing powers it has, not the formula itself). However, it still brightens and smells nice. I just use it in combination with another hypoallergenic moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I love this facial cream and I can&#x27;t buy it in town anymore. The service was great from this company too!</li>
            <li> They totally changed the face lotion, so now it;s crap, it was from petaluma Calif, now fron Ney York and not the sane</li>
            <li> This product has been ruined. Beware! The item pictured and described is the old formula, which was a great product. I&#x27;ve used it for years. The new one arrived, with a different label, and wow, it&#x27;s no good. My face immediately felt dry and stretched and in the morning there was a residue on my skin that I could not wait to wash off. So sad. Guess I&#x27;m looking for a new moisturizer. Shame on Avalon Organics for messing with a good thing!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer pictured here is the old formula, but what I got was thew new \\&quot;Lavender Luminosity\\&quot; daily mositurizer forumla and it is no good.  It&#x27;s drying and not moisturizing at all.  Too bad because I&#x27;ve loved this stuff and used it for years.</li>
            <li> This does make my skin moist, but I was under the impression it would be healing also. I have red blotchy skin a lot of the time and look for things to improve it, but this did nothing, it gets even redder after I put this on. So it&#x27;s just like any old moisturizer, nothing great.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s light weight, non greasy, and smells amazing:) I have been using it for 3 years now!</li>
            <li> Avalon Organics, Daily Moisturizer, Lavender, 2-Ounce Jar  is a gentle product, but a bit thick when applying - I probably will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great daily facial moisture cream. Not greasy. Does not take much to cover face and neck. I also use an additional eye cream, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s really necessary ... just my habit. I&#x27;ve been using this cream for years and see no reason to stop.</li>
            <li> Perfect daily moisturizer for dry skin all year or normal skin during the winter. Wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for a few years. It smells wonderful. I use it at night and the lavender is very relaxing. It moisturizes without being heavy or oily. And Amazon&#x27;s price beats Whole Foods!</li>
            <li> I like the way this lotion tightens my skin.</li>
            <li> Great product! Gave it as gifts to family members and they love it.</li>
            <li> I love Avalon products. I have been using them for over a year now and have found nothing wrong to say. It is thick, rich, and makes my face feel wonderful</li>
            <li> Really nice, light moisturizer with lovely light fragrance. I am in my 50&#x27;s and have slightly oily skin and use this in daytime during summer. My 19 year old daughter also uses it (leans toward dry skin with some breakouts). For night and winter I use the Night Cream by Avalon - also great fragrance. Really nice products, and easily found at most groceries in addition to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years.  I use it twice a week and love how smooth and soft my skin feels afterwards.  It also does not aggravate my sensitive skin.</li>
