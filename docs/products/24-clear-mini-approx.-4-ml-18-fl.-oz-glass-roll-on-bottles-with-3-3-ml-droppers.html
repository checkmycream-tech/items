            <li>The glass bottles are a good size</li>
            <li>Came in unbroken so that&#x27;s good.</li>

            <li>I love these roller bottles.</li>
            <li>Love the convenience of rolling the oils on.</li>
            <li>Too many have roller balls that fall out.</li>
            <li>While I will use these myself, I will not be able to give them away as I had planned to.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Love these bottles.</li>
            <li>Perfect for mixing my essential oil blends to give to friends and family.</li>
            <li>I love these items</li>
            <li>Love love these bottles.</li>
            <li>They are OK.</li>
            <li>The roller balls do not glide easily.</li>
            <li>These are great for purse sizes essential oil rollers.</li>
            <li>They work great for your essential oils.</li>
            <li>I had to reordered from my original place</li>
            <li>When new, they need to be lubricated for the ball to operate smoothly, but I have found that to be true of most roller bottles.</li>
            <li>Super price.</li>
            <li>The pipettes that came with this set are awesome extra - they allow you to fill the tiny bottles with relative easy; the bottles once filled are pretty easy to assemble too!</li>
            <li>These bottles are great, highly recommend them for essential oils.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for!  </li>
            <li>I bought these roller bottles to make my own essential oil mixes.</li>
            <li>I get these from this seller all the time they are very fast getting them to me.  </li>
            <li>While I love the smaller size of the bottles, the roller balls put out ZERO oils!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I was in love with this deal until 3 different times and bottles had the rollers fall out while using them.</li>
            <li>I love how everything was in a neat tiny box!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of roller ball recently from many sellers/websites.</li>
            <li>They also don&#x27;t roll very well.</li>
            <li>Definitely comes in handy for my essential oils!</li>
            <li>While the bottles arrived quickly and we&#x27;re well packaged, the quality is definitely lacking.</li>
            <li>I was super excited to get these because of their small size.</li>
            <li>Occasionally one of the balls doesn&#x27;t start turning right away, but if you turn the bottle upside down and shake it a bit, you get the oil through the sides, and then the roller ball slides just fine.</li>
            <li>Very well packaged and I will definitely</li>
            <li>My son went to use one and the roller fell completely out.</li>
            <li>Good bottles, I didn&#x27;t get any broken in shipment!</li>
            <li>Have only used 7 bottles so far.</li>
            <li>Hope the other bottles are trouble free.</li>
            <li>The rollers barely move though, even with essential oils and a carrier oil.  </li>
            <li>My essential oil blends barely come out at all</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Long story short.</li>
            <li> The balls in the roller piece just do not work which is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This last time I ordered 2 boxes and at least half of the first box the rollers are falling out and the oil leaks.</li>
            <li> and I should have followed my instincts and went with the smaller quantity order I have previously received.</li>
            <li> Exactly as expected.</li>
            <li> The roller ball popped right out after only using it a few times and dumped almost all my expensive oils out.</li>
            <li> I bought these small bottles to make several class projects to introduce &amp;#34;essential oils&amp;#34; to my class.</li>
            <li> accept the roller is hard to roll...that is a giant bummer cause to get the oils out you need the roller to work...</li>
            <li> Takes a little bit to get the black lid on.</li>
            <li> The roller ball needs a little work to get going</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble with the balls falling out.</li>
            <li> I experience the same thing, there were six roller balls out of the 24 that are already broken.</li>
            <li> These are a waste of money....</li>
            <li> I have dropped them on hardwood floors, and as this is thick brown glass, I haven&#x27;t even seen a chip much less a crack or break.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money!</li>
            <li> I cant use these without the balls so they are just pointless to use.</li>
            <li> Some of the roller balls are hard to start rolling and on one bottle</li>
            <li> Quite a mess and expensive loss.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, these bottles were a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m having issues with the actual balls of the rollers in this batch:(</li>
            <li> So sad.</li>
            <li> They are completely useless.</li>
            <li> I put my expensive oils in 6 of them.</li>
            <li> The balls dont roll or some are missing &amp; the worst part is that the balls FALL out when you use them!!!</li>
            <li> I have to say after using these for a while, I am disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> I have been disappointed that the glass balls fall out of some of these bottles when used.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These things suck sooooooo bad!!!!</li>

            <li> I purchased these to use for a make and take essential oils workshop I was doing.  Having the pipettes was a bonus when adding the carrier oil.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my Essential Oil Make and Take party...love everything about them accept the roller is hard to roll...that is a giant bummer cause to get the oils out you need the roller to work...</li>
            <li> just what I was looking for</li>
            <li> I love these roller bottles. When new, they need to be lubricated for the ball to operate smoothly, but I have found that to be true of most roller bottles. I have had zero problems with my order and will order again.</li>
            <li> None of the rollers work! Got here in tome but I can&#x27;t use any of them! I had to reordered from my original place</li>
            <li> Good bottles, I didn&#x27;t get any broken in shipment!</li>
            <li> The roller balls do not glide easily.</li>
            <li> I have had a lot of trouble with the balls falling out. Quite a mess and expensive loss.</li>
            <li> Most roller bottles aren&#x27;t rolling well and 2 didn&#x27;t have the balls in the roller thing, making them useless. Amazon refunded for those but I am finding them not rolling well. The size is perfect though. Much more convenient than the 10ml!</li>
            <li> I bought these roller bottles to make my own essential oil mixes. However, after making one, I discovered that the roller ball did not dispense an even amount of oil (if any at all) on our skin. Unfortunately, these bottles were a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for!  Roller works great!  My clients love the size, enabling them to carry their oil mixtures with them and use as needed!</li>
            <li> These are great for purse sizes essential oil rollers. The roller ball needs a little work to get going but once it does, it works fantastically.</li>
            <li> I was super excited to get these because of their small size. Using them for blends with my essential oils. The roller ball popped right out after only using it a few times and dumped almost all my expensive oils out. So sad.</li>
            <li> The 4oz bottles are the best!</li>
            <li> None of these roller ball caps roll. They are completely useless.</li>
            <li> Some of the roller balls are hard to start rolling and on one bottle the roller ball keeps falling out. Have only used 7 bottles so far. Am using them for essential oils. Love the convenience of rolling the oils on. Hope the other bottles are trouble free.</li>
            <li> Great bottles, all of them were intact.</li>
            <li> Too many have roller balls that fall out.</li>
            <li> These work perfectly for oil blends.  Occasionally one of the balls doesn&#x27;t start turning right away, but if you turn the bottle upside down and shake it a bit, you get the oil through the sides, and then the roller ball slides just fine.</li>
            <li> I cannot wait to concoct amazing blends in these bottles!</li>

            <li> I have been disappointed that the glass balls fall out of some of these bottles when used. They also don&#x27;t roll very well. While I will use these myself, I will not be able to give them away as I had planned to.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. No problems with the rolling. Will buy from them again.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for making my own essential oil blends.  Rollers work great, lids fit good.</li>
            <li> I have ordered these before with no problem. This last time I ordered 2 boxes and at least half of the first box the rollers are falling out and the oil leaks. It is like the holder for the roller ball is too big.</li>
            <li> perfect to create your own mixes and share with family/friends</li>
            <li> I bought these small bottles to make several class projects to introduce &amp;#34;essential oils&amp;#34; to my class. I made each one separately, by putting in carrier oil then adding drops of oil. The bottles were a hit, especially with the rollerball. They came as described, and I had no problem with lids or balls. I kept a set of 6 for myself, and have needed to pull the rubber top/ball off of the bottle to refill, and it has reattached beautifully. These have been in use daily for almost 6 months. I have dropped them on hardwood floors, and as this is thick brown glass, I haven&#x27;t even seen a chip much less a crack or break. I am pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I was in love with this deal until 3 different times and bottles had the rollers fall out while using them. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing these. Now I have to find good roller inserts to use in the bottles.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Very well packaged and I will definitely but these again!!</li>
            <li> These vials were packaged neatly and compactly - I love how everything was in a neat tiny box! The pipettes that came with this set are awesome extra - they allow you to fill the tiny bottles with relative easy; the bottles once filled are pretty easy to assemble too!</li>
            <li> Very nice box and packaging. The rollers barely move though, even with essential oils and a carrier oil.  I will not purchase these again.</li>
            <li> Love these bottles. Never had an issue with any of them.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mixing my essential oil blends to give to friends and family.</li>
            <li> The product is excellent. Exactly as expected. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These oil bottles were very nice but I gave a lot of them away with oil in them, and my friends said that a lot of the roller tops broke off. My daughter had them spell all inside of her suitcase because of that. I experience the same thing, there were six roller balls out of the 24 that are already broken.</li>
            <li> These things suck sooooooo bad!!!! I can not believe they sell them. I put my expensive oils in 6 of them. My son went to use one and the roller fell completely out. Oil got all over. Then I went to use one and again the roller fell out. Long story short. All the rollers I have used (about 12) are junk. The glass bottles are a good size</li>
            <li> I get these from this seller all the time they are very fast getting them to me.  I love these items</li>
            <li> Amazing price and great product! Definitely comes in handy for my essential oils!</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the money!  These bottles are great, highly recommend them for essential oils.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Love love these bottles. Thanks for the awesome service ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Very disappointed. While the bottles arrived quickly and we&#x27;re well packaged, the quality is definitely lacking. The balls in the roller piece just do not work which is a complete waste of money. The reviews were mixed but several mentioned this same problem and I should have followed my instincts and went with the smaller quantity order I have previously received. These are a waste of money....</li>
            <li> plastic rollers don&#x27;t work well with essential oils</li>
            <li> Second set I&#x27;ve purchased but I&#x27;m having issues with the actual balls of the rollers in this batch:(</li>
            <li> They work great for your essential oils.</li>
            <li> They are OK. Came in unbroken so that&#x27;s good. Takes a little bit to get the black lid on.</li>
            <li> Just as described and work great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a lot of roller ball recently from many sellers/websites. These are high quality glass, which is fantastic but the roller ball tops DO NOT ROLL!!!!  My essential oil blends barely come out at all and that&#x27;s only after I roll them on a TON. I would not order this item from this seller again.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS TOO PERFECT</li>
