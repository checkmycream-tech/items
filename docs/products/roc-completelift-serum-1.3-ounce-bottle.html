            <li>I am very impressed with all the RoC products.</li>

            <li>This is one of the greatest products I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is NOT a multi-functional product (that moisturizes, whitens, lifts, reduces wrinkle lines, refines pores, protects from UV, etc, etc all in one jar) but does best what it promises to do - lift.  </li>

            <li>I tried it and was also pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my neck but also put some on my face.</li>
            <li>I am buying more ROC products.</li>
            <li>Ok if you get the buy 1 get 50% off another ROC product.</li>
            <li>just keep getting better.  </li>
            <li>seems okay....</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles</li>

            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Always seem to love the ROC product line.</li>
            <li>Use it every morning before my make up &amp; love the lift it gives my face.</li>

            <li>am on my third bottle and am so happy with the results.</li>
            <li>My skin does feel smooth after applying it but a good moisturizer would do the same.  </li>
            <li>Although my face is not dry, it does not feel as plumped up (in a good way) as RoC.</li>
            <li>But I noticed one day that my face contours looked great, cheekbones looked beautiful, the jaw line looked contoured and overall, my face looked plump and firm.</li>
            <li>If you are on a budget, it&#x27;s okay, but for that quick lift, there are many other products that I&#x27;ve enjoyed more success with.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented around way too much before finding that while many products don&#x27;t do a thing, RoC products work for me.</li>
            <li>It is not bad but it doesn&#x27;t do anything ...</li>
            <li>Love the Complete Lift Serum.</li>
            <li>this product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a real face lift!  </li>
            <li>and I have almost no wrinkles and my skin is firmed up SO MUCH!  </li>
            <li>Works really well for me!</li>
            <li>It was my first purchase of a serum.</li>
            <li>She is more open to ROC products now.</li>
            <li>but I could not recall the exact name.  </li>
            <li>ill buy again for sure!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I really care about my skin and likes how this serum works.</li>
            <li>It really works on minimizing pores on your face plus gives a tightening effect.  </li>
            <li>I wear it under my make-up and really like the results on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always</li>
            <li>By the way, it is very economical, you need tiny bit to cover your face.</li>
            <li>Instructions said to first put on complete</li>
            <li>My neck is showing improvement (my main concern).</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m used to more \\&quot;tightened\\&quot; facial skin, I don&#x27;t think I can go back to not using it.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this serum for a while now and have not seen any results as of yet,maybe it takes longer to see any noticeable results.what works for one does not mean it will work for everyone.i</li>
            <li>their products are far better than any other more expensive brand i have tried (and liked far less).</li>
            <li>Originally, I was going to order a StriVectin product I have used for my neck before (much more expensive)</li>
            <li>I shied away from buying the Roc products because of the price and having tried so many products in the past that didn&#x27;t do as promised.</li>
            <li>I first received a sample of this product with RoC deep wrinkle night cream.</li>
            <li>It has been 1 1/2 weeks and the results are clearly visible.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60, and am amazed with how firm, smooth and lifted this product</li>
            <li>RoC Complete Lift Serum with retinol will tighten and freshen up the skin on your face...</li>
            <li>and i really see a difference especially on my neck.  </li>
            <li>It also does not last as much Iast</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s worked well for my situation.</li>
            <li>but it feels more moisturized and looks less dry.  </li>
            <li>I used this whole bottle in about a month and noticed by face is not as dry</li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft and I did not break out Two big pluses.</li>
            <li>as the commercial says, growing old, getting wrinkled, waiting for your wrinkle cream to work!</li>
            <li>my only gripe would be that it contains no spf, however i hope roc will remedy this at some point in the near future.</li>
            <li>I had a high hope for this one based on the other reviews and advertisement.  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I started using it, may be once a week because I was very busy with my PhD and did not really know how to use it.</li>

            <li> RoC CompleteLift Serum feels soft on skin; it does not do anything other, but I do like how it feels.  </li>
            <li> Recently I was having a facial and the lady was telling me how dry my skin was.</li>
            <li> This really works - hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I bought it last fall and did not really know what to expect.</li>
            <li> but lasts long.</li>
            <li> Love it, but finding it harder to find and since supplies are diminishing, this stuff is getting very expensive.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that it was rough before</li>
            <li> but I will repost after the bottle is empty and let you know how it works.</li>
            <li> I have rather sagging eyelids and have been using this product on them as well as on other areas of my face(I am 53,btw).  </li>
            <li> I tried this based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> I still use my other skincare products for other purposes, but RoC CompleteLift Serum is THE lifting product for me.</li>
            <li> It feels like she received a small face lift and looks very much younger after a while.</li>
            <li> I felt my face was sagging, like literally sagging down.</li>
            <li> However, the price has to come down a bit.</li>
            <li> This product does feel a little like a mini face lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does tightens a little, but it dries the skin a lot.</li>
            <li> I am 34, Asian, and was not happy about my face.</li>
            <li> Wasted money on this one.  </li>
            <li> Facial expression looked sad, tired, and aged.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money; in my opinion it&#x27;s a sticky substance!</li>
            <li> Small bottle</li>
            <li> I use expensive foundations, blush, eye shadows, etc., but I prefer RoC products over all of the very expensive creams for lifting what needs lifting, fading spots that you want to go away, and putting some life back in a complexion that looks faded out.</li>
            <li> but this one I thought it was useless .</li>
            <li> Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> nothing seems to stop wrinkles sadly....</li>

            <li> I first used the MultiZone line of RoC products and loved them, but decided to see if the lift was all it was cracked up to be. IT IS! I&#x27;m 60, and am amazed with how firm, smooth and lifted this product has made my skin in a very short time. However, I must say that I use it in conjunction with the day and nighttime moisturizers and the eye serum. I am very impressed with all the RoC products. Both my daughter and I use them (she is 30 and uses the MultiZone line). RoC rocks!</li>
            <li> Works like they say. I&#x27;m 65 and just had someone tell me I looked 45.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking the supplement for 20 days now and I like the effect. My skin is softer and smoother. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This product does feel a little like a mini face lift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented around way too much before finding that while many products don&#x27;t do a thing, RoC products work for me. I use expensive foundations, blush, eye shadows, etc., but I prefer RoC products over all of the very expensive creams for lifting what needs lifting, fading spots that you want to go away, and putting some life back in a complexion that looks faded out. My favorite is the filler, but the \\&quot;lift\\&quot; products, including this one, do their job. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> came across roc almost by accident and thank goodness i did! their products are far better than any other more expensive brand i have tried (and liked far less). this product is exactly as described. it is my go to serum in the morning. every morning. it makes my skin feel nourished and firmer. i have now gone through two bottles and do not intend to switch to another brand. my only gripe would be that it contains no spf, however i hope roc will remedy this at some point in the near future.</li>
            <li> I guess for the price I should not have expected a lot, but when compared to other lifting serums I&#x27;ve tried, this didn&#x27;t really hold up (no pun-intended) to their abilities.  If you are on a budget, it&#x27;s okay, but for that quick lift, there are many other products that I&#x27;ve enjoyed more success with.  But, at a price about triple this one.</li>
            <li> RoC Complete Lift Serum with retinol will tighten and freshen up the skin on your face...it&#x27;s like a real face lift!  I love how it makes my skin feel.  Then to top it off, I use RoC eye lotion, but I use it all over my face and oooooooooooo, it feels so good.  RoC night cream is another topper on my list.  Try it all.  RoC with retinol!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janet</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this product @ all. I never saw or felt any difference . I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> i added this to my line of roc procducts and i really see a difference especially on my neck.  i have use alot of products thu amazon but have been set on roc products plus monthly peels.  love amazon</li>
            <li> I am using this product for many years and I really love it!  For me it is very good!  I will buy more soon!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the greatest products I have ever used.  I have tried many other brands and this one is the best.  I have been using ROC products for about 2 months and I have almost no wrinkles and my skin is firmed up SO MUCH!  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I really care about my skin and likes how this serum works. I use it after cleaning my face and then I apply sunscreen. Works really well for me!</li>
            <li> It is not bad but it doesn&#x27;t do anything ...maybe I don&#x27;t know what to look for but I know I won&#x27;t buy it again . I love Roc products but this one I thought it was useless .</li>
            <li> I have rather sagging eyelids and have been using this product on them as well as on other areas of my face(I am 53,btw).  This is probably the only serum/cream/moisturizer that I have ever used that decreases the sagginess.  If nothing else has worked on deep wrinkles, I suggest you try this for yourself.  Another plus is that it&#x27;s inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on other reviews. Originally, I was going to order a StriVectin product I have used for my neck before (much more expensive) but I thought I&#x27;d give this a try when I read how much everyone liked it. I tried it and was also pleased with the result. I use it mostly on my neck but also put some on my face. My neck is showing improvement (my main concern). I also do neck and facial exercises every day and I believe this is contributing to the results. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it last fall and did not really know what to expect. It was my first purchase of a serum. I am 34, Asian, and was not happy about my face. I felt my face was sagging, like literally sagging down. Facial expression looked sad, tired, and aged. Anyways, I started using it, may be once a week because I was very busy with my PhD and did not really know how to use it. I did not notice any results within two months and at some point stopped using it. But I noticed one day that my face contours looked great, cheekbones looked beautiful, the jaw line looked contoured and overall, my face looked plump and firm. I realized that it was effect of my ROC serum after a while. I went back to using it, I apply it may be once or twice a week before bed, under moisturizer. I apply it on my neck as well and sometimes, chest area. Believe me, it is a good product and its effect accumulates, don&#x27;t expect results in 2 weeks. All the damage we do to our skin cannot be undone in a month. By the way, it is very economical, you need tiny bit to cover your face. I am buying more ROC products.</li>
            <li> Last month I red review about it and I decided to buy to try it    In my opinion that cream do nothing  We really have to give a honest opinion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not done with the initial bottle yet - I do like how it feels on my skin but i have not noticed any difference yet.</li>
            <li> this RoC stuff is about $20 in the drug store.  Just go look in the drug store and compare prices.  It&#x27;s a decent product but dont get ripped off price wise.</li>
            <li> It does tightens a little, but it dries the skin a lot. It also does not last as much Iast I need it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product to give a lift to my skin, and after reading various reviews, I decided to give RoC CompleteLift Serum a try.  And boy did it deliver.  This is NOT a multi-functional product (that moisturizes, whitens, lifts, reduces wrinkle lines, refines pores, protects from UV, etc, etc all in one jar) but does best what it promises to do - lift.  After using it for a week or so, I could feel my face smoothened and \\&quot;toned\\&quot; up.  Now that I&#x27;m used to more \\&quot;tightened\\&quot; facial skin, I don&#x27;t think I can go back to not using it.  I still use my other skincare products for other purposes, but RoC CompleteLift Serum is THE lifting product for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a serum, not a cream, which means I don&#x27;t break out from this product as it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.  Love it, but finding it harder to find and since supplies are diminishing, this stuff is getting very expensive.  Not happy at all!</li>
            <li> I had a high hope for this one based on the other reviews and advertisement.  I applied it twice a day, morning and evening, for a month, and I don&#x27;t see any difference at all.  My skin does feel smooth after applying it but a good moisturizer would do the same.  I gave it 3 stars because it&#x27;s not expensive and smells good but if you look for something that \\&quot;lift\\&quot; and \\&quot;firm\\&quot; your face I don&#x27;t think this cream would help.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my friend and she is content with the product.&lt;br /&gt;However, when used continuously, there are some visible improvements in the skin complexion. It feels like she received a small face lift and looks very much younger after a while. She is more open to ROC products now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several months and I haven&#x27;t noticed anything from it.&lt;br /&gt;It appears to work for others just not for me.</li>
            <li> This is a pricey serum.  It is a good product.  I would use it again.  However, the price has to come down a bit.</li>
            <li> Excellent product from ROC</li>
            <li> RoC CompleteLift Serum feels soft on skin; it does not do anything other, but I do like how it feels.  Ok if you get the buy 1 get 50% off another ROC product.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this product although it takes a while to see results.  But I think that in time it does work.</li>
            <li> I find it has a nice creamy feeling, tingles and can be used under makeup.  This one was recommended for deeper wrinkles by a makeup clerk.  So far it&#x27;s worked well for my situation.</li>
            <li> This product makes my skin feel great. I have noticed a big difference since I&#x27;ve been using it on my skin.</li>
            <li> It works. That&#x27;s why I like it.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it says it will do. make your skin better.&lt;br /&gt;To men and women who want to have a healthier, younger look...buy this, and the accompanying products.</li>
            <li> I shied away from buying the Roc products because of the price and having tried so many products in the past that didn&#x27;t do as promised. I had been using Yonka salon quality products that I paid $200 for and wasn&#x27;t happy. Recently I was having a facial and the lady was telling me how dry my skin was. I asked her what product she recommended, expecting another $200 product. She told me the Roc products were excellent as far as over the counter products go. So I purchased the night cream, day cream spf30, eye cream, and serum. It promised visible results in 12 weeks. It has been 1 1/2 weeks and the results are clearly visible. The size of my pores has dramatically decreases and I look younger already. I see no reason to try another product again.</li>
            <li> I first received a sample of this product with RoC deep wrinkle night cream. Instructions said to first put on complete&lt;br /&gt;lift serum then the deep wrinkle night cream to seal it in.  WOW!! within a couple of days, I noticed a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;It just keep getting better.  This product does what it says it does without paying big bucks.  These two products&lt;br /&gt;are apart of my morning and night routine.</li>
            <li> seems okay....nothing seems to stop wrinkles sadly....as the commercial says, growing old, getting wrinkled, waiting for your wrinkle cream to work!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after using RoC Deep wrinkle night cream.  Although I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles I know they are coming.  I used this whole bottle in about a month and noticed by face is not as dry and my skin feels softer???? it&#x27;s not that it was rough before but it feels more moisturized and looks less dry.  I went to purchase more but I could not recall the exact name.  I tried Olay Regenerist Serum but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good.  Although my face is not dry, it does not feel as plumped up (in a good way) as RoC.</li>
            <li> I purchased RoC CompleteLift Serum for the 1st time. I DO think it is improving my skin. Only about 1/3 through the bottle, but my skin looks smoother and (maybe) tighter. I will difinitely buy this again!!! Next time I will give it 5 stars..if it keeps going this way.</li>
            <li> outside of a face peel or laser...its just another cream.  Wasted money on this one.  Would not order again, but will use until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> I love this lifting serum.  You can buy way more expensive stuff and it doesn&#x27;t even do as well as this does.</li>
            <li> Love the Complete Lift Serum. It seems to tighten facial skin. does what it claims. Use it twice a day</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money; in my opinion it&#x27;s a sticky substance!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It really works on minimizing pores on your face plus gives a tightening effect.  I wear it under my make-up and really like the results on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I am on my third bottle and am so happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I saw results within days. Very light, spreads nicely and evenly, feels and looks great. Small bottle but lasts long.</li>
            <li> Always seem to love the ROC product line. This one no exception. Use it every morning before my make up &amp; love the lift it gives my face.</li>
            <li> This really works - hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> May be my skin type but my skin did not like these Roc products at all.&lt;br /&gt;I saw where another review had problems too&lt;br /&gt;It left a sore on my chin so I quit using it for a while and tried later..&lt;br /&gt;Then I ended up with 2 sores on my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Now I am stuck with a whole regimen of this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Always buy 1 then buy the rest of the regimen.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft and I did not break out Two big pluses. I have not used itlong enough to see any big difference but I will repost after the bottle is empty and let you know how it works.</li>
            <li> I have been using this serum for a while now and have not seen any results as of yet,maybe it takes longer to see any noticeable results.what works for one does not mean it will work for everyone.i will finish the tube and keep watching for results.</li>
            <li> my skin is so smooth and my laso-labial lines are dimishing in just 3 days!!! ill buy again for sure!!!!!!</li>
