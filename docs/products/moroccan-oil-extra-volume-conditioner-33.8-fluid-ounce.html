            <li>and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>So, the Shampoos great.</li>
            <li>The company who shipped and sold the product is great.</li>
            <li>I have been using Moroccanoil products for over a year now, my hair looks great and has grown longer faster.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be fooled by cheaper products you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I love all of MoroccanOil products.</li>

            <li>and I personally love the Argan smell.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li>For the conditioner - surprisingly its really milky/creamy.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, the style easily keeps for two days.</li>
            <li>and I can easily make a bubble mask for hair..</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t even know counterfeit shampoos and conditioners existed, but this company made me very aware that they do exist!</li>
            <li>They are absolutely fantastic.</li>
            <li>I just smooth this over my hair without even combing it through and it is smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love this whole line of hair products.</li>
            <li>Extra Volume conditioner and Extra volume shampoo are great products.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and pleasing and your hair is left amazingly soft, yet full.</li>
            <li>In addition to the volume it gives my thin, fine hair, it also gives my hair a nice shine without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great conditioner, but product arrived with a broken, cracked, unusable pump.</li>
            <li>It works really well with my - used to be untamable hair.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it cleans really well</li>
            <li>This conditioner, not so much.</li>
            <li>The smell and texture isn&#x27;t anything like the real thing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair smelling amazing, feeling SO soft and silky and seems to get less tangles during the day.</li>
            <li>I love the oil, but the conditioner was just too heavy for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping my email to them will yield a new pump.</li>
            <li>conditioner is rather white, liquidish with a texure similar to the cheap ones from the Drug stores.</li>
            <li>This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found that makes the post-shower brush out of my ends easy, and lets my hair air dry without frizz.</li>
            <li>This conditioner really conditions and helps eliminate dry scalp conditions.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine but thick hair, my hair looks flat and heavy</li>

            <li> The. Best. Smelling. Product for your hair. And it does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner, but product arrived with a broken, cracked, unusable pump. It was well padded so it did not appear that the damage happened as a result of the shipping process, seller simply sold it this way without disclosing. Pretty disappointed about the pump, but I&#x27;m looking forward to using the conditioner itself. I&#x27;ve had it before and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> BUYER BEWARE! I receieved COUNTERFEIT Moroccan Oil Conditioner from this company! I didn&#x27;t even know counterfeit shampoos and conditioners existed, but this company made me very aware that they do exist! Moroccan Oil products are made in Canada, not Israel. DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCTS FROM THIS VENDOR!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have extremely tangle-prone hair, even with a Wet Brush. This is the only stuff I&#x27;ve found that makes the post-shower brush out of my ends easy, and lets my hair air dry without frizz. As a bonus, the style easily keeps for two days.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moraccon Shampoo and the conditioner for years.I am so positive that the conditioner from this seller is not authentic.The color, the smell and the texture is nothing like what I have been using for the past few years.&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is rather white, liquidish with a texure similar to the cheap ones from the Drug stores. Unfortunately, I opened it just now after a few months and I am not able to return it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner really conditions and helps eliminate dry scalp conditions.  In a cold dry climate skin drys out so quickly that this conditioner not only conditions the hair but has eliminated dry itchy scalp.</li>

            <li> I love all of MoroccanOil products. They are absolutely fantastic. Extra Volume conditioner and Extra volume shampoo are great products.</li>
            <li> The best volume hair product that I have ever used!! I have very fine but thick hair, my hair looks flat and heavy, I am very happy for the purchase.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve ever used this product - it speaks for itself</li>
            <li> Basically all of my hair products are from Moraccon Oil.  It works really well with my - used to be untamable hair.  So, the Shampoos great. It brings out alot bubbles and I can easily make a bubble mask for hair.. in my second wash. :) I feel like it cleans really well and I personally love the Argan smell. For the conditioner - surprisingly its really milky/creamy. Thought it would be thicker since I use there Hydrating Treatment.  I&#x27;m used to doing \\&quot;less is more\\&quot; with products but for this conditioner, don&#x27;t be shy. You should definitely cover your entire hair and use alot of it. I advise using the Hydrating treatment once a week, and apply the oil treatment before you blow dry everytime.  If you have thick, long, curly, untamable hair like me then you should definitely give this a try.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!!! This is not Moroccan Oil conditioner.  What a scam!!! It&#x27;s not the same texture and has a really terrible, musty odor.  And the pump was dirty which makes me think it was used and refilled by a cheap conditioner.</li>
            <li> The company who shipped and sold the product is great. This conditioner, not so much. I have natural curly hair and this conditioner weighed my hair down and was hard to rinse out. I love the oil, but the conditioner was just too heavy for my hair. I would recommend trying a small bottle and see how it works on your hair before buying a large one.</li>
            <li> I have been using Moroccanoil products for over a year now, my hair looks great and has grown longer faster.&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t be fooled by cheaper products you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY FAKE PRODUCT! I have been using Moroccan Oil Products for 5 years and this is not it. I have previously purchased the product through other providers on Amazon and have never had an issue. The smell and texture isn&#x27;t anything like the real thing. Save yourself the time and don&#x27;t purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  It is expensive, but it does the job like no other conditioner I have ever used.  When my hair is all tangled from washing it and feels like a web I just smooth this over my hair without even combing it through and it is smooth.  Also it smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and shampoo. It is just divine. In addition to the volume it gives my thin, fine hair, it also gives my hair a nice shine without weighing it down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the pump on one of the bottles I purchased is broken. I&#x27;m hoping my email to them will yield a new pump.</li>
