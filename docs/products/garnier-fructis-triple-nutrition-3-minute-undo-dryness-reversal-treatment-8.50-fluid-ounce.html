            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love love love this stuff.</li>
            <li>It smells great and conditions well, but not as good as any deep treatment conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>and my hair is in better condition than ever.</li>
            <li>and I have tried so many hair products.</li>
            <li>Really love this product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner makes my hair so shiny and so strong.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s helped my hair tremendously!</li>
            <li>I was worried that because it was so cheap</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product it truly is amazing</li>
            <li>I did not use it in conjunction with the shampoo or conditioner, so I cannot speak for them all together...but the reversal treatment seemed to do the job on its own with my normal shampoo routine.</li>
            <li>The free sample seemed to work better, but maybe there wasn&#x27;t as much humidity that day.</li>
            <li>I already tried many expensive products but this is the best thing i ever tried!</li>
            <li>They are lighter products and better for my particular type of hair.</li>
            <li>Teaming this line of products for super triple hydration has worked wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been super humid and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li>&amp; I can&#x27;t live without it!!!!</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena mask that comes in a jar and costs about the same as this is MUCH better!</li>
            <li>Shampoo, conditioners, smoothing milk then a flat&lt;br /&gt;iron gives smooth and silky straight hair.</li>
            <li>great hair product, left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love how soft my hair is afterwards, and the smell just adds to it.</li>
            <li>This mask is kind of gross.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and can say it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Very Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best product to use for dry hair especially if you color your hair!!</li>
            <li>I suffered some heat damage from hot curlers and blow drying.  </li>
            <li>When I rinsed it out in the morning my hair felt even thicker and so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I use all Garnier products and all work great for my thick frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li>This was my first Garnier purchase &amp; I got bought it at Targe.t; it was about $4.00 or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The conditioner is great for my dry hair every since my hair grew back after chemo and radiation</li>
            <li>It does work really well and moistens my dry, fine hair!</li>
            <li>This is great for those who have weak hair, which is prone to splitting and damage.</li>
            <li>It is rather concentrated, so I don&#x27;t have to use much.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well.  </li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>After the shower, I noticed my hair was a bit more shiny, but nothing at all what I expected.</li>
            <li>and I use a shampoo that can be very drying to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It washed out very well.  </li>
            <li>The pros I guess would be that it smells good (like fruits), the little extra shine you get, and it tames frizzies, although I don&#x27;t have much to tame.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It made my hair very soft and it was much smoother after my blow-dry.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>REALLY makes my hair soft and resistant to frizz.</li>
            <li>My curls are soft and very  bouncy....</li>
            <li>I followed all the directions and used my normal shampoo.</li>
            <li>So, the product works like a normal conditioner: it moisturizers my hair and makes it softer, WHILE I was in the shower.</li>
            <li>I have short short colored hair and it works fabulous scent</li>
            <li>Very soft &amp; touchable.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and manageable after use.</li>
            <li>but i was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair really soft though, so what I do</li>
            <li>Made my hair really soft.</li>
            <li>I like the product, but I was expecting my hair to feel soft and silky, like</li>
            <li>Buyer beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase the product, because it&#x27;s really not anything special.</li>
            <li>I used it every time I put a new relaxer in, it brings back moisture and softness.</li>
            <li>My hair was in such bad shape, I never thought it would be nice &amp; soft again, but this conditioner has really repaired a lot of the damage that I had done!  </li>
            <li>This product is one of several that Garnier offers.  </li>
            <li>maybe my skin is just sensitive but after using it last night before bed</li>
            <li>I have pretty thick frizzy/wavy hair, and it really helped to manage it.  </li>
            <li>Keeping it in for exactly 3 minutes, does in fact deep conditions very dry and unruly hair!  </li>
            <li>product is thick, rich, fragrant &amp; textured,  Not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I buy multiple tubes of it and its still cheaper than I would pay at any of the local places near me.</li>
            <li>Garnier decided to water it down - significantly water it down.</li>
            <li>I have extremely dry hair from over-coloring it &amp; this conditioner has made it soft and manageable again.</li>
            <li>The first time, it proved to be too heavy, so I cut back on the amount.  </li>
            <li>It strengthens the hair and holds the moisture in, also makes your hair very soft while wet.</li>
            <li>I have split end and dry hair due to dying it to much.</li>

            <li> it has never been the same very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and this conditioner works wonders!!!  </li>
            <li> I use it about 2 times a week and on the other days, I just use my regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> Almost all of that damage has been repaired by using this 3 Minute Undo while washing my hair and using the heat protector and  leave in conditioner after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair had been feeling really dry and cracking, so I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> It takes the dry, brittle feeling away with one use.</li>
            <li> I use it daily, on my daughter&#x27;s tight, kinky curls and it helps detangle and moisturizes well.</li>
            <li> I used it after shampooing, massaged it in with extra attention to the ends and then used a shower cap to cover my hair for a few hours.</li>
            <li> Who ever says it doesn&#x27;t work due to them having straw like hair.</li>
            <li> I prefer their other products, i.e., the 2 minute and the 1 minute undos.  </li>
            <li> I usually leave this on for three minutes, but I also use it as a deep conditioner and it makes my hair feel like silk.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent so much money on expensive hair products &amp; none</li>
            <li> hair is long, color-treated, wavy/curly and has been getting dryer and harder to handle lately.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same thick cream</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m noticing less dryness with continued use.</li>
            <li> I rinsed for a long time, because conditioner is hard to get out.</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little too Bath &amp; Body Works synthetic for me</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my twist out, I had bouncy, full,well defined curls with little frizz.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s yellow and it has these weird beads in it, which sometimes I have trouble washing out.</li>
            <li> Helped very little with the frizz.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick and textured.</li>
            <li> It just looks and feels worse.</li>
            <li> but it moisturizes like crazy-</li>
            <li> It has become almost impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I have had to take 3 showers to undo the itchy awful scalp and skin caused by this product.  </li>

            <li> My hair is soft and manageable after use. I&#x27;m noticing less dryness with continued use.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but I&#x27;m feeling compelled to do so because this product used to be great. Garnier decided to water it down - significantly water it down. It&#x27;s now ineffective. Avoid this product! It&#x27;s a waste of money. The Neutrogena mask that comes in a jar and costs about the same as this is MUCH better!</li>
            <li> I already tried many expensive products but this is the best thing i ever tried! If you read this buy it!!!!</li>
            <li> Love love this I have short short colored hair and it works fabulous scent is awesome. Who ever says it doesn&#x27;t work due to them having straw like hair. .DON&#x27;T blame the product it&#x27;s your\\&quot;Straw like HAIR\\&quot;!!&lt;br /&gt;IT didn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker . All their products are A1 great!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> This product is one of several that Garnier offers.  It is rather concentrated, so I don&#x27;t have to use much.  The first time, it proved to be too heavy, so I cut back on the amount.  I prefer their other products, i.e., the 2 minute and the 1 minute undos.

            <li> The free sample seemed to work better, but maybe there wasn&#x27;t as much humidity that day.</li>
            <li> I love almost every item I&#x27;ve ever purchased from Garnier Fructis, and this stuff is no exception. This 3 Minute Undo Dryness Reversal Treatment met and exceeded my expectations for a repairing conditioner. I used it after shampooing, massaged it in with extra attention to the ends and then used a shower cap to cover my hair for a few hours. At the end of the night, I rinsed it out and dryed it. My hair felt wonderfully conditioned without undue buildup and had a nice shine and very fresh scent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is long, color-treated, wavy/curly and has been getting dryer and harder to handle lately. (I&#x27;ve got some of those wiry-grays coming in.) This conditioner is perfection and cheap! If you have hair problems, you will definitely notice the results, especially if you give it extra time to work.</li>
            <li> My hair needs this once a week to look healthy and shiny. I love this!</li>
            <li> great hair product, left my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product in addition to the shampoo and conditioner for a couple months now. I absolutely love how soft my hair is afterwards, and the smell just adds to it. I generally only use this product once or twice a week and it&#x27;s helped my hair tremendously! I tell everyone about it!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I lather it on leave it for about an hour then rinse it out there&#x27;s no need to even shampoo does wonders for your hair</li>
            <li> Great for frizz free curly hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for awhile now and it works really well.  I have relaxed hair.  I suffered some heat damage from hot curlers and blow drying.  Almost all of that damage has been repaired by using this 3 Minute Undo while washing my hair and using the heat protector and  leave in conditioner after I blow dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I put on on my dry hair and left it on overnight. I have split end and dry hair due to dying it to much. ( I work at a salon ) haha. When I rinsed it out in the morning my hair felt even thicker and so soft and smooth. You&#x27;ve gotta try it!</li>
            <li> The fragrance is a little too Bath &amp; Body Works synthetic for me but it moisturizes like crazy-</li>
            <li> Teaming this line of products for super triple hydration has worked wonders for my hair. I have tried the most expensive lines pf products....but nothing came close to these products br Garnier Fructis Triple Nutrition.</li>
            <li> I use all Garnier products and all work great for my thick frizzy hair.  Shampoo, conditioners, smoothing milk then a flat&lt;br /&gt;iron gives smooth and silky straight hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely dry hair from over-coloring it &amp; this conditioner has made it soft and manageable again. I use it about 2 times a week and on the other days, I just use my regular conditioner. My hair was in such bad shape, I never thought it would be nice &amp; soft again, but this conditioner has really repaired a lot of the damage that I had done!  Very Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighted down.  It has become almost impossible to find in stores.</li>
            <li> Not as moisturizing as I had hoped. Helped very little with the frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product just once and my hair is already noticeably different. I also used it with the triple nutrition shampoo and conditioner. I was worried that because it was so cheap I would not get very good results, if any but i was pleasantly surprised. I love love love this stuff. I will update in about a month or so to see if my hair continues to show improvement or not</li>
            <li> This mask is kind of gross. It&#x27;s yellow and it has these weird beads in it, which sometimes I have trouble washing out. If you can deal with that, then you won&#x27;t have a problem with this. It does make my hair really soft though, so what I do (I leave it on way longer than 3 minutes) is after shampooing, I put a glob of this in my hair and finger comb it through. I twist my hair into a bun, rinse it out, and then I have shiny, manageable hair.</li>
            <li> It strengthens the hair and holds the moisture in, also makes your hair very soft while wet. This is great for those who have weak hair, which is prone to splitting and damage. It protects the hair and feels instantly stronger. I&#x27;ve been using it for months now and can say it is worth every penny. Extremely good product.</li>
            <li> I am a Caucasian female with coarse, wavy hair. My hair had been feeling really dry and cracking, so I purchased this product. I followed all the directions and used my normal shampoo. I rinsed for a long time, because conditioner is hard to get out. My hair feels straw-like now.  It just looks and feels worse.</li>
            <li> Works great. Made my hair really soft. I used it every time I put a new relaxer in, it brings back moisture and softness. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair prone to dryness and frizziness. Using this REALLY makes my hair soft and resistant to frizz. It&#x27;s been super humid and my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz. Great product. I have a friend who was a cosmetologist-turned-scientist who worked for both Loreal and Proctor &amp; Gamble and she says Garnier does the best job of mimicking salon-grade products. For the price, this is a very good product!</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick and textured. It smells great and conditions well, but not as good as any deep treatment conditioners I&#x27;ve ever used. I use it daily, on my daughter&#x27;s tight, kinky curls and it helps detangle and moisturizes well. When I want to deep condition I use an Olive deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> So, the product works like a normal conditioner: it moisturizers my hair and makes it softer, WHILE I was in the shower. After the shower, I noticed my hair was a bit more shiny, but nothing at all what I expected. I like the product, but I was expecting my hair to feel soft and silky, like a deep conditioner&#x27;s supposed to help your hair achieve. My hair wasn&#x27;t any softer when I got out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The pros I guess would be that it smells good (like fruits), the little extra shine you get, and it tames frizzies, although I don&#x27;t have much to tame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t repurchase the product, because it&#x27;s really not anything special.</li>
            <li> I just received a sample of this in the mail and I cannot wait to purchase this product!  It made my hair very soft and it was much smoother after my blow-dry.  I have pretty thick frizzy/wavy hair, and it really helped to manage it.  I definitely would recommend this treatment to anyone with damaged or dried-out hair.  I did not use it in conjunction with the shampoo or conditioner, so I cannot speak for them all together...but the reversal treatment seemed to do the job on its own with my normal shampoo routine.</li>
            <li> I have had to take 3 showers to undo the itchy awful scalp and skin caused by this product.  maybe my skin is just sensitive but after using it last night before bed i am COVERED in zits (giant sebaceous ones) and i am soooo itchy that i want to crawl out of my skin.  Buyer beware if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i would give this 5 stars but every time i put it throughout my hair i have a allergic reaction and my scalp gets itchy. I&#x27;ve used it about 4-5 times and every time my scalp itches. This doesn&#x27;t happen with all my deep conditioners. It does work really well and moistens my dry, fine hair!</li>
            <li> I have thick naturally curly hair and this conditioner works wonders!!!  Keeping it in for exactly 3 minutes, does in fact deep conditions very dry and unruly hair!  My curls are soft and very  bouncy....love this conditioner.  Works like a hair mask, and the longer you keep it in the softer it becomes.  It also smells delicious!!!  A++++++++</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product to use for dry hair especially if you color your hair!! It takes the dry, brittle feeling away with one use. I&#x27;ve spent so much money on expensive hair products &amp; none do what this does for your hair! I highly recommend this product it truly is amazing &amp; I can&#x27;t live without it!!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is sooo good to my hair.  I decided to try this because I have a scalp condition and I use a shampoo that can be very drying to my hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this treatment for a year now and my hair is in better condition than ever. I usually leave this on for three minutes, but I also use it as a deep conditioner and it makes my hair feel like silk.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any change in the formulation.  It&#x27;s the same thick cream it&#x27;s always been.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I like all of these products . The conditioner is great for my dry hair every since my hair grew back after chemo and radiation it has never been the same very dry.  This is best so far and I have tried so many hair products.</li>
            <li> This was my first Garnier purchase &amp; I got bought it at Targe.t; it was about $4.00 or so.&lt;br /&gt;The product is thick, rich, fragrant &amp; textured,  Not oily at all.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product as a  deep condition/co-wash.  It washed out very well.  I followed up  with SM Restorative Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;After my twist out, I had bouncy, full,well defined curls with little frizz.  Very soft &amp; touchable.&lt;br /&gt;Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> Really love this product. I buy multiple tubes of it and its still cheaper than I would pay at any of the local places near me. This conditioner makes my hair so shiny and so strong. I highly recommend it.</li>
