            <li>Yes this is pretty great stuff.  </li>

            <li>Well, I want to love this product b/c I am Hungarian but both times my sister used it</li>

            <li>I love love love this masque.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this mask.  </li>
            <li>Works really well, smells great, invigorating.  </li>
            <li>but it has phenomenal results!!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried Proactive, Origins, Clinique, AdvoCare, and much more</li>
            <li>Great mask for sensitive, acne prone skin!</li>
            <li>It makes my skin bright red, but is amazing after about an hour.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look amazing and got a lot of compliments on my face after I used it the first time.  </li>
            <li>, that has been this effective this fast.</li>
            <li>Personally, it works great for me</li>
            <li>I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed much from it at all.  </li>
            <li>It does get tingly, but I enjoy that because it means something is happening.  </li>
            <li>It works wonderfully for little spots or breakouts!  </li>
            <li>So I mixed the two products and this was the best application I&#x27;ve had so far</li>
            <li>Makes it look radiant and clean in the morning after evening application.</li>
            <li>I have tried several mud masks and this is the best one by far.</li>
            <li>It brightened my skin and gave me a beautiful glow lasting the whole day.</li>
            <li>Bright red face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stated just applying this product straight on does nothing really visually appealing to my skin</li>
            <li>I have yet to try it as full mask but am looking forward to it.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any expectations going into trying this product, but it dries quickly</li>
            <li>I knew I could find it here for way more of a decent price.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t exactly apply smoothly.  </li>
            <li>It has a very hot (spicy) type feel to it when applied that may not be to everyone&#x27;s liking.  </li>
            <li>This masque is so very hot.</li>
            <li>Now, the product does smell really good (like the holidays) and it burns so deep into your skin that it often leaves my skin smelling nice easily through the next day (which I did really</li>
            <li>Hot the first time but fine after that.  </li>
            <li>After years of trying stuff out, I don&#x27;t purchase anything unless I&#x27;ve tried it first without spending money on the full product.  </li>
            <li>It may burn at firat, but the results are very much worth it.</li>
            <li>It is soooo worth it though.</li>
            <li>Although this product is great, it&#x27;s definitely not for the sensitive skinned dame.</li>
            <li>I knew she won&#x27;t get her money&#x27;s worth out of it.</li>
            <li>when I apply it, I have to use my blowdryer on cool to take away the burning sensation for the first minute.</li>
            <li>The first time, I gave up too quickly and didn&#x27;t feel the results.</li>
            <li>This is a really great product, it leaves my pores tight and glowing when done!</li>
            <li>I IMMEDIATELY felt a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and tone, she was also right about it bringing things up.</li>
            <li>I just got this in the mail yesterday and gave it a try right away.</li>
            <li>and the new skin is so smooth &amp; soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i know there is sticker saying its HOT, but man is it HOTTTTT&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i literally wanted to scream the first time i put it on, the first 10-15 mins were brutal!!!&lt;br /&gt;it does make all the blackheads softer and easier to remove..</li>
            <li>STINGS when you first put it on -</li>
            <li>My favorite mixture with this masque is the clear skin probiotic masque - this combo always makes my acne-prone skin look fantastic the next day.</li>
            <li>but the cinnamon and spices in the mud gets hot on your face at first)  </li>
            <li>and this was the first &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty tolerate</li>
            <li>The herbal mud stings a bit when you first apply to skin, but subsides in about a minute.  </li>
            <li>The hybrid masque treatment was a gentle burn/tingle (that did not require zen meditation), I was able to peel it off in the morning with no dry patches and that start of the healing</li>
            <li>the only downside is, it burns sooooo much!!!!</li>
            <li>Right after I rinsed it off, my skin was so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>Is hot at first but subsides and leaves skin feeling soft and pores clean.</li>
            <li>Yes, it turns my face red, bright red...</li>
            <li>I use only twice a month so this jar easily lasts a year.</li>
            <li>This mask will make your face red for a little bit and gets hot but it makes your face feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high pain tolerance</li>
            <li>Burns like hell for a few minutes and it&#x27;ll take up to an hour for your face to fade from cherry red to a rosy glow, but if you can take the burn then this product is awesome, especially for breakouts.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>This burned too much for my taste...</li>
            <li>it really does prevent breakouts and pimples.</li>
            <li>it really really stings.</li>
            <li>It really does seem to help as spot treatment or all over mask for acne.&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li>this stuff is really</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and a lot of clogged pores.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you like your face to look refreshed!</li>
            <li>I love the tingly heat that comes on right away, and yes it dissipates after a few moments.</li>
            <li>Knowing what to expect the second time (the quick hot onset), I dealt with the heat because I know that is part of the medicine</li>
            <li>I can feel and see that they&#x27;re healing now and the irritation has been SIGNIFICANTLY reduced, literally from ten minutes of this on my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried eminence products in the past and really liked them, but never this</li>
            <li>an attempt to try to see full benefits of this product I&#x27;ve played around with applications such as Overnight (sleeping in it)--</li>
            <li>usually put it on and then use a blow dryer on cool and after 30 seconds its fine.</li>
            <li>Just bought a new one again !</li>
            <li>It is a hot mask and does &#x27;burn&#x27; but  only  for a minute and t really isn&#x27;t very intense.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; goes away as quick as you are applying the mask to the next area of your face.  </li>
            <li>but I wish the prices weren&#x27;t so high for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it highly to anyone who is wondering........</li>
            <li>First, I have acne-prone (aka adult acne), sensitive, and oily skin</li>
            <li>but I really had to dig deep when I first applied this masque.</li>
            <li>now after 20-30 minutes my face stopped looking like a bright red balloon; However, if you do Any extractions, be warned -- all extractions on my face remained big red blotches the Entire day</li>
            <li>That I could live with.  </li>
            <li>Makes a noticeable difference - worth the price because you really do not use much at all with each application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suggest this at all on one attempt it look off a layer of skins when I spot treated and on another it created super dry patches.</li>
            <li>i have acne-prone skin which is also very sensitive to products like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and retin-a</li>
            <li>For those with extra sensitive skin, you may want to steer clear of this, as it heats up pretty well on skin up to my brains!</li>
            <li>I have adult acne &amp; Eminence is the answer!  </li>
            <li>This is definitely a new must have for my skin care regiment as well as the clear skin masque.</li>
            <li>Afterwards she used the clear skin masque.</li>
            <li>It worked like a charm on my oily T-zone and the next day my skin feels and looks much healthier</li>
            <li>My sister even offered to split it with me and I declined because she&#x27;s so sensitive</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t consider it &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; &amp; I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft and my pores were cleaned out after one use.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended and works so far...</li>
            <li>I have combo skin w adult hormonal acne and this mask seems to be helping.</li>
            <li>The package directions indicated that the product was somewhat thick and one would be able to dilute it for easier application by putting the needed amount of mud in the palm of the hand and then add a small amount of water to make the consistency smooth.</li>
            <li>I had a facial recently at a really high end spa and the girl used this on me along with the clear skin masque.</li>
            <li>All the yucky white heads I had, dried up and were easily removable.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people who have extremely sensitive skin, due to the hot tingling sensation it gives.</li>
            <li>I really just felt it was deep cleaning my pores of any possible bacteria after an extraction session</li>
            <li>plus the consistency will make it last much longer than a regular 2 ounce mask</li>
            <li>cuz after you wash it off and the redness goes away you are left with clear soft skin.</li>
            <li>and my skin was more delicate than usual, but for me the feeling of my face burning isn&#x27;t worth the results.</li>
            <li>But about this product in general (I&#x27;ve purchased it before from a spa)...</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m tan and this made my face clearly, unattractive red for the day.</li>
            <li>This item has a little &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; initially but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li>I would say it is less hot than the stimulating lime masque but hotter than 8 greens.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hot and has a slight sting after applied.  </li>
            <li>One little spot on my cheek became redder and a little more</li>
            <li>(and truthfully there are better and less painful ways to accomplish this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and yes, the large pores on my nose had gone down.  </li>
            <li>It got hot and dried in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>I felt a little bit of a tingle when I first applied it, but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>Works well, but it smells like black licorice (which I really don&#x27;t like).</li>
            <li>It tingles at first and makes my skin red for a few minutes, but it goes away</li>
            <li>so I like to think it does kill some bacteria under the skin) but leaves dry patches and does not start the healing process for me which is crucial for acne &amp; sensitive skin.</li>

            <li> I IMMEDIATELY felt a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and tone, she was also right about it bringing things up.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday and gave it a try right away.</li>
            <li> and the new skin is so smooth &amp; soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i know there is sticker saying its HOT, but man is it HOTTTTT&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i literally wanted to scream the first time i put it on, the first 10-15 mins were brutal!!!&lt;br /&gt;it does make all the blackheads softer and easier to remove..</li>
            <li> STINGS when you first put it on -</li>
            <li> My favorite mixture with this masque is the clear skin probiotic masque - this combo always makes my acne-prone skin look fantastic the next day.</li>
            <li> but the cinnamon and spices in the mud gets hot on your face at first)  </li>
            <li> and this was the first &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty tolerate</li>
            <li> The herbal mud stings a bit when you first apply to skin, but subsides in about a minute.  </li>
            <li> The hybrid masque treatment was a gentle burn/tingle (that did not require zen meditation), I was able to peel it off in the morning with no dry patches and that start of the healing</li>
            <li> the only downside is, it burns sooooo much!!!!</li>
            <li> Right after I rinsed it off, my skin was so much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Is hot at first but subsides and leaves skin feeling soft and pores clean.</li>
            <li> Yes, it turns my face red, bright red...</li>
            <li> I use only twice a month so this jar easily lasts a year.</li>
            <li> This mask will make your face red for a little bit and gets hot but it makes your face feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have a pretty high pain tolerance</li>
            <li> Burns like hell for a few minutes and it&#x27;ll take up to an hour for your face to fade from cherry red to a rosy glow, but if you can take the burn then this product is awesome, especially for breakouts.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> This burned too much for my taste...</li>
            <li> it really does prevent breakouts and pimples.</li>
            <li> it really really stings.</li>
            <li> It really does seem to help as spot treatment or all over mask for acne.&lt;br /&gt;Down</li>
            <li> this stuff is really</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and a lot of clogged pores.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you like your face to look refreshed!</li>
            <li> I love the tingly heat that comes on right away, and yes it dissipates after a few moments.</li>
            <li> Knowing what to expect the second time (the quick hot onset), I dealt with the heat because I know that is part of the medicine</li>
            <li> I can feel and see that they&#x27;re healing now and the irritation has been SIGNIFICANTLY reduced, literally from ten minutes of this on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried eminence products in the past and really liked them, but never this</li>
            <li> an attempt to try to see full benefits of this product I&#x27;ve played around with applications such as Overnight (sleeping in it)--</li>
            <li> usually put it on and then use a blow dryer on cool and after 30 seconds its fine.</li>
            <li> Just bought a new one again !</li>
            <li> It is a hot mask and does &#x27;burn&#x27; but  only  for a minute and t really isn&#x27;t very intense.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; goes away as quick as you are applying the mask to the next area of your face.  </li>
            <li> but I wish the prices weren&#x27;t so high for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it highly to anyone who is wondering........</li>
            <li> First, I have acne-prone (aka adult acne), sensitive, and oily skin</li>
            <li> but I really had to dig deep when I first applied this masque.</li>
            <li> now after 20-30 minutes my face stopped looking like a bright red balloon; However, if you do Any extractions, be warned -- all extractions on my face remained big red blotches the Entire day</li>
            <li> That I could live with.  </li>
            <li> Makes a noticeable difference - worth the price because you really do not use much at all with each application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t suggest this at all on one attempt it look off a layer of skins when I spot treated and on another it created super dry patches.</li>
            <li> i have acne-prone skin which is also very sensitive to products like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and retin-a</li>
            <li> For those with extra sensitive skin, you may want to steer clear of this, as it heats up pretty well on skin up to my brains!</li>
            <li> I have adult acne &amp; Eminence is the answer!  </li>
            <li> This is definitely a new must have for my skin care regiment as well as the clear skin masque.</li>
            <li> Afterwards she used the clear skin masque.</li>
            <li> It worked like a charm on my oily T-zone and the next day my skin feels and looks much healthier</li>
            <li> My sister even offered to split it with me and I declined because she&#x27;s so sensitive</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t consider it &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; &amp; I have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft and my pores were cleaned out after one use.  </li>
            <li> It was recommended and works so far...</li>
            <li> I have combo skin w adult hormonal acne and this mask seems to be helping.</li>
            <li> The package directions indicated that the product was somewhat thick and one would be able to dilute it for easier application by putting the needed amount of mud in the palm of the hand and then add a small amount of water to make the consistency smooth.</li>
            <li> I had a facial recently at a really high end spa and the girl used this on me along with the clear skin masque.</li>
            <li> All the yucky white heads I had, dried up and were easily removable.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people who have extremely sensitive skin, due to the hot tingling sensation it gives.</li>
            <li> I really just felt it was deep cleaning my pores of any possible bacteria after an extraction session</li>
            <li> plus the consistency will make it last much longer than a regular 2 ounce mask</li>
            <li> cuz after you wash it off and the redness goes away you are left with clear soft skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin was more delicate than usual, but for me the feeling of my face burning isn&#x27;t worth the results.</li>
            <li> But about this product in general (I&#x27;ve purchased it before from a spa)...</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m tan and this made my face clearly, unattractive red for the day.</li>
            <li> This item has a little &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; initially but it goes away quickly.  </li>
            <li> I would say it is less hot than the stimulating lime masque but hotter than 8 greens.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot and has a slight sting after applied.  </li>
            <li> One little spot on my cheek became redder and a little more</li>
            <li> (and truthfully there are better and less painful ways to accomplish this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and yes, the large pores on my nose had gone down.  </li>
            <li> It got hot and dried in 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> I felt a little bit of a tingle when I first applied it, but it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it smells like black licorice (which I really don&#x27;t like).</li>
            <li> It tingles at first and makes my skin red for a few minutes, but it goes away</li>
            <li> so I like to think it does kill some bacteria under the skin) but leaves dry patches and does not start the healing process for me which is crucial for acne &amp; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> (among a host of other triggers), so anytime I try a new product I go into it aware that there&#x27;s at least a 50-50 chance of it breaking it out/drying me out rather than helping anything.</li>
            <li> My skin is also sensitive along w all the other issues and this mask suits well.</li>
            <li> Also my pores seem to be clearing up w no major breakouts.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product works long term.  </li>
            <li> It was a long week, I can assure you.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to actually find beauty products that actually live up to its claims.</li>
            <li> My face is red after use but only for less than 1 hr.</li>
            <li> I would suggest using this at night before bedtime to avoid, so you can sleep off the redness, but in this application my skin did not start to heal, created dry spots, and my acne did not improve --</li>
            <li> Not surprising... due to the hot paprika in it..</li>
            <li> the instructions say since the consistency is pretty thin and use it as it</li>
            <li> its been a couple of months since this happened, but when I received this product the seal was half open, so I never used it because it seemed sketchy.</li>
            <li> I applied it with a little water so it was diluted and left it on for 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> At the time i applied it last night my skin around my jawline and on my cheeks was pre-breakout-- lots of little congested bumps under the skin.</li>
            <li> I would imagine the redness might last a little longer also.</li>
            <li> My skin was a little red afterwards, which it says will happen.  </li>
            <li> and I figured the people who complained about this burning are just really sensitive people</li>
            <li> It killed and revitalized my entire epidermis.</li>
            <li> I thought this product was expensive but after using it, I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s worth every penny-</li>
            <li> I tend to mix it with other creamier masques.  </li>
            <li> It burns (well not really burn!</li>
            <li> Just a little bit overnight helps dry up problem areas!  </li>
            <li> so it should last at least 3 months because I only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> The product consistency is very thin, so I could not dilute it with water and applied just straight on (until I found a semi-solution).</li>
            <li> The product was extremely watery and, thus, quite messy.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it has a strange texture (watery, but thick)</li>
            <li> I suggest caution if purchasing this product and you have not used it previously.</li>
            <li> &gt; 2.There is a slight sting in the beginning which goes away.</li>
            <li> It burns like mad when you first put it on, but the burning goes away after about a minute or two.  </li>
            <li> It killed my cystic acne</li>
            <li> After a few minutes it goes away.  </li>
            <li> You may need a bag over your head for a few days.</li>
            <li> one.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it was not what i&#x27;d call either hot or painful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like it melts the hard dead layer of skin instead of peeling it</li>
            <li> I ended up mixing it in the lid and then applying it, but I was not able to apply it evenly.  </li>
            <li> but Ill keep searching for a similar product that doesn&#x27;t cost $$$.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for the past year.</li>
            <li> The mud treatment requires a thicker product for dilution (other than water) as I said because the treatment itself is very thin and mixing with water would make a mess.</li>
            <li> Perhaps, it was a bad reaction, but I have read other reviews that said the same.  </li>
            <li> and I found it extremely hard to adapt to my skin.</li>
            <li> Initial application it burns bad as the product reacts with the water.  </li>
            <li> I say, Don&#x27;t give up, breath and if you see negative reviews, try this mask for yourself!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the consistency of this product needed no dilution because it was already thin and watery which was unexpected and very disappointing.</li>
            <li> and if you&#x27;ve already broken out, it does reduce the pimples.</li>
            <li> Its burns but just for a minute, its not as bad as some people make it out to be in other reviews.</li>
            <li> and yes, it is liquid-like and thin, but it works!  </li>
            <li> I am obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> The part that took me by surprise, however, was the fact that I got the worst breakout that I had ever gotten IN MY LIFE, the following week.  </li>
            <li> I think she is afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> its very expensive.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> great product, and its HOT..i know there is sticker saying its HOT, but man is it HOTTTTT&lt;br /&gt;i literally wanted to scream the first time i put it on, the first 10-15 mins were brutal!!!&lt;br /&gt;it does make all the blackheads softer and easier to remove..great product to use in between facials, it will almost unclog the gunk lol</li>
            <li> I meant to write this review a while ago... its been a couple of months since this happened, but when I received this product the seal was half open, so I never used it because it seemed sketchy. Never returned it because let&#x27;s be honest, returning things that you bought on line is the worst/most inconvenient thing. But about this product in general (I&#x27;ve purchased it before from a spa)... it&#x27;s so awesome! Burns like hell for a few minutes and it&#x27;ll take up to an hour for your face to fade from cherry red to a rosy glow, but if you can take the burn then this product is awesome, especially for breakouts. Definitely don&#x27;t use if you have severe rosacea/broken capillaries/sensitivity</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome!  Hot the first time but fine after that.  Blows drug store facial masks out of the water.</li>
            <li> I have used Eminence products for years but recently decided to increase the amount of them I use with layering multiple products. In my search of eminence products I came across this and had to try it. It&#x27;s GREAT. I love the tingly heat that comes on right away, and yes it dissipates after a few moments. It brightened my skin and gave me a beautiful glow lasting the whole day. I also took the advice of another reviewer and used it as a spot treatment. It&#x27;s great for that, too.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it helps reduce my breakouts and my pores appear to be smaller. I only use it twice a week so it should last at least 3 months because I only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I tried this product from a local beauty store and went to Amazon to check out prices.  The only review of this masque is not the same experience I had.  I&#x27;ve had oily skin in the T-Zone area forever.  I have not used a masque that actually lived up to its \\&quot;closes pores\\&quot; claim.  Well, for anyone who has used a variety of masques over the years, you know that there is a wide range of textures from thick, liquid, grainy, smooth etc.  I didn&#x27;t have any expectations going into trying this product, but it dries quickly and yes, it is liquid-like and thin, but it works!  I applied it at night and when I woke up my skin color seemed more even and yes, the large pores on my nose had gone down.  I did not give this a 5 star rating b/c I don&#x27;t know how this product works long term.  I&#x27;m going to keep using this product on the t-zone area and if I have any updates, I&#x27;ll respond. I also recommend the 8 greens phyto masque from this collection.  That masque also did wonders and added the \\&quot;glow\\&quot; the company claims to be a result of the product.  It&#x27;s hard to actually find beauty products that actually live up to its claims. Good luck finding the product that works best for you and try to get trial sizes of anything before you spend lots of money on beauty products!  After years of trying stuff out, I don&#x27;t purchase anything unless I&#x27;ve tried it first without spending money on the full product.  A company that lives up to its claims should offer trial sizes.</li>
            <li> I have combination/sensitive skin and this mask will instantly reduce the size of your breakouts and pores. It will also help even out your skin tone. It may burn at firat, but the results are very much worth it. I have heard of the great effects of Hungarian mud/ thermal water and gave this mask a try. It is now my go to as well as the Garlic and Tomato mask which makes your face look flawless because of the plastic like texture.</li>
            <li> Well, I want to love this product b/c I am Hungarian but both times my sister used it (I bought for her as a gift) she had a reaction. Bright red face. Not surprising... due to the hot paprika in it.. but it took a while to go away. I think she is afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> STINGS when you first put it on - but after a minute or two it stops. It is soooo worth it though. I am obsessed with this stuff. Makes a noticeable difference - worth the price because you really do not use much at all with each application. I use 100% pure rose water as a toner afterwards - a perfect combination! (Note: I have oil/combination skin)</li>
            <li> This product is like a gel rather than a mud. I followed the directions and added water also, which made it virtually disappear in my hand. I ended up mixing it in the lid and then applying it, but I was not able to apply it evenly.  I hoped for the best however and  was not disappointed. It got hot and dried in 5 minutes. It worked like a charm on my oily T-zone and the next day my skin feels and looks much healthier and I think my pores are smaller too.</li>
            <li> Came as advertised.  Great product.</li>
            <li> The product was extremely watery and, thus, quite messy. The package directions indicated that the product was somewhat thick and one would be able to dilute it for easier application by putting the needed amount of mud in the palm of the hand and then add a small amount of water to make the consistency smooth. Unfortunately, the consistency of this product needed no dilution because it was already thin and watery which was unexpected and very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I had a facial recently at a really high end spa and the girl used this on me along with the clear skin masque. She did warn me this burns and I didn&#x27;t really care. I have a pretty high pain tolerance and I figured the people who complained about this burning are just really sensitive people but boy did it burn! Still not enough for me to ask her to take it off... But yes, I did feel the heat! She said its great at bringing things clogged in your pores up to the skin&#x27;s surface. Afterwards she used the clear skin masque. My face recently EXPLODED after having a baby and being on birth control. I IMMEDIATELY felt a difference in my skin&#x27;s texture and tone, she was also right about it bringing things up. All the yucky white heads I had, dried up and were easily removable.  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t buy this at the spa because honestly it was $56. I knew I could find it here for way more of a decent price. This is definitely a new must have for my skin care regiment as well as the clear skin masque. Although this product is great, it&#x27;s definitely not for the sensitive skinned dame. My sister even offered to split it with me and I declined because she&#x27;s so sensitive I knew she won&#x27;t get her money&#x27;s worth out of it. This is a great product! Smells like Christmas too!</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and just put this mask on for the second time. The first time, I gave up too quickly and didn&#x27;t feel the results. Knowing what to expect the second time (the quick hot onset), I dealt with the heat because I know that is part of the medicine and I fanned my face until it subsided. I applied it with a little water so it was diluted and left it on for 20 minutes. My face has never felt smoother!! All of the bacteria and pimples that were forming are no longer present. It killed and revitalized my entire epidermis. My skin has a rosy glow and I am very happy with the results ! If you have a low pain tolerance, this mask may not be for you. I say, Don&#x27;t give up, breath and if you see negative reviews, try this mask for yourself!</li>
            <li> This burned too much for my taste...I took it off immediately. Maybe I had exfoliated too recently and my skin was more delicate than usual, but for me the feeling of my face burning isn&#x27;t worth the results. I&#x27;ll stick to the Garlic and Tomato Masque, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne &amp; Eminence is the answer!  This item has a little &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; initially but it goes away quickly.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider it &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; &amp; I have extremely sensitive skin.  The &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; goes away as quick as you are applying the mask to the next area of your face.  Great mask for sensitive, acne prone skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product and love this brand!</li>
            <li> Works well, but it smells like black licorice (which I really don&#x27;t like).</li>
            <li> This is a great spicy masque.  I would say it is less hot than the stimulating lime masque but hotter than 8 greens.  The only negative is that it has a strange texture (watery, but thick) and it doesn&#x27;t exactly apply smoothly.  I tend to mix it with other creamier masques.  My favorite mixture with this masque is the clear skin probiotic masque - this combo always makes my acne-prone skin look fantastic the next day.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It gets really warm, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt, and it helps to keep all your pores cleaned out! I like using this once a week.</li>
            <li> I just got this in the mail yesterday and gave it a try right away. i have acne-prone skin which is also very sensitive to products like salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and retin-a (among a host of other triggers), so anytime I try a new product I go into it aware that there&#x27;s at least a 50-50 chance of it breaking it out/drying me out rather than helping anything. I&#x27;ve tried eminence products in the past and really liked them, but never this one.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it was not what i&#x27;d call either hot or painful. I felt a little bit of a tingle when I first applied it, but it didn&#x27;t last. Maybe the batch I got had a lower quantity of cinnamon oil? who knows. At the time i applied it last night my skin around my jawline and on my cheeks was pre-breakout-- lots of little congested bumps under the skin. Right after I rinsed it off, my skin was so much softer and smoother. One little spot on my cheek became redder and a little more swollen-- I assumed it was bringing the impurity to the surface. When I woke up this morning, it was gone. The tiny bumps are still there but aren&#x27;t irritated. I can feel and see that they&#x27;re healing now and the irritation has been SIGNIFICANTLY reduced, literally from ten minutes of this on my face. I&#x27;m totally sold. This is a miracle product for me. I can&#x27;t remember any product or medicine, prescription or otherwise, that has been this effective this fast. Plus, it&#x27;s all natural. I totally encourage trying it.</li>
            <li> This mask will make your face red for a little bit and gets hot but it makes your face feel great afterwards.</li>
            <li> It killed my cystic acne i used this as a spot treatment leave it on for one hour and rinse it after.</li>
            <li> whenever I feel like I am about to breakout, I will apply this mask. it really does prevent breakouts and pimples. and if you&#x27;ve already broken out, it does reduce the pimples. the only downside is, it burns sooooo much!!!! when I apply it, I have to use my blowdryer on cool to take away the burning sensation for the first minute. it really really stings. but it works.</li>
            <li> My favorite mask! Heats up the skin and encourages all impurities out. For those with extra sensitive skin, you may want to steer clear of this, as it heats up pretty well on skin up to my brains! LOL</li>
            <li> Yes this is pretty great stuff.  It burns (well not really burn! but the cinnamon and spices in the mud gets hot on your face at first)  After a few minutes it goes away.  It really does seem to help as spot treatment or all over mask for acne.&lt;br /&gt;Down side is ...its very expensive.  I love it...but Ill keep searching for a similar product that doesn&#x27;t cost $$$.&lt;br /&gt;Eminence products I believe are excellent overall..but I wish the prices weren&#x27;t so high for the amount of product you get.</li>
            <li> Works great as a spot treatment if you feel a pimple coming on.  Its burns but just for a minute, its not as bad as some people make it out to be in other reviews.</li>
            <li> First, I have acne-prone (aka adult acne), sensitive, and oily skin and this was the first &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; treatment I&#x27;ve tried from eminence. I&#x27;ve used this masque several different ways and I found it extremely hard to adapt to my skin. The product consistency is very thin, so I could not dilute it with water and applied just straight on (until I found a semi-solution). Now, the product does smell really good (like the holidays) and it burns so deep into your skin that it often leaves my skin smelling nice easily through the next day (which I did really like).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am use to the saying beauty is pain and blah, blah and I&#x27;ve experienced some pain...but I really had to dig deep when I first applied this masque. I suggest deep breaths and working on your zen meditation to get through this treatment (that&#x27;s what I did) and after 10 minutes (give or take) the burn does start to go away. Yes, it turns my face red, bright red...now after 20-30 minutes my face stopped looking like a bright red balloon; However, if you do Any extractions, be warned -- all extractions on my face remained big red blotches the Entire day (I try not to be seen out in public the days that I use this masque). I should mention, I&#x27;m biracial so I&#x27;m tan and this made my face clearly, unattractive red for the day. I would suggest using this at night before bedtime to avoid, so you can sleep off the redness, but in this application my skin did not start to heal, created dry spots, and my acne did not improve -- I really just felt it was deep cleaning my pores of any possible bacteria after an extraction session (and truthfully there are better and less painful ways to accomplish this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an attempt to try to see full benefits of this product I&#x27;ve played around with applications such as Overnight (sleeping in it)-- I don&#x27;t suggest this at all on one attempt it look off a layer of skins when I spot treated and on another it created super dry patches. Just don&#x27;t do it. Spot treatments -- I only do this overnight and as I mentioned already and I do not suggest it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The semi-solution:&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve stated just applying this product straight on does nothing really visually appealing to my skin (it burns deep so I like to think it does kill some bacteria under the skin) but leaves dry patches and does not start the healing process for me which is crucial for acne &amp; sensitive skin. So, I decided to mix the herbal mud treatment with the Eminence Quince and Ice Wine Masque (I&#x27;ve reviewed this product as well and detail why I decided to match these two products) hoping dilution would help and it did. The mud treatment requires a thicker product for dilution (other than water) as I said because the treatment itself is very thin and mixing with water would make a mess. So I mixed the two products and this was the best application I&#x27;ve had so far (of course I slept in it overnight...) The hybrid masque treatment was a gentle burn/tingle (that did not require zen meditation), I was able to peel it off in the morning with no dry patches and that start of the healing process!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that was a lot of work to get the product where I needed it -- I suggest caution if purchasing this product and you have not used it previously. I did find a working solution, but I will not purchase again...proceed with caution is my advice.</li>
            <li> Read instructions........ don&#x27;t be alarmed when your face turns red........</li>
            <li> I love this mud mask.  It burns like mad when you first put it on, but the burning goes away after about a minute or two.  My skin always feels smoother and refreshed after I use the treatment.</li>
            <li> Stuff is great. It tingles at first and makes my skin red for a few minutes, but it goes away and I&#x27;ve noticed I have had fewer breakouts. I try to use this once a week. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people who have extremely sensitive skin, due to the hot tingling sensation it gives. I would imagine the redness might last a little longer also. Personally, it works great for me and I will continue buying this mask.</li>
            <li> I was given advice from a nurse whom is also an esthetician about this mud treatment.  It works wonderfully for little spots or breakouts!  Just a little bit overnight helps dry up problem areas!  I have yet to try it as full mask but am looking forward to it.  I would recommend it highly to anyone who is wondering........</li>
            <li> This product is great.  It has a very hot (spicy) type feel to it when applied that may not be to everyone&#x27;s liking.  I can definitely tell a difference in my skin after using this.  Love it.  Overall, I am a big fan of all the eminence products that I use.</li>
            <li> The product came with the lid not shut and it leaked.</li>
            <li> There is no exaggeration when I say- this stuff is really good!&lt;br /&gt;1.It&#x27;s like a mini chemical peel without the peeling. It&#x27;s like it melts the hard dead layer of skin instead of peeling it and the new skin is so smooth &amp; soft.&lt;br /&gt; 2.There is a slight sting in the beginning which goes away. I&#x27;m pretty tolerate so it did not bother me at all. I&#x27;m adding this to my regular skin regime. However, I do not dilute it like the instructions say since the consistency is pretty thin and use it as it is.&lt;br /&gt;3. I thought this product was expensive but after using it, I&#x27;ll say it&#x27;s worth every penny- plus the consistency will make it last much longer than a regular 2 ounce mask so it balances the cost out.</li>
            <li> It burns! Makes my skin look amazing and got a lot of compliments on my face after I used it the first time.  I have very oily skin and a lot of clogged pores. I use this about once a week and it has helped my skin a lot. Of course, I use my blackheads extractor prior to putting this on.</li>
            <li> I love love love this masque.  It makes my skin bright red, but is amazing after about an hour.  I use it at night and by morning my skin is shining and bright.  Highly recommend if you like your face to look refreshed!</li>
            <li> Initial application it burns bad as the product reacts with the water.  I honestly haven&#x27;t noticed much from it at all.  I think it just burns from the cinnamon that&#x27;s in it and that&#x27;s it... I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  The packaging also did not look anything like what they sell it in at the salon.</li>
            <li> This mud mask burns like a chemical peel.  That I could live with.  The part that took me by surprise, however, was the fact that I got the worst breakout that I had ever gotten IN MY LIFE, the following week.  It was a long week, I can assure you.  Perhaps, it was a bad reaction, but I have read other reviews that said the same.  Use at your own risk.  You may need a bag over your head for a few days.</li>
            <li> AWESOME products, GREAT service!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mask for the past year. It is great for my acne prone oily skin. Makes it look radiant and clean in the morning after evening application. Just bought a new one again !</li>
            <li> Be prepared to feel the burn! It works to get that blood flow going to purify your skin at all layers. I use only twice a month so this jar easily lasts a year.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this mask.  It was used on me at a spa where I discovered Eminence, but I buy the products on Amazon for a lower price.  It works so well.  I left it on for about 15 minutes.  It does get tingly, but I enjoy that because it means something is happening.  My skin was so soft and my pores were cleaned out after one use.  My skin was a little red afterwards, which it says will happen.  Since I used it at night, I didn&#x27;t mind.  I have tried several mud masks and this is the best one by far.</li>
            <li> It was recommended and works so far...</li>
            <li> The herbal mud stings a bit when you first apply to skin, but subsides in about a minute.  This is a really great product, it leaves my pores tight and glowing when done!</li>
            <li> love it! I have combo skin w adult hormonal acne and this mask seems to be helping. It is a hot mask and does &#x27;burn&#x27; but  only  for a minute and t really isn&#x27;t very intense. My skin is also sensitive along w all the other issues and this mask suits well. My face is red after use but only for less than 1 hr. Also my pores seem to be clearing up w no major breakouts. I will purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Works really well, smells great, invigorating.  Is hot at first but subsides and leaves skin feeling soft and pores clean.</li>
            <li> This masque is so very hot. Makes me eyes water and nose run but it has phenomenal results!!!&lt;br /&gt;I usually put it on and then use a blow dryer on cool and after 30 seconds its fine. But I can actually feel the masque working and my face has cleared in a week. I have tried Proactive, Origins, Clinique, AdvoCare, and much more and this works great for my oily skin. I am a trainer so I sweat for 9 hours a day and this has rescued me from having clients stare at my breakouts during their sessions!&lt;br /&gt;Love this Hungarian Masque!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hot and has a slight sting after applied.  Suck up the pain cuz after you wash it off and the redness goes away you are left with clear soft skin.</li>
