            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t even remember how I stumbled across this stuff on Amazon, however I was looking for soap to use in my shower that was cheaper but still effective than what I was finding at the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the way it feels and cleans.</li>
            <li>I immediately fell in love with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the refreshing feel of a shower using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It offers great refreshment.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s more economical.</li>
            <li>I use it to clean the floors in my house also.</li>
            <li>I used some to clean a pair of wool gloves after changing a radiator on a truck with a hundred and fifty thousand miles.</li>
            <li>I use it diluted with water to clean everything from my granite countertop, hands, bathroom, and baby&#x27;s toys.</li>

            <li>Good to get a larger container</li>
            <li>You really feel CLEAN after showering!</li>
            <li>Talk about not only feeling absolutely squeaky clean, in addition and the most surprising, is the aroma that goes straight into your nose and the tingly feeling of the mint all across my body.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap is all natural, organic and has a fresh, clean peppermint scent.  </li>
            <li>My buddy was amazed how clean the gloves were, new looking.</li>
            <li>you want a something that is different (even the labeling... kind of odd, but interesting),</li>
            <li>The peppermint was reasonable in price.</li>
            <li>I bought the Peppermint soap and the first time I used it - WOW!  </li>

            <li>It also repels many other insects!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a high quality, liquid castile soap.  </li>
            <li>No complaint about the product itself.</li>
            <li>; when you get out of the shower, but be careful if your sensitive &amp;#34;downstairs&amp;#34;... it&#x27;s kind of like an icy hot feeling</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this product to someone that is looking for a natural body soap that really works.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this soap doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I have used it to wash of fuel oil off my hands and it removed the oil completely.</li>
            <li>I give friends this soap for a gift and they are skeptical at first, then they tell me they love it.  </li>
            <li>but it was just my regular old shower.  </li>
            <li>It is getting harder to find in health food stores at a reasonable price.  </li>

            <li> Love the way it feels and cleans.</li>
            <li> I not only have been using this soap in the shower for over 30 years but I put it in a spray bottle and spray down my shed as the Peppermint repels rodents and keeps my shed clear of mice and rats putting up nests! It also repels many other insects! I use it to clean the floors in my house also. Smells great! Feels tingly when you use it in the shower or on your scalp. Great versitle soap!</li>
            <li> Great product, and I am always left feeling incredibly clean. I would definitely recommend this product to someone that is looking for a natural body soap that really works.</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be bigger.  We had a larger one before and thought this would be the same size.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap since 1973. It works great for everything, I recommend it to all.Good bye, folks.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap that I use.  It offers great refreshment.</li>
            <li> Best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Takes grease off better than fast orange or gojo.</li>

Talk about not only feeling absolutely squeaky clean, in addition and the most surprising, is the aroma that goes straight into your nose and the tingly feeling of the mint all across my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt like I was in one of those fancy spas... but it was just my regular old shower.  I immediately fell in love with this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want a something that is different (even the labeling... kind of odd, but interesting), something that will wake you up every morning before you trudge off to your job, something that will send chills up and down your body - well this is the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I travel for work, and I&#x27;ve had a lot of fancy soap samples - but none of them compare to this peppermint delight that awaits me when I get home.  Love, love, love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very refreshing soap - make your skin tingle.</li>
            <li> I go through these gallons every couple of months. The peppermint was reasonable in price. No complaint about the product itself.</li>
            <li> Fourth bottle can&#x27;t say anymore !</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re repeat customers and have used Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Peppermint Castile Soap for years.  It&#x27;s a high quality, liquid castile soap.  We find that it helps repel mosquitos in the summer.  Love the refreshing feel of a shower using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s.  There&#x27;s nothing like it!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
            <li> this is a half gallon, not a full gallon for a higher price than sold elsewhere here on amazon.  do your homework.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  Good to get a larger container that&#x27;s more economical.</li>
