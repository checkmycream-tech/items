            <li>The results are perfect.</li>
            <li>so I guess I have a medium, at best, pain</li>
            <li>so I found that epilating is the best choice.</li>

            <li>read the instructions and saw that it said optimal was the best setting (hence the name, I suppose).  </li>
            <li>Happy, hairless days, lovelies!</li>
            <li>and my legs still look (and feel) great!</li>

            <li>I am very happy I chose epilation and happy with the lightweight Braun SE 5180.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be another great product from Braun, it still lives in our family but now my aunt has it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Maybe if you are already happily an epilator user this is for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product itself works great,</li>
            <li>also have experienced ingrowth with epilation , but even waxing did that to my hair..</li>
            <li>but now when I read the reviews for this product before placing the order, someone has given great tips on preventing in growth: exfoliating..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li>Great investment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m totally happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- power is great</li>
            <li>Great investment for hair</li>
            <li>This epilator is a great option for anyone who doesn&#x27;t feel like shaving every day and can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this epilator for a year already, still working great.</li>
            <li>The shipping was on time as always (great amazon service)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am happy with the Braun.</li>
            <li>I have never in my life used one of these things, but im an overly happy with this one.</li>
            <li>This will great in the summer :</li>
            <li>Honestly, I think epilation is the best!</li>
            <li>Although it takes me longer than it says it will on the instructions, I am really happy with this epilator!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>this is great product.</li>
            <li>I was in the store and peeked at the star ratings on my phone which were good.</li>
            <li>This was a really good purchase.</li>
            <li>Time wise.</li>
            <li>Also, while this does tweeze away a lot of hair, it also breaks off a good amount at the surface and doesn&#x27;t remove shorter hairs.</li>
            <li>I am smooth and happy!  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to see that the epilator pulls out like tweezers (I would puck each hair on my body if I had time LOL).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Forget about the acessories - the massage thing gets in the way, the cooling glove is not needed (but is good for kid&#x27;s boo boos)  </li>
            <li>The price is very good and the model is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>i love it!</li>
            <li>i love this product and i recommend it!</li>
            <li>Since this is my first epilator I can&#x27;t compare it with others, but I am very happy with my choice!!</li>
            <li>I love this thing!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING epilator for the price.</li>
            <li>It had a great angle to run it along your legs comfortably as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I used to have another braun epilator which it was amazing.</li>
            <li>I can say that the product does remove hair effectively.  </li>
            <li>I am getting ready to be in my best friend&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li>no i did not use the ice glove, I took a warm shower</li>
            <li>Honestly though it&#x27;s not a type of pain you cannot tolerate...</li>
            <li>but you get used to it after some time, your skin kind of numbs itself.</li>
            <li>This is a GREAT unit and I am gonna try out another model of this same brand since it seems to be the best on the market</li>
            <li>would not recommend; liked the shave/trim head (bikini).</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;ice glove\\&quot; is kind of pointless&lt;</li>
            <li>I liked this one because it has 40 tweezers</li>
            <li>The light was VERY handy even in my well-lit bathroom.  </li>
            <li>The light was VERY handy even in my well-lit bathroom.  </li>
            <li>Smooth and Clean is how I can best describe this one.</li>
            <li>Probably will get even better the more I use it!  </li>
            <li>It gave me a great first experience!</li>
            <li>I honestly think she gave up too soon :)  </li>
            <li>The ice glove is especially useful for the underarm area (without it, it would be even more difficult)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled to try it again, but I felt I needed to use it more than once before I could give my opinion.</li>
            <li>But it is still more effective than shaving.</li>
            <li>A good Veet now and then (which I do to take care of the backs of my thighs) also tend to free the ingrowns.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after reading that the majority of reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;However, I followed all directions on how to have the best epilating experience and this epilator, the first one I&#x27;ve ever tried after shaving for years, did not give me the hairless and smooth legs promised.</li>
            <li>experience is this works great on coarse hair, fairly well on medium hair, not so great on fine hair.  </li>
            <li>The light is a good plus to see the areas you need to pay more atention.  </li>
            <li>I also didn&#x27;t feel that my skin was very smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li>My four star review isbased on how effectively it removed hair and how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this on my face is a HUGE NO-NO!  </li>
            <li>I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>The epilator makes it so much better -</li>
            <li>but stubble was really getting to me, so after hearing a friend saying really great things about depilators, i decided to try one out.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll probably have to spend a bit more time at it than people with softer, thinner hair.</li>
            <li>Make sure waht are the accessories you are getting with the purchase of these two epilators.</li>
            <li>I wanted to buy a not-so-expensive epilator and chose this one based upon the customer reviews and have been using this for more than a year now.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>It does give her goosebumps which may help the epilator grab the hairs better.</li>
            <li>I LOVE the light!  </li>
            <li>One thing to consider which has been mentioned is \\&quot;pulling a hair\\&quot; &#x3D; \\&quot;pain\\&quot;, thus \\&quot;more hair\\&quot; &#x3D; \\&quot;more pain\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>more than I could see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am sincerely glad that I did not.  </li>
            <li>the more I use it, though.  </li>
            <li>I am sincerely glad that I did not.  </li>
            <li>the more I use it, though.  </li>
            <li>I love this Braun Epilator.</li>
            <li>The noise didn&#x27;t bother me like I had read on many reviews.  </li>
            <li>I would describe it as discomfort more than pain.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li>The handy light and massage function are an added bonus as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does have a nice compact size that fits in your hand comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Yep, it&#x27;s more \\&quot;barbaric\\&quot; and you feel a lot more</li>
            <li>but it also grabs a lot more hair this way and saves time.   </li>
            <li>I think the fact that you have to go over parts is what makes it more noticeable.</li>
            <li>It does get better as you use it (by the end I got used to it</li>
            <li>and I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>and I simply love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am absolutely satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li>so you are not pulling out as many hairs all at once.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I think worked a bit better to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hurts like hell and caused many ingrown hairs that lasted for months after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>I love this model although now i prefer the cordless models just for the convenience purposes.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I went through with it this time :)</li>
            <li>I fully braced myself for what I was sure would be excruciating pain.</li>
            <li>On my arms and legs, where I have more tolerance for stubble, I use a couple times a month.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with ingrown hair problems-</li>
            <li>The pain is mimimal to none on my legs, more so in the bikini line and armpits.  </li>
            <li>Love Braun epilators and have been using them for 15 plus years.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Braun 7280 - okay;</li>
            <li>and hopefully practice will make this work more</li>
            <li>It huts most on stomach and bikini area</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for another Braun epilator that I used for many years.</li>
            <li>Im sure</li>
            <li>It is reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>the best part about this is that I know now that even if I make last minute plans to go the beach or something, all I need is about 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li>The more I used it, the longer I could tolerate it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using epilators for many years</li>
            <li>I read many reviews and was almost scared off my purchase by the number of people who shared their horror stories regarding the pain involved in using an epilator.</li>
            <li>I think you will really love this product.</li>
            <li>All the attachments are great to have which makes it a very versatile device.</li>
            <li>the course of the evening (no ice glove, as I don&#x27;t have that many hands)</li>
            <li>so I thought this may be better.  </li>
            <li>and I still had more hair to pull there</li>
            <li>If you use the epilator for the first time on hair that is thinner and finer (as it is after waxing or using an epilator), then the experience is much more pleasant.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to do right before you go to bed because of the possibility of redness.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good to do right before you go to bed because of the possibility of redness.  </li>
            <li>the hair on my legs is pretty fine and sparse now from years of epilating and this braun works great for me.</li>
            <li>but I must say this model is wonderful! : very efficient,  quick, even removing the fine \\&quot;downy\\&quot; fuzz around the knees.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit, it&#x27;s  great.</li>
            <li>(I think it gets better as one gets more experienced; I&#x27;ve only done it myself twice)).</li>
            <li>, I love the light.</li>
            <li>Some men like Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds are hairy in an attractive, masculine way.  </li>
            <li>I find the headlight to be very useful helping to make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything.</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun machines since 2001 ,yet Braun 5180 Silk is the best amoung the other models.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and it gets the shorter hair too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>I epilated a part of my arms where I didn&#x27;t want hair and most of it didn&#x27;t grow back, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>there are others who could easily stand the pain</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold &amp;</li>
            <li>I wax my own underarms and will continue doing that because I think epilating the area will take longer and leave more stubble, whereas using a waxing strip is fast and leaves the area perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li>If you epilate often, your hair will be fine and easily removable.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>I showered first without soap or anything just to get my skin warm</li>
            <li>The device is comfortable in the hand, easy to hold and</li>
            <li>Lightly seemed to produce more tugging, and prevent you from getting the full benefit of the vibrations which help manage the pain.    </li>
            <li>recommend this product strongly, it&#x27;s awesome, and useful and you can take it anywhere on trips (as long as you follow voltage instructions).</li>
            <li>Epilator was fine though.</li>
            <li>This machine is still going strong with regular use for over three years - love Braun stuff!!</li>
            <li>You can really get all of the hairs, and i think the light is a nice feature, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line is the Braun is a great alternative to shaving in my case and the light makes a BIG difference while using it.  </li>
            <li>only used the epilator on my legs and they look great.</li>
            <li>my legs are still smooth with no hairs.</li>
            <li>As advertised it doesn&#x27;t keep you hair free for over a month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Its fabulous.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light:</li>
            <li>It is also comfortable to hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li>is that my legs aren&#x27;t nearly as smooth as they would be post shave or wax.</li>
            <li>have used Braun silk epil before(11years back) and had switched to waxing/shaving and it feels great to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Would have continued using it, if the voltage/current parameters would have fit the US as well.</li>
            <li>My legs felt so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The brush for cleaning hairs &amp; the simple, drawsting pouch for holding spilator, attachments &amp; cord is always a great, needed addition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li>the light helps focus and the tweezers work well.</li>
            <li>Not as smooth as shaving or waxing.  </li>
            <li>Tried it almost 24 hours ago and still smooth, with shaving I would already be prickly at this point.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li>Shave once or twice a week to get smooth and exfoliated.</li>
            <li>works well and the light feature helps a lot.</li>
            <li>light notices hairs that I would have never seen without it.</li>
            <li>I will admit, I&#x27;ve not worked up the courage to do my underarms yet, but the legs are absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li>got this for my mom, who I am the primary care giver for.</li>
            <li>but I had also let it grow out pretty good first.  </li>
            <li>the first thing i did was try it out on my thigh hair, that i only shave in the summer - and the results were incredible, even my boyfriend noticed the difference.</li>
            <li>Shaving with this was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>worth a shot!</li>
            <li>I caught most on the first try.</li>
            <li>Worth it! -</li>
            <li>Worth it! -</li>
            <li>Worth it! -</li>
            <li>Worth it! -</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator and like it much better than shaving.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of the first Silk Epils years and years ago (circa 1995) and it seemed like over time the metal tweezers stopped gripping.  </li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to clean my hairs from all over the bathroom when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li>I had used an epilator before a very cheap one that was a very painfull experience  </li>
            <li>not as good as expected,the light is pretty much useless,the epilator itself feels like it pinches you all yhe time,hurts more than my old one</li>
            <li>Nothing special, it does its job</li>
            <li>As for the pain factor I never have to use the ice thingy and find  the pain perfectly tolerable and hardly get any irritation:</li>
            <li>(Don&#x27;t allow the hair to grow more than 3/4 of an inch in underarms, otherwise it might become very painful)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Money wise it is simple.</li>
            <li>however, for comparison&#x27;s sake, it is definitely more intense).</li>
            <li>But overall this thing is good.</li>
            <li>Fairly well on the fronts of my thighs (medium) and bikini region (coarse).  </li>
            <li>(And watching something while doing it seems to help me not focus on the pain too much and get it done more</li>
            <li>so I placed the cool glove in it for about 3 mins (inadvertantly; I received a call and had to answer it).  </li>
            <li>Not bad at all for the trade off of days of no maintenance.   </li>
            <li>Wish Braun comes up with a new model featuring more tweezers and higher speed!!</li>
            <li>The little light that is on it is great too.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as a careful close shave, but it felt great for my first try!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as a careful close shave, but it felt great for my first try!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the smart light  is very useful.</li>
            <li>just a quick pluck and done.     </li>
            <li>Between using that setting, my own growing expertise, and the fact that fewer hairs grow back every time, I now have totally smooth legs for about 2 weeks after every use.  </li>
            <li>Well, it is even more comfortable to use than my old one.</li>
            <li>On my underarms it often felt like I had a mild sunburn after using (for about a day or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>create their own challenges), wasn&#x27;t pink, and had the light built in!  </li>
            <li>create their own challenges), wasn&#x27;t pink, and had the light built in!  </li>
            <li>I found out quickly that is not the case.</li>
            <li>But it does a great job on coarse hair and it has a real place in the hairy woman&#x27;s arsenal.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Besides the pain, this device is only effective on the more noticeable hairs as it doesn&#x27;t grab the short ones or very fine ones.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>Once the lotion dried, my husband and I were both impressed with how soft and smooth my legs felt.  </li>

            <li>I am very pleased as it has been 3 weeks since I last used it</li>
            <li>First, I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years, and they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too large and can be stored easily in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li>I switched out for the efficiency cap and turned the speed up and found that I actually experienced less discomfort.  </li>
            <li>Actually, the vibration from the epilator feels pretty good against the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall as a first time user of an epilator, and trying to decide between multiple options, I chose this one because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine much better short of laser becoming truly affordable.</li>
            <li>I watched Youtube video, after Youtube video, of people trying epilators for the first time... and man, did it scare me!  </li>
            <li>I watched Youtube video, after Youtube video, of people trying epilators for the first time... and man, did it scare me!  </li>
            <li>but it only gets better!  </li>
            <li>Cooling pad is great, There will always be a little pain in doing this</li>
            <li>Holding the device more firmly against the skin was better than holding it lightly.</li>
            <li>Your legs may also never feel as smooth with epilating as after shaving - but they will LOOK acceptable for much longer.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and smooth, I didnt feel any pain.</li>
            <li>Far faster and more efficient</li>
            <li>I think  that, over all, this purchase was totally worth it</li>
            <li>In fact, I kind of miss that feeling of having had a nice deep massage after using my last one.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly noisy, though as expected.</li>
            <li>I could not find any data about RPMs on Braun&#x27;s site, but for some reason it just feels like the 5180 revolves more often than the old 5270.  </li>
            <li>I DO care about looking nice for people I care about, but not regularly just for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also want to say that the ice glove is nice idea but the same thing can be achieved at home..</li>
            <li>Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>Two speeds are nice for different purposes and pain tolerances.</li>
            <li>it hurts more in sensitive areas like calves and close to ankles</li>
            <li>so my experience could be totally different from your own.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, it&#x27;s worth it for me because I despise having to shave.</li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;ll be delighted.</li>
            <li>well worth the price.</li>
            <li>For a manual exfoliation I have found that better than any scrub or loofah etc IN the shower is AFTER a nice long shower, dry your legs very aggressively with a nice un-fabric-softened towel - you will see the skin roll off even if you just used scrubby gloves or whatever.  </li>
            <li>easily in your hand, is less noisy, the massaging head attachment actually helps keep the pain level low by gently vibrating the surrounding skin, the led light is great for lighting up the area to find missed hairs, and the best part, and this is my personal opinion, my skin feels smoother</li>
            <li>It works great as an epilator but the hair is hard to clean from the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;The light is only an okay feature, doesn&#x27;t help very much.</li>
            <li>I love the light on this Braun - it makes it so easy to see the little hairs.</li>
            <li>had shaved the day I was supposed to receive this product and did not, so I could not epilate on my legs right away.  </li>
            <li>Why would I want to chill my pores right before yanking hairs out?  </li>
            <li>Received my item right on time, as described and unharmed.</li>
            <li>It takes a whole hour to clean my legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted - a simple and effective epilator.</li>
            <li>Also, shaving is very quick now because there really isn&#x27;t much there to shave, just a quick once over to smooth out my skin completely until I&#x27;m ready to epilate again.  </li>
            <li>hmmm I suppose this was worth a try, but you must have to use it frequently at first to get rid of all your hair.  </li>
            <li>Luckily my arm hair is light and fine, if a tad long - I would never dream of using this on my arms.  </li>
            <li>This epilator removed all the hair except very fine, very blonde hairs.</li>
            <li>I had the previous incarnation of this item and loved it but noticed it was losing its strength after a number of years but still doing well</li>
            <li>Since this is my first epilator I can&#x27;t compare it with others, but I am very happy with my choice!!got a little nervous when I realized how red</li>
            <li>I love the colorful, sparkly look of the old - the new looks</li>
            <li>Its so easy to operate ,fast to save me time and left my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>this one is as nice as the dry ones come!)</li>
            <li>Attached to the product is a \\&quot;smart light\\&quot; which really came in handy when epilating and especially finding stray hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line - get a Braun and I highly recommend one with a light, it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying an epilator</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li>things first</li>
            <li>The light comes in handy to see what areas need a second or third pass.  </li>
            <li>This is my first ever epilation experience.</li>
            <li>So immediately after the use you cannot exactly say whether all the hairs were removed from root or just cut at the surface)&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would like to start by saying that this is NOT my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>no self-harm\\&quot; mechanism wouldn&#x27;t allow me to try it first</li>
            <li>so I got my boyfriend to do my first leg.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li>oh and just so you know this is the first review of any product I have ever done</li>
            <li>*)</li>
            <li>Many hairs were pulled from the root, but a good amount were broken off, so my results were good but not great; my legs were smooth in some places but not others.  </li>
            <li>so it would help on the slower setting for those who have a higher threshold for pain.</li>
            <li>To my standards, epilating has taken longer than shaving, but I get better results, my skin feels softer and it takes longer for the hair to grow back</li>
            <li>(I used to do this when I first started waxing and it helps).</li>
            <li>(though maybe all epilators do this - I don&#x27;t know as it&#x27;s my first)</li>
            <li>The first time I used this, it was my first time using an epilator, ever.</li>
            <li>The instructions did mention if you&#x27;re a first timer</li>
            <li>and I must say it&#x27;s a lot more like a moderate discomfort.  </li>
            <li>The instructions did mention if you&#x27;re a first timer</li>
            <li>and I must say it&#x27;s a lot more like a moderate discomfort.  </li>
            <li>That first time?</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t have to use it again for a couple of weeks and if you do it&#x27;ll be for sparse hair that got missed the first time perhaps because they weren&#x27;t even out yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left so many stray hairs and just would not pick up them up, even after going over and over the area dozens of times until I gave up and just shaved the strays.  </li>
            <li>There simply is no comparison, Braun makes a better epilator.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Being my first epilator, I think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>this is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>My legs are nowhere near as smooth as they were when I shave.</li>
            <li>Overall I am pleased with it when I use it on my armpits and lower leg</li>
            <li>However, in the process of doing my research about it, I learned for the first time ever about epilation.  </li>
            <li>Today I &amp;#34;played&amp;#34; with it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part is the light so u can do ur legs even if it is dark in the room.</li>
            <li>Thanks for reading !</li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>which is the only reason for the 4 stars vs 5 :-)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a high tolerance for pain, but after you run it through your hair once quickly, and don&#x27;t focus on the pain, it&#x27;s a breeze after that.</li>
            <li>My legs are still super smooth at the end of the night and the next morning when I wake up.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the manual, but it seems to be pretty intuitive - just make sure you go against the direction of hair growth (which sometimes means going in several directions on a certain body part, like the medial calf).  </li>
            <li>I have not used an epilator since the WAY early days of the original Epilady...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, I did not even feel like it did a decent job quicklyenough to make it worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this on my underarms was pretty intense the first time -</li>
            <li>far, the 5180 seems to do a better job than even my old 5270.  </li>
            <li>The packaging is smart and portable and the price is reasonable for the years of use and sexiness that will result!</li>
            <li>The light is nice, though not necessary for me this time, as I could figure out where I still had to do by going right next to the previous bright red</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this and their previous models in terms of pain reduction, but it&#x27;s definitely more precise and picks up hair very well.</li>
            <li>Epilating is much faster (though still pretty time consuming - I would say an hour for both legs with an epilator versus 2-4 for waxing</li>
            <li>The first experience was a very tolerable pain on my legs</li>
            <li>Very noisy, so at first, it will intimidate you.</li>
            <li>(Some people may have a higher pain threshhold though I do consider mine pretty high.)  </li>
            <li>Since she is now nearly 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li>The hair does gradually grow back over two weeks time, but the epilator is so easy to use that I can touch up in between if I&#x27;m tempted to wear a sundress and find that my legs need some work.</li>
            <li>My thought on that is it is going hurt for the first few times, no matter what kind you get.  </li>
            <li>&amp; 3) good disposable blade razors are becoming really expensive.     </li>
            <li>With the light, I can easily see where little hairs are.</li>
            <li>The Braun did hurt a little more but subsided quickly.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to face that I had wasted my money and try another Braun, figuring this one would be even better than my original with the upgraded 40 tweezer heads and the addition of the light.  </li>
            <li>certainly recommend this product to anyone that is wanting to try an epilator.</li>
            <li>I researched epilating I remembered reading ingrown hairs can be an issue, so when I was done, I got back in the shower with my new favorite exfoliating wash</li>
            <li>I researched epilating I remembered reading ingrown hairs can be an issue, so when I was done, I got back in the shower with my new favorite exfoliating wash</li>
            <li>love the fact that the new Silk epil has the inbuilt light,so I don&#x27;t have to strain my eyes and back to see if it took out all the hair.</li>
            <li>Yes, it hurts, depending on the person, much less or much more, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it has held up fine over the last 4 years or so.  </li>
            <li>The discomfort was quite mild in most places and only moderate on my shins.  </li>
            <li>Every single hair follicle turned bright red, but after some baby oil and a night&#x27;s sleep, it looked pretty normal again.</li>
            <li>My hair grows back sparser and finer, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>Not much I can say about it :)</li>
            <li>It was very tolerable on lighter hair and for that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li>i didnt really use the ice glove, i found there was no need for it.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would, but I have used wax strips before.</li>
            <li>The Braun Silk-epil 5 works very well at removing hair and</li>
            <li>You can be worry free for the next 15 to 20 days after epilation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>, my wife really likes this epilator.</li>
            <li>So any touch ups can&#x27;t really hurt but so much.</li>
            <li>My legs were smooth through several bouts of goosebumps.</li>
            <li>but  you can handle it very well.  </li>
            <li>Mine comes with a frezzing gel pad to aply it in your sking before you start with the epilator  to reduce the pain, and believe me IT WORKS it almost freezes yuor skin and you will not feel to much pain</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s fast</li>
            <li>Granted, I do not have much hair on the bottom of my forearm, but</li>
            <li>I absolutely could not tolerate the pain.  </li>
            <li>Never again will I do that or pay high salon prices!  </li>
            <li>Very helpful for seeing where you missed.&lt;br /&gt;The ice glove: I see no difference with it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find that the iced glove made much difference in my pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer to get them waxed because you get perfectly smooth legs for several weeks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but the time isn&#x27;t reasonable.</li>
            <li>, there&#x27;s no real way to avoid this - you are just yanking hairs out by the root after all) - the better epilators \\&quot;minimize\\</li>
            <li>The Braun 5180 does that job very well.</li>
            <li>(because I really was terrified after reading all the reviewers talk about pain) and it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really care much about portability and batteries</li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t really care much about portability and batteries</li>
            <li>Or I get goosebumps and negate the whole thing...  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t painfree, but very tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Even better that the hairs come in slower and not as rough as the razor.  </li>
            <li>they really minimise the pain.</li>
            <li>it did not hurt as much</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Works fast, doesn&#x27;t do the damage some cheaper ones do.</li>
            <li>It works fast and pulls the the leg hairs out by the root.</li>
            <li>Apart from that, I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Depending, some models want you to go slower with a lighter touch to really pull out the hairs &amp; not just cut them as is the case for me.</li>
            <li>Afterwards, my legs and underarms were left amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It is so much smoother than tweezing every hair for some reason.</li>
            <li>and you can really see the difference; it is fast.</li>
            <li>and I am able to epilate my legs with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>10 or 15 minutes later, I swear my stomach was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s belly.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.  </li>
            <li>Hair growth is still fast as</li>
            <li>Maintain your smooth skin by using your epilator regularly (every two weeks or so).</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m left with smooth, hair-free legs for days.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really knock the item,</li>
            <li>Pain Tolerance: I like tweezing my eyebrows, sometimes so much that I get carried away.</li>
            <li>I was ready to go...</li>
            <li>When using it on my underarms at first, I screamed, but now it is more than bearable and as someone of color who has dark hair, it removes the spots on your underarms and legs</li>
            <li>My first got shoved away in a box under the bed almost immediately after my first attempt at using it, which, as I recall, didn&#x27;t go far.</li>
            <li>Well, first thing I did right was buy it first and read the reviews second.</li>
            <li>I mean it didn&#x27;t feel good or something, but it was not excruciating or unbearable.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to go for some other epilators with more tweezers.</li>
            <li>So now I&#x27;m gonna go into some detail of what I like/dislike using it for, not for the sake of TMI, but in case you want more input on what other women use it on and why.</li>
            <li>but I do wish I was able to epilate my thighs and arms and not experience extreme pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure thats due to the Braun having approx.</li>
            <li>As she said, there are forty other things that I would rather be doing, but I like smooth in all the right places</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the older model of this epilator for almost exactly a year of writing this new review.  </li>
            <li>Epilation removes the hair and keeps legs hair free as long as waxing does</li>
            <li>i was told the hair will grow back softer and thinner, so i&#x27;m waiting to see if that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>If you have a higher threshold of pain and to make sureyou have a complete epilation and not just a shave do it</li>
            <li>However, this device has pretty much completely changed the way I remove hair.  </li>
            <li>In a moment of unexpected bravery, I first held it up to an armpit after turning it on.</li>
            <li>The pain was a little more intense also.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Arrived in a timely fashion and exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will feel pain the first few times you use it but after that it all gets better and you&#x27;ll barely feel it.</li>
            <li>massaging roller head really helps, it did me when I was new at it, but sometimes felt it got in the way of grabbing shorter hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, brand new, unopened package.</li>
            <li>More squinting less outright \\&quot;OWWW\\&quot;-ing.  </li>
            <li>This has all the main features or functionality required and serves the purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a definite sting but over quickly.</li>
            <li>I started with an older model Braun 27 tweezer head and used it until it wore out.  </li>
            <li>It does take some time for the hair to grow back ( a week at the most) and the hair also grows back slower.</li>
            <li>I must admit I was reluctant to purchase my first epilator, but after managing to slice open a nice little gash in my leg while shaving, I decided to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li>Prior to your first experience with the epilator, make sure you wax (either do it yourself or, if you are inexperienced, pay to have it done).</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t hurt) and certain body parts are more sensitive than others (thighs as opposed to lower half of leg).</li>
            <li>And I do not do the backs of my thighs because the hair grows in nine million different directions and you really need to go the right direction to epilate.  </li>
            <li>As I mentioned before, I have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>So far two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li>The results are pretty much the same, it hurts a little bit more in some parts though.</li>
            <li>I am in need of a new replacement head - I think they ALL lose tweeze ability over time - and decided just to buy a whole new unit since they are making a new style now</li>
            <li>As far as quality goes, this epilator feels very sturdy and appears well made.  </li>
            <li>will repeat that I am happily surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li>will repeat that I am happily surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li>She uses it frequently and it works very well for her.</li>
            <li>So I will deduct one star for pain and leave it as a great product that some will find difficult to use.</li>
            <li>I will use it again in a few days to get rid of more hair.</li>
            <li>There was virtually no pain above the elbow, some discomfort on the tops of my forearms, and pretty intense pain on the bottoms of my forearms.  </li>
            <li>The cost is worth the fact that I only shave once, maybe twice a month.  </li>
            <li>green - Love it!&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I can epilate and then go campingfor a few days with friends and look OK</li>
            <li>After a thorough testing by my significant other I can report the Braun expilator does a really job.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning it is time consuming but not hard.</li>
            <li>The little light on this particular epilator is really helpful when epilating the legs.</li>
            <li>time, tweezing supposedly results in finer hair regrowth (so the epilator would become less effective as it doesn&#x27;t work as well on the finer hairs) but that is in theory and in practice, I have never noticed hairs growing back finer after repeated tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Subsequent touch ups were easy, relatively painless and convenient.</li>
            <li>so my pores are open and epilated my legs right after the shower.</li>
            <li>But my first epilator experience and my first (and only, EVER) attempt at home waxing ended in much the same way:  </li>
            <li>There are parts of my inner legs kinds of above and below the knee where the hair is fine, doesn&#x27;t work so well on this.  </li>
            <li>Ok...that is a little more sensitive, but I can deal with that if I&#x27;m going to have hairless underarms.  </li>
            <li>and then you will need to replace them or to buy a new Epilator.  </li>
            <li>hello to my new friend Braun SE 5180.  </li>
            <li>I am a new customer for this product line.  </li>
            <li>even though I have piercings/tattoos it was a new sensation that I was NOT used to.</li>
            <li>and I live in a 110 V area</li>
            <li>Then the head got worn out and instead of paying $30 for a new head I just bought a new epilator instead.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m browsing for a new one.</li>
            <li>I heard about a (new?)</li>
            <li>tears, shakiness, new product in the trash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and remove hair in short time, i recommend it for legs, there is a pain though but not that much.</li>
            <li>All in all, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is fed up with shaving or body hair in general!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve helped her out with epilating, I can say from personal experience that it does a pretty thorough job.</li>
            <li>so I only got to one leg, below the calf, the first day.  </li>
            <li>I psyched myself up pretty badly prior to this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was expecting this loud, obnoxious sound but it sounds like any other electronic gadget that you use.  </li>
            <li>After 4 uses, my hair is much thinner and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li>This is my second Braun; the first one died by using 6-7 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First epilator I&#x27;ve found tolerable, and it seems to do a pretty thorough job, so I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyhow, I decided to try it anyhow as the last time I tried epilation, 15 or so years ago, the technology was no so hot</li>
            <li>No bateries, it comes with an electric cord long enough to have free movement around your body.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light blonde, but long and dense, so I look hairier than I ought to.</li>
            <li>Buy it, take your time with your first few uses, and you too will say \\&quot;Worth It!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Although it will leave your hair much smoother and thinner down there, the pain may not be worth it.</li>
            <li>My first was a Phillips Satinelle which, apparently, is no longer in production.</li>
            <li>I started out by trying it on the bottom half and moved to the top of my legs the following day.</li>
            <li>Also my hair started growing back in less time than advertised (more like a week).  </li>
            <li>The irritation I did feel was outweighed by the site of the stubborn little hairs flying in all directions, illuminated for your entertainment, in the light built in to the device.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit long to clean it properly though.</li>
            <li>A little noise, more than a regular shaving machine, not so ergonomic design</li>
            <li>also my hair r not that hard any more.</li>
            <li>The product itself seems of very high quality the problem is my mom has a low tolerance of pain.</li>
            <li>The so called NEW models differ from the older ones only  by color and body shape.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>as a relatively hairy girl, i have always shaved and never ventured into the world of much else - like waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;* Not messy like waxing&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised that there was no pain for me while doing this.  </li>
            <li>in all, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is fed up with shaving or body hair in general!n get everything, and I ended up just plucking individually...</li>
            <li>I never got that far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the creams and I have rather sensitive skin</li>
            <li>and by this time the redness was nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>and by this time the redness was nearly gone.  </li>
            <li>and it is not messy, nor does the weather effect the efficiency of hair</li>
            <li>Soon after I was surprised to find the Braun had been delivered so</li>
            <li>the tiny brush for cleaning works very well&lt;</li>
            <li>As far as hair removal goes I cannot say that this epilates all my hairs.</li>
            <li>I did not know my old epilator was so inefficient until I used this newer model.  </li>
            <li>been using it regularly and it is very convenient to plug and use.</li>
            <li>As for this review specifically for the Braun,  I feel the final results were much smoother skin.  </li>
            <li>so I replaced it with a Soft Perfection (20 tweezers)</li>
            <li>so the old is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I for now am going to say I prefer the old.  </li>
            <li>I am simply not limber enough to be able to get close enough to figure out what I am doing back</li>
            <li>This thing actually works really well in conjunction with shaving.</li>
            <li>far as noise goes, it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but I found I could still hear the TV over it at about the volume I had it at without the epilator on.</li>
            <li>I think it will take me a few sessions to get the entire underarm area, but I love the way it feels after it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also the hair grows back much more slowly and is much thinner.</li>
            <li>In the past I have been to the salon and had my legs waxed and felt like the skin covering my shins had been pulled off right along with the hair!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;For those of you new to epilating, it will hurt at first, but trust me, before long you will barely feel it.  </li>
            <li>The armpit was relatively easy with very little pain.</li>
            <li>Trimmed the other arm&#x27;s worth of hair, and then finished that rather quickly, though with breaks every 20 seconds or so to wait for the pain to die down.</li>
            <li>It is not removing small and fine hairs.</li>
            <li>X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] was an replacement after my older Emjoi (which isn&#x27;t even listed on Amazon anymore) started showing its age after a couple years of solid performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Remember that the first time you use it you are pulling out ALL your hairs at once and the &amp;#34;bulbs&amp;#34; at the end of the hair are big and hurt coming out of your skin (especially the underarms, take Ibuprofen 15-30 mins.</li>
            <li>Most importantly (for me), I love the fact that the hair on my legs grows back without ever being rough and spiky (which I really, really hate and why I refuse to shave).</li>
            <li>The only annoying thing is the light which is too bright that you cannot see clearly.</li>
            <li>i had to go over the same areas more than once because, as i already said, i didn&#x27;t luck out with genetics and soft invisible hairs, mine is pretty coarse and thick, especially after years and years of shaving.</li>
            <li>I guess I had a little more facial hair than I could actually see, because it did get a lot out.  </li>
            <li>No regrets!!</li>
            <li>I am fortunate in that I only have to remove hair from the front lower half of my legs...</li>
            <li>The head, without the attachments, looked kind of naked and unfinished compared to the Soft Perfection and the tweezers were half plastic, half metal vs. metal on metal like the Soft Perfection - but it worked well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m, a busy working single mom of 2 and this machine saves me loads of time getting ready in the mornings.</li>
            <li>(since it does grow in much thinner, it&#x27;s not nearly as noticeable as it was when I was shaving).   </li>
            <li>In that case just calm down, switch it off, unplug the device</li>
            <li>It stung a little, but didn&#x27;t hurt and didn&#x27;t really feel much</li>
            <li>I had to run the epilator very slowly up my legs SEVERAL times over one pass just to clear it up and while the smart light was quite helpful, t hair seemed to break off in most places and only a few were actually pulled out.</li>
            <li>lower legs i actually depilated today - and whilst i did miss a few little hairs that were just too short to be plucked (i used tweezers on them), the overall result is great.</li>
            <li>I have dark hair, with dark roots, so my legs looked better with the roots gone.</li>
            <li>Anxious to try it out, but lacking much body hair, I decided to do my arms first.</li>
            <li>When I moved onto other areas it hurt a little more.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- very little hair actually falls out of the epilator - this may because my hair is fine and also because i cleaned it out every 5 minutes&lt;</li>
            <li>On more sensitive areas I usually get irritation bumps even if I ice or take other precautions.</li>
            <li>I am confident that with extended use I will have less and less hair on my legs.</li>
            <li>The smart light is useful to find thin small hairs</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great shaver, and I didn&#x27;t find it painful (maybe because I&#x27;ve already been using one).</li>
            <li>I just use it as an ice pack for general use now.</li>
            <li>The treated area stays smooth for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Personally, I like it because is small ad lightweight plus the light</li>
            <li>No regrets with buying this brand, infact i wish i bought this sooner.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t really try the ice glove that comes with it, because it just made my legs wet</li>
            <li>On my legs the pain barely bother me.</li>
            <li>I also recommend doing this in the evening as you can get red bumps or sensitive skin afterward</li>
            <li>the only reason i bought this because my old one is 220 V</li>
            <li>So, I had to buy another one, but thought to go for the same brand, since the old one served well.</li>
            <li>I found that to be the complete opposite for me.</li>
            <li>Bare bones, unit and spinny head, yank those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not much different than the old one we had</li>
            <li>The details of the products braun SE 5270(pink) and SE 5180 were exactly same except the price of pink one was bit higher.</li>
            <li>first few times I used it, I used the soft setting.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the same - the initial pain can be surprising, but if you go through it quickly, it&#x27;s easily forgettable.</li>
            <li>Though if you&#x27;re comparing this to shaving, from the 2nd day on, epilating wins hands down.</li>
            <li>Though expensive, it works great, with NO pain, less hair regrowth,therefore,</li>
            <li>My first one I got as an xmas present--the original coil style Epilady which was pretty painful.</li>
            <li>Shaving leaves your legs very smooth, but only for a few hours and the hairs look so dark when they grow</li>
            <li>First, because a spot on my leg was red and burning from having first epilated, I ran it down that spot a few times and it helped considerably.  </li>
            <li>My left side(Braun) felt smoother while rubbing my skin as opposed to the right side(Emjoi) which I felt had a slight stubble sensation</li>
            <li>The pain was minimal, watching the little hairs coming out made this almost pain free for me.</li>
            <li>This model is hard to clean though.</li>
            <li>have pretty dark body hair in general with some finer, blonde hairs.  </li>
            <li>It was very helpful for me to read that information in other reviews....</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell they use the same head so tweezing ability should be the same.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it is pretty painful, but I expected that much; it does seem to get better</li>
            <li>Yes, it is pretty painful, but I expected that much; it does seem to get better</li>
            <li>Legs were very much less sensitive than the arm, though a day&#x27;s stubble didn&#x27;t seem quite long enough for it to grip onto very much hair.</li>
            <li>It will grab hair that is pretty short - way shorter than waxing - but the thicker the hair the less prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In fact, I had a few strays from the first day</li>
            <li>but the way my legs looked afterward was WAY worth the small amount of discomfort that I did have.</li>
            <li>love what waxing does for the legs, but it is messy and in humid weather its not very effective either.</li>
            <li>I would rather wax down there and get a whole section done with then use the epilator and have it torture me hair by hair.</li>
            <li>I started with my legs first, and it wasn&#x27;t any more painful than having my legs waxed...</li>
            <li>love this product, at first it may seem painful when is pulling hair out</li>
            <li>but it was a lot less intense.</li>
            <li>The first few times I used it, I could tolerate it only for 1-2 seconds at a time b/c of the pain.</li>
            <li>Used weekly, and the first one lasted only a few months</li>
            <li>It hurt less than waxing, and to me, except for a few very hairy spots, there was not real &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; at all, just mild discomfort.  </li>
            <li>In the underarm area if the skin is not stretched properly, the skin can get stuck into the epilator.</li>
            <li>; so maybe I&#x27;m not typical, but I could use this all day long and never give it a second thought.  </li>
            <li>Normally I had to shave every other day especially in the summer months.</li>

            <li> I am very happy I chose epilation and happy with the lightweight Braun SE 5180.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be another great product from Braun, it still lives in our family but now my aunt has it</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe if you are already happily an epilator user this is for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product itself works great,</li>
            <li> also have experienced ingrowth with epilation , but even waxing did that to my hair..</li>
            <li> but now when I read the reviews for this product before placing the order, someone has given great tips on preventing in growth: exfoliating..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great investment.</li>

            <li> The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- power is great</li>
            <li> Great investment for hair</li>
            <li> This epilator is a great option for anyone who doesn&#x27;t feel like shaving every day and can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this epilator for a year already, still working great.</li>
            <li> The shipping was on time as always (great amazon service)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am happy with the Braun.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life used one of these things, but im an overly happy with this one.</li>
            <li> This will great in the summer :</li>
            <li> Honestly, I think epilation is the best!</li>
            <li> Although it takes me longer than it says it will on the instructions, I am really happy with this epilator!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> this is great product.</li>
            <li> I was in the store and peeked at the star ratings on my phone which were good.</li>
            <li> This was a really good purchase.</li>
            <li> Time wise.</li>
            <li> Also, while this does tweeze away a lot of hair, it also breaks off a good amount at the surface and doesn&#x27;t remove shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> I am smooth and happy!  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to see that the epilator pulls out like tweezers (I would puck each hair on my body if I had time LOL).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Forget about the acessories - the massage thing gets in the way, the cooling glove is not needed (but is good for kid&#x27;s boo boos)  </li>
            <li> The price is very good and the model is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> i love it!</li>
            <li> i love this product and i recommend it!</li>
            <li> Since this is my first epilator I can&#x27;t compare it with others, but I am very happy with my choice!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING epilator for the price.</li>
            <li> It had a great angle to run it along your legs comfortably as well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I used to have another braun epilator which it was amazing.</li>
            <li> I can say that the product does remove hair effectively.  </li>
            <li> I am getting ready to be in my best friend&#x27;s wedding</li>
            <li> no i did not use the ice glove, I took a warm shower</li>
            <li> Honestly though it&#x27;s not a type of pain you cannot tolerate...</li>
            <li> but you get used to it after some time, your skin kind of numbs itself.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT unit and I am gonna try out another model of this same brand since it seems to be the best on the market</li>
            <li> would not recommend; liked the shave/trim head (bikini).</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;ice glove\\&quot; is kind of pointless&lt;</li>
            <li> I liked this one because it has 40 tweezers</li>
            <li> The light was VERY handy even in my well-lit bathroom.  </li>
            <li> The light was VERY handy even in my well-lit bathroom.  </li>
            <li> Smooth and Clean is how I can best describe this one.</li>
            <li> Probably will get even better the more I use it!  </li>
            <li> It gave me a great first experience!</li>
            <li> I honestly think she gave up too soon :)  </li>
            <li> The ice glove is especially useful for the underarm area (without it, it would be even more difficult)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled to try it again, but I felt I needed to use it more than once before I could give my opinion.</li>
            <li> But it is still more effective than shaving.</li>
            <li> A good Veet now and then (which I do to take care of the backs of my thighs) also tend to free the ingrowns.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading that the majority of reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;However, I followed all directions on how to have the best epilating experience and this epilator, the first one I&#x27;ve ever tried after shaving for years, did not give me the hairless and smooth legs promised.</li>
            <li> experience is this works great on coarse hair, fairly well on medium hair, not so great on fine hair.  </li>
            <li> The light is a good plus to see the areas you need to pay more atention.  </li>
            <li> I also didn&#x27;t feel that my skin was very smooth after using it.  </li>
            <li> My four star review isbased on how effectively it removed hair and how easy it was to use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this on my face is a HUGE NO-NO!  </li>
            <li> I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> The epilator makes it so much better -</li>
            <li> but stubble was really getting to me, so after hearing a friend saying really great things about depilators, i decided to try one out.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll probably have to spend a bit more time at it than people with softer, thinner hair.</li>
            <li> Make sure waht are the accessories you are getting with the purchase of these two epilators.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a not-so-expensive epilator and chose this one based upon the customer reviews and have been using this for more than a year now.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> It does give her goosebumps which may help the epilator grab the hairs better.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the light!  </li>
            <li> One thing to consider which has been mentioned is \\&quot;pulling a hair\\&quot; &#x3D; \\&quot;pain\\&quot;, thus \\&quot;more hair\\&quot; &#x3D; \\&quot;more pain\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> more than I could see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sincerely glad that I did not.  </li>
            <li> the more I use it, though.  </li>
            <li> I am sincerely glad that I did not.  </li>
            <li> the more I use it, though.  </li>
            <li> I love this Braun Epilator.</li>
            <li> The noise didn&#x27;t bother me like I had read on many reviews.  </li>
            <li> I would describe it as discomfort more than pain.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase</li>
            <li> The handy light and massage function are an added bonus as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does have a nice compact size that fits in your hand comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Yep, it&#x27;s more \\&quot;barbaric\\&quot; and you feel a lot more</li>
            <li> but it also grabs a lot more hair this way and saves time.   </li>
            <li> I think the fact that you have to go over parts is what makes it more noticeable.</li>
            <li> It does get better as you use it (by the end I got used to it</li>
            <li> and I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> and I simply love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am absolutely satisfied with this one.</li>
            <li> so you are not pulling out as many hairs all at once.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I think worked a bit better to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell and caused many ingrown hairs that lasted for months after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I love this model although now i prefer the cordless models just for the convenience purposes.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I went through with it this time :)</li>
            <li> I fully braced myself for what I was sure would be excruciating pain.</li>
            <li> On my arms and legs, where I have more tolerance for stubble, I use a couple times a month.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with ingrown hair problems-</li>
            <li> The pain is mimimal to none on my legs, more so in the bikini line and armpits.  </li>
            <li> Love Braun epilators and have been using them for 15 plus years.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Braun 7280 - okay;</li>
            <li> and hopefully practice will make this work more</li>
            <li> It huts most on stomach and bikini area</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another Braun epilator that I used for many years.</li>
            <li> Im sure</li>
            <li> It is reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> the best part about this is that I know now that even if I make last minute plans to go the beach or something, all I need is about 10-15 minutes</li>
            <li> The more I used it, the longer I could tolerate it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using epilators for many years</li>
            <li> I read many reviews and was almost scared off my purchase by the number of people who shared their horror stories regarding the pain involved in using an epilator.</li>
            <li> I think you will really love this product.</li>
            <li> All the attachments are great to have which makes it a very versatile device.</li>
            <li> the course of the evening (no ice glove, as I don&#x27;t have that many hands)</li>
            <li> so I thought this may be better.  </li>
            <li> and I still had more hair to pull there</li>
            <li> If you use the epilator for the first time on hair that is thinner and finer (as it is after waxing or using an epilator), then the experience is much more pleasant.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to do right before you go to bed because of the possibility of redness.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good to do right before you go to bed because of the possibility of redness.  </li>
            <li> the hair on my legs is pretty fine and sparse now from years of epilating and this braun works great for me.</li>
            <li> but I must say this model is wonderful! : very efficient,  quick, even removing the fine \\&quot;downy\\&quot; fuzz around the knees.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit, it&#x27;s  great.</li>
            <li> (I think it gets better as one gets more experienced; I&#x27;ve only done it myself twice)).</li>
            <li> , I love the light.</li>
            <li> Some men like Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds are hairy in an attractive, masculine way.  </li>
            <li> I find the headlight to be very useful helping to make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything.</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun machines since 2001 ,yet Braun 5180 Silk is the best amoung the other models.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use and it gets the shorter hair too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> I epilated a part of my arms where I didn&#x27;t want hair and most of it didn&#x27;t grow back, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> there are others who could easily stand the pain</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold &amp;</li>
            <li> I wax my own underarms and will continue doing that because I think epilating the area will take longer and leave more stubble, whereas using a waxing strip is fast and leaves the area perfectly smooth.</li>
            <li> If you epilate often, your hair will be fine and easily removable.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> I showered first without soap or anything just to get my skin warm</li>
            <li> The device is comfortable in the hand, easy to hold and</li>
            <li> Lightly seemed to produce more tugging, and prevent you from getting the full benefit of the vibrations which help manage the pain.    </li>
            <li> recommend this product strongly, it&#x27;s awesome, and useful and you can take it anywhere on trips (as long as you follow voltage instructions).</li>
            <li> Epilator was fine though.</li>
            <li> This machine is still going strong with regular use for over three years - love Braun stuff!!</li>
            <li> You can really get all of the hairs, and i think the light is a nice feature, too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line is the Braun is a great alternative to shaving in my case and the light makes a BIG difference while using it.  </li>
            <li> only used the epilator on my legs and they look great.</li>
            <li> my legs are still smooth with no hairs.</li>
            <li> As advertised it doesn&#x27;t keep you hair free for over a month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Its fabulous.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light:</li>
            <li> It is also comfortable to hold in your hand.  </li>
            <li> is that my legs aren&#x27;t nearly as smooth as they would be post shave or wax.</li>
            <li> have used Braun silk epil before(11years back) and had switched to waxing/shaving and it feels great to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Would have continued using it, if the voltage/current parameters would have fit the US as well.</li>
            <li> My legs felt so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The brush for cleaning hairs &amp; the simple, drawsting pouch for holding spilator, attachments &amp; cord is always a great, needed addition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> the light helps focus and the tweezers work well.</li>
            <li> Not as smooth as shaving or waxing.  </li>
            <li> Tried it almost 24 hours ago and still smooth, with shaving I would already be prickly at this point.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Shave once or twice a week to get smooth and exfoliated.</li>
            <li> works well and the light feature helps a lot.</li>
            <li> light notices hairs that I would have never seen without it.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I&#x27;ve not worked up the courage to do my underarms yet, but the legs are absolutely fabulous.</li>
            <li> got this for my mom, who I am the primary care giver for.</li>
            <li> but I had also let it grow out pretty good first.  </li>
            <li> the first thing i did was try it out on my thigh hair, that i only shave in the summer - and the results were incredible, even my boyfriend noticed the difference.</li>
            <li> Shaving with this was quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I caught most on the first try.</li>
            <li> Worth it! -</li>
            <li> Worth it! -</li>
            <li> Worth it! -</li>
            <li> Worth it! -</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and like it much better than shaving.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of the first Silk Epils years and years ago (circa 1995) and it seemed like over time the metal tweezers stopped gripping.  </li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t have to clean my hairs from all over the bathroom when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> I had used an epilator before a very cheap one that was a very painfull experience  </li>
            <li> not as good as expected,the light is pretty much useless,the epilator itself feels like it pinches you all yhe time,hurts more than my old one</li>
            <li> Nothing special, it does its job</li>
            <li> As for the pain factor I never have to use the ice thingy and find  the pain perfectly tolerable and hardly get any irritation:</li>
            <li> (Don&#x27;t allow the hair to grow more than 3/4 of an inch in underarms, otherwise it might become very painful)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Money wise it is simple.</li>
            <li> however, for comparison&#x27;s sake, it is definitely more intense).</li>
            <li> But overall this thing is good.</li>
            <li> Fairly well on the fronts of my thighs (medium) and bikini region (coarse).  </li>
            <li> (And watching something while doing it seems to help me not focus on the pain too much and get it done more</li>
            <li> so I placed the cool glove in it for about 3 mins (inadvertantly; I received a call and had to answer it).  </li>
            <li> Not bad at all for the trade off of days of no maintenance.   </li>
            <li> Wish Braun comes up with a new model featuring more tweezers and higher speed!!</li>
            <li> The little light that is on it is great too.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as a careful close shave, but it felt great for my first try!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as a careful close shave, but it felt great for my first try!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the smart light  is very useful.</li>
            <li> just a quick pluck and done.     </li>
            <li> Between using that setting, my own growing expertise, and the fact that fewer hairs grow back every time, I now have totally smooth legs for about 2 weeks after every use.  </li>
            <li> Well, it is even more comfortable to use than my old one.</li>
            <li> On my underarms it often felt like I had a mild sunburn after using (for about a day or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> create their own challenges), wasn&#x27;t pink, and had the light built in!  </li>
            <li> create their own challenges), wasn&#x27;t pink, and had the light built in!  </li>
            <li> I found out quickly that is not the case.</li>
            <li> But it does a great job on coarse hair and it has a real place in the hairy woman&#x27;s arsenal.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Besides the pain, this device is only effective on the more noticeable hairs as it doesn&#x27;t grab the short ones or very fine ones.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> Once the lotion dried, my husband and I were both impressed with how soft and smooth my legs felt.  </li>
            <li> Once the lotion dried, my husband and I were both impressed with how soft and smooth my legs felt.  </li>
            <li> I am very pleased as it has been 3 weeks since I last used it</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years, and they are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too large and can be stored easily in the bathroom.  </li>
            <li> I switched out for the efficiency cap and turned the speed up and found that I actually experienced less discomfort.  </li>
            <li> Actually, the vibration from the epilator feels pretty good against the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall as a first time user of an epilator, and trying to decide between multiple options, I chose this one because of the good reviews.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine much better short of laser becoming truly affordable.</li>
            <li> I watched Youtube video, after Youtube video, of people trying epilators for the first time... and man, did it scare me!  </li>
            <li> I watched Youtube video, after Youtube video, of people trying epilators for the first time... and man, did it scare me!  </li>
            <li> but it only gets better!  </li>
            <li> Cooling pad is great, There will always be a little pain in doing this</li>
            <li> Holding the device more firmly against the skin was better than holding it lightly.</li>
            <li> Your legs may also never feel as smooth with epilating as after shaving - but they will LOOK acceptable for much longer.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and smooth, I didnt feel any pain.</li>
            <li> Far faster and more efficient</li>
            <li> I think  that, over all, this purchase was totally worth it</li>
            <li> In fact, I kind of miss that feeling of having had a nice deep massage after using my last one.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly noisy, though as expected.</li>
            <li> I could not find any data about RPMs on Braun&#x27;s site, but for some reason it just feels like the 5180 revolves more often than the old 5270.  </li>
            <li> I DO care about looking nice for people I care about, but not regularly just for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also want to say that the ice glove is nice idea but the same thing can be achieved at home..</li>
            <li> Definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li> Two speeds are nice for different purposes and pain tolerances.</li>
            <li> it hurts more in sensitive areas like calves and close to ankles</li>
            <li> so my experience could be totally different from your own.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, it&#x27;s worth it for me because I despise having to shave.</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;ll be delighted.</li>
            <li> well worth the price.</li>
            <li> For a manual exfoliation I have found that better than any scrub or loofah etc IN the shower is AFTER a nice long shower, dry your legs very aggressively with a nice un-fabric-softened towel - you will see the skin roll off even if you just used scrubby gloves or whatever.  </li>
            <li> easily in your hand, is less noisy, the massaging head attachment actually helps keep the pain level low by gently vibrating the surrounding skin, the led light is great for lighting up the area to find missed hairs, and the best part, and this is my personal opinion, my skin feels smoother</li>
            <li> It works great as an epilator but the hair is hard to clean from the blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The light is only an okay feature, doesn&#x27;t help very much.</li>
            <li> I love the light on this Braun - it makes it so easy to see the little hairs.</li>
            <li> had shaved the day I was supposed to receive this product and did not, so I could not epilate on my legs right away.  </li>
            <li> Why would I want to chill my pores right before yanking hairs out?  </li>
            <li> Received my item right on time, as described and unharmed.</li>
            <li> It takes a whole hour to clean my legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted - a simple and effective epilator.</li>
            <li> Also, shaving is very quick now because there really isn&#x27;t much there to shave, just a quick once over to smooth out my skin completely until I&#x27;m ready to epilate again.  </li>
            <li> hmmm I suppose this was worth a try, but you must have to use it frequently at first to get rid of all your hair.  </li>
            <li> Luckily my arm hair is light and fine, if a tad long - I would never dream of using this on my arms.  </li>
            <li> This epilator removed all the hair except very fine, very blonde hairs.</li>
            <li> I had the previous incarnation of this item and loved it but noticed it was losing its strength after a number of years but still doing well</li>
            <li> Since this is my first epilator I can&#x27;t compare it with others, but I am very happy with my choice!!got a little nervous when I realized how red</li>
            <li> I love the colorful, sparkly look of the old - the new looks</li>
            <li> Its so easy to operate ,fast to save me time and left my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> this one is as nice as the dry ones come!)</li>
            <li> Attached to the product is a \\&quot;smart light\\&quot; which really came in handy when epilating and especially finding stray hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line - get a Braun and I highly recommend one with a light, it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying an epilator</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time.</li>
            <li> things first</li>
            <li> The light comes in handy to see what areas need a second or third pass.  </li>
            <li> This is my first ever epilation experience.</li>
            <li> So immediately after the use you cannot exactly say whether all the hairs were removed from root or just cut at the surface)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying that this is NOT my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> no self-harm\\&quot; mechanism wouldn&#x27;t allow me to try it first</li>
            <li> so I got my boyfriend to do my first leg.</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it advertises.  </li>
            <li> oh and just so you know this is the first review of any product I have ever done</li>
            <li> *)</li>
            <li> Many hairs were pulled from the root, but a good amount were broken off, so my results were good but not great; my legs were smooth in some places but not others.  </li>
            <li> so it would help on the slower setting for those who have a higher threshold for pain.</li>
            <li> To my standards, epilating has taken longer than shaving, but I get better results, my skin feels softer and it takes longer for the hair to grow back</li>
            <li> (I used to do this when I first started waxing and it helps).</li>
            <li> (though maybe all epilators do this - I don&#x27;t know as it&#x27;s my first)</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it was my first time using an epilator, ever.</li>
            <li> The instructions did mention if you&#x27;re a first timer</li>
            <li> and I must say it&#x27;s a lot more like a moderate discomfort.  </li>
            <li> The instructions did mention if you&#x27;re a first timer</li>
            <li> and I must say it&#x27;s a lot more like a moderate discomfort.  </li>
            <li> That first time?</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> You wouldn&#x27;t have to use it again for a couple of weeks and if you do it&#x27;ll be for sparse hair that got missed the first time perhaps because they weren&#x27;t even out yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left so many stray hairs and just would not pick up them up, even after going over and over the area dozens of times until I gave up and just shaved the strays.  </li>
            <li> There simply is no comparison, Braun makes a better epilator.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Being my first epilator, I think it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> this is my first time using an epilator</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> My legs are nowhere near as smooth as they were when I shave.</li>
            <li> Overall I am pleased with it when I use it on my armpits and lower leg</li>
            <li> However, in the process of doing my research about it, I learned for the first time ever about epilation.  </li>
            <li> Today I &amp;#34;played&amp;#34; with it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> My favorite part is the light so u can do ur legs even if it is dark in the room.</li>
            <li> Thanks for reading !</li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> which is the only reason for the 4 stars vs 5 :-)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a high tolerance for pain, but after you run it through your hair once quickly, and don&#x27;t focus on the pain, it&#x27;s a breeze after that.</li>
            <li> My legs are still super smooth at the end of the night and the next morning when I wake up.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the manual, but it seems to be pretty intuitive - just make sure you go against the direction of hair growth (which sometimes means going in several directions on a certain body part, like the medial calf).  </li>
            <li> I have not used an epilator since the WAY early days of the original Epilady...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I did not even feel like it did a decent job quicklyenough to make it worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this on my underarms was pretty intense the first time -</li>
            <li> far, the 5180 seems to do a better job than even my old 5270.  </li>
            <li> The packaging is smart and portable and the price is reasonable for the years of use and sexiness that will result!</li>
            <li> The light is nice, though not necessary for me this time, as I could figure out where I still had to do by going right next to the previous bright red</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this and their previous models in terms of pain reduction, but it&#x27;s definitely more precise and picks up hair very well.</li>
            <li> Epilating is much faster (though still pretty time consuming - I would say an hour for both legs with an epilator versus 2-4 for waxing</li>
            <li> The first experience was a very tolerable pain on my legs</li>
            <li> Very noisy, so at first, it will intimidate you.</li>
            <li> (Some people may have a higher pain threshhold though I do consider mine pretty high.)  </li>
            <li> Since she is now nearly 9 months pregnant</li>
            <li> The hair does gradually grow back over two weeks time, but the epilator is so easy to use that I can touch up in between if I&#x27;m tempted to wear a sundress and find that my legs need some work.</li>
            <li> My thought on that is it is going hurt for the first few times, no matter what kind you get.  </li>
            <li> &amp; 3) good disposable blade razors are becoming really expensive.     </li>
            <li> With the light, I can easily see where little hairs are.</li>
            <li> The Braun did hurt a little more but subsided quickly.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to face that I had wasted my money and try another Braun, figuring this one would be even better than my original with the upgraded 40 tweezer heads and the addition of the light.  </li>
            <li> certainly recommend this product to anyone that is wanting to try an epilator.</li>
            <li> I researched epilating I remembered reading ingrown hairs can be an issue, so when I was done, I got back in the shower with my new favorite exfoliating wash</li>
            <li> I researched epilating I remembered reading ingrown hairs can be an issue, so when I was done, I got back in the shower with my new favorite exfoliating wash</li>
            <li> love the fact that the new Silk epil has the inbuilt light,so I don&#x27;t have to strain my eyes and back to see if it took out all the hair.</li>
            <li> Yes, it hurts, depending on the person, much less or much more, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it has held up fine over the last 4 years or so.  </li>
            <li> The discomfort was quite mild in most places and only moderate on my shins.  </li>
            <li> Every single hair follicle turned bright red, but after some baby oil and a night&#x27;s sleep, it looked pretty normal again.</li>
            <li> My hair grows back sparser and finer, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say about it :)</li>
            <li> It was very tolerable on lighter hair and for that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i didnt really use the ice glove, i found there was no need for it.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would, but I have used wax strips before.</li>
            <li> The Braun Silk-epil 5 works very well at removing hair and</li>
            <li> You can be worry free for the next 15 to 20 days after epilation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> , my wife really likes this epilator.</li>
            <li> So any touch ups can&#x27;t really hurt but so much.</li>
            <li> My legs were smooth through several bouts of goosebumps.</li>
            <li> but  you can handle it very well.  </li>
            <li> Mine comes with a frezzing gel pad to aply it in your sking before you start with the epilator  to reduce the pain, and believe me IT WORKS it almost freezes yuor skin and you will not feel to much pain</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s fast</li>
            <li> Granted, I do not have much hair on the bottom of my forearm, but</li>
            <li> I absolutely could not tolerate the pain.  </li>
            <li> Never again will I do that or pay high salon prices!  </li>
            <li> Very helpful for seeing where you missed.&lt;br /&gt;The ice glove: I see no difference with it.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find that the iced glove made much difference in my pain tolerance.  </li>
            <li> I would prefer to get them waxed because you get perfectly smooth legs for several weeks.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but the time isn&#x27;t reasonable.</li>
            <li> , there&#x27;s no real way to avoid this - you are just yanking hairs out by the root after all) - the better epilators \\&quot;minimize\\</li>
            <li> The Braun 5180 does that job very well.</li>
            <li> (because I really was terrified after reading all the reviewers talk about pain) and it didn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really care much about portability and batteries</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t really care much about portability and batteries</li>
            <li> Or I get goosebumps and negate the whole thing...  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t painfree, but very tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Even better that the hairs come in slower and not as rough as the razor.  </li>
            <li> they really minimise the pain.</li>
            <li> it did not hurt as much</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Works fast, doesn&#x27;t do the damage some cheaper ones do.</li>
            <li> It works fast and pulls the the leg hairs out by the root.</li>
            <li> Apart from that, I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending, some models want you to go slower with a lighter touch to really pull out the hairs &amp; not just cut them as is the case for me.</li>
            <li> Afterwards, my legs and underarms were left amazingly smooth.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It is so much smoother than tweezing every hair for some reason.</li>
            <li> and you can really see the difference; it is fast.</li>
            <li> and I am able to epilate my legs with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> 10 or 15 minutes later, I swear my stomach was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s belly.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.  </li>
            <li> Hair growth is still fast as</li>
            <li> Maintain your smooth skin by using your epilator regularly (every two weeks or so).</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m left with smooth, hair-free legs for days.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really knock the item,</li>
            <li> Pain Tolerance: I like tweezing my eyebrows, sometimes so much that I get carried away.</li>
            <li> I was ready to go...</li>
            <li> When using it on my underarms at first, I screamed, but now it is more than bearable and as someone of color who has dark hair, it removes the spots on your underarms and legs</li>
            <li> My first got shoved away in a box under the bed almost immediately after my first attempt at using it, which, as I recall, didn&#x27;t go far.</li>
            <li> Well, first thing I did right was buy it first and read the reviews second.</li>
            <li> I mean it didn&#x27;t feel good or something, but it was not excruciating or unbearable.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend to go for some other epilators with more tweezers.</li>
            <li> So now I&#x27;m gonna go into some detail of what I like/dislike using it for, not for the sake of TMI, but in case you want more input on what other women use it on and why.</li>
            <li> but I do wish I was able to epilate my thighs and arms and not experience extreme pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure thats due to the Braun having approx.</li>
            <li> As she said, there are forty other things that I would rather be doing, but I like smooth in all the right places</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the older model of this epilator for almost exactly a year of writing this new review.  </li>
            <li> Epilation removes the hair and keeps legs hair free as long as waxing does</li>
            <li> i was told the hair will grow back softer and thinner, so i&#x27;m waiting to see if that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> If you have a higher threshold of pain and to make sureyou have a complete epilation and not just a shave do it</li>
            <li> However, this device has pretty much completely changed the way I remove hair.  </li>
            <li> In a moment of unexpected bravery, I first held it up to an armpit after turning it on.</li>
            <li> The pain was a little more intense also.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Arrived in a timely fashion and exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will feel pain the first few times you use it but after that it all gets better and you&#x27;ll barely feel it.</li>
            <li> massaging roller head really helps, it did me when I was new at it, but sometimes felt it got in the way of grabbing shorter hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, brand new, unopened package.</li>
            <li> More squinting less outright \\&quot;OWWW\\&quot;-ing.  </li>
            <li> This has all the main features or functionality required and serves the purpose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a definite sting but over quickly.</li>
            <li> I started with an older model Braun 27 tweezer head and used it until it wore out.  </li>
            <li> It does take some time for the hair to grow back ( a week at the most) and the hair also grows back slower.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was reluctant to purchase my first epilator, but after managing to slice open a nice little gash in my leg while shaving, I decided to take the plunge.  </li>
            <li> Prior to your first experience with the epilator, make sure you wax (either do it yourself or, if you are inexperienced, pay to have it done).</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t hurt) and certain body parts are more sensitive than others (thighs as opposed to lower half of leg).</li>
            <li> And I do not do the backs of my thighs because the hair grows in nine million different directions and you really need to go the right direction to epilate.  </li>
            <li> As I mentioned before, I have a high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li> So far two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> The results are pretty much the same, it hurts a little bit more in some parts though.</li>
            <li> I am in need of a new replacement head - I think they ALL lose tweeze ability over time - and decided just to buy a whole new unit since they are making a new style now</li>
            <li> As far as quality goes, this epilator feels very sturdy and appears well made.  </li>
            <li> will repeat that I am happily surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li> will repeat that I am happily surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  </li>
            <li> She uses it frequently and it works very well for her.</li>
            <li> So I will deduct one star for pain and leave it as a great product that some will find difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I will use it again in a few days to get rid of more hair.</li>
            <li> There was virtually no pain above the elbow, some discomfort on the tops of my forearms, and pretty intense pain on the bottoms of my forearms.  </li>
            <li> The cost is worth the fact that I only shave once, maybe twice a month.  </li>
            <li> green - Love it!&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li> I can epilate and then go campingfor a few days with friends and look OK</li>
            <li> After a thorough testing by my significant other I can report the Braun expilator does a really job.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning it is time consuming but not hard.</li>
            <li> The little light on this particular epilator is really helpful when epilating the legs.</li>
            <li> time, tweezing supposedly results in finer hair regrowth (so the epilator would become less effective as it doesn&#x27;t work as well on the finer hairs) but that is in theory and in practice, I have never noticed hairs growing back finer after repeated tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Subsequent touch ups were easy, relatively painless and convenient.</li>
            <li> so my pores are open and epilated my legs right after the shower.</li>
            <li> But my first epilator experience and my first (and only, EVER) attempt at home waxing ended in much the same way:  </li>
            <li> There are parts of my inner legs kinds of above and below the knee where the hair is fine, doesn&#x27;t work so well on this.  </li>
            <li> Ok...that is a little more sensitive, but I can deal with that if I&#x27;m going to have hairless underarms.  </li>
            <li> and then you will need to replace them or to buy a new Epilator.  </li>
            <li> hello to my new friend Braun SE 5180.  </li>
            <li> I am a new customer for this product line.  </li>
            <li> even though I have piercings/tattoos it was a new sensation that I was NOT used to.</li>
            <li> and I live in a 110 V area</li>
            <li> Then the head got worn out and instead of paying $30 for a new head I just bought a new epilator instead.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m browsing for a new one.</li>
            <li> I heard about a (new?)</li>
            <li> tears, shakiness, new product in the trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and remove hair in short time, i recommend it for legs, there is a pain though but not that much.</li>
            <li> All in all, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is fed up with shaving or body hair in general!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve helped her out with epilating, I can say from personal experience that it does a pretty thorough job.</li>
            <li> so I only got to one leg, below the calf, the first day.  </li>
            <li> I psyched myself up pretty badly prior to this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was expecting this loud, obnoxious sound but it sounds like any other electronic gadget that you use.  </li>
            <li> After 4 uses, my hair is much thinner and barely noticeable.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun; the first one died by using 6-7 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First epilator I&#x27;ve found tolerable, and it seems to do a pretty thorough job, so I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyhow, I decided to try it anyhow as the last time I tried epilation, 15 or so years ago, the technology was no so hot</li>
            <li> No bateries, it comes with an electric cord long enough to have free movement around your body.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light blonde, but long and dense, so I look hairier than I ought to.</li>
            <li> Buy it, take your time with your first few uses, and you too will say \\&quot;Worth It!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Although it will leave your hair much smoother and thinner down there, the pain may not be worth it.</li>
            <li> My first was a Phillips Satinelle which, apparently, is no longer in production.</li>
            <li> I started out by trying it on the bottom half and moved to the top of my legs the following day.</li>
            <li> Also my hair started growing back in less time than advertised (more like a week).  </li>
            <li> The irritation I did feel was outweighed by the site of the stubborn little hairs flying in all directions, illuminated for your entertainment, in the light built in to the device.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit long to clean it properly though.</li>
            <li> A little noise, more than a regular shaving machine, not so ergonomic design</li>
            <li> also my hair r not that hard any more.</li>
            <li> The product itself seems of very high quality the problem is my mom has a low tolerance of pain.</li>
            <li> The so called NEW models differ from the older ones only  by color and body shape.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> as a relatively hairy girl, i have always shaved and never ventured into the world of much else - like waxing or sugaring.</li>
            <li> /&gt;* Not messy like waxing&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised that there was no pain for me while doing this.  </li>
            <li> in all, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is fed up with shaving or body hair in general!n get everything, and I ended up just plucking individually...</li>
            <li> I never got that far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the creams and I have rather sensitive skin</li>
            <li> and by this time the redness was nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> and by this time the redness was nearly gone.  </li>
            <li> and it is not messy, nor does the weather effect the efficiency of hair</li>
            <li> Soon after I was surprised to find the Braun had been delivered so</li>
            <li> the tiny brush for cleaning works very well&lt;</li>
            <li> As far as hair removal goes I cannot say that this epilates all my hairs.</li>
            <li> I did not know my old epilator was so inefficient until I used this newer model.  </li>
            <li> been using it regularly and it is very convenient to plug and use.</li>
            <li> As for this review specifically for the Braun,  I feel the final results were much smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> so I replaced it with a Soft Perfection (20 tweezers)</li>
            <li> so the old is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I for now am going to say I prefer the old.  </li>
            <li> I am simply not limber enough to be able to get close enough to figure out what I am doing back</li>
            <li> This thing actually works really well in conjunction with shaving.</li>
            <li> far as noise goes, it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but I found I could still hear the TV over it at about the volume I had it at without the epilator on.</li>
            <li> I think it will take me a few sessions to get the entire underarm area, but I love the way it feels after it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also the hair grows back much more slowly and is much thinner.</li>
            <li> In the past I have been to the salon and had my legs waxed and felt like the skin covering my shins had been pulled off right along with the hair!!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For those of you new to epilating, it will hurt at first, but trust me, before long you will barely feel it.  </li>
            <li> The armpit was relatively easy with very little pain.</li>
            <li> Trimmed the other arm&#x27;s worth of hair, and then finished that rather quickly, though with breaks every 20 seconds or so to wait for the pain to die down.</li>
            <li> It is not removing small and fine hairs.</li>
            <li> X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] was an replacement after my older Emjoi (which isn&#x27;t even listed on Amazon anymore) started showing its age after a couple years of solid performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Remember that the first time you use it you are pulling out ALL your hairs at once and the &amp;#34;bulbs&amp;#34; at the end of the hair are big and hurt coming out of your skin (especially the underarms, take Ibuprofen 15-30 mins.</li>
            <li> Most importantly (for me), I love the fact that the hair on my legs grows back without ever being rough and spiky (which I really, really hate and why I refuse to shave).</li>
            <li> The only annoying thing is the light which is too bright that you cannot see clearly.</li>
            <li> i had to go over the same areas more than once because, as i already said, i didn&#x27;t luck out with genetics and soft invisible hairs, mine is pretty coarse and thick, especially after years and years of shaving.</li>
            <li> I guess I had a little more facial hair than I could actually see, because it did get a lot out.  </li>
            <li> No regrets!!</li>
            <li> I am fortunate in that I only have to remove hair from the front lower half of my legs...</li>
            <li> The head, without the attachments, looked kind of naked and unfinished compared to the Soft Perfection and the tweezers were half plastic, half metal vs. metal on metal like the Soft Perfection - but it worked well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m, a busy working single mom of 2 and this machine saves me loads of time getting ready in the mornings.</li>
            <li> (since it does grow in much thinner, it&#x27;s not nearly as noticeable as it was when I was shaving).   </li>
            <li> In that case just calm down, switch it off, unplug the device</li>
            <li> It stung a little, but didn&#x27;t hurt and didn&#x27;t really feel much</li>
            <li> I had to run the epilator very slowly up my legs SEVERAL times over one pass just to clear it up and while the smart light was quite helpful, t hair seemed to break off in most places and only a few were actually pulled out.</li>
            <li> lower legs i actually depilated today - and whilst i did miss a few little hairs that were just too short to be plucked (i used tweezers on them), the overall result is great.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair, with dark roots, so my legs looked better with the roots gone.</li>
            <li> Anxious to try it out, but lacking much body hair, I decided to do my arms first.</li>
            <li> When I moved onto other areas it hurt a little more.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;- very little hair actually falls out of the epilator - this may because my hair is fine and also because i cleaned it out every 5 minutes&lt;</li>
            <li> On more sensitive areas I usually get irritation bumps even if I ice or take other precautions.</li>
            <li> I am confident that with extended use I will have less and less hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> The smart light is useful to find thin small hairs</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great shaver, and I didn&#x27;t find it painful (maybe because I&#x27;ve already been using one).</li>
            <li> I just use it as an ice pack for general use now.</li>
            <li> The treated area stays smooth for at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Personally, I like it because is small ad lightweight plus the light</li>
            <li> No regrets with buying this brand, infact i wish i bought this sooner.</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t really try the ice glove that comes with it, because it just made my legs wet</li>
            <li> On my legs the pain barely bother me.</li>
            <li> I also recommend doing this in the evening as you can get red bumps or sensitive skin afterward</li>
            <li> the only reason i bought this because my old one is 220 V</li>
            <li> So, I had to buy another one, but thought to go for the same brand, since the old one served well.</li>
            <li> I found that to be the complete opposite for me.</li>
            <li> Bare bones, unit and spinny head, yank those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much different than the old one we had</li>
            <li> The details of the products braun SE 5270(pink) and SE 5180 were exactly same except the price of pink one was bit higher.</li>
            <li> first few times I used it, I used the soft setting.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the same - the initial pain can be surprising, but if you go through it quickly, it&#x27;s easily forgettable.</li>
            <li> Though if you&#x27;re comparing this to shaving, from the 2nd day on, epilating wins hands down.</li>
            <li> Though expensive, it works great, with NO pain, less hair regrowth,therefore,</li>
            <li> My first one I got as an xmas present--the original coil style Epilady which was pretty painful.</li>
            <li> Shaving leaves your legs very smooth, but only for a few hours and the hairs look so dark when they grow</li>
            <li> First, because a spot on my leg was red and burning from having first epilated, I ran it down that spot a few times and it helped considerably.  </li>
            <li> My left side(Braun) felt smoother while rubbing my skin as opposed to the right side(Emjoi) which I felt had a slight stubble sensation</li>
            <li> The pain was minimal, watching the little hairs coming out made this almost pain free for me.</li>
            <li> This model is hard to clean though.</li>
            <li> have pretty dark body hair in general with some finer, blonde hairs.  </li>
            <li> It was very helpful for me to read that information in other reviews....</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell they use the same head so tweezing ability should be the same.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it is pretty painful, but I expected that much; it does seem to get better</li>
            <li> Yes, it is pretty painful, but I expected that much; it does seem to get better</li>
            <li> Legs were very much less sensitive than the arm, though a day&#x27;s stubble didn&#x27;t seem quite long enough for it to grip onto very much hair.</li>
            <li> It will grab hair that is pretty short - way shorter than waxing - but the thicker the hair the less prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In fact, I had a few strays from the first day</li>
            <li> but the way my legs looked afterward was WAY worth the small amount of discomfort that I did have.</li>
            <li> love what waxing does for the legs, but it is messy and in humid weather its not very effective either.</li>
            <li> I would rather wax down there and get a whole section done with then use the epilator and have it torture me hair by hair.</li>
            <li> I started with my legs first, and it wasn&#x27;t any more painful than having my legs waxed...</li>
            <li> love this product, at first it may seem painful when is pulling hair out</li>
            <li> but it was a lot less intense.</li>
            <li> The first few times I used it, I could tolerate it only for 1-2 seconds at a time b/c of the pain.</li>
            <li> Used weekly, and the first one lasted only a few months</li>
            <li> It hurt less than waxing, and to me, except for a few very hairy spots, there was not real &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; at all, just mild discomfort.  </li>
            <li> In the underarm area if the skin is not stretched properly, the skin can get stuck into the epilator.</li>
            <li> ; so maybe I&#x27;m not typical, but I could use this all day long and never give it a second thought.  </li>
            <li> Normally I had to shave every other day especially in the summer months.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have a high tolerance of pain, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything except slight pulls.</li>
            <li> (but just a small spot because the glove is only so big) with the cold and, as aforementioned, that would work great, but could only do this if I had hours and hours to work on epilation.  </li>
            <li> may end up trying the new style down the road just because I like gadgets...  </li>
            <li> the older 5270 model took a few passes in order to grab-and-yank the hairs properly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming everyone knows that epilators hurt (other than completely anesthetizing your shaving area</li>
            <li> There were a few spots that smarted a little but not bad.</li>
            <li> The new one just pivots which seems to me like it would offer less control?  </li>
            <li> so epilating makes my legs look so much better because you can&#x27;t see those tiny pindots of black hairs that shaving leaves behind.  </li>
            <li> After the first few sessions, there really is no pain.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble doing my armpit, which also was the part that hurt the most, but the ice glove helped a little with the pain.</li>
            <li> It was very convenient for the small places.</li>
            <li> and I had to wait until my hair was long enough.</li>
            <li> The first time epilating was terrifying and felt like little ants biting me, but once you get over that feeling, this little tool is the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me a long time to post a review for this product because I can&#x27;t bring myself to use it frequently enough to get the desired results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epiladies for years starting with Emjoi &amp; my current one besides this is a few years old model Braun.</li>
            <li> , I hope it will last as long.</li>
            <li> This could just be in my mind or it could be that my old 5270 is just slowing down, so please take this observation with a grain of salt</li>
            <li> It Works very well at removing hair with less irritation than an other method like shaving razors or creams , but it does hurt.</li>
            <li> I came to the conclusion that most people who find the epilator incredibly painful are those who go from shaving directly to using an epilator.</li>
            <li> I have an old (at least 10 years old)</li>
            <li> Observations: after the fourth day, I had minimal grow back .</li>
            <li> You can epilate whenever, without having to wait for every single hair to grow back out (as in waxing).</li>
            <li> it also was rather frustrating having to wait till it grows long enough to be depilated - but it was worth it.</li>
            <li> If you epilate on a regular basis your hair regrowth will be sparser due to the different growth cycles</li>
            <li> A cheap alternative for the expensive parlor hair</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t choose a wet/dry model because one of the things that bothered me the most about shaving was having to get in the shower and stand awkwardly to do it.    </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to wait at least a week, and maybe two, but don&#x27;t wait much longer than that.</li>
            <li> My experience with tweezing, prior to receiving this, was extremely minimal.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it for so long.</li>
            <li> Long story</li>
            <li> It works on hairs about 1mm long, sometimes shorter.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wait too long before using the epilator after waxing.</li>
            <li> i only used this on my arms and the pain was irritating the first 5min</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am curious how long this will last compared to shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I am curious how long this will last compared to shaving.  </li>
            <li> I use the high speed as the other one seems pointless to me and the discomfort level is the same.   </li>
            <li> On my arm pits, I have to use it at least twice a week to keep the new growth from coming back.</li>
            <li> I find that going at a 90 degree angle to the direction of growth is less painful than fully against, while still getting good clearage.</li>
            <li> But having it done is expensive and doing it yourself (for me) takes a *ridiculous* amount of time and makes me have to get creative with position in hopes of not missing a spot, to the point where by the end</li>
            <li> but I have no prior experience with other brands or models to compare the product to.  </li>
            <li> The one con, other than the initial ouch, is ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I literally read every single review here, not only for this model but also every other one I could find.  </li>
            <li> I literally read every single review here, not only for this model but also every other one I could find.  </li>
            <li> It does take a while and hurts at first but after the first use the pain isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> and i had to dry them to be depilated each time.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, this is more painful than waxing (though waxing doesn&#x27;t bother me, and I don&#x27;t think epilating is that big of a deal either...</li>
            <li> I got out of the shower patted them dry and covered them in [[ASIN:B000YHAGK8 Tropical Traditions Organic Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizing Cream - Unscented]]</li>

            <li> She said it does tend to pull the occasional hair a bit painfully, but this is way better than shaving.</li>
            <li> The armpit feels like dry shaving.</li>
            <li> It was painful in a few places but the results were good.</li>
            <li> I tried with dry legs.  </li>
            <li> Braun 5280 pink - same as 5180 but in pink.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I am not new to epilation ...</li>
            <li> (It hurts a lot less when it&#x27;s not long, however!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars due to the slight bloody pores I experienced which the Emjoi did not happen with.  </li>
            <li> started out with the \\&quot;starter\\&quot; head and slow speed, but have moved onto the faster speed and \\&quot;efficiency\\&quot; head, as it doesn&#x27;t really hurt any less to do the whole process in slow motion--</li>
            <li> Shaving my underarm has always left a dark shadow and the hairs always grew back within two days, but epilating keeps the hair away longer and doesn&#x27;t leave a dark shadow.</li>
            <li> not able remove the hair completely.</li>
            <li> This time, I decided to use some topical cepacol throat numbing spray (active ingredient: benzocaine!)</li>
            <li> I can mention that is almost the same as pain, maybe 10% or 15% less.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly girly.  </li>
            <li> About a week and half later I worked up the nerve to use this again.</li>
            <li> so I went ahead and epilated with my Emjoi for about 30 mins with the normal unsatisfactory results (lots of stray hairs left behind).  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is that they don&#x27;t have a smaller cup like they did in the previous model...</li>
            <li> because her previous Emjoi finally gave up the ghost after 10 years.  </li>
            <li> the first time epilating is the worst, as the hair follicles weaken the more times the hair is plucked out.</li>
            <li> but that was expected because of the single 40 tweezer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it was due to long hairs being tweezed out or what.  </li>
            <li> but I would not say it hurts, less painful than waxing and definitely cheaper and more convenient.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it is less efficient with finer hair i.e. upper arms and legs, where I made several passes and the skin is still not 100% hair-free.</li>
            <li> The ice glove provides only a little relief.  </li>
            <li> I got a little nervous when I realized how red</li>
            <li> And after a while, your hairs hardly grow back at all, and when they do, they are much thinner and hardly noticeable.    </li>
            <li> While I was waiting I decided to try my arms and that was even more painful than my legs.</li>
            <li> the skin is smoother a few days later than with shaving.  </li>
            <li> Recently I bought Braun SE 5180 silk epil 5 epilator with ice glove (green).</li>
            <li> When starting out I suggest shaving a few days before you epilate so</li>
            <li> and you can carefully remove it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The red swelling bumps that appeared as I epilated disappeared in a few hours.</li>
            <li> Before using this, I tried plucking a few hairs on various parts of my body: face, arms, underarms, legs.  </li>
            <li> The noise is minimal, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hurt enough for me to waste time on icing.   </li>
            <li> Really, no complains concerning efficiency.</li>
            <li> I ordered this epilator a few months back</li>
            <li> I spent years waxing my chest and shoulders</li>
            <li> Also well on my face (a few coarse chinny chins).  </li>
            <li> Not very thorough, so you have to go over that spot two or three times in order for the epilator to catch all of the follicles.</li>
            <li> This product not working as expected.</li>
            <li> There were a few tiny stings of rogue hairs being plucked, but nothing excruciating.</li>
            <li> I am not into painkillers so this was not really an option.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My legs once professionally a few years ago, and at home several times with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> I think that you have to be willing to invest enough time in this product to get to a point where the procedure becomes less uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I had read other reviews where people stated that the armpit was the most painful spot to epilate.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it in the bath with warm/hot water so that my pores are a little more open to make for easier (less painful) hair</li>
            <li> So, I soaked in a hot-water bath (and had to get out and dry off) and the pain was bearable but as soon as my legs cooled down, again, it became unbearable.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago for the very first time I used it on my legs because I was sick and tired of shaving my dark, thick and super fast growing hair every day..</li>
            <li> Beauty wise you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I had no pain individually plucking hairs from my arms or legs, and very little pain plucking my face (chin, eyebrows, upperlip) and underarms.&lt;br</li>
            <li> From my experience it does not make the skin darker as with the shaving or other methods</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t speak to pain, or speed in comparison to other models because I&#x27;ve never used any.</li>
            <li> I have two tattoos as well - one on my shin, the other on my ankle -</li>
            <li> No more daily shaving!!!!!!</li>
            <li> In other words, one-pass, get it all, don&#x27;t do it again for a week or so.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure if that is standard</li>
            <li> Other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> When I found this Braun product, I was interested but skeptical.  </li>
            <li> Of course I&#x27;ve never used any other epilator</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s held up and performed well against other brands I have used.  </li>
            <li> cold glove thingy was kinda&#x27; cool (no pun intended) though.  </li>
            <li> (So I tried it on the other knee, having not been epilated at all</li>
            <li> Easy and not too painful to use; your results will improve every time.  </li>
            <li> The pain was MUCH less than I expected, too.  </li>
            <li> The other negative was it took longer to actually finish my bodypart using the Braun than with the Emjoi.  </li>
            <li> I contemplated shaving first, but I was afraid if I took the time to do that I&#x27;d loose the nerve to try the epilator.  </li>
            <li> I followed other posters advice and took Motrin about a half hour before I began the procedure.  </li>
            <li> So the random hair doesn&#x27;t hurt really at all...</li>
            <li> I tried wax at home and that didn&#x27;t really do anything for me (probably the wrong stuff).  </li>
            <li> Although a few hair and some fuzzy ones have grown out  in past two days you only feel it when you touch the leg.</li>
            <li> I have blond hair, but lots of it -- and it is thick and coarse.  </li>
            <li> of these models are pretty \\&quot;rough\\&quot; - even on the slow setting they yank out hairs pretty violently.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always kind of hated my arm hair.</li>
            <li> I just glanced at the instructions, then plugged it, turned it on and pressed it against my skin in slow strokes, and in different directions (up and down, and side to side).  </li>
            <li> Yes, the underarm area is more sensitive, but you get the added satisfaction of little pink-pink-pink noises as those nasty little pricklies go flying.  </li>
            <li> And the price just after 6 days has gone down to 61 from</li>
            <li> One down side.</li>
            <li> I arrived home at noon today with my Braun Silk Epilator and sat down with lunch to give the instructions a once-over.  </li>
            <li> Genetics has been cruel in that my brother and father have less leg hair than I do - on what planet is that fair???  </li>
            <li> and I got tired of the mess, the long process, and how much my back hurts after</li>
            <li> In fact, it  hurts worse than tweezing a single hair but only because it is yanking out dozens at a time.  </li>
            <li> Anyways, Try this one if all the other ones have let you down!</li>
            <li> and it lasted longer than shaving, but it was messy and it was hard to see the back of my legs</li>
            <li> the only thing that sort of was a bummer is that i ended up with a few ingrowns, but they weren&#x27;t hard to pluck with tweezers.</li>
            <li> But you get used to it - and it hurts less every time.</li>
            <li> There is less irritation than a depilitory cream causes but it does hurt.  </li>
            <li> I had half a mind to return it</li>
            <li> I had half a mind to return it</li>
            <li> in fact there was less pain involved.  </li>
            <li> If I compare it to waxing, it takes less time</li>
            <li> I wonder if this would be easier if I had finer hair -- or less of it.  </li>
            <li> But for those who hate the itching and stubble the day after shaving, especially in the bikini area, it is worth every ouchie.</li>
            <li> grows thinner and less visible;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> I had to pause about half way through to reapply the numbing creme and wait for another 30 minutes or so for it to penetrate.</li>
            <li> I typically epilate every two weeks</li>
            <li> I did have to go over it a few times to get all the hairs, which caused some slight bumping.</li>
            <li> con of epilation vs waxing it that epilation makes ur skin dry and dull since it doesn&#x27;t remove the dead skin cells where as waxing removes then hence legs look and feel good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, of course it hurts a little because you are pulling hairs out by the root.</li>
            <li> the hairs are a little shorter.</li>
            <li> It pinches a little</li>
            <li> It felt like little pokes all over my skin.  </li>
            <li> Yea it stings a little bit</li>
            <li> I can still feel a few little hairs, but  I can&#x27;t see any of them.</li>
            <li> I was not taking it seriously at all, until I started to see hair accumulating in the dry bath tub in which I was standing.  </li>
            <li> (non-brazilian) bikini waxes don&#x27;t either except for a few spots.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While looking over my legs, I noticed a few patches that I had missed shaving - on my shin and thigh -</li>
            <li> did not enjoy the feel of having the hair removed in this manner</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I find that wax is effictive but messy and of course hurts.</li>
            <li> It has been a few months since  </li>
            <li> I too have had problems with ingrown hairs but its just a few</li>
            <li> I have tried this a few times now &amp; each time it feels as though I am ripping each hair out one by one.  </li>
            <li> - I tend to do it every few days in the summer.  </li>
            <li> AmLactin lotion can help a lot with an ingrowns that result - or for an acute horrible patch of them, tend-skin or the home made alternative.  </li>
            <li> Used every week or few days.  </li>
            <li> I was confused and finally ordered green</li>
            <li> But I can say certain areas were less unpleasant...</li>
            <li> I mean I expected a lot of pain</li>
            <li> I mean I expected a lot of pain</li>
            <li> Sturdy and fast, it makes epilating easier and not as painful as other methods.</li>
            <li> and also I have very pale skin and dark hair</li>
            <li> However, literally the second time I used it (a few weeks later) it was much much less painful, and now it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all</li>
            <li> My leg hairs (although thin) were long, and I got all of them after a few runs.</li>
            <li> Even did underarms and with very less pain</li>
            <li> I hate how getting goosebumps ruins a perfectly fresh shave in minutes.</li>
            <li> It did just an okay job removing the hair, so I was disappointed because at almost $60.00 it should perform better.&lt;br /&gt;After using this, I bit the bullet &amp; bought a no!no!</li>
            <li> It works but for first time use, it&#x27;s painful.</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that the first time you use this epilator it is painful.  </li>
            <li> The first time was quite painful and the cooling glove helped.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I am giving it fours stars because it really does work; it&#x27;s just my pain thresholdthat makes it impossible for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pulling your skin tight and going slowly helps.</li>
            <li> There is very little redness, and no visible hairs remain on my lower legs.  </li>
            <li> I bought this epilator with a lot of reservation...cost, will it really work, how painful,</li>
            <li> For the past 7 years, I&#x27;ve strictly shaved my legs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
            <li> Another week passes and I use it again and this time the pain is no more than what I feel when I pluck my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this about once a week for the past three weeks</li>
            <li> Anyhow, I am wierdly obsessed with being hairless and have recently been waxing.</li>
            <li> and now I feel like I&#x27;ve been missing out for years!</li>
            <li> This time I was surprised how much less painful it was to use.</li>
            <li> Less painful than childbirth, more painful than a</li>
            <li> And use this Epilator to massively thin out the number of active hairs.</li>
            <li> Several years later, I still hate shaving, so I found myself shopping for epilators</li>
            <li> 68$.The efficiency of the epilator is not very good.</li>
            <li> So, goodbye painful leg waxing, and high salon prices...</li>
            <li> and I am horrible at shaving my legs and really sick of it (only been doing it for 15 or so years, but I kept thinking there&#x27;s gotta be a better way!).  </li>
            <li> I normally tweeze each and every hair so it was not as painful as it could have been.</li>
            <li> My leg hair was getting scary long</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easier (since there are some parts that are really hard to get when you&#x27;re waxing), also waxing</li>
            <li> I had ordered some numbing creme with my epilator expecting it to dull the pain.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to explain</li>
            <li> I used that one for at least 2 decades.</li>
            <li> I spend at least 15 minute trying to get it done</li>
            <li> It was painful, and took me 4 hours with frequent breaks to contemplate what I was doing to myself and why, but I finished the darn forearm nonetheless.</li>
            <li> For people with thick hairs like myself you have to take the ups and downs of these types of hair removal systems.  </li>
            <li> The idea is to begin to epilate before your hair grows in too thickly.</li>
            <li> Regular use does make it less and less painful, until eventually it is merely maintenance.</li>
            <li> No more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow!</li>
            <li> No more razor stubble!</li>
            <li> I mean one that can go in water..</li>
            <li> It really was very unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Epilating my legs for the first time proved very painful.</li>
            <li> It seriously leaves hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> like the back of my legs weren&#x27;t as bad.</li>
            <li> The pain is by no means unbearable, but it is bad enough that I just find myself returning to shaving.  </li>
            <li> Attaching the beginner&#x27;s cap, I readied myself in the bathroom , set the speed on low, and touched the buzzing head to my leg and...not bad.  </li>
            <li> In the beginning stage of use it is painful, especially in the underarms but with time you get used to</li>
            <li> I thought I would upgrade to the Emjoi Emagine (AP-18) and have been using that for maybe a year until I finally grew completely frustrated with it.  </li>
            <li> it is not pleasant but it gives the results I want</li>
            <li> (Duh!)  </li>
            <li> But I think it&#x27;s really slow!</li>
            <li> It even hurts worse than waxing.  </li>
            <li> The benzocaine made that worse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m exhausted and breaking out a bottle of wine.</li>
            <li> My chest and abdomen had thin, splotchy patches of hair.  </li>
            <li> But if a $300 product was getting terrible reviews, what could a $60 product really do?  </li>
            <li> but I actually had bloody pores (about 3 of them).  </li>
            <li> When you have been shaving your legs for any length of time, your hair will be thick and coarse and thus very difficult (and painful) to remove with the epilator.</li>
            <li> I did notice that some parts of my legs were less painful than others.</li>
            <li> I got to admit that I was a little scared to use this product as some reviews said it was to painful.</li>
            <li> No - but it fails because body hair is a tough enemy to beat.  </li>
            <li> but after a few minutes, it wasn&#x27;t that bad as i got used to it.</li>
            <li> It also seems less painful than the others my wife has used, but it&#x27;s still uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little terrified of epilators because I always thought they would hurt really badly like other hair removal techniques, but this wasn&#x27;t bad at ALL!</li>
            <li> I think is an expensive one though.</li>
            <li> If you have to do pass, after pass, after pass - well that just prolongs the uncomfortable experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I dropped the epilator while in the shower.</li>
            <li> Sad thing is it doesn&#x27;t even pull the roots out.  </li>
            <li> Well, I was mostly wrong.</li>
            <li> Yes the cooling glove helped but I was troubled by the problems she was having using the Braun.</li>
            <li> Not because I was afraid, but because I was too compulsive and weird about growing stubble out (which is a requirement)</li>
            <li> and I can be hair-free without an expensive and inconvenient trip to a waxing salon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to explain, but it was a diffuse, unyeilding, annoying pain.</li>
            <li> I am still unable to epilate my arms though because I find it to be too painful.</li>
            <li> I bough it anyway, feeling desperate for any possibility of a DIY solution.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m a 6 maybe on a 1-10 (10 being numb all over) scale of ability to self-impose hair-removal pain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If I had the time (and patience), I could take the glove and numb each part of my leg</li>
            <li> so that would usually leave me with an awful rash.  </li>
            <li> Am I doing this wrong?!?</li>
            <li> Even though there&#x27;s some pain involved, it&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds.  </li>
            <li> and they aren&#x27;t too bad.</li>
            <li> On the legs, it feels like toothpicks poking you, so the pain there is not too bad.</li>
            <li> I will say though, that it is not as painful as I was imagining.</li>
            <li> yes it was painful...</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so incredibly painful on the underarms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not as painful as some put it, but this is coming from a waxer.</li>
            <li> Based on the reviews here, I was expecting it to be painful.  </li>
            <li> It was just to painful for me to bear.  </li>
            <li> and now I am totally disappointed with its performance..</li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I found it to be expensive ($300) and the reviews were terrible, so I passed on it.  </li>
            <li> My knee became numb!</li>
            <li> I hate even doing it to get my hair cut.  </li>
            <li> I hate shaving my legs, and I always end up with razor burn.  </li>
            <li> I epilate because I hate stubble</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s annoying if you do.  </li>
            <li> Painful!  </li>
            <li> I epilate the underarm area every 10 days or so, so that, as and when there is hair growth I can remove it and not making it  very painful</li>
            <li> It was very painful,</li>
            <li> I like it but its very painful.</li>
            <li> A friend of my told me about epilators and every review I read said the pain was awful and almost unbearable.</li>
            <li> Ankles were awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My wife tells me it pinches her and she stopped using it after one use..  I honestly think she gave up too soon :)  It seems to be another great product from Braun, it still lives in our family but now my aunt has it and she loves it.  Not much I can say about it :)</li>
            <li> The unit works well at removing all hair that I tried it on, but with heavier hair the sensation left me gasping. It was very tolerable on lighter hair and for that I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying an epilator and i must say..i love it! No regrets with buying this brand, infact i wish i bought this sooner. i only used this on my arms and the pain was irritating the first 5min or so but it goes away and you get used to it. i didnt really use the ice glove, i found there was no need for it. i love this product and i recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun machines since 2001 ,yet Braun 5180 Silk is the best amoung the other models.Its so easy to operate ,fast to save me time and left my skin smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I love this epilator. I just used it for the first time. It didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would, but I have used wax strips before. Yes, of course it hurts a little because you are pulling hairs out by the root. But you get used to it - and it hurts less every time. Shaving leaves your legs very smooth, but only for a few hours and the hairs look so dark when they grow back.&lt;br /&gt;I only used the epilator on my legs and they look great. I can still feel a few little hairs, but  I can&#x27;t see any of them. I will use it again in a few days to get rid of more hair. I am confident that with extended use I will have less and less hair on my legs. I used to wax and it did make my hair grow back finer and it lasted longer than shaving, but it was messy and it was hard to see the back of my legs and I had to wait until my hair was long enough. The epilator makes it so much better - it&#x27;s easy to use and it gets the shorter hair too. I love the light on this Braun - it makes it so easy to see the little hairs. I will never shave or wax again!</li>
            <li> as a relatively hairy girl, i have always shaved and never ventured into the world of much else - like waxing or sugaring. but stubble was really getting to me, so after hearing a friend saying really great things about depilators, i decided to try one out.&lt;br /&gt;first things first - it hurts. i didn&#x27;t really try the ice glove that comes with it, because it just made my legs wet and i had to dry them to be depilated each time. but after a few minutes, it wasn&#x27;t that bad as i got used to it. i had to go over the same areas more than once because, as i already said, i didn&#x27;t luck out with genetics and soft invisible hairs, mine is pretty coarse and thick, especially after years and years of shaving. so if you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ll probably have to spend a bit more time at it than people with softer, thinner hair. it also was rather frustrating having to wait till it grows long enough to be depilated - but it was worth it. the first thing i did was try it out on my thigh hair, that i only shave in the summer - and the results were incredible, even my boyfriend noticed the difference. lower legs i actually depilated today - and whilst i did miss a few little hairs that were just too short to be plucked (i used tweezers on them), the overall result is great. i was told the hair will grow back softer and thinner, so i&#x27;m waiting to see if that&#x27;s true. the only thing that sort of was a bummer is that i ended up with a few ingrowns, but they weren&#x27;t hard to pluck with tweezers. hopefully, that is the only downfall of this product. overall, i definitely would recommend it to anyone. worth a shot!</li>
            <li> I had never used an epilator before.  The Braun Silk-epil 5 works very well at removing hair and the skin is smoother a few days later than with shaving.  There is less irritation than a depilitory cream causes but it does hurt.  In fact, it  hurts worse than tweezing a single hair but only because it is yanking out dozens at a time.  It even hurts worse than waxing.  The ice glove provides only a little relief.  The light comes in handy to see what areas need a second or third pass.  The device is comfortable in the hand, easy to hold and handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides the pain, this device is only effective on the more noticeable hairs as it doesn&#x27;t grab the short ones or very fine ones.  So there are definitely tradeoffs--smoother skin for a longer period of time but having to wait longer before using it again--so it averages out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over time, tweezing supposedly results in finer hair regrowth (so the epilator would become less effective as it doesn&#x27;t work as well on the finer hairs) but that is in theory and in practice, I have never noticed hairs growing back finer after repeated tweezing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving the Braun Silk-epil 5 five stars because it performs quite well doing what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Recently I bought Braun SE 5180 silk epil 5 epilator with ice glove (green). The details of the products braun SE 5270(pink) and SE 5180 were exactly same except the price of pink one was bit higher.I didnt get the shaver or trimmer head with the product. And the price just after 6 days has gone down to 61 from 68$.The efficiency of the epilator is not very good. It is not removing small and fine hairs. I would recommend to go for some other epilators with more tweezers. Make sure waht are the accessories you are getting with the purchase of these two epilators. It has not given anywhere in the page. I was confused and finally ordered green and now I am totally disappointed with its performance..</li>
            <li> A friend of my told me about epilators and every review I read said the pain was awful and almost unbearable. On my legs the pain barely bother me. There were a few spots that smarted a little but not bad. When I moved onto other areas it hurt a little more. Especially where the hairs were longer. When starting out I suggest shaving a few days before you epilate so the hairs are a little shorter. I got and used mine on the 20th of June and now on Aug 2 my legs are still smooth with no hairs. After just one use. I am hooked!     One down side. This model doesnt come with the smaller attachment for the bikini and under are areas. But I still use it in those areas anyway.</li>
            <li> I wanted to buy a not-so-expensive epilator and chose this one based upon the customer reviews and have been using this for more than a year now. I am satisfied with it. This is my first ever epilation experience. I use this for hands, legs and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* This has all the main features or functionality required and serves the purpose.&lt;br /&gt;* A cheap alternative for the expensive parlor hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;* From my experience it does not make the skin darker as with the shaving or other methods&lt;br /&gt;* Not messy like waxing&lt;br /&gt;* The regrowing hair is thinner&lt;br /&gt;* You can be worry free for the next 15 to 20 days after epilation.&lt;br /&gt;* The ice glove is especially useful for the underarm area (without it, it would be even more difficult)&lt;br /&gt;* The smart light is useful to find thin small hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* In the beginning stage of use it is painful, especially in the underarms but with time you get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;* As advertised it doesn&#x27;t keep you hair free for over a month. You can expect a max. of 20 days&lt;br /&gt;* It doesn&#x27;t remove all the hair. When the hair length is proper you can expect a 80% removal. (Though all the hairs are not removed from root they are cut by the blades, so only after 2 or 3 days you see the hair growing back. So immediately after the use you cannot exactly say whether all the hairs were removed from root or just cut at the surface)&lt;br /&gt;* In the underarm area if the skin is not stretched properly, the skin can get stuck into the epilator. (Because of the rotation of the blades. In that case just calm down, switch it off, unplug the device and you can carefully remove it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;* I epilate the underarm area every 10 days or so, so that, as and when there is hair growth I can remove it and not making it  very painful (Don&#x27;t allow the hair to grow more than 3/4 of an inch in underarms, otherwise it might become very painful)&lt;br /&gt;* If you have a higher threshold of pain and to make sureyou have a complete epilation and not just a shave do it slowly.&lt;br /&gt;* Eat some food and then epilate!!</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;ice glove\\&quot; notwithstanding, my wife really likes this epilator. Since she is now nearly 9 months pregnant and I&#x27;ve helped her out with epilating, I can say from personal experience that it does a pretty thorough job. It also seems less painful than the others my wife has used, but it&#x27;s still uncomfortable. The ice glove doesn&#x27;t do anything for my wife&#x27;s pain. It does give her goosebumps which may help the epilator grab the hairs better. She suggests taking a couple of Advil 30 minutes before epilating to reduce the pain.</li>
            <li> It works but for first time use, it&#x27;s painful. I suggest getting a numbing cream. It&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I would like to start by saying that this is NOT my first epilator.  I have been using one for about 10 yrs, so I cannot comment on the pain factor.  My thought on that is it is going hurt for the first few times, no matter what kind you get.  This is my third epilator and nothing beats a corded shaver.  Shaving with this was quick and easy.  I LOVE the light!  This is an AMAZING epilator for the price.</li>
            <li> My four star review isbased on how effectively it removed hair and how easy it was to use. It doesn&#x27;t speak to pain, or speed in comparison to other models because I&#x27;ve never used any. Well, first thing I did right was buy it first and read the reviews second. I was in the store and peeked at the star ratings on my phone which were good. I saved the horror stories for when I got home. My \\&quot;do no self-harm\\&quot; mechanism wouldn&#x27;t allow me to try it first so I got my boyfriend to do my first leg. And it hurt like all get out!!!  It&#x27;s tough to explain, but it was a diffuse, unyeilding, annoying pain. So, in addition to the included ice pack, I got all the packs we already had in the freezer to use on an area before AND after epilation.     It really was very unpleasant. There&#x27;s no way to say otherwise. But I can say certain areas were less unpleasant...like the back of my legs weren&#x27;t as bad. Ankles were awful. I should have prefaced this with saying I have waxed before. My legs once professionally a few years ago, and at home several times with minimal pain. It was a definite sting but over quickly. Eyebrow waxes don&#x27;t bother me at all and regular (non-brazilian) bikini waxes don&#x27;t either except for a few spots. For the past 7 years, I&#x27;ve strictly shaved my legs. But I wanted something different because 1) I have to do it too often. 2) I hate how getting goosebumps ruins a perfectly fresh shave in minutes. &amp; 3) good disposable blade razors are becoming really expensive.     Overall with breaks it took about 90 minutes. I&#x27;d do a 4\\&quot; square and need a break to ice or BREATHE! I had something to do so I only got to one leg, below the calf, the first day.  Three days later when I was up to it we did the second leg. This time, I decided to use some topical cepacol throat numbing spray (active ingredient: benzocaine!) on my legs and boy did it make a difference!! I sprayed it on, rubbed it in and waited about 6-7 minutes. The pain didn&#x27;t go away but it was a lot less intense. More squinting less outright \\&quot;OWWW\\&quot;-ing.  I still used the ice on the front of my legs but I didn&#x27;t need any cooling in the back. It took about 30 min. Not bad at all for the trade off of days of no maintenance.   One thing to consider which has been mentioned is \\&quot;pulling a hair\\&quot; &#x3D; \\&quot;pain\\&quot;, thus \\&quot;more hair\\&quot; &#x3D; \\&quot;more pain\\&quot;. So any touch ups can&#x27;t really hurt but so much. In fact, I had a few strays from the first day and I went at them with no problem. Actually, the vibration from the epilator feels pretty good against the skin. So the random hair doesn&#x27;t hurt really at all...just a quick pluck and done.     Observations: after the fourth day, I had minimal grow back . My legs were smooth through several bouts of goosebumps. I have dark hair, with dark roots, so my legs looked better with the roots gone. The red swelling bumps that appeared as I epilated disappeared in a few hours. Subsequent touch ups were easy, relatively painless and convenient. Holding the device more firmly against the skin was better than holding it lightly. Lightly seemed to produce more tugging, and prevent you from getting the full benefit of the vibrations which help manage the pain.    I didn&#x27;t choose a wet/dry model because one of the things that bothered me the most about shaving was having to get in the shower and stand awkwardly to do it.    This model is hard to clean though. The benzocaine made that worse but I don&#x27;t imagine needing it again.</li>
            <li> I had used an epilator before a very cheap one that was a very painfull experience  When I tiried The Braun Silk-epil 5 I can mention that is almost the same as pain, maybe 10% or 15% less.  It Works very well at removing hair with less irritation than an other method like shaving razors or creams , but it does hurt. It has to, you are pulling out your hair.   The light is a good plus to see the areas you need to pay more atention.  A little noise, more than a regular shaving machine, not so ergonomic design but  you can handle it very well.  No bateries, it comes with an electric cord long enough to have free movement around your body.  I prefered this instead a rechargable one because after 2 or 3 years the baterries will die and will not hold he charge as in the beggining and then you will need to replace them or to buy a new Epilator.  Mine comes with a frezzing gel pad to aply it in your sking before you start with the epilator  to reduce the pain, and believe me IT WORKS it almost freezes yuor skin and you will not feel to much pain</li>
            <li> I have the same model in my country, so I know this epilator. The price is very good and the model is easy to use. The results are perfect. It&#x60;s fast so you only need 15 minutes for your legs.</li>
            <li> So, to begin: I have NEVER epilated.  My experience with tweezing, prior to receiving this, was extremely minimal.  (Read: Tried it once when I was younger, on my eyebrows, bled and never did it again.)  However, this device has pretty much completely changed the way I remove hair.  Before using this, I tried plucking a few hairs on various parts of my body: face, arms, underarms, legs.  I had no pain individually plucking hairs from my arms or legs, and very little pain plucking my face (chin, eyebrows, upperlip) and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have pretty dark body hair in general with some finer, blonde hairs.  There is not a ton, but enough to make me uncomfortable: mostly on my face.  It&#x27;s medium in thickness.  I have two tattoos as well - one on my shin, the other on my ankle - so I guess I have a medium, at best, pain tolerance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had shaved the day I was supposed to receive this product and did not, so I could not epilate on my legs right away.  I did receive it the next day, and used it on my entire arm.  There was virtually no pain above the elbow, some discomfort on the tops of my forearms, and pretty intense pain on the bottoms of my forearms.  Granted, I do not have much hair on the bottom of my forearm, but more than I could see!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While looking over my legs, I noticed a few patches that I had missed shaving - on my shin and thigh - so I decided to test epilating on those areas.  I was actually surprised that there was no pain for me while doing this.  I psyched myself up pretty badly prior to this, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this on my underarms was pretty intense the first time - but I had also let it grow out pretty good first.  I think it will take me a few sessions to get the entire underarm area, but I love the way it feels after it&#x27;s done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this on my face is a HUGE NO-NO!  I absolutely could not tolerate the pain.  I guess I had a little more facial hair than I could actually see, because it did get a lot out.  By the end of it, though, I was in tears.  I did not even get everything, and I ended up just plucking individually... which is what I think I will continue to do.  (Please know that I do understand that this product says it is only for use on legs, but I had to try!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are like me, you are reading reviews relentlessly to determine whether or not this product is for you.  I literally read every single review here, not only for this model but also every other one I could find.  I watched Youtube video, after Youtube video, of people trying epilators for the first time... and man, did it scare me!  I even watched them after I placed my order, and after my order had shipped.  I had half a mind to return it the instant it arrived without even trying it.  Let me tell you, though: I am sincerely glad that I did not.  This product does exactly what it advertises.  Yes, it is pretty painful, but I expected that much; it does seem to get better the more I use it, though.  The Ice Glove, however, they could have done without!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is fed up with shaving or body hair in general!n get everything, and I ended up just plucking individually... which is what I think I will continue to do.

            <li> AWESOME-AWESOME...I love this Braun Epilator. Received in about 2 days. After reading all the reviews I had to try it. Its fabulous. The pain was minimal, watching the little hairs coming out made this almost pain free for me. It has been 2 weeks and I have not had to take my shaver out. Normally I had to shave every other day especially in the summer months. I started out by trying it on the bottom half and moved to the top of my legs the following day. I applied 100% Aloe with tree tea oil after using this and I had absolutley no bumps or red spots! I also found by zigzagging across my leg I caught most on the first try. oh and just so you know this is the first review of any product I have ever done and I buy a lot of things on-line. Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t purchase an epilator earlier! Shaving my underarm has always left a dark shadow and the hairs always grew back within two days, but epilating keeps the hair away longer and doesn&#x27;t leave a dark shadow. Tweezing also took forever so I found that epilating is the best choice. The little light on this particular epilator is really helpful when epilating the legs. With the light, I can easily see where little hairs are. The first time epilating was terrifying and felt like little ants biting me, but once you get over that feeling, this little tool is the best. I don&#x27;t use the ice glove. I just use it as an ice pack for general use now.</li>
            <li> I received this item two days after I ordered it--GREAT!!!!!  In the past I have been to the salon and had my legs waxed and felt like the skin covering my shins had been pulled off right along with the hair!!  Never again will I do that or pay high salon prices!  I have found the answer.  The noise didn&#x27;t bother me like I had read on many reviews.  I was expecting this loud, obnoxious sound but it sounds like any other electronic gadget that you use.  I started with my legs first, and it wasn&#x27;t any more painful than having my legs waxed...in fact there was less pain involved.  Then, I used it on my underarms.  Ok...that is a little more sensitive, but I can deal with that if I&#x27;m going to have hairless underarms.  I may use the ice glove with the underarms next time, but the ice glove wasn&#x27;t needed for the legs.  The little light that is on it is great too.  So, goodbye painful leg waxing, and high salon prices...hello to my new friend Braun SE 5180.  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators since 1986. My first one I got as an xmas present--the original coil style Epilady which was pretty painful. the hair on my legs is pretty fine and sparse now from years of epilating and this braun works great for me. You can really get all of the hairs, and i think the light is a nice feature, too. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator months ago, but couldn&#x27;t review it because I couldn&#x27;t use it.  Not because I was afraid, but because I was too compulsive and weird about growing stubble out (which is a requirement) - I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to not shave.  FINALLY I went 3 days without shaving (*shudder*) so I could use this baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PAIN:&lt;br /&gt;Minimal.  I would describe it as discomfort more than pain.  Less painful than childbirth, more painful than a hangnail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EASE OF USE:&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was cordless, but otherwise it fits neatly in the hand and it&#x27;s similar to shaving.  The noise is minimal, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS:&lt;br /&gt;The first few times I used it, I used the soft setting.  Many hairs were pulled from the root, but a good amount were broken off, so my results were good but not great; my legs were smooth in some places but not others.  Also my hair started growing back in less time than advertised (more like a week).  After a few times, I got the hang of it and now use the fast setting.  Between using that setting, my own growing expertise, and the fact that fewer hairs grow back every time, I now have totally smooth legs for about 2 weeks after every use.  YAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXTRAS:&lt;br /&gt;The light: Very helpful for seeing where you missed.&lt;br /&gt;The ice glove: I see no difference with it.&lt;br /&gt;The comfort head: Helps when you&#x27;re new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:  Easy and not too painful to use; your results will improve every time.  And I no longer am a slave to shaving daily!</li>
            <li> I am a new customer for this product line.  I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase but I have no prior experience with other brands or models to compare the product to.  I do think it beats waxing and tweezing.</li>
            <li> hmmm I suppose this was worth a try, but you must have to use it frequently at first to get rid of all your hair.  I never got that far and I have had this product for about 4 months now.  Not my piece of cake.  I will say though, that it is not as painful as I was imagining.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator one year ago and suddenly yesterday I had a big surprise - it was just not working ... Have no idea why it&#x27;s not working, what to do with it, if it can be repaired and where to repair it ...</li>
            <li> Smooth and Clean is how I can best describe this one. Far faster and more efficient that anything I have tried as well. Cooling pad is great, There will always be a little pain in doing this so im not gonna say anything about that but I do suggest this product to anyone who epilates (is that even a word?) The handy light and massage function are an added bonus as well. This one also has 2 speed where alot that I have tried only had 1 so it would help on the slower setting for those who have a higher threshold for pain. Anyways, Try this one if all the other ones have let you down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little terrified of epilators because I always thought they would hurt really badly like other hair removal techniques, but this wasn&#x27;t bad at ALL! It stung just a tiny bit here and there but the way my legs looked afterward was WAY worth the small amount of discomfort that I did have. The packaging is smart and portable and the price is reasonable for the years of use and sexiness that will result! I am converted!!!</li>
            <li> As someone else noted OUCH!- I am a newbie to epilators and am not thinking about converting anytime soon.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you are already happily an epilator user this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a nice compact size that fits in your hand comfortably.  It had a great angle to run it along your legs comfortably as well.&lt;br /&gt;I did not enjoy the feel of having the hair removed in this manner, I did not even feel like it did a decent job quicklyenough to make it worth the discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about three months now and wish I had got one years ago. I am fortunate in that I only have to remove hair from the front lower half of my legs...I think because that is all I have ever done (shaving). It pinches a little but I would not say it hurts, less painful than waxing and definitely cheaper and more convenient. I find the headlight to be very useful helping to make sure you don&#x27;t miss anything. I don&#x27;t use the Ice Glove, I just don&#x27;t find it necessary. A great product!</li>
            <li> Nothing special, it does its job but you have to pass it through the same areas over and over to take all the hair.</li>
            <li> not as good as expected,the light is pretty much useless,the epilator itself feels like it pinches you all yhe time,hurts more than my old one</li>
            <li> I got to admit that I was a little scared to use this product as some reviews said it was to painful. Even though there&#x27;s some pain involved, it&#x27;s not as bad as it sounds.  This was a really good purchase. To my standards, epilating has taken longer than shaving, but I get better results, my skin feels softer and it takes longer for the hair to grow back (3 weeks in my case). If I compare it to waxing, it takes less time and it&#x27;s easier (since there are some parts that are really hard to get when you&#x27;re waxing), also waxing is messier. The results are pretty much the same, it hurts a little bit more in some parts though. The product itself works great, the smart light  is very useful. I had a little trouble doing my armpit, which also was the part that hurt the most, but the ice glove helped a little with the pain. I think  that, over all, this purchase was totally worth it</li>
            <li> Worth it! - Money wise it is simple. This device will save on years and years of razor purchases!    Worth it! - Beauty wise you will not be disappointed! No more 5 o&#x27;clock shadow! No more razor stubble! And after a while, your hairs hardly grow back at all, and when they do, they are much thinner and hardly noticeable.    Worth it! - Time wise. No more daily shaving!!!!!! After a while, you can even go over a week without using it.    Worth it! - After the first few sessions, there really is no pain. It feels like a massage.    This is my 2nd epilator. My first was a Phillips Satinelle which, apparently, is no longer in production. I used that one for at least 2 decades. I bought this one with some trepidation because it looked a bit different. Well, it is even more comfortable to use than my old one. In fact, I kind of miss that feeling of having had a nice deep massage after using my last one.     Buy it, take your time with your first few uses, and you too will say \\&quot;Worth It!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken me a long time to post a review for this product because I can&#x27;t bring myself to use it frequently enough to get the desired results.  I can say that the product does remove hair effectively.  I didn&#x27;t find that the iced glove made much difference in my pain tolerance.  I followed other posters advice and took Motrin about a half hour before I began the procedure.  The pain is by no means unbearable, but it is bad enough that I just find myself returning to shaving.  I think that you have to be willing to invest enough time in this product to get to a point where the procedure becomes less uncomfortable.  I have blond hair, but lots of it -- and it is thick and coarse.  I wonder if this would be easier if I had finer hair -- or less of it.  As far as quality goes, this epilator feels very sturdy and appears well made.  It isn&#x27;t too large and can be stored easily in the bathroom.  It is also comfortable to hold in your hand.  If you have the determination -- give this system a go!</li>
            <li> Personally, I like it because is small ad lightweight plus the light help u a lot. I think is an expensive one though.</li>
            <li> EDIT: I decided to just take off the head that comes with it and run the actual tweezer against my skin. Yep, it&#x27;s more \\&quot;barbaric\\&quot; and you feel a lot more but it also grabs a lot more hair this way and saves time.   In my opinion, this is more painful than waxing (though waxing doesn&#x27;t bother me, and I don&#x27;t think epilating is that big of a deal either...however, for comparison&#x27;s sake, it is definitely more intense). I think the fact that you have to go over parts is what makes it more noticeable. It does get better as you use it (by the end I got used to it and it didn&#x27;t hurt) and certain body parts are more sensitive than others (thighs as opposed to lower half of leg). For pain management I recommend taking ibuprofen 30 mins prior (I used to do this when I first started waxing and it helps). I also recommend doing this in the evening as you can get red bumps or sensitive skin afterward (I do and it passes by the morning). I don&#x27;t use the ice or any creams before or after, so I have no idea if they help with anything. It doesn&#x27;t hurt enough for me to waste time on icing.   It&#x27;s easy to hold. With this model, you do have to have it charged at all time, but if you don&#x27;t like that aspect, just pick a different model. It&#x27;s fairly noisy, though as expected. You can epilate whenever, without having to wait for every single hair to grow back out (as in waxing). It&#x27;s easy to use. I didn&#x27;t read the manual, but it seems to be pretty intuitive - just make sure you go against the direction of hair growth (which sometimes means going in several directions on a certain body part, like the medial calf).  Pulling your skin tight and going slowly helps. I use the high speed as the other one seems pointless to me and the discomfort level is the same.   What I don&#x27;t like about this product (though maybe all epilators do this - I don&#x27;t know as it&#x27;s my first) is that my legs aren&#x27;t nearly as smooth as they would be post shave or wax. Though if you&#x27;re comparing this to shaving, from the 2nd day on, epilating wins hands down. Also, while this does tweeze away a lot of hair, it also breaks off a good amount at the surface and doesn&#x27;t remove shorter hairs. I definitely have to go over parts a lot. For this reason I&#x27;m keeping the use of it to my legs (which is what I basically got it for). For me it&#x27;s about 2 weeks before hair starts growing back and about 3 weeks before I actually epilate it again (since it does grow in much thinner, it&#x27;s not nearly as noticeable as it was when I was shaving).   So now I&#x27;m gonna go into some detail of what I like/dislike using it for, not for the sake of TMI, but in case you want more input on what other women use it on and why. It was very helpful for me to read that information in other reviews....but if you don&#x27;t want to hear about it, skip the rest. I get my bikini+ area waxed and will continue with that because the concept of taking this thing to my genitals would make even me a masochist. I wax my own underarms and will continue doing that because I think epilating the area will take longer and leave more stubble, whereas using a waxing strip is fast and leaves the area perfectly smooth. Also the hair grows back much more slowly and is much thinner. I epilated a part of my arms where I didn&#x27;t want hair and most of it didn&#x27;t grow back, so I&#x27;m happy. As for my legs...I&#x27;m not sure. I would prefer to get them waxed because you get perfectly smooth legs for several weeks. But having it done is expensive and doing it yourself (for me) takes a *ridiculous* amount of time and makes me have to get creative with position in hopes of not missing a spot, to the point where by the end I&#x27;m exhausted and breaking out a bottle of wine. It doesn&#x27;t hurt, but the time isn&#x27;t reasonable. Epilating is much faster (though still pretty time consuming - I would say an hour for both legs with an epilator versus 2-4 for waxing (I think it gets better as one gets more experienced; I&#x27;ve only done it myself twice)).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the older model of this epilator for almost exactly a year of writing this new review.  The [[ASIN:B000EZYKTS Braun 5270 X&#x27;elle Body System Epilator]] was an replacement after my older Emjoi (which isn&#x27;t even listed on Amazon anymore) started showing its age after a couple years of solid performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thicker hairs and the older 5270 model took a few passes in order to grab-and-yank the hairs properly.  I&#x27;m assuming everyone knows that epilators hurt (other than completely anesthetizing your shaving area, there&#x27;s no real way to avoid this - you are just yanking hairs out by the root after all) - the better epilators \\&quot;minimize\\&quot; the pain by doing it as quickly as possible. In other words, one-pass, get it all, don&#x27;t do it again for a week or so. If you have to do pass, after pass, after pass - well that just prolongs the uncomfortable experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, the 5180 seems to do a better job than even my old 5270.  I could not find any data about RPMs on Braun&#x27;s site, but for some reason it just feels like the 5180 revolves more often than the old 5270.  This could just be in my mind or it could be that my old 5270 is just slowing down, so please take this observation with a grain of salt (and yes, both are on the \\&quot;high\\&quot; setting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these models are pretty \\&quot;rough\\&quot; - even on the slow setting they yank out hairs pretty violently. On more sensitive areas I usually get irritation bumps even if I ice or take other precautions. On my underarms it often felt like I had a mild sunburn after using (for about a day or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I still like this epilator.  For people with thick hairs like myself you have to take the ups and downs of these types of hair removal systems.  Sometimes just finding a product that can actually remove your hair is all you&#x27;re looking for.  The Braun 5180 does that job very well.</li>
            <li> I had the previous incarnation of this item and loved it but noticed it was losing its strength after a number of years but still doing well so i didnt feel an urgency to replace it but I must say this model is wonderful! : very efficient,  quick, even removing the fine \\&quot;downy\\&quot; fuzz around the knees. As for the pain factor I never have to use the ice thingy and find  the pain perfectly tolerable and hardly get any irritation: I highly recommend this unit, it&#x27;s  great.</li>
            <li> I must admit I was reluctant to purchase my first epilator, but after managing to slice open a nice little gash in my leg while shaving, I decided to take the plunge.  I arrived home at noon today with my Braun Silk Epilator and sat down with lunch to give the instructions a once-over.  Attaching the beginner&#x27;s cap, I readied myself in the bathroom , set the speed on low, and touched the buzzing head to my leg and...not bad.  The discomfort was quite mild in most places and only moderate on my shins.  I switched out for the efficiency cap and turned the speed up and found that I actually experienced less discomfort.  The irritation I did feel was outweighed by the site of the stubborn little hairs flying in all directions, illuminated for your entertainment, in the light built in to the device.  I then proceeded to do my arms and underarms.  Yes, the underarm area is more sensitive, but you get the added satisfaction of little pink-pink-pink noises as those nasty little pricklies go flying.  It is now just 1:00, and I&#x27;m all done save vacuuming up the bristly massacre on the bathroom floor.  There is very little redness, and no visible hairs remain on my lower legs.  Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase.  My only complaint is that it is less efficient with finer hair i.e. upper arms and legs, where I made several passes and the skin is still not 100% hair-free.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this, it was my first time using an epilator, ever. It was very painful, even though I have piercings/tattoos it was a new sensation that I was NOT used to. However, literally the second time I used it (a few weeks later) it was much much less painful, and now it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it&#x27;s simply just going through the motions. When using it on my underarms at first, I screamed, but now it is more than bearable and as someone of color who has dark hair, it removes the spots on your underarms and legs so it improves the overall look of your skin drastically. After 4 uses, my hair is much thinner and barely noticeable. Very happy!</li>
            <li> This epilator may not take the pain out of epilating, because after all, ripping hair out by the roots can never be painless. But for those who hate the itching and stubble the day after shaving, especially in the bikini area, it is worth every ouchie. It does work, and it gets the smallest follicle possible. It also works well on legs and underarms. Regular use does make it less and less painful, until eventually it is merely maintenance. Another bonus is that I do not get epilator burn when I use it on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well at all. It suggests shaving your legs with a regular razor before using this. Huh! I&#x27;m going to request a return. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to be in my best friend&#x27;s wedding and I am horrible at shaving my legs and really sick of it (only been doing it for 15 or so years, but I kept thinking there&#x27;s gotta be a better way!).  The impending wedding got me searching around and I discovered the epilator!  I&#x27;ve tried the creams and I have rather sensitive skin so that would usually leave me with an awful rash.  I tried wax at home and that didn&#x27;t really do anything for me (probably the wrong stuff).  I am terrified to step into a salon for hair removal.  I hate even doing it to get my hair cut.  I&#x27;m not particularly girly.  I DO care about looking nice for people I care about, but not regularly just for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Braun SE 5180 in March and I was so nervous to try this thing it took me a month to muster up the courage.  My leg hair was getting scary long (.5\\&quot; eww gross so embarrassed to admit that!) by the time I tried it.  I contemplated shaving first, but I was afraid if I took the time to do that I&#x27;d loose the nerve to try the epilator.  I showered first without soap or anything just to get my skin warm so my pores would be relaxed.  I didn&#x27;t use the ice pack because it seemed counter-intuitive.  Why would I want to chill my pores right before yanking hairs out?  That didn&#x27;t make sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions and saw that it said optimal was the best setting (hence the name, I suppose).  I set it to optimal and got used to the noise (about as noisy as my husband&#x27;s mustache trimmer) and went for it starting around at my lower shin.  I kept doing it in short bursts to get used to it (because I really was terrified after reading all the reviewers talk about pain) and it didn&#x27;t hurt.  I got braver and did it in longer slower swaths and it still didn&#x27;t hurt.  I mean it didn&#x27;t feel good or something, but it was not excruciating or unbearable.  It felt like little pokes all over my skin.  Once I got over the feeling I proceeded to do all over my legs.  I got a little nervous when I realized how red/splotchy they turned, but it did eventually go away.  The instructions did mention if you&#x27;re a first timer it&#x27;s good to do right before you go to bed because of the possibility of redness.  I wasn&#x27;t worried about it as I would be home for the rest of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I researched epilating I remembered reading ingrown hairs can be an issue, so when I was done, I got back in the shower with my new favorite exfoliating wash [[ASIN:B004D2DQSY Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Pore Scrub]] and used it on my legs.  I got out of the shower patted them dry and covered them in [[ASIN:B000YHAGK8 Tropical Traditions Organic Virgin Coconut Oil Moisturizing Cream - Unscented]] and by this time the redness was nearly gone.  Once the lotion dried, my husband and I were both impressed with how soft and smooth my legs felt.  It&#x27;s not quite as smooth as a careful close shave, but it felt great for my first try!&lt;br /&gt;I will repeat that I am happily surprised that it didn&#x27;t hurt much at all.  I mean I expected a lot of pain and I must say it&#x27;s a lot more like a moderate discomfort.  That&#x27;s not to say it won&#x27;t hurt you.  I&#x27;m relating my experience as it is all I can speak to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am curious how long this will last compared to shaving.  Time will tell!  I am very happy I chose epilation and happy with the lightweight Braun SE 5180.  I chose this model because it wasn&#x27;t battery operated (I don&#x27;t really care much about portability and batteries create their own challenges), wasn&#x27;t pink, and had the light built in!  The light was VERY handy even in my well-lit bathroom.  Since this is my first epilator I can&#x27;t compare it with others, but I am very happy with my choice!!got a little nervous when I realized how red/splotchy they turned, but it did eventually go away.

            <li> It&#x27;s fast and remove hair in short time, i recommend it for legs, there is a pain though but not that much.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I hate shaving my legs, and I always end up with razor burn.  Or I get goosebumps and negate the whole thing...  I am smooth and happy!  Yea it stings a little bit but it only gets better!  Thank you Braun!!!!</li>
            <li> There is no doubt that the first time you use this epilator it is painful.  That first time? It took me 3 days to do both of my legs.  I wasn&#x27;t thrilled to try it again, but I felt I needed to use it more than once before I could give my opinion. About a week and half later I worked up the nerve to use this again. This time I was surprised how much less painful it was to use. Dare I say it was tolerable? Another week passes and I use it again and this time the pain is no more than what I feel when I pluck my eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I can&#x27;t imagine going back to shaving.  The one con, other than the initial ouch, is ingrown hairs. Other than that I love it!</li>
            <li> I like it but its very painful.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and like it much better than shaving.  I do not have a lot of leg hair but don&#x27;t like the bumps I get from razor and do not like the expense of going to have them waxed.  I have used this about once a week for the past three weeks and I am pleased.  It isn&#x27;t painfree, but very tolerable.  Even better that the hairs come in slower and not as rough as the razor.  I didn&#x27;t use the ice glove so can&#x27;t comment on that feature.  If you shop around, you can find it a bit cheaper, but I prefer the convenience of shopping with Amazon.</li>
            <li> My husband finally bought this as a mother&#x27;s day gift and I simply love it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Braun silk epil before(11years back) and had switched to waxing/shaving and it feels great to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that the new Silk epil has the inbuilt light,so I don&#x27;t have to strain my eyes and back to see if it took out all the hair. I like the massaging rollers too..they really minimise the pain. It is a bit noisy, but it actually diverts my attention from the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I am not new to epilation ...it did not hurt as much I thought it would as I was using it after a gap of 11 years.&lt;br /&gt;I love what waxing does for the legs, but it is messy and in humid weather its not very effective either. Epilation removes the hair and keeps legs hair free as long as waxing does and it is not messy, nor does the weather effect the efficiency of hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;The con of epilation vs waxing it that epilation makes ur skin dry and dull since it doesn&#x27;t remove the dead skin cells where as waxing removes then hence legs look and feel good.&lt;br /&gt;I also have experienced ingrowth with epilation , but even waxing did that to my hair.. so i guess my skin is like that. I realised that shaving now and then reduced the ingrowth for me..but now when I read the reviews for this product before placing the order, someone has given great tips on preventing in growth: exfoliating.. so I am going to try that and see if that helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the epilator once till now and since I had started shaving my legs the hair had gotten coarse so now when the hair are trying to come out it feels itchy. I guess with repeated use it would change.&lt;br /&gt; I also want to say that the ice glove is nice idea but the same thing can be achieved at home.. I crank up the AC and use my ice pack.. so I feel that its not an added value, I would have rather opted for the shaver head instead of ice glove if there was an option.&lt;br /&gt; So far two thumbs up!! Thanks Hubby dear.&lt;br /&gt; 4 star coz i have used it just once... will update with timear coz i have used it just once... will update with time</li>
            <li> It works great as an epilator but the hair is hard to clean from the blades.&lt;br /&gt;The light is only an okay feature, doesn&#x27;t help very much.</li>
            <li> I will recommend it to my friends. I also bought one for my sister and she like it too. I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Braun epilators since I bought one in 2004. the only reason i bought this because my old one is 220 V and I live in a 110 V area and it&#x27;s just a hassle using an adapter to change the voltage and another to change the shape of the plug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in a timely fashion and exactly as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will feel pain the first few times you use it but after that it all gets better and you&#x27;ll barely feel it. Definitely worth buying. You wouldn&#x27;t have to use it again for a couple of weeks and if you do it&#x27;ll be for sparse hair that got missed the first time perhaps because they weren&#x27;t even out yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product strongly, it&#x27;s awesome, and useful and you can take it anywhere on trips (as long as you follow voltage instructions). Great investment.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my wife as a Christmas present last year and she loves it.  She uses it frequently and it works very well for her.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product.  She said it does tend to pull the occasional hair a bit painfully, but this is way better than shaving.</li>
            <li> Works fast, doesn&#x27;t do the damage some cheaper ones do. Two speeds are nice for different purposes and pain tolerances. Just remember, just like an electric razor, if you go over and over an area, it will irritate.</li>
            <li> I have an old (at least 10 years old) Braun Silk Epil epilator. Would have continued using it, if the voltage/current parameters would have fit the US as well. So, I had to buy another one, but thought to go for the same brand, since the old one served well. I am absolutely satisfied with this one. It works fast and pulls the the leg hairs out by the root. Really, no complains concerning efficiency. It takes a bit long to clean it properly though. Apart from that, I absolutely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been epilating for years.  I started with an older model Braun 27 tweezer head and used it until it wore out.  I thought I would upgrade to the Emjoi Emagine (AP-18) and have been using that for maybe a year until I finally grew completely frustrated with it.  It left so many stray hairs and just would not pick up them up, even after going over and over the area dozens of times until I gave up and just shaved the strays.  I also didn&#x27;t feel that my skin was very smooth after using it.  I finally decided to face that I had wasted my money and try another Braun, figuring this one would be even better than my original with the upgraded 40 tweezer heads and the addition of the light.  I was not expecting my Braun to arrive in the mail for another couple days so I went ahead and epilated with my Emjoi for about 30 mins with the normal unsatisfactory results (lots of stray hairs left behind).  Soon after I was surprised to find the Braun had been delivered so of course I plugged it in and gave it a try.  It picked up those stray hairs immediately and also picked up tiny-barely-there hairs that the Emjoi could not pick up.  My legs felt so smooth afterwards.  There simply is no comparison, Braun makes a better epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you new to epilating, it will hurt at first, but trust me, before long you will barely feel it.  Remember that the first time you use it you are pulling out ALL your hairs at once and the &amp;#34;bulbs&amp;#34; at the end of the hair are big and hurt coming out of your skin (especially the underarms, take Ibuprofen 15-30 mins. before).  If you epilate on a regular basis your hair regrowth will be sparser due to the different growth cycles so you are not pulling out as many hairs all at once.  Also, the hair is weaker and pulls out of your skin easier.  Just keep at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do shave along with epilating for the smoothest legs possible.  The reason I epilate is NOT so that I don&#x27;t have to shave anymore.  I epilate because I hate stubble and also I have very pale skin and dark hair so epilating makes my legs look so much better because you can&#x27;t see those tiny pindots of black hairs that shaving leaves behind.  My legs are still super smooth at the end of the night and the next morning when I wake up.  Also, shaving is very quick now because there really isn&#x27;t much there to shave, just a quick once over to smooth out my skin completely until I&#x27;m ready to epilate again.  I save a lot of money on razor cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - get a Braun and I highly recommend one with a light, it really helps a lot.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference between this and their previous models in terms of pain reduction, but it&#x27;s definitely more precise and picks up hair very well. No leftovers. What I don&#x27;t like is that they don&#x27;t have a smaller cup like they did in the previous model... It was very convenient for the small places. But overall this thing is good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epiladies for years starting with Emjoi &amp; my current one besides this is a few years old model Braun. Yes, it hurts, depending on the person, much less or much more, but it is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending, some models want you to go slower with a lighter touch to really pull out the hairs &amp; not just cut them as is the case for me. This model has half plastic/half metal tweezers, where older models were all metal &amp; I think worked a bit better to grab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike others, I find the spotlight helpful for finding lighter colored hairs I might have missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The massaging roller head really helps, it did me when I was new at it, but sometimes felt it got in the way of grabbing shorter hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ice glove can be helpful if you want to spend the time to use it so your hand doens&#x27;t freeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush for cleaning hairs &amp; the simple, drawsting pouch for holding spilator, attachments &amp; cord is always a great, needed addition.</li>
            <li> Hurts like hell and caused many ingrown hairs that lasted for months after I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I have had a different color of this epilator for 3 years and i used it on my arms. Then the head got worn out and instead of paying $30 for a new head I just bought a new epilator instead. I love this model although now i prefer the cordless models just for the convenience purposes. A few weeks ago for the very first time I used it on my legs because I was sick and tired of shaving my dark, thick and super fast growing hair every day..I let the hair grow for a week and then....yes it took me two hours....yes it was painful...I kept twitching...no i did not use the ice glove, I took a warm shower so my pores are open and epilated my legs right after the shower. Honestly though it&#x27;s not a type of pain you cannot tolerate...it hurts more in sensitive areas like calves and close to ankles but you get used to it after some time, your skin kind of numbs itself. I have not touched my legs for two weeks! This is heaven! Although a few hair and some fuzzy ones have grown out  in past two days you only feel it when you touch the leg. The hair is not visible and it&#x27;s softer. I love it! I will never put a razor on my legs ever again! I tried epilating 2-3 times before but I chickened out. I am so glad I went through with it this time :) Trust me ladies, pain is gain! This is a GREAT unit and I am gonna try out another model of this same brand since it seems to be the best on the market</li>
            <li> Being my first epilator, I think it works pretty well. It does take a while and hurts at first but after the first use the pain isn&#x27;t so bad. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> After reading numerous reviews I decided to buy the Braun SE 5180 Epil 5. Until I received it yesterday, I had never used an epilator. I have also never waxed before, only shaved. This epilator removed all the hair except very fine, very blonde hairs. Afterwards, my legs and underarms were left amazingly smooth. I must admit, based on the accounts of severe pain I fully braced myself for what I was sure would be excruciating pain. However, that never happened. Granted, I have a high tolerance of pain, but I didn&#x27;t feel anything except slight pulls. It didn&#x27;t hurt AT ALL. As I mentioned before, I have a high tolerance for pain so my experience could be totally different from your own. I look forward to not shaving twice a week! I highly recommend this product! Happy, hairless days, lovelies!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now. On my arm pits, I have to use it at least twice a week to keep the new growth from coming back. On my arms and legs, where I have more tolerance for stubble, I use a couple times a month.&lt;br /&gt;For those of you with ingrown hair problems- I guarantee if you pulled the hairs out in the direction in which they grow, you&#x27;d have no problem.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m, a busy working single mom of 2 and this machine saves me loads of time getting ready in the mornings. It&#x27;s a lifesaver!&lt;br /&gt;I wish the cord was longer so I could stand over the tub or there was a hair collection feature so I wouldn&#x27;t have to clean my hairs from all over the bathroom when I&#x27;m done. It seriously leaves hair everywhere.</li>
            <li> I bought this epilator with a lot of reservation...cost, will it really work, how painful, etc.  I&#x27;m totally happy with it.  The cost is worth the fact that I only shave once, maybe twice a month.  The pain is mimimal to none on my legs, more so in the bikini line and armpits.  Nonetheless, it&#x27;s worth it for me because I despise having to shave. If and when this one wears out, I will be buying another one...I wish I found out about it years ago.</li>
            <li> Love Braun epilators and have been using them for 15 plus years.&lt;br /&gt;In the last five years I bought three:&lt;br /&gt;1. Braun 7280 - okay; would not recommend; liked the shave/trim head (bikini). Unfortunately I dropped the epilator while in the shower. As a result the shave/trim head stopped working. Epilator was fine though. Still working.&lt;br /&gt;2. Braun 5180 green - Love it!&lt;br /&gt;3. Braun 5280 pink - same as 5180 but in pink. Hahahhaa. Bought it because it came with a shave/trim head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here what I like about the 5180/5280 models:&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Leaves no hair behind;&lt;br /&gt;Pulls even the minuscule hairs;&lt;br /&gt;No ingrown hair;&lt;br /&gt;Hair grows thinner and less visible;&lt;br /&gt;Hair grows slower;&lt;br /&gt;Hair grows softer;&lt;br /&gt;Can go 2-3 weeks before I need to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- time-consuming! It takes a whole hour to clean my legs. Wish Braun comes up with a new model featuring more tweezers and higher speed!! The so called NEW models differ from the older ones only  by color and body shape.&lt;br /&gt;This is why I gave four stars!</li>
            <li> The pros:&lt;br /&gt;- power is great&lt;br /&gt;- they have 2 caps that you can use, one to \\&quot;massage\\&quot; your skin and one that doesnt&lt;br /&gt;- very little hair actually falls out of the epilator - this may because my hair is fine and also because i cleaned it out every 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;- the tiny brush for cleaning works very well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s not cordless!&lt;br /&gt;- the \\&quot;ice glove\\&quot; is kind of pointless&lt;br /&gt;- it doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs at once. this is my first time using an epilator so i&#x27;m not sure if that is standard&lt;br /&gt;- the tiny brush is TINY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall as a first time user of an epilator, and trying to decide between multiple options, I chose this one because of the good reviews. I especially like it for my under arm hairs - granted I normally tweeze each and every hair so it was not as painful as it could have been. It is so much smoother than tweezing every hair for some reason. I don&#x27;t have a high tolerance for pain, but after you run it through your hair once quickly, and don&#x27;t focus on the pain, it&#x27;s a breeze after that. I decided to shave my legs thereafter and it&#x27;s the same - the initial pain can be surprising, but if you go through it quickly, it&#x27;s easily forgettable. I also did not follow the instructions to shave a couple days beforehand. My leg hairs (although thin) were long, and I got all of them after a few runs. I don&#x27;t necessarily recommend this for a \\&quot;brazilian\\&quot;. Although it will leave your hair much smoother and thinner down there, the pain may not be worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading that the majority of reviews were good.&lt;br /&gt;However, I followed all directions on how to have the best epilating experience and this epilator, the first one I&#x27;ve ever tried after shaving for years, did not give me the hairless and smooth legs promised. The first experience was a very tolerable pain on my legs but it&#x27;s so incredibly painful on the underarms. I had to run the epilator very slowly up my legs SEVERAL times over one pass just to clear it up and while the smart light was quite helpful, t hair seemed to break off in most places and only a few were actually pulled out. The ice glove does nothing at all, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use my epilator anyway and hopefully practice will make this work more effectively.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the noise it makes is monstrous. I&#x27;d advise you to use it when no one else is at home.</li>
            <li> This is my second Braun; the first one died by using 6-7 years. I liked this one because it has 40 tweezers and you can really see the difference; it is fast. It pulls the hair (relatively) painless. The only annoying thing is the light which is too bright that you cannot see clearly. I wish there was an option to turn it on and off. Other than that, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I don&#x27;t know how I lived without it for so long. The first time was quite painful and the cooling glove helped. I haven&#x27;t had to use the glove since then. My hair grows back sparser and finer, which is a huge plus. It&#x27;s also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have been comtemplating purchasing this for a while...Ulta&#x27;s had them out of stock for a while and I for it here for a steal! Anyhow, I am wierdly obsessed with being hairless and have recently been waxing. I find that wax is effictive but messy and of course hurts. I was thrilled to see that the epilator pulls out like tweezers (I would puck each hair on my body if I had time LOL). Why am I just now finding out about this?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not as painful as some put it, but this is coming from a waxer. It huts most on stomach and bikini area and I find that the device is big for the bikini line. It works well, I love the light. I have not even used the ice glove! Great investment for hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line...it is not pleasant but it gives the results I want so I go with it.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another Braun epilator that I used for many years. It&#x27;s a great shaver, and I didn&#x27;t find it painful (maybe because I&#x27;ve already been using one). If it lasts as long as my first one, I&#x27;ll be delighted.</li>
            <li> I ordered this epilator a few months back and I have to say that I mixed feelings towards it. Bear in mind that I have never owned another epilator and I have only waxed twice before. I had read other reviews where people stated that the armpit was the most painful spot to epilate. I found that to be the complete opposite for me. The armpit was relatively easy with very little pain. I did have to go over it a few times to get all the hairs, which caused some slight bumping. After doing my armpits I tried it on my legs. I had ordered some numbing creme with my epilator expecting it to dull the pain. I found out quickly that is not the case. Epilating my legs for the first time proved very painful. I had to pause about half way through to reapply the numbing creme and wait for another 30 minutes or so for it to penetrate. While I was waiting I decided to try my arms and that was even more painful than my legs. It has been a few months since  and I am able to epilate my legs with minimal pain. I am still unable to epilate my arms though because I find it to be too painful. Im sure there are others who could easily stand the pain and I cheer them on. As far as hair removal goes I cannot say that this epilates all my hairs. My legs are nowhere near as smooth as they were when I shave. It does take some time for the hair to grow back ( a week at the most) and the hair also grows back slower. I too have had problems with ingrown hairs but its just a few and they aren&#x27;t too bad. I don&#x27;t get bumps from them just hairs under the skin. Overall I am pleased with it when I use it on my armpits and lower leg but I do wish I was able to epilate my thighs and arms and not experience extreme pain.</li>
            <li> I did not know my old epilator was so inefficient until I used this newer model.  I am very pleased as it has been 3 weeks since I last used it and my legs still look (and feel) great!</li>
            <li> This epilator is a great option for anyone who doesn&#x27;t feel like shaving every day and can&#x27;t afford laser hair removal. It is reasonably priced and works great. The treated area stays smooth for at least 2 weeks. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Yes, you have to get used to the pain.. how could ripping hair out not hurt?</li>
            <li> I used to have another braun epilator which it was amazing. After about 10 years, I needed to change it so I decided to get this one. It&#x27;s okay. But I think it&#x27;s really slow! It takes for ever to finish with a leg. My underarm is another story. I spend at least 15 minute trying to get it done and then I have to use a tweezer. Now I&#x27;m browsing for a new one.</li>
            <li> been using it regularly and it is very convenient to plug and use. the light helps focus and the tweezers work well.</li>
            <li> Some men like Tom Selleck and Burt Reynolds are hairy in an attractive, masculine way.  I had the hair but not the luck.  My chest and abdomen had thin, splotchy patches of hair.  I spent years waxing my chest and shoulders but I didn&#x27;t wax my abdomen because the the pain, time and cost were prohibitive.  I heard about a (new?) Remington home laser product and I decided to research it as a DIY option.  I found it to be expensive ($300) and the reviews were terrible, so I passed on it.  However, in the process of doing my research about it, I learned for the first time ever about epilation.  I never knew about epilators before.  When I found this Braun product, I was interested but skeptical.  First, I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years, and they are fantastic.  But if a $300 product was getting terrible reviews, what could a $60 product really do?  I bough it anyway, feeling desperate for any possibility of a DIY solution.  Today I &amp;#34;played&amp;#34; with it for the first time.  I just glanced at the instructions, then plugged it, turned it on and pressed it against my skin in slow strokes, and in different directions (up and down, and side to side).  I was not taking it seriously at all, until I started to see hair accumulating in the dry bath tub in which I was standing.  10 or 15 minutes later, I swear my stomach was as smooth as a baby&#x27;s belly.  Seriously.  The pain was MUCH less than I expected, too.  It hurt less than waxing, and to me, except for a few very hairy spots, there was not real &amp;#34;pain&amp;#34; at all, just mild discomfort.  I will admit that I have what my doctor calls a &amp;#34;high pain threshold,&amp;#34; so maybe I&#x27;m not typical, but I could use this all day long and never give it a second thought.  I am incredibly impressed.  I&#x27;ve never reviewed anything before on Amazon or anywhere else, though I shop on Amazon all the time (not because I think Amazon is so great, just because I hate to shop in stores).  A final note:  the best part about this is that I know now that even if I make last minute plans to go the beach or something, all I need is about 10-15 minutes and I can be hair-free without an expensive and inconvenient trip to a waxing salon.  Bravo Braun!  Of course I&#x27;ve never used any other epilator so I can&#x27;t compare this model to any others, but for me, this one is an A+.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this epilator for a year already, still working great.My favorite part is the light so u can do ur legs even if it is dark in the room. also my hair r not that hard any more. thank you, seller</li>
            <li> How does this not hurt?!?  Am I doing this wrong?!? I have tried this a few times now &amp; each time it feels as though I am ripping each hair out one by one.  Sad thing is it doesn&#x27;t even pull the roots out.  Not as smooth as shaving or waxing.  I think I&#x27;m done with this.  I&#x27;ll take shaving any day.</li>
            <li> I purchased my wife the Emjoi Emagine [[ASIN:B001GS6OB4 Emjoi AP-18 Emagine Dual Opposed 72 Tweezer Head Epilator]] because her previous Emjoi finally gave up the ghost after 10 years.  She swears by it and upon receiving it, I actually read the manual.  Since it is not recommended to share epilators between people, I decided to purchase one for myself (I always shave my arms, legs, chest etc with a razor). I wanted to purchase a different brand and based on the reviews here, I went with the Braun 5180.  The shipping was on time as always (great amazon service)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me in my infinite wisdom decided to play guinea pig and experiment using the left(Braun) and right(Emjoi) side of my body for comparison, so here&#x27;s my findings...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fits easily in your hand, is less noisy, the massaging head attachment actually helps keep the pain level low by gently vibrating the surrounding skin, the led light is great for lighting up the area to find missed hairs, and the best part, and this is my personal opinion, my skin feels smoother overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;On several spots I don&#x27;t know how but I actually had bloody pores (about 3 of them).  I don&#x27;t know if it was due to long hairs being tweezed out or what.  The other negative was it took longer to actually finish my bodypart using the Braun than with the Emjoi.  I&#x27;m sure thats due to the Braun having approx. 1/2 the amount of tweezers than the Emjoi.  The pain was a little more intense also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my verdict???  I believe they both did the job well and both have their pros and cons.  As for this review specifically for the Braun,  I feel the final results were much smoother skin.  The Braun did hurt a little more but subsided quickly. It took longer to finish the job but that was expected because of the single 40 tweezer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is the Braun is a great alternative to shaving in my case and the light makes a BIG difference while using it.  My left side(Braun) felt smoother while rubbing my skin as opposed to the right side(Emjoi) which I felt had a slight stubble sensation, it&#x27;s hard to explain but the Braun had no resistance at all.  I&#x27;m giving this 4 stars due to the slight bloody pores I experienced which the Emjoi did not happen with.  I&#x27;m looking forward to updating this review in the future as things change.  Thanks for reading !</li>
            <li> I bought one of the first Silk Epils years and years ago (circa 1995) and it seemed like over time the metal tweezers stopped gripping.  That style had been discontinued so I replaced it with a Soft Perfection (20 tweezers) only to then learn of the X&#x27;elle which had 40.  So I bought an X&#x27;elle - aqua blue sparkly body.  The head, without the attachments, looked kind of naked and unfinished compared to the Soft Perfection and the tweezers were half plastic, half metal vs. metal on metal like the Soft Perfection - but it worked well.  I had some doubts of it holding up but it has held up fine over the last 4 years or so.  I am in need of a new replacement head - I think they ALL lose tweeze ability over time - and decided just to buy a whole new unit since they are making a new style now so the old is cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I may end up trying the new style down the road just because I like gadgets...  but since I tend to be crotchety and stuck in my ways I for now am going to say I prefer the old.  ;-)  As far as I can tell they use the same head so tweezing ability should be the same.  The new one just pivots which seems to me like it would offer less control?  I love the colorful, sparkly look of the old - the new looks boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep wanting to try an Emjoi but I can&#x27;t help but think that second spinning backward head, if it does anything, is going to break hair rather than help...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway.  Let&#x27;s talk epilating.  Chances are if you are considering epilating, you are doing it because shaving doesn&#x27;t cut it for you.  I am a hairy woman.  I blame PCOS + my mother&#x27;s Italian genes.  Genetics has been cruel in that my brother and father have less leg hair than I do - on what planet is that fair???  So assuming you are coming at this from a similar place, you may never look like the woman on the box.  Your legs may also never feel as smooth with epilating as after shaving - but they will LOOK acceptable for much longer.  I can epilate and then go campingfor a few days with friends and look OK - just don&#x27;t touch me -vs shaving and I will look like a neanderthal in 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience is this works great on coarse hair, fairly well on medium hair, not so great on fine hair.  It will grab hair that is pretty short - way shorter than waxing - but the thicker the hair the less prone to breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this works well on my lower legs (coarse).  Fairly well on the fronts of my thighs (medium) and bikini region (coarse).  Also well on my face (a few coarse chinny chins).  There are parts of my inner legs kinds of above and below the knee where the hair is fine, doesn&#x27;t work so well on this.  Luckily my arm hair is light and fine, if a tad long - I would never dream of using this on my arms.  And I do not do the backs of my thighs because the hair grows in nine million different directions and you really need to go the right direction to epilate.  I am simply not limber enough to be able to get close enough to figure out what I am doing back there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On coarse hair- this works well.  I have never seen 4 weeks of smoothness - I tend to do it every few days in the summer.  But it is still more effective than shaving. AmLactin lotion can help a lot with an ingrowns that result - or for an acute horrible patch of them, tend-skin or the home made alternative.  I think weather or not you get them is partly a personal variation and it&#x27;s annoying if you do.  A good Veet now and then (which I do to take care of the backs of my thighs) also tend to free the ingrowns.  For a manual exfoliation I have found that better than any scrub or loofah etc IN the shower is AFTER a nice long shower, dry your legs very aggressively with a nice un-fabric-softened towel - you will see the skin roll off even if you just used scrubby gloves or whatever.  Then use lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget about the acessories - the massage thing gets in the way, the cooling glove is not needed (but is good for kid&#x27;s boo boos)  Bare bones, unit and spinny head, yank those hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is this device perfect?  No - but it fails because body hair is a tough enemy to beat.  It won&#x27;t get ALL the hair and it can hurt until you get used to it.  But it does a great job on coarse hair and it has a real place in the hairy woman&#x27;s arsenal.  I can&#x27;t imagine much better short of laser becoming truly affordable.</li>
            <li> After a thorough testing by my significant other I can report the Braun expilator does a really job.  As she said, there are forty other things that I would rather be doing, but I like smooth in all the right places and I am happy with the Braun. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Received my item right on time, as described and unharmed. I had never heard of epilating until recently and tried this as soon as I got it and now I feel like I&#x27;ve been missing out for years! Tried it almost 24 hours ago and still smooth, with shaving I would already be prickly at this point. I think I will get a nicer one when this one wears out(by nicer I mean one that can go in water..this one is as nice as the dry ones come!) but I would def recommend this one to someone just starting with epilating.  It gave me a great first experience!</li>
            <li> love this product, at first it may seem painful when is pulling hair out but you get use to it just like when you pluck your eyebrows,</li>
            <li> Not very thorough, so you have to go over that spot two or three times in order for the epilator to catch all of the follicles. Very noisy, so at first, it will intimidate you. The pain varies. On the legs, it feels like toothpicks poking you, so the pain there is not too bad. The armpit feels like dry shaving. The bikini like HURTS, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it there since it does pluck out each follicle. I would rather wax down there and get a whole section done with then use the epilator and have it torture me hair by hair. Attached to the product is a \\&quot;smart light\\&quot; which really came in handy when epilating and especially finding stray hair. Overall, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> It works very well.  Used every week or few days.  It&#x27;s held up and performed well against other brands I have used.  My daughter put me on to this one.</li>
            <li> I have never in my life used one of these things, but im an overly happy with this one. No pain at all. Im a sissy for pain and this does not hurt one bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these models for like 8 years now. Long story but I was a boy back then. At this point my leg\arm\body hair is sparse enough that doing them all with an Epilator is _not_ a voyage into masochism. This thing actually works really well in conjunction with shaving. Shave once or twice a week to get smooth and exfoliated. And use this Epilator to massively thin out the number of active hairs. It works on hairs about 1mm long, sometimes shorter. I find that going at a 90 degree angle to the direction of growth is less painful than fully against, while still getting good clearage.</li>
            <li> I might be biased againt the product, as I wasn&#x27;t a regular epilator userbefore buyng this. This thing hurts a LOT!  The first few times I used it, I could tolerate it only for 1-2 seconds at a time b/c of the pain. The more I used it, the longer I could tolerate it. It did just an okay job removing the hair, so I was disappointed because at almost $60.00 it should perform better.&lt;br /&gt;After using this, I bit the bullet &amp; bought a no!no! Though expensive, it works great, with NO pain, less hair regrowth,therefore, well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using epilators for many years and I can say that this is a very good one. Buy with confidence. Fast shipping, brand new, unopened package. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Not much different than the old one we had, I hope it will last as long. Pain is relative. Glove I do not care about using it.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator.  Based on the reviews here, I was expecting it to be painful.  However, it wasn&#x27;t at all!  It stung a little, but didn&#x27;t hurt and didn&#x27;t really feel much afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the instructions and followed them.  Didn&#x27;t use the ice glove and don&#x27;t think I will need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lasts a LOT longer than a regular shave and this is just after one use.  Probably will get even better the more I use it!  This will great in the summer :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just wish it was cordless which is the only reason for the 4 stars vs 5 :-)</li>
            <li> I thought this would hurt like a mutha!?#@!%$!  But I had 2 ibuprofen, cranked up the tunes, and used the vibrating cap- I didn&#x27;t need the ibuprofen the second time, and did it while watching tv.  Great for beginning epilators!</li>
            <li> This product not working as expected. not able remove the hair completely. Hair growth is still fast as im seeing the growth within a week.</li>
            <li> Before I bought my Braun Silk Epilator I read many reviews and was almost scared off my purchase by the number of people who shared their horror stories regarding the pain involved in using an epilator. I thought about it off and on for several months and then decided that I would take a chance. I came to the conclusion that most people who find the epilator incredibly painful are those who go from shaving directly to using an epilator. When you have been shaving your legs for any length of time, your hair will be thick and coarse and thus very difficult (and painful) to remove with the epilator. If you use the epilator for the first time on hair that is thinner and finer (as it is after waxing or using an epilator), then the experience is much more pleasant. With that in mind, here are my tips for making your epilation experience bearable:&lt;br /&gt;1. Prior to your first experience with the epilator, make sure you wax (either do it yourself or, if you are inexperienced, pay to have it done). Trust me - this is essential! You need your hair to be thinner and finer before you attack it with the epilator.&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t wait too long before using the epilator after waxing. You&#x27;ll need to wait at least a week, and maybe two, but don&#x27;t wait much longer than that. The idea is to begin to epilate before your hair grows in too thickly. I typically epilate every two weeks and I find that this is about perfect for me.&lt;br /&gt;3. Maintain your smooth skin by using your epilator regularly (every two weeks or so). I have made the mistake of waiting longer, and the experience is a much different one. If you epilate often, your hair will be fine and easily removable.&lt;br /&gt;4. Finish up with an after-wax cooling gel. You&#x27;ll find that it will help with any stinging you might experience.&lt;br /&gt;5. Apart from the gel, don&#x27;t use lotions or creams on your legs until the next day. Your pores may be open and you could break out if you put something greasy on your legs immediately after hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the tips above I think you will really love this product. I can&#x27;t imagine living without mine. I have waxed for years and I got tired of the mess, the long process, and how much my back hurts after (I did the waxing myself and bending over for 90 minutes was agony). I find that I can epilate both legs in under 30 minutes and I&#x27;m left with smooth, hair-free legs for days. The hair does gradually grow back over two weeks time, but the epilator is so easy to use that I can touch up in between if I&#x27;m tempted to wear a sundress and find that my legs need some work. Most importantly (for me), I love the fact that the hair on my legs grows back without ever being rough and spiky (which I really, really hate and why I refuse to shave). Honestly, I think epilation is the best!</li>
            <li> works well and the light feature helps a lot. It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted - a simple and effective epilator.</li>
            <li> I was looking for epilators online and based on reviews Braun was ranked 3rd or 4th on the list. Since one of my friend suggested this, I decided to try Braun.. No regrets!! It was painful in a few places but the results were good. I would definitely recommed Braun.</li>
            <li> Although it takes me longer than it says it will on the instructions, I am really happy with this epilator!&lt;br /&gt;The light notices hairs that I would have never seen without it.</li>
            <li> I went thru tons of reviews on epilators before I decided to take a chance on this one. I have not used an epilator since the WAY early days of the original Epilady...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I have tried OTC waxing twice prior to this. That is what made me decide to go ahead and try an actual epilator. I have got to tell you, I actually examined the hairs coming out because it was so painless, I thought it was just shaving them off. I will admit, I&#x27;ve not worked up the courage to do my underarms yet, but the legs are absolutely fabulous. I haven&#x27;t yet used the cooling glove that came with it, may put it to use when I do the underarms or pubic region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is time consuming but not hard. It is easy to hold &amp; operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I certainly recommend this product to anyone that is wanting to try an epilator.</li>
            <li> Bought two, and feel they didn&#x27;t have the power to do the job. Used weekly, and the first one lasted only a few months</li>
            <li> This machine is still going strong with regular use for over three years - love Braun stuff!! All the attachments are great to have which makes it a very versatile device. Sturdy and fast, it makes epilating easier and not as painful as other methods.</li>
            <li> Braun SE 5180 Silk Epil 5 Epilator with Ice Glove, Green&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this for my mom, who I am the primary care giver for. I thought she might like this. Well, I was mostly wrong. The product itself seems of very high quality the problem is my mom has a low tolerance of pain. Yes the cooling glove helped but I was troubled by the problems she was having using the Braun. I can&#x27;t really knock the item, like I said it was doing the job and doing it well. So I will deduct one star for pain and leave it as a great product that some will find difficult to use.</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator. My first got shoved away in a box under the bed almost immediately after my first attempt at using it, which, as I recall, didn&#x27;t go far. Several years later, I still hate shaving, so I found myself shopping for epilators again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Pain Tolerance: I like tweezing my eyebrows, sometimes so much that I get carried away. I like tweezing my leg hairs one by one for amusement while talking on the phone. But my first epilator experience and my first (and only, EVER) attempt at home waxing ended in much the same way:  tears, shakiness, new product in the trash. So, I&#x27;m a 6 maybe on a 1-10 (10 being numb all over) scale of ability to self-impose hair-removal pain?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I forgot which day I was expecting this device, so I&#x27;d just shaved my legs and armpits that morning. In a moment of unexpected bravery, I first held it up to an armpit after turning it on. There were a few tiny stings of rogue hairs being plucked, but nothing excruciating. Anxious to try it out, but lacking much body hair, I decided to do my arms first. I&#x27;ve always kind of hated my arm hair. It&#x27;s light blonde, but long and dense, so I look hairier than I ought to. Still, I&#x27;ve never done anything about it fearing it would grow back denser and darker if I shaved it. Theoretically, epilating ought to make it lighter and thinner, so I thought I&#x27;d try it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the course of the evening (no ice glove, as I don&#x27;t have that many hands), I made it through my left forearm. It was painful, and took me 4 hours with frequent breaks to contemplate what I was doing to myself and why, but I finished the darn forearm nonetheless. Every single hair follicle turned bright red, but after some baby oil and a night&#x27;s sleep, it looked pretty normal again. By the next day, I was getting some leg stubble, and decided to try it out on that. Legs were very much less sensitive than the arm, though a day&#x27;s stubble didn&#x27;t seem quite long enough for it to grip onto very much hair.I used the ice glove and tried to hold the skin taught as I went, and it did seem to help a bit. Trimmed the other arm&#x27;s worth of hair, and then finished that rather quickly, though with breaks every 20 seconds or so to wait for the pain to die down. (It hurts a lot less when it&#x27;s not long, however!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all accounts, the first time epilating is the worst, as the hair follicles weaken the more times the hair is plucked out. With that in mind, I think this device has potential to stay in my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started out with the \\&quot;starter\\&quot; head and slow speed, but have moved onto the faster speed and \\&quot;efficiency\\&quot; head, as it doesn&#x27;t really hurt any less to do the whole process in slow motion--might as well just rip off the band-aid, so to speak. The light is nice, though not necessary for me this time, as I could figure out where I still had to do by going right next to the previous bright red spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as noise goes, it&#x27;s a bit noisy, but I found I could still hear the TV over it at about the volume I had it at without the epilator on. (And watching something while doing it seems to help me not focus on the pain too much and get it done more quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First epilator I&#x27;ve found tolerable, and it seems to do a pretty thorough job, so I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> In the comparison chart it said that it was cordless so I assumed it was a wet/dry...  The cord does detatch, however, it is not a rechargable, cordless product.  I wanted to use it in the bath with warm/hot water so that my pores are a little more open to make for easier (less painful) hair removal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I decided to try it anyhow as the last time I tried epilation, 15 or so years ago, the technology was no so hot so I thought this may be better.  I tried with dry legs.  Painful!  It was just to painful for me to bear.  So, I soaked in a hot-water bath (and had to get out and dry off) and the pain was bearable but as soon as my legs cooled down, again, it became unbearable. (Some people may have a higher pain threshhold though I do consider mine pretty high.)  I did notice that some parts of my legs were less painful than others. I am not into painkillers so this was not really an option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cold glove thingy was kinda&#x27; cool (no pun intended) though.  I tried it two ways.  First, because a spot on my leg was red and burning from having first epilated, I ran it down that spot a few times and it helped considerably.  The second way was that I had been working on my knee and it was sore and I still had more hair to pull there so I placed the cool glove in it for about 3 mins (inadvertantly; I received a call and had to answer it).  My knee became numb! (Duh!)  So I epilated my knee again and it was painless. (So I tried it on the other knee, having not been epilated at all and it was also painless.)  If I had the time (and patience), I could take the glove and numb each part of my leg (but just a small spot because the glove is only so big) with the cold and, as aforementioned, that would work great, but could only do this if I had hours and hours to work on epilation.  However, being a working mother of three, this is not an option. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I am giving it fours stars because it really does work; it&#x27;s just my pain thresholdthat makes it impossible for me to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I am sending this back and have ordered the more expensive but wet/dry so I can try this in the shower/bath and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> this is great product. It is fast and smooth, I didnt feel any pain. Even did underarms and with very less pain I was ready to go...</li>
