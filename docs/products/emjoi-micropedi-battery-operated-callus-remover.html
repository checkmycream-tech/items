            <li>Cost was the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but it is a very good investment for summer sandal feet.</li>
            <li>but my daughter loved it so much I got one here at amazon</li>
            <li>After buying one for myself I found it to be such a great item I bought 2 more as gifts</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so easy to use.</li>
            <li>The very first time I used it, I was able to get 95% of my toe corn off</li>

            <li>My feet look fabulous.</li>

            <li>use this device after I use the rasp, to smooth everything.</li>
            <li>and this really impressed her in getting all the dead skin and calluses off her feet.</li>
            <li>It can take a while to smooth it out</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products without success.  </li>
            <li>They were very pleased and surprised how easy to use.</li>
            <li>I like the ease of use for this product easy cleanup not painful</li>
            <li>It leaves my feet super smooth &amp; cleanup of the device</li>
            <li>I love it &amp; would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It does work, but it takes a bit of time to getting use to it and the batteries wear out quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>Will have to see how long the rollers last but just using it in the convenience of your home is great!</li>
            <li>It works great, FOLLOW directions and do not use a heavy hand with this.</li>
            <li>Does a great job removing dead skin.</li>
            <li>For that reason alone this purchase was worth it.  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money.</li>
            <li>The rollers wear out pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>it came quickly and exactly as described ..</li>
            <li>The reviews were accurate in saying you go through the first roller pretty fast</li>
            <li>It seems it is not as powerful now than when I first got it even with a change of batteries.</li>
            <li>Gentle enough but effective.</li>
            <li>That being said it should start improving feet and heels at first use.</li>
            <li>It really works!  </li>
            <li>This removed a LOT of callus at first.</li>
            <li>Will definitely keep my feet more presentable for sandal season.</li>
            <li>miht get a couple more as christmas present this year!</li>
            <li>With the first use I was amazed at the difference.  </li>
            <li>Saw it first on a tv infomercial but prefer shopping with Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended for a quick pedicure.  </li>
            <li>I go barefoot on my hard surface floors all the time, so the MicroPedi is great for keeping my feet sandal ready.</li>
            <li>I am constantly battling calluses, and this does a great job of whittling them down.</li>
            <li>This little device is amazing.  </li>
            <li>I save so much time and effort.  </li>
            <li>Much safer than a shaver I used to use.</li>
            <li>It really helps.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier then manually removing a callous with a handheld tool or pumice stone.</li>
            <li>Works so well and gets smooth heels in short period of time.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I had seen this on QVC, but Amazon had a little better price because of no shipping.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because it could use a little more power</li>
            <li>It will save you so much money and time from getting those frequent pedicures.  </li>
            <li>Will always have this product or a similar one because its worth every penny</li>
            <li>I love this little gadget!</li>
            <li>Wow, does this every work!  </li>
            <li>however I found the next one lasted much longer.  </li>
            <li>I was not too sure as I read negative reviews after I bought</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a professional tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I play a lot of tennis and had a big callus on my right big toe</li>
            <li>With this model I received an extra replacement roller which overall brought the cost down more.  </li>
            <li>I felt about 50/50 when I ordered that this product would be a waste of money, as many other purchases of &amp;#34;corn remover systems&amp;#34; were.  </li>
            <li>However after the first few times it appears to be loosing power.</li>
            <li>This tool easily removes the tough skin.  </li>
            <li>Now that there is less build up, not so much.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> However after the first few times it appears to be loosing power.</li>
            <li> This tool easily removes the tough skin.  </li>
            <li> Now that there is less build up, not so much.  </li>
            <li> A little messy to use as dry skin flies off as a fine, white dust, but that just shows it&#x27;s working.  </li>
            <li> I had such dry heels</li>
            <li> I bought 4 extra rollers, and would recommend you do the same, and you will also find paperwork in the box to order from the manufacturer- same price, but at least you know you won&#x27;t have a product you cant find parts for next year!  </li>
            <li> I bought it to use before going to my pedi appointments because I have excess dry scaly feet</li>
            <li> really would recommend this to people who get thick rough skin on feet</li>
            <li> I signed up for the auto-refill which is $5 less than regular price.</li>
            <li> but I purchased it for cracked heels and other dry areas of my feet.  </li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve aged, the soles of my feet have become quite rough.  </li>
            <li> Buy a few replacement heads for the future.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> If you have rough feet, this is the tool for you!  </li>
            <li> (well, it was pretty big and quite painful).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product.  I save so much time and effort.  Highly recommended for a quick pedicure.  My feet look fabulous.</li>
            <li> Best foot care tool !&lt;br /&gt;Works great and is addictive! Love the fact that I do not need to soak my feet to achieve even better results and so easy!</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive before purchasing this product (after reading some of the reviews)  but after watching a demonstration video I decided to try it.  And I sure am glad I did.  I love the Emjoi MicroPedi.  The reviews were accurate in saying you go through the first roller pretty fast however I found the next one lasted much longer.  I use this product every 2 - 3 days  and I have had great results.  I play a lot of tennis and had a big callus on my right big toe and it is all but gone now.  No more pain.  For that reason alone this purchase was worth it.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works great and got it on time thank you my wife love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I thought what a great concept! I bought it to use before going to my pedi appointments because I have excess dry scaly feet and I was embarrassed to have someone else remove it for me. It does work, but it takes a bit of time to getting use to it and the batteries wear out quickly.</li>
            <li> You can see the dead skin fall off! It&#x27;s faster and does the job better then a hand held. GET IT!</li>
            <li> This is gift for my sister, I have used this item for over a year.  It works great, FOLLOW directions and do not use a heavy hand with this. That being said it should start improving feet and heels at first use.</li>
            <li> I must admit that I was a little trepidatious about whether this would work, but found that it is something everyone should have.  It really works!  I had seen this advertised on a shopping network (same price and with Amazon there is no tax or shipping) and since it was inexpensive thought I would give it a try.  It will save you so much money and time from getting those frequent pedicures.  Will have to see how long the rollers last but just using it in the convenience of your home is great!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with this purchase.  It is gentle but does a great job on my feet and my husband&#x27;s.  Our feet are baby-soft now. I highly recommend this.  It is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Wow, does this every work!  When I use a regular emery board style callus remover, it causes my heals to crack open within a day or so.  This removed a LOT of callus at first. Now that there is less build up, not so much.  My heels haven&#x27;t looked this good in 10 years!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  As I&#x27;ve aged, the soles of my feet have become quite rough.  This tool easily removes the tough skin.  I bought the 2nd one for my daughter.</li>
            <li> After buying one for myself I found it to be such a great item I bought 2 more as gifts</li>
            <li> This is called a callous remover but I purchased it for cracked heels and other dry areas of my feet.  This little device is amazing.  You will need the addition of some good moisturizer after exfoliating.  I just started using Miracle Foot Repair and then Vaseline with Cocoa butter (then some socks or you will slip and fall).  January/February are usually the worst months of the year but thanks to the Emjoi I now have healthy feet.</li>
            <li> I like the ease of use for this product easy cleanup not painful really would recommend this to people who get thick rough skin on feet try it</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and she really love it. I guess it satisfy her expectation about this product.</li>
            <li> I have this for a few months now.  I am on the 3rd roller refill now.  The rollers wear out pretty quickly. It seems it is not as powerful now than when I first got it even with a change of batteries. The refills can get expensive.  I signed up for the auto-refill which is $5 less than regular price.</li>
            <li> I had seen this on QVC, but Amazon had a little better price because of no shipping. It works wonders in just 2 uses. It&#x27;s so easy to use and your feet will love you. Really gets the dried cracked heels into shape. Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy this...</li>
            <li> This callus remover is the best I&#x27;ve had. I am constantly battling calluses, and this does a great job of whittling them down. I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I love it &amp; would highly recommend it! It leaves my feet super smooth &amp; cleanup of the device is very easy.</li>
            <li> great product!!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the emjoi micropedi, It works great on calluses and cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I felt about 50/50 when I ordered that this product would be a waste of money, as many other purchases of &amp;#34;corn remover systems&amp;#34; were.  I am so impressed! It is ergonomically designed, easy to use and clean, and works the most amazing way.  The very first time I used it, I was able to get 95% of my toe corn off (well, it was pretty big and quite painful).  I also use it all over the soles of my feet, especially the heels.  My skin turns to baby-soft.  I am pressing all my friends to buy this:  it is both for beauty and health.  I bought 4 extra rollers, and would recommend you do the same, and you will also find paperwork in the box to order from the manufacturer- same price, but at least you know you won&#x27;t have a product you cant find parts for next year!  Go ahead:  this is not a luxury, this is a necessity!  You will love it and save $ on pedicures.</li>
            <li> I was not too sure as I read negative reviews after I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a rasp device that I bought after another reviewer said this product was worthless but the rasp works well. And it truly does. Much safer than a shaver I used to use. The rasp cost $10 and I bought it on Amazon too. It&#x27;s a professional tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this device after I use the rasp, to smooth everything. It makes a powdery residue, so it does work. I think if you used it solely you&#x27;d be there all day.</li>
            <li> The concept is great. However after the first few times it appears to be loosing power. It will get the job done if you stay at it for 20 or 30 minutes. The first time I used it, I was impressed. After that it doesn&#x27;t work as well. But its a good tool to have. Not made for heavy use.</li>
            <li> Effortless pedicures.  Much better than the pedegg which I had been using for a while.  Buy a few replacement heads for the future.  Depending on your needs, it will need to be replaced in a couple weeks to a month.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I got this. It really helps.</li>
            <li> I had never seen anything like this until I saw it  on QVC. bought it for me and my husband we both have problems with our feet. It is a miracle. We love it, it works great exactly the way it was advertised. Everyone should have one.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  No more scrubbing and/or razors at the nail salon.</li>
            <li> Allows me to delay a pedicure in winter. This tool is THE BEST ! I recommend it to all of my friends</li>
            <li> WOW, amazing, fantastic, painless, easy to use - I can go on and on!  If you have rough feet, this is the tool for you!  It is terrific!!!</li>
            <li> I love this. Does a great job removing dead skin. Especially like using it when feet are dry--no soaking before</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have used to control the callus on my feet.  My friend lent me her&#x27;s and as soon as I turned it on I knew I had to have one of my own.  Will definitely keep my feet more presentable for sandal season.</li>
            <li> I am soooo happy with this product..its incredible!! it came quickly and exactly as described ..LOOOVE it!!! miht get a couple more as christmas present this year!</li>
            <li> This is the best foot callus remover there is.Bought a deluxe&lt;br /&gt; kit somewhere else but my daughter loved it so much I got one here at amazon</li>
            <li> I bought this for the wife since she is always working on her feet and this really impressed her in getting all the dead skin and calluses off her feet. This is one great item for the lady&#x27;s or men. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It does a good job removing callouses and smoothing your skin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a tougher or deeper callous on your foot. It can take a while to smooth it out but it does do the trick and it&#x27;s so easy to use. Makes your skin very smooth too. I got the teal color and it is very nice. I gave it 4 stars because it could use a little more power but I am very satisfied with this tool. It&#x27;s so much easier then manually removing a callous with a handheld tool or pumice stone. I&#x27;m glad I bought it! It does a great job, saves time and makes my feet very soft. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  Please don&#x27;t waste your time, or your money ordering this product.</li>
            <li> Works so well and gets smooth heels in short period of time.  My sister recently tried when visiting and she is going to buy one and save on expensive pedicures.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 3 of these, one for myself and others for daughter &amp; daughter-in-law. They were very pleased and surprised how easy to use. You get good results in minutes. Highly recommend. Delivery was quick.Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the person I gave it to is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Use the Emjoi to file your toenails if you are having difficulty&lt;br /&gt;reaching to the floor.  Its a godsend to us seniors!!!</li>
            <li> Love this.  I had such dry heels there was a crack in one of them.  After just a few uses, it&#x27;s almost gone!  A little messy to use as dry skin flies off as a fine, white dust, but that just shows it&#x27;s working.  Gentle enough but effective.</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend&#x27;s Birthday.  I have one and love it.  It just keeps feet maintained in between pedicures.  I think the add on tools would be a great purchase too.  That will be next</li>
            <li> I go barefoot on my hard surface floors all the time, so the MicroPedi is great for keeping my feet sandal ready. Very easy to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> At last a way to get rid of stubborn calluses on the feet.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products without success.  With the first use I was amazed at the difference.  Saw it first on a tv infomercial but prefer shopping with Amazon.  With this model I received an extra replacement roller which overall brought the cost down more.  So glad to find this product! Cost was the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, but it is a very good investment for summer sandal feet.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I get thick callouses on my heels that I have to see the podiatrist for but this does the job without the inconvenience or expense. Will always have this product or a similar one because its worth every penny</li>
