            <li>You have to position it just right on your left wrist and hold it over your heart for an accurate reading.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I have used the monitor several times and after receiving very helpful instructions of how to proper place the monitor I was able to obtain fairly accurate readings.  </li>
            <li>simple and easy to use</li>

            <li>Thanks for offering it.</li>
            <li>Reads fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>The reading is too low to be credible.</li>
            <li>Really iffy readings.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>&amp; I have a nice BIG upper arm BP cuff!</li>
            <li>The little motor is strong and quick, it fits my patients</li>
            <li>Included a solid plastic storage case to keep it clean and protected.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure it is on your wrist tightly and above your wrist bone to get an accurate reading.</li>
            <li>This little machine is so far superior to our 15+ year old manual pump-up.  </li>
            <li>An irregular heartbeat symbol will appear if your heart beat is 25% slower or faster two or more times than the average rhythm</li>
            <li>Two AAA batteries come with the unit and when not in use it can tucked  into the handy small plastic container</li>
            <li>I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about writing down the results every time.</li>
            <li>The LCD is very clear with the systolic and diastolic and the pulse rate in large letters.</li>
            <li>Works far better than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the color indicator on the side of the face.</li>
            <li>The display is nice and the text is large enough for people with less vision to also read and understand.</li>
            <li>high.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>He could take it with him always and check this high pressure any time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for people who have high blood pressure and need close monitor their BP.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone ( even if you have small wrists as it is adjustable) and is very easy to use and to read.</li>
            <li>then other monitors and easy to store away.</li>
            <li>I am a person who needs to check my blood pressure on a daily basis and I really need something accurate and easy to use and finally after trying a lot of other home blood pressure monitors</li>
            <li>also like the ease of use and light that changes from color scale green to red when your arm is in the correct position to get an correct accurate reading</li>
            <li>blood pressure medication change your diet and with exercise watch your blood pressure dropped to normal levels</li>
            <li>I have to take my blood pressure everyday, twice a day, to monitor it and make sure my medication is working.</li>
            <li>Used it for 3 days, almost went to the ER because it gave me a reading of 206/93 when in fact my BP was normal at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>a few more days I&#x27;ll call the doctor if this keeps up.  </li>
            <li>The trouble is there are just too many &#x27;error&#x27; results when using it.</li>
            <li>I have high blood pressure and live in panic mode..</li>
            <li>so so in order to get proper reading, so you can&#x27;t rely on the reading as you may not be just positioned exactly......not easy to position correctly if you are having a problem and want to verify the reading against your present condition.  </li>
            <li>Might try to glue it back on, but right now it just sits in my nursing bag -</li>
            <li>The readings compare very favorably with my Omron upper arm monitor but the wrist monitor is so much handier and allows you to take your pressure anywhere.</li>
            <li>I like the scale on the left side that immediately compares BP results to the WHO standard; very useful if you are like me and don&#x27;t have that memorized (who does...).</li>
            <li>At first I was concerned that it did not actually display my blood pressure.  </li>
            <li>Several months ago I went to the doctor and my bp was higher than it has been.  </li>
            <li>This little blood pressure monitor was working great especially for such low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple to use, the number display is large and clear and it fits my skinny wrist!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend for anyone who is small boned, sensitive and bruise easily.</li>
            <li>The unit needs to be placed above the large bone at your wrist.</li>
            <li>I have large arms and the regular cuffs</li>
            <li>The instructions are clear.  </li>
            <li>If the unit worked well, I love the fact that it has a memory function that stores the date and time, and the color-coded scale on the left lets you know instantly how good or bad the news is for your pressure.</li>
            <li>I purchased this blood pressure monitor for my father whom just turned 70 years old.</li>
            <li>I can imagine that if someone did not have access to a second monitor, this thing would scare them to death and cause much fear.  </li>
            <li>it has so far.</li>
            <li>It has served me well during my busy travel schedule.  </li>
            <li>The company I bought it from also sent me an e-mail on the proper use of the monitor which was very helpful.</li>
            <li>It inflates and is complete in seconds not minutes like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it after trying and sending back a few others.</li>
            <li>This little unit is easy to use and seems to read the same as the Dr.&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get a small monitor for travel purposes that would be compact and accurate.  </li>

            <li>BTW, this one read HIGHER for us, not lower than other cuffs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and small enough to throw in a purse or bag.  </li>
            <li>Blood pressure readings only take a few second and the numbers on the screen  are easily read.</li>
            <li>It is very compact but fits small and large wrists  </li>
            <li>Much time and money would be wasted running off to the doctor to see why your BP was so high.  </li>
            <li>Since my father recently diagnosed with high blood pressure, as a licensed nurse,  I suggested him to check and monitor his BP twice a day or daily.</li>
            <li>apparently, your results may differ judging from the comments that lead me to buy it.</li>
            <li>Won&#x27;t his doctor be surprised when he can answer her question with a &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; next time!</li>
            <li>I pulled out an old battery operated upper arm cuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty small, quiet &amp; fast.</li>
            <li>I work in Home Health as a physical therapist and must use the cuff with my very large people and when my patients are active, a manual cuff is just not feasible.  </li>
            <li>It is fast as compared to any other I have ever used.</li>
            <li>My husband is a tall man with big bones and I am complete opposite - We have both used the monitor and like the product.</li>
            <li>Holding your breath or breathing very shallowly will shorten your blood of some oxygen and trigger the brain&#x27;s response to increase your heart rate and of course : ) your blood pressure.</li>
            <li>It is much easier for him to use this because it goes on his wrist and not on his upper arm like his other devices.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it seems to consistent with its readings.</li>
            <li>I am considering purchasing another one of these for other senior citizen members of my family because of my dad&#x27;s experience with this particular product.</li>
            <li>Due to he likes travel, I purchased this small wrist BP monitor for him, because it is so to easy to carry to everywhere--</li>

            <li> Thanks for offering it.</li>
            <li> Reads fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> The reading is too low to be credible.</li>
            <li> Really iffy readings.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> &amp; I have a nice BIG upper arm BP cuff!</li>
            <li> The little motor is strong and quick, it fits my patients</li>
            <li> Included a solid plastic storage case to keep it clean and protected.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure it is on your wrist tightly and above your wrist bone to get an accurate reading.</li>
            <li> This little machine is so far superior to our 15+ year old manual pump-up.  </li>
            <li> An irregular heartbeat symbol will appear if your heart beat is 25% slower or faster two or more times than the average rhythm</li>
            <li> Two AAA batteries come with the unit and when not in use it can tucked  into the handy small plastic container</li>
            <li> I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about writing down the results every time.</li>
            <li> The LCD is very clear with the systolic and diastolic and the pulse rate in large letters.</li>
            <li> Works far better than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the color indicator on the side of the face.</li>
            <li> The display is nice and the text is large enough for people with less vision to also read and understand.</li>
            <li> high.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> He could take it with him always and check this high pressure any time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for people who have high blood pressure and need close monitor their BP.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone ( even if you have small wrists as it is adjustable) and is very easy to use and to read.</li>
            <li> then other monitors and easy to store away.</li>
            <li> I am a person who needs to check my blood pressure on a daily basis and I really need something accurate and easy to use and finally after trying a lot of other home blood pressure monitors</li>
            <li> also like the ease of use and light that changes from color scale green to red when your arm is in the correct position to get an correct accurate reading</li>
            <li> blood pressure medication change your diet and with exercise watch your blood pressure dropped to normal levels</li>
            <li> I have to take my blood pressure everyday, twice a day, to monitor it and make sure my medication is working.</li>
            <li> Used it for 3 days, almost went to the ER because it gave me a reading of 206/93 when in fact my BP was normal at my doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> a few more days I&#x27;ll call the doctor if this keeps up.  </li>
            <li> The trouble is there are just too many &#x27;error&#x27; results when using it.</li>
            <li> I have high blood pressure and live in panic mode..</li>
            <li> so so in order to get proper reading, so you can&#x27;t rely on the reading as you may not be just positioned exactly......not easy to position correctly if you are having a problem and want to verify the reading against your present condition.  </li>
            <li> Might try to glue it back on, but right now it just sits in my nursing bag -</li>
            <li> The readings compare very favorably with my Omron upper arm monitor but the wrist monitor is so much handier and allows you to take your pressure anywhere.</li>
            <li> I like the scale on the left side that immediately compares BP results to the WHO standard; very useful if you are like me and don&#x27;t have that memorized (who does...).</li>
            <li> At first I was concerned that it did not actually display my blood pressure.  </li>
            <li> Several months ago I went to the doctor and my bp was higher than it has been.  </li>
            <li> This little blood pressure monitor was working great especially for such low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple to use, the number display is large and clear and it fits my skinny wrist!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend for anyone who is small boned, sensitive and bruise easily.</li>
            <li> The unit needs to be placed above the large bone at your wrist.</li>
            <li> I have large arms and the regular cuffs</li>
            <li> The instructions are clear.  </li>
            <li> If the unit worked well, I love the fact that it has a memory function that stores the date and time, and the color-coded scale on the left lets you know instantly how good or bad the news is for your pressure.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blood pressure monitor for my father whom just turned 70 years old.</li>
            <li> I can imagine that if someone did not have access to a second monitor, this thing would scare them to death and cause much fear.  </li>
            <li> it has so far.</li>
            <li> It has served me well during my busy travel schedule.  </li>
            <li> The company I bought it from also sent me an e-mail on the proper use of the monitor which was very helpful.</li>
            <li> It inflates and is complete in seconds not minutes like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it after trying and sending back a few others.</li>
            <li> This little unit is easy to use and seems to read the same as the Dr.&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a small monitor for travel purposes that would be compact and accurate.  </li>
            <li> br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  Item offered free  in exchange for a review, I&#x27;am open to negative and positive comment&#x27;sautomatic memory function records the last 120 measurements in 2 groups for efficient tracking.</li>
            <li> BTW, this one read HIGHER for us, not lower than other cuffs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and small enough to throw in a purse or bag.  </li>
            <li> Blood pressure readings only take a few second and the numbers on the screen  are easily read.</li>
            <li> It is very compact but fits small and large wrists  </li>
            <li> Much time and money would be wasted running off to the doctor to see why your BP was so high.  </li>
            <li> Since my father recently diagnosed with high blood pressure, as a licensed nurse,  I suggested him to check and monitor his BP twice a day or daily.</li>
            <li> apparently, your results may differ judging from the comments that lead me to buy it.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t his doctor be surprised when he can answer her question with a &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; next time!</li>
            <li> I pulled out an old battery operated upper arm cuff.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty small, quiet &amp; fast.</li>
            <li> I work in Home Health as a physical therapist and must use the cuff with my very large people and when my patients are active, a manual cuff is just not feasible.  </li>
            <li> It is fast as compared to any other I have ever used.</li>
            <li> My husband is a tall man with big bones and I am complete opposite - We have both used the monitor and like the product.</li>
            <li> Holding your breath or breathing very shallowly will shorten your blood of some oxygen and trigger the brain&#x27;s response to increase your heart rate and of course : ) your blood pressure.</li>
            <li> It is much easier for him to use this because it goes on his wrist and not on his upper arm like his other devices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it seems to consistent with its readings.</li>
            <li> I am considering purchasing another one of these for other senior citizen members of my family because of my dad&#x27;s experience with this particular product.</li>
            <li> Due to he likes travel, I purchased this small wrist BP monitor for him, because it is so to easy to carry to everywhere--</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s lower the blood pressure readings will be slightly elevated, and if it&#x27;s too high</li>
            <li> My experience is that the reading tends to be about 10 mm low but is at least consistent.</li>
            <li> did notice that the battery housing cover felt a bit loose when I inserted the batteries and actually fell off during one reading - that could be an issue for the future - but the housing cover is just a cosmetic feature and its presence or absence has no effect on the unit&#x27;s function.</li>
            <li> When the BP reading is complete a LED arrow on the screen points to a corresponding the color (green, yellow, orange or red) to let you know where your BP falls on the scale, green good red dangerous.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and bought an above-the-elbow version of a blood pressure monitor by Panasonic for about the same price and haven&#x27;t had a single error result.</li>
            <li> I recently compared it to a conventional BP cuff at my doctor&#x27;s office and the readings were only one or two numbers off.</li>
            <li> and I am afraid in most cases</li>
            <li> I wish I had opted for a wrist monitor long time ago.</li>
            <li> This thing has earned its place on my desktop and will continue to be there as long as maintains the level of accuracy</li>
            <li> Shipping took a long time.</li>
            <li> Only con has been difficulty switching from one saved group back to previous group.</li>
            <li> Even using the instructions carefully, the variations in BP from other more expensive units are way off the mark.</li>
            <li> We took it to the local pathmark pharmacy blood pressure machine and compared readings, they both were within a couple of readings of each other</li>
            <li> It is less expensive than most other models out there</li>
            <li> With the power off, pressing the set button will program the machine to indicate an average of the last three readings.</li>
            <li> the readings will be slightly too low.</li>
            <li> I have been on bp medicine for 30 years--since my Marine Corps Reserve physical discovered slightly elevated bp.  </li>
            <li> I am using it now with rubber bands around the bracelet to keep the patch on tight enough to use the monitor.    </li>
            <li> The Last 3 Results Average feature automatically calculates average readings stored in memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Last 3 Results Average feature automatically calculates average readings stored in memory.  </li>
            <li> The doctor suggested I check my bp every hour for the next few days.</li>
            <li> It took 35 minutes to get any reading and then the reading was so low that I thought I was dead.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.  </li>
            <li> The only &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; were the 2 dead batteries enclosed in the package.</li>
            <li> I have had the monitor for only a few days.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend, not accurate even when following instructions.</li>
            <li> This BP monitor gives false and unrealistically high readings.</li>
            <li> the quality or accuracy of other cuffs is not there.  </li>
            <li> He checks his blood pressure at least twice a day and has been taking blood pressure medicine for several decades.</li>
            <li> Irregular Heart Beat detector automatically alerts you when heart rhythm is either 25 percent faster or slower than the average rhythm detected during the measuring process.</li>
            <li> An Irregular Heart Beat detector automatically alerts you when heart rhythm is either 25 percent faster or slower than the average rhythm detected during the measuring process.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how you hold your arm, it will work on average 1 time out of 4.</li>
            <li> I hands down give this product 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> Compared with my other BP machine with repeatable values!</li>
            <li> Wait at least 30~minutes or extra few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I might have gotten the odd box, because it mentions batteries on the side of the box.</li>
            <li> It squeezed so tight</li>
            <li> No very good, will take 10 tries to get a reading</li>
            <li> I would have given it 5 stars but the velcro on the armband fell off a few days after I received it</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m dead?</li>
            <li> no more pinch arm cuffs, wanting cry when they inflate and then half the time getting an inaccurate reading...</li>
            <li> I am so sad that Amazon would sell such a defective product.  </li>
            <li> We didn&#x27;t even realize that there was a small, affordable gadget out there like this.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size fool you.</li>
            <li> He loves it and likes the convenience of carrying it in its small case.  </li>
            <li> I bought this monitor for my husband who was not happy with other BP monitors.  </li>
            <li> I know what that mean I was told in past</li>
            <li> No more running to the drug store to test my blood pressure!</li>
            <li> a little superglue couldn&#x27;t fix, but it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is not a good item for me...</li>
            <li> It was so far off base with the blood pressure reading and scared me silly until i checked it against my usual monitor.  </li>
            <li> With a broken arm this has allowed me to monitor my BP as I could not with the arm cuff.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.     http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IQN770Y/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> so I tried the other one and found it was just as bad.</li>
            <li> It is horrible very hard to use and every time was a different score on the screen</li>
            <li> Unfortunately we all have some heart problems in my family so it will be a shared experience for all.</li>
            <li> UNFORTUNATELY...</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find out that this monitor is not very accurate.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not to Crazy to follow</li>
            <li> It has been the bearer of bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to use, accurate.  Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> This little machine is so far superior to our 15+ year old manual pump-up.  It is very consistent and my doctor appreciates the saved measurements.</li>
            <li> I have used the monitor several times and after receiving very helpful instructions of how to proper place the monitor I was able to obtain fairly accurate readings.  So far, its been worth the money!</li>
            <li> No very good, will take 10 tries to get a reading</li>
            <li> cannot get it to work</li>
            <li> You have to position it just right on your left wrist and hold it over your heart for an accurate reading.</li>
            <li> Works far better than I expected.  Good value....</li>
            <li> Great little monitor. Love it after trying and sending back a few others.</li>
            <li> It is horrible very hard to use and every time was a different score on the screen</li>
            <li> Well in as much as you can &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; an item I guess I love it.  I work in Home Health as a physical therapist and must use the cuff with my very large people and when my patients are active, a manual cuff is just not feasible.  I have tested this against my manual cuff and I am very comfortable with the accuracy within 2-4 points.  The reason I am bothering to write a review is that I will go through about 8-10 cuffs per year because of the travel and frequency of use and I am afraid in most cases the quality or accuracy of other cuffs is not there.  This cuff is solid and I expect it to serve me well.  The little motor is strong and quick, it fits my patients wrists well, it is easy to use and of course the memory function is invaluable.</li>
            <li> A great quality instrument that does the job it was intended to do...</li>
            <li> Great product must have for anybody over 40 and trying to stay off of blood pressure medication change your diet and with exercise watch your blood pressure dropped to normal levels</li>
            <li> bought this for my mother she states easy to use and read</li>
            <li> With a broken arm this has allowed me to monitor my BP as I could not with the arm cuff.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my Zigabob Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor, It exceeded my expectations in every way. Earlier today I had a Dr. Appt, and I took it with me, I took my blood pressure just before going into the dr. office, and I was able to compared it with the outcome of my doctor&#x27;s machine, the reading prove to me that I am getting an accurate reading of my pressure at home, which is vital to my health. It is very convenient and easy to use. I have to take my blood pressure everyday, twice a day, to monitor it and make sure my medication is working. I recommend this to anyone that has to monitor their pressure and wants to do it easily and accurately. Great quality, well made. Convenient and very compact carrying case, it can fit in my purse. Also this is perfect when traveling. I wish I had opted for a wrist monitor long time ago. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly love my Zigabob Wrist Blood Pressure Monitor.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item at a promotional rate, but all stated in this review is based on my own experience and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> meh.... compared it to others that are the wrap around your bicep-area kind.  This one came up 14 pts. high.  I read the instructions, yes.And I read all of the emails you get that confirm that you&#x27;re using it properly (which I was).  Now I just subtract 14 off of the results I get.  Meh... I definitely wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. *shrugs*  apparently, your results may differ judging from the comments that lead me to buy it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this blood pressure monitor for my father whom just turned 70 years old. He checks his blood pressure at least twice a day and has been taking blood pressure medicine for several decades. When I gave this to him he was THRILLED. It is much easier for him to use this because it goes on his wrist and not on his upper arm like his other devices. Very easy to use!! High-quality cuff and digital screen. This monitor is the real deal and very good quality especially for the price. I am considering purchasing another one of these for other senior citizen members of my family because of my dad&#x27;s experience with this particular product. I highly recommend it. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, thank you.</li>
            <li> This wrist unit is handy, easy to use and read and the readings pretty much match my doctor&#x27;s.  I would recommend this to a friend, easily.  It packs well, I travel from home to work for days at a time.</li>
            <li> so so not as good as one I had</li>
            <li> This is not a good item for me...it has to be held just so so in order to get proper reading, so you can&#x27;t rely on the reading as you may not be just positioned exactly......not easy to position correctly if you are having a problem and want to verify the reading against your present condition.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone....my previous monitor was excellent for many years, but unfortunately I gave it away to soon.&lt;br /&gt;Would have returned this, but wasn&#x27;t able to to do this in an expeditious manner so I still have it......but most likely will never use it.  Destined for the trash.</li>
            <li> keeping track of blood pressure is so easy with this monitor.  Super easy set up following the directions.  Included a solid plastic storage case to keep it clean and protected.  Uses AAA batteries that are not included.  The memory feature is a nice bonus</li>
            <li> My doctor said my blood pressure has been increasing elevated with each visit. I work to maintain optimal health so I wanted to be able to monitor at home so I can get a good idea of whats going on. It works well. Has good directions booklet to follow to make certain to get the proper reading. It works well for me and I like the added irregular heartbeat feature.  easy to use, good customer service, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It is less expensive than most other models out there and it works very well.  It is easy to use and keeps track of my blood pressure history.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to get a small monitor for travel purposes that would be compact and accurate.  This thing is a hunk of junk.  It was so far off base with the blood pressure reading and scared me silly until i checked it against my usual monitor.  I am so sad that Amazon would sell such a defective product.  I can imagine that if someone did not have access to a second monitor, this thing would scare them to death and cause much fear.  Much time and money would be wasted running off to the doctor to see why your BP was so high.  It says it is FDA approved.  Yet another example of our trustworthy government.  If you are thinking of pirchasing a monitor, please take my advice and keep on looking.  These should be taken off the market.</li>
            <li> We took it to the local pathmark pharmacy blood pressure machine and compared readings, they both were within a couple of readings of each other I do recommend that you follow the instructions specifically as to the correct measurement position : ) Sit upright relaxed no straining. Try not to lean over too much and sit unsteady .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Keep your feet rested on the floor not ~ stand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Don&#x27;t take your blood pressure reading after eating ~ exercising~ smoking~bathing or drinking alcohol. Wait at least 30~minutes or extra few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sit in a calm while your not talking area because while you&#x27;re taking your blood pressure : ) it raises it up and keep your wrist level with your heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Keep away from strong electromagnetic interference like example cells phone ~~microwave ~~while taking your blood pressure basically if you stay completely still you&#x27;d get a better reading. Holding your breath or breathing very shallowly will shorten your blood of some oxygen and trigger the brain&#x27;s response to increase your heart rate and of course : ) your blood pressure. You Need to breath regularly without interference affecting your readings . Don&#x27;t use if have as stated severe arrhythmia I know what that mean I was told in past I have this medical issue which is known to have extra heart beats I know that the multiple abdominal surgeries I went though had brought that medical problem on anyways my husband tested this just incase for you&#x27;ll : ) ~~measure same time each day if need to retest wait 3 minutes or longer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* If you decide to buy a cuff-type monitor make sure that the cuff is around your heart level, too. If it&#x27;s lower the blood pressure readings will be slightly elevated, and if it&#x27;s too high the readings will be slightly too low. Just don&#x27;t have the cuff around your waist or with head level and you&#x27;ll be fine just follow directions it&#x27;s not to Crazy to follow don&#x27;t mind my writing..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* It requires 2 x AAA batteries (NOTE - batteries are not supplied with the unit).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The automatic memory function records the last 120 measurements in 2 groups for efficient tracking.

            <li> I have to keep track of my blood pressure, because of a stomach condition, this is so easy to use, and I can use it just about any where. All I have to do is slap it on and hit the button, easy face, and portable.</li>
            <li> simple and easy to use</li>
            <li> I have been able to get consistent readings with this monitor very easily. You just press the start button and it takes the reading and stores it in memory. The readings I got with this monitor matched up very closely to what the doctor&#x27;s office gets.</li>
            <li> I bought this after my wife blood pressure was running a bit high.&lt;br /&gt;We have made some changes to his diet and lifestyle, and have been using this to track the progress.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to use and practically fool proof.&lt;br /&gt;I also like the ease of use and light that changes from color scale green to red when your arm is in the correct position to get an correct accurate reading every time.&lt;br /&gt;It is so convenient that she checks his pressure several times a day with no problems and I don&#x27;t have to bug her to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my wife and she tells me that she&#x27;s satisfied with it. It performs flawlessly every time and the readout is well laid out. The size is very compact and the battery life is quite impressive, given that the pump inflates the bladder quite rapidly. I don&#x27;t give this item 5 stars because the user interface is not as accommodating for non-techie people.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s doctor keeps asking him if he has been monitoring his blood pressure. Ummmm, with as much as he works how is he supposed to do that? We didn&#x27;t even realize that there was a small, affordable gadget out there like this.  It comes in a nice little protective case.  It&#x27;s easy to use and small enough to throw in a purse or bag.  Won&#x27;t his doctor be surprised when he can answer her question with a &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34; next time!</li>
            <li> No more running to the drug store to test my blood pressure! Very handy for other high blood pressure people out there. So glad I got this!</li>
            <li> This cuff works very well. Easy to use and very accurate. Would have been 5 stars if it had come with batteries. I might have gotten the odd box, because it mentions batteries on the side of the box. Either way it works great. Super easy instructions.</li>
            <li> Seems to be very accurate and works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact it is smaller then other monitors and easy to store away.</li>
            <li> All I can say is, all of this for $40!!!!  The concept is sooooo easy and operating it is just as simple.  I purchased this to make sure I keep a nice keen eye on my health.  Whether its after a workout or not.  I hands down give this product 5 stars.  I wish there were more to give!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like how simple and accurate this wrist blood pressure machine works.  I have an old one brand name one at home that works when it wants and never gives accurate readings.  This one is very accurate and it even has the date and time and super easy to use.  Will be purchasing another for my parents soon.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I love it so much. Thanks for the fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This little blood pressure monitor was working great especially for such low price. I would have given it 5 stars but the velcro on the armband fell off a few days after I received it, it was nothing a little superglue couldn&#x27;t fix, but it was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for my husband easy to read and use. Thanks for offering it. It adds a piece of mind to our home.</li>
            <li> This is great for everyday use. Sometimes you need to know so you&#x27;re not worried. Even in public this monitor is not a distraction. Unfortunately we all have some heart problems in my family so it will be a shared experience for all. I&#x27;d recommend this to all my family and friends.</li>
            <li> Product is unreliable.  This comment is necessary to add into the review because I have now used the monitor for some time...UNFORTUNATELY...there is a problem with the wrist band.  The gripper is a velco attachment and is glued to the wrist band cloth material.  I did not realize this would be a problem, but it is.    The gripper will not stay glued to the material.  I don&#x27;t have access to a sewing machine to stitch it on.  The constant pull of using the wrist monitor has pulled the gripper off.  I tried to glue it back on, but it still doesn&#x27;t hold.  I am using it now with rubber bands around the bracelet to keep the patch on tight enough to use the monitor.    I am not happy with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.     http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IQN770Y/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Accurate. Liked the irregular  heart rate icon. Only con has been difficulty switching from one saved group back to previous group.</li>
            <li> Super compact, comes with a nice little case to keep it in. Reads fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with my blood pressure so much so I made a trip to the ER last week. The doctor suggested I check my bp every hour for the next few days. I pulled out an old battery operated upper arm cuff. It was like torture. It squeezed so tight I wanted to screem. After a day of this I had enough. I went on line and found out about the wrist cuff.&lt;br /&gt;This was the best thing I could have done. Not only is it easy to use, easy to set up and easy to store, but it is painless and accurate. It comes in a little carrying case, so it&#x27;s great to travel with. I highly recommend for anyone who is small boned, sensitive and bruise easily. Thank you for such a great product!</li>
            <li> Use it as directed and this device will flag when your BP is out of control. My experience is that the reading tends to be about 10 mm low but is at least consistent. This thing has earned its place on my desktop and will continue to be there as long as maintains the level of accuracy it has so far. After all I wanted it just to let me know when the BP is out of whack.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t think this would work. I&#x27;ve used it a few times and it seems to consistent with its readings. Easy to use, convenient and I would recommend it for anyone&#x27;s use!</li>
            <li> This BP monitor gives false and unrealistically high readings. I bought it in part because of the good reviewsI read and because of its portability. Used it for 3 days, almost went to the ER because it gave me a reading of 206/93 when in fact my BP was normal at my doctor&#x27;s office. And yes, I used it correctly.</li>
            <li> Blood pressure is a problem each person goes through their life time. Its always good to keep your blood pressure checked every few days. But who has time to go to the doctor. This is where the wrist blood pressure monitor comes in very handy. It was so easy to set this device up and even easier to use. The display is nice and the text is large enough for people with less vision to also read and understand. All it takes is wrapping the device on your wrist and keep it on the same level as your chest for correct reading. A very good feature in this is that it stores your previous reading and so you can monitor your pressure. It also comes with a carrying case to prevent damage to the monitor when carrying it with you. I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
            <li> Very nice and convenient, Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby.  He uses it twice a day...works well and very accurate.</li>
            <li> I ordered 1 and received 2. Maybe this was a good thing because I tried one of them and found it defective so I tried the other one and found it was just as bad. They never fully deflated and kept inflating over and over again. It took 35 minutes to get any reading and then the reading was so low that I thought I was dead. I have used the cuff monitors for years so I DO know how to use them. Will buy another Brand as I am returning these.</li>
            <li> This is so much more convenient to use than the traditional arm wrap pressure monitors that I have always used. I am really happy with this new monitor.</li>
            <li> This monitor is all that it says it is. Don&#x27;t let the small size fool you. It comes with a plastic carry case, which is perfect for storage and traveling. The monitor easily Velcro&#x27;s onto your wrist securely. Blood pressure readings only take a few second and the numbers on the screen  are easily read. I particularly like the color indicator on the side of the face. When the BP reading is complete a LED arrow on the screen points to a corresponding the color (green, yellow, orange or red) to let you know where your BP falls on the scale, green good red dangerous. I&#x27;m glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I have to keep resetting the unit to get an actual reading.  Better than nothing I guess</li>
            <li> This is the second one I purchased, since it was easy to use and results seem reliable.</li>
            <li> great monitor very quick and right on readings.</li>
            <li> This little monitor is just great. You can set it for the date and time and for two groups taking measurements separately. An irregular heartbeat symbol will appear if your heart beat is 25% slower or faster two or more times than the average rhythm The LCD is very clear with the systolic and diastolic and the pulse rate in large letters.With the power off, pressing the set button will program the machine to indicate an average of the last three readings.Two AAA batteries come with the unit and when not in use it can tucked  into the handy small plastic container provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The monitor is very nicely made and the cuff will fit my extremely skinny wrist. The unit needs to be placed above the large bone at your wrist. When measuring you should raise your arm with the unit in place across your chest at heart level. You should also be seated.The readings compare very favorably with my Omron upper arm monitor but the wrist monitor is so much handier and allows you to take your pressure anywhere. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected.  Shipping took a long time.</li>
            <li> This product has been incredible and the travel case is a HUGE PLUS.  It&#x27;s actually why I purchased it over another wrist monitor.  It has served me well during my busy travel schedule.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about writing down the results every time. I can scroll through and write later.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use, this wrist cuff BP monitor is accurate and easy to read. I recently compared it to a conventional BP cuff at my doctor&#x27;s office and the readings were only one or two numbers off. Very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> Readings seem inconsistent.</li>
            <li> The reading is too low to be credible. I just have to return it.</li>
            <li> Works great,  very accurate</li>
            <li> Such an easy way to take and monitor your blood pressure and heart rate. The company I bought it from also sent me an e-mail on the proper use of the monitor which was very helpful. You have to make sure it is on your wrist tightly and above your wrist bone to get an accurate reading. I would recommend this to anyone ( even if you have small wrists as it is adjustable) and is very easy to use and to read.</li>
            <li> Inconsistent and inaccurate readings.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed to find out that this monitor is not very accurate.  Compared to reliable readings with arm-cuff monitors, this device consistently registers 20-30 pts higher on systolic and 5-10 higher on diastolic.  Not a reliable BP monitor.</li>
            <li> Works great!  No problems. I got it several months ago.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend, not accurate even when following instructions.</li>
            <li> easy to use  when placed correctly on the wrist gives accurate readings</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best blood pressure cuff i have ever used.  I am a nurse and I get 12 blood pressures 3 days of the week, more than once a shift.  The reason I only gave this 2 stars is because I have only had this blood pressure cuff for 3 months and the velcro ripped off, faulty glue!!! I was going to try to sew it back on, but there is metal in the cuff and I cant get a needle through it.  Might try to glue it back on, but right now it just sits in my nursing bag - unusable.&lt;br /&gt;This pumps up very fast and give a quick accurate reading.</li>
            <li> Really iffy readings.  I have my doubts about it&#x27;s accuracy.</li>
            <li> This little unit is easy to use and seems to read the same as the Dr.&#x27;s office. I&#x27;m very happy and would recommend this product to anyone who need a simple way to keep a check on their BP.</li>
            <li> easy to use, easy to read.  Wished you could adjust the blood pressure cuff inflation lower than 190 for readings</li>
            <li> Great product, I love it! I had problems at first but after reading the instructions problems solved themselves.</li>
            <li> Muy bueno el equipo y es de muy fácil operación.</li>
            <li> This works just as stated.</li>
            <li> Bought this to keep track of my hubby&#x27;s bp numbers. Once we figured out how to use it getting accurate readings are a breeze.</li>
            <li> Gives me a peace of mind!  It&#x27;s so easy to use and helps me make smart decisions regarding my health.  Thank you for a wonderful product</li>
            <li> I got this pressure monitor for my husband. He is always so stress and travelling all the time. This monitor is great because is small and portable. He could take it with him always and check this high pressure any time.&lt;br /&gt;He always wanted a pressure monitor and this one is perfect for him! I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have high blood pressure and live in panic mode.. I often run up to the drug store to use there free blood pressure machine.. Not anymore!!! SO convenient and very accurate.. thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure how accurate it is, but it&#x27;s very consistent in its readings.  Easy to use and I like that it keeps a record of the readings and that two people can share it and keep track of their results.  I would recommend this to my friends.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as needed. Simple to use. Follow the directions and you&#x27;ll get consistent readings. I have large arms and the regular cuffs never work well for me.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use. The numbers are big and easy to read. The case is compact and easy to travel with. The only &amp;#34;oops&amp;#34; were the 2 dead batteries enclosed in the package.</li>
            <li> Even using the instructions carefully, the variations in BP from other more expensive units are way off the mark. It does fit nicely on thinner wrists but that is no tradeoff for accuracy.  Get an Omron and save your money and time.  BTW, this one read HIGHER for us, not lower than other cuffs.  I am returning in hope of refund.</li>
            <li> This blood pressure monitor is great! It&#x27;s simple to use, the number display is large and clear and it fits my skinny wrist!</li>
            <li> Works great. Accurate compared to my others and much faster to inflate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This BP monitor is great. First, the reading is accurate. Second, it is easy to set up/use, Finally, easy to carry. I bought it as gift for my parents. Since my father recently diagnosed with high blood pressure, as a licensed nurse,  I suggested him to check and monitor his BP twice a day or daily. Due to he likes travel, I purchased this small wrist BP monitor for him, because it is so to easy to carry to everywhere--just like to carry a denture box. I recommend this product for people who have high blood pressure and need close monitor their BP. Also the price is great!</li>
            <li> After receiving this monitor &amp;#34;I LOVE IT&amp;#34;!!! It is fast as compared to any other I have ever used. It is accurate and has large easy to read numbers.  It inflates and is complete in seconds not minutes like others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are pushed for time and have kids that don&#x27;t understand you need to sit quiet and still till it is done, then this is for you!</li>
            <li> I love this handy, convenient digital wrist blood pressure monitor!  It is the perfect size...doesn&#x27;t take up much space, comes in a great little carry case.  Perfect for anyone and everyone...easy to toss in your briefcase and monitor at the office, throw in your gym bag and monitor before and after your work out, toss in your purse and monitor wherever you go!  So easy and so convenient!  Thanks for this great product!!!</li>
            <li> BEST,BEST,BESTTTTTTTTTTTT</li>
            <li> no more pinch arm cuffs, wanting cry when they inflate and then half the time getting an inaccurate reading...this wrist monitor has changed my life.  I am a person who needs to check my blood pressure on a daily basis and I really need something accurate and easy to use and finally after trying a lot of other home blood pressure monitors I found one that is all of those things.  I love this device...it is a lifesaver...literally</li>
            <li> This is a good home wrist blood pressure monitor.  The monitor comes in a box, and inside that box is a separate plastic case for you to store the monitor at home - such as on a kitchen counter or nightstand.  The instructions are clear.  It requires 2 AAA batteries that were not included, so I provided my own.  The machine performed according to instructions and I was happy with how simple and easy the readings were to see.  There is a memory feature which allows you to keep track of your readings over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that the battery housing cover felt a bit loose when I inserted the batteries and actually fell off during one reading - that could be an issue for the future - but the housing cover is just a cosmetic feature and its presence or absence has no effect on the unit&#x27;s function.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve checked my BP at home for years &amp; I have a nice BIG upper arm BP cuff! Still works but I&#x27;ve seen these used at the doctors &amp; dentist office &amp; decided to try. It&#x27;s pretty small, quiet &amp; fast. Compared with my other BP machine with repeatable values! Great price!</li>
            <li> I have had the monitor for only a few days.  At first I was concerned that it did not actually display my blood pressure.  I have been on bp medicine for 30 years--since my Marine Corps Reserve physical discovered slightly elevated bp.  Since then my bp has been controlled by meds.  Several months ago I went to the doctor and my bp was higher than it has been.  It happened again a month ago and I ordered this monitor.  It has been the bearer of bad news.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It arrived in good time.  It is easy to use and consistently shows that my bp is elevated.  I think the likelihood of malfunction is in my body, not the monitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a few more days I&#x27;ll call the doctor if this keeps up.  I guess I&#x27;ll get stronger medicine or regular bloodlettings or something.</li>
            <li> I bought this monitor for my husband who was not happy with other BP monitors.  He loves it and likes the convenience of carrying it in its small case.  It is very compact but fits small and large wrists  My husband is a tall man with big bones and I am complete opposite - We have both used the monitor and like the product.</li>
            <li> Mom loves the blood pressure monitor</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product. The trouble is there are just too many &#x27;error&#x27; results when using it. It doesn&#x27;t matter how you hold your arm, it will work on average 1 time out of 4. I went ahead and bought an above-the-elbow version of a blood pressure monitor by Panasonic for about the same price and haven&#x27;t had a single error result. If the unit worked well, I love the fact that it has a memory function that stores the date and time, and the color-coded scale on the left lets you know instantly how good or bad the news is for your pressure. Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck... and since its covered by Amazon, returns are hassle-free.</li>
            <li> Just kept pumping up without giving a reading. Two different people tried it, at different times, and never got a BP reading.</li>
            <li> Awesome and accurate! Easy to use</li>
            <li> Very simple to use.  I like the scale on the left side that immediately compares BP results to the WHO standard; very useful if you are like me and don&#x27;t have that memorized (who does...).</li>
            <li> Excellent device! Easy to use and seems to very accurate. Also well priced for what you get.. Rich Robins, Salt Lake City, Utah</li>
            <li> Works well . Pretty accurate readings</li>
            <li> Junk! Guessing would be more accurate. one reading says 220sys / 170 dia. Next reading says 80/30.  Maybe I&#x27;m dead?</li>
