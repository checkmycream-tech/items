            <li>It&#x27;s also great for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li>I feel good about purchasing a product that is good for the community, safe for the environment, and healthy for my family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never felt this strongly about a shampoo before, honestly!</li>
            <li>Good price, good brand, gets the kids clean and gets them to take baths.</li>
            <li>The smell is very mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of this soap and it&#x27;s good to my kids skin, but the top was busted off in shipping</li>
            <li>so you dont have to worry about smelling like lavender all day, though I think that would be nice :)</li>
            <li>I happily use on my baby too, but hes 14 and like axe; )  </li>
            <li>It is very well priced and works great.  </li>

            <li>This was just ok.</li>
            <li>Love the company and it&#x27;s goals, mission and accomplishments.</li>
            <li>Both of my girls love the smell of lavender now.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!  :-)</li>
            <li>Really love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I really love this brand of soap.</li>
            <li>I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get the scent that I ordered but what I did get was OK..</li>
            <li>All in all, this is one of my favorite baby finds.</li>
            <li>We love this soap.</li>
            <li>Later that night she came to my door so happy!</li>
            <li>and it got static.</li>
            <li>Bought for a dog with fleas and senstive skin-if it&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I even purchased a $300 UVB wand to begin light therapy treatment!  </li>
            <li>We LOVE this Shampoo &amp; Body Wash for our daughter.</li>
            <li>It suds up nicely and the smell is really mild of herby lemon and lavender.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job with their hair too leaving it soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and the ingredients are more natural than most shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It works so well to get hers clean!</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s made in Olympia, WA (a place I love and love supporting!)</li>
            <li>Kind of pricey, but worth</li>
            <li>This stuff is creamy and smooth, works great on my daughters sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My youngest son has very mild eczema</li>
            <li>It rinses easily which is a plus</li>
            <li>it smells lovely, get their hair clean</li>
            <li>, it was a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>We love it so much that I had to try the lotion, and I love love it.</li>
            <li>a long ways Nice that it&#x27;s fair trade.</li>
            <li>I have since used the shampoo on my son&#x27;s hair and body (and I&#x27;ve shaved my legs with it), and it was fine for those jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t the best but once rinsed and dried you&#x27;re left with a much more pleasant scent on the skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>It is not tear free but not an issue with my son, as we don&#x27;t get any in his eyes.</li>
            <li>another reviewer noted, it&#x27;s not tear free.</li>
            <li>I feel good about using this on all my kids&#x27; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It smells nice, lathers nicely, and seems very moisturizing and gentle.  </li>
            <li>I love that its fair trade certified and some of the proceeds go back to Togo.  </li>
            <li>We enjoyed this soap very much and when I say we</li>
            <li>/&gt;Is great as both a Shampoo and a Soap leaving virtually no residue other than a very mild fragrance that is 100%</li>
            <li>Hair comes out clean but not striped feeling.</li>
            <li>After I started washing my face with a natural baby soap, I started using it as my body wash too and realized how much better my skin felt!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing natural product for babies and toddlers with a convenient pump.  </li>
            <li>I like how a percentage of every purchase goes toward a worthy cause</li>
            <li>/&gt;Never once caused a rash on our newborn Children, very gentle Soap!  </li>
            <li>I love washing my 20 month old with it!</li>
            <li>I love that every ingredient is recognizable and checks out safe in the skin deep database.</li>
            <li>and I like that the lavender helps calm the children during their bath.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>all Natural and free of all that stuff that causes Cancer in California!  </li>
            <li>Love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li>As a body wash, it leaves me feeling clean and fresh, although there isn&#x27;t much lather.  </li>
            <li>Alaffia&#x27;s formulaters  must be well educated as they put everything you&#x27;d want in all the right % in it.  </li>
            <li>I try to avoid those chemicals, so I live with the non-tear free products.</li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair nice, my daughters hair was dry after using it.</li>
            <li>Actually Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo burned my eyes in the shower more than this Soap did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light and leaves her skin and hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li>After lots of research and many lifestyle changes I was on a mission to replace all my personal care products.</li>
            <li>I was in love instantly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty concentrated</li>
            <li>I ordered this product after I had tried and loved the Everyday Shea Shea Butter Conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Smells like California Baby and just as good for a lot less!</li>
            <li>They were nice enough to coontact the manufacurer who explained that shea butter in its natural state is brown.  </li>
            <li>Love the smell and how soft it keeps our kiddos&#x27; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product is pretty much everything you could want in a product.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s VERY mild, which I personally like because I find some baby products to have very cloying</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not tear free but that&#x27;s not a big deal</li>
            <li>but I didnt like how it much.</li>
            <li>so we aren&#x27;t getting as much.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I bought it on sale at whole foods (got the calming scent)  </li>
            <li>Her hair much better!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My daughter has stick straight blond hair.</li>
            <li>We also use it as soap and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Great addition for parents in areas with west nile, though I&#x27;d still use deet if outdoors for extended periods as the risks of WNV are so much worse than the posion.  </li>
            <li>gentle products and this one makes claims of being &amp;#34;extra gentle,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;nontoxic,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;handmade,&amp;#34; etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We try to use natural alternatives whenever possible, and as a biologist feel knowledgeable  and confident doing so.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell which is great for us since I actually hate lavendar smell.</li>
            <li>Why do babies get the special gentle soap when adults skin should be treated no differently?</li>
            <li>It absorbs fast, gentle on my sons skin and leaves it with a velvety soft feeling.</li>
            <li>so I have always been careful to buy gentle, chemical free products for him.  </li>
            <li>I had high hopes, which were dashed away the moment I rinsed this product from my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li>I started using it a few months ago when mine ran out, and frankly, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>More recently in the last month his skin has been completely inflamed-</li>
            <li>have a new Newborn</li>
            <li>Very sensitive skin in our family and</li>
            <li>I started using this for his first bath and still am 11 months later.  </li>
            <li>I found with other soaps we got my daughters hair too clean</li>
            <li>It left her hair dry and super tangled…so much so that the miracle conditioner couldn&#x27;t even take out the tangles.  </li>
            <li>The smell is mellow and natural.</li>
            <li>Once the color issue was cleared up, I began using it on my 3 year old son.  </li>
            <li>He has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I have to say I have been very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and does not irritate my boy&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>(we&#x27;re very close as our kids are around the same age)</li>
            <li>When I started to wash my 10-month old son&#x27;s hair with this stuff, he started to cry and scream in pain.  </li>
            <li>We are always skeptical of Soaps, this one proved so good we have been using it for over 2 years now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I realized that I bought my first bottle of this hideous product right before Christmas because I couldn&#x27;t find the Lil Goats Milk body wash that we usually use.  </li>
            <li>My hair is tangle free and combable when wet, soft and shiny when dry.  </li>
            <li>We rinse her hair with 4 small buckets of water and that is always more than enough.</li>
            <li>The scent is way too strong for my little ones, especially a baby.</li>
            <li>We were incredible disappointed with the tears and drama that came along with bath time that morning.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the pump top was defective.  </li>
            <li>The products are traceable and natural and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting weird things on my baby&#x27;s skin or my own.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been changing everything in our house for more natural products and I now realize how harsh the soaps you typically find in the stores are.</li>
            <li>My youngest daughter has sensitive skin (eczema) and this is the only thing I will use in her hair for her bath.  </li>
            <li>So we tried organic products and first used the everyday shea butter shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle and a little bit cheaper online vs our local Earth Fare.</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s slightly less gentle, I&#x27;d probably avoid using this with a newborn, but I have no hesitations of using it with a baby 6 months and up who is sitting upright in the tub.</li>

            <li> I love that its fair trade certified and some of the proceeds go back to Togo.  </li>
            <li> We enjoyed this soap very much and when I say we</li>
            <li> /&gt;Is great as both a Shampoo and a Soap leaving virtually no residue other than a very mild fragrance that is 100%</li>
            <li> Hair comes out clean but not striped feeling.</li>
            <li> After I started washing my face with a natural baby soap, I started using it as my body wash too and realized how much better my skin felt!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing natural product for babies and toddlers with a convenient pump.  </li>
            <li> I like how a percentage of every purchase goes toward a worthy cause</li>
            <li> /&gt;Never once caused a rash on our newborn Children, very gentle Soap!  </li>
            <li> I love washing my 20 month old with it!</li>
            <li> I love that every ingredient is recognizable and checks out safe in the skin deep database.</li>
            <li> and I like that the lavender helps calm the children during their bath.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> all Natural and free of all that stuff that causes Cancer in California!  </li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews</li>
            <li> As a body wash, it leaves me feeling clean and fresh, although there isn&#x27;t much lather.  </li>
            <li> Alaffia&#x27;s formulaters  must be well educated as they put everything you&#x27;d want in all the right % in it.  </li>
            <li> I try to avoid those chemicals, so I live with the non-tear free products.</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair nice, my daughters hair was dry after using it.</li>
            <li> Actually Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo burned my eyes in the shower more than this Soap did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes</li>
            <li> The fragrance is light and leaves her skin and hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> After lots of research and many lifestyle changes I was on a mission to replace all my personal care products.</li>
            <li> I was in love instantly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty concentrated</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I had tried and loved the Everyday Shea Shea Butter Conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Smells like California Baby and just as good for a lot less!</li>
            <li> They were nice enough to coontact the manufacurer who explained that shea butter in its natural state is brown.  </li>
            <li> Love the smell and how soft it keeps our kiddos&#x27; sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much everything you could want in a product.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s VERY mild, which I personally like because I find some baby products to have very cloying</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not tear free but that&#x27;s not a big deal</li>
            <li> but I didnt like how it much.</li>
            <li> so we aren&#x27;t getting as much.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I bought it on sale at whole foods (got the calming scent)  </li>
            <li> Her hair much better!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My daughter has stick straight blond hair.</li>
            <li> We also use it as soap and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Great addition for parents in areas with west nile, though I&#x27;d still use deet if outdoors for extended periods as the risks of WNV are so much worse than the posion.  </li>
            <li> gentle products and this one makes claims of being &amp;#34;extra gentle,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;nontoxic,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;handmade,&amp;#34; etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We try to use natural alternatives whenever possible, and as a biologist feel knowledgeable  and confident doing so.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell which is great for us since I actually hate lavendar smell.</li>
            <li> Why do babies get the special gentle soap when adults skin should be treated no differently?</li>
            <li> It absorbs fast, gentle on my sons skin and leaves it with a velvety soft feeling.</li>
            <li> so I have always been careful to buy gentle, chemical free products for him.  </li>
            <li> I had high hopes, which were dashed away the moment I rinsed this product from my daughters hair.  </li>
            <li> I started using it a few months ago when mine ran out, and frankly, my hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> More recently in the last month his skin has been completely inflamed-</li>
            <li> have a new Newborn</li>
            <li> Very sensitive skin in our family and</li>
            <li> I started using this for his first bath and still am 11 months later.  </li>
            <li> I found with other soaps we got my daughters hair too clean</li>
            <li> It left her hair dry and super tangled…so much so that the miracle conditioner couldn&#x27;t even take out the tangles.  </li>
            <li> The smell is mellow and natural.</li>
            <li> Once the color issue was cleared up, I began using it on my 3 year old son.  </li>
            <li> He has sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I have to say I have been very pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and does not irritate my boy&#x27;s sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> (we&#x27;re very close as our kids are around the same age)</li>
            <li> When I started to wash my 10-month old son&#x27;s hair with this stuff, he started to cry and scream in pain.  </li>
            <li> We are always skeptical of Soaps, this one proved so good we have been using it for over 2 years now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I realized that I bought my first bottle of this hideous product right before Christmas because I couldn&#x27;t find the Lil Goats Milk body wash that we usually use.  </li>
            <li> My hair is tangle free and combable when wet, soft and shiny when dry.  </li>
            <li> We rinse her hair with 4 small buckets of water and that is always more than enough.</li>
            <li> The scent is way too strong for my little ones, especially a baby.</li>
            <li> We were incredible disappointed with the tears and drama that came along with bath time that morning.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the pump top was defective.  </li>
            <li> The products are traceable and natural and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting weird things on my baby&#x27;s skin or my own.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been changing everything in our house for more natural products and I now realize how harsh the soaps you typically find in the stores are.</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter has sensitive skin (eczema) and this is the only thing I will use in her hair for her bath.  </li>
            <li> So we tried organic products and first used the everyday shea butter shampoo and body wash.</li>
            <li> It is very gentle and a little bit cheaper online vs our local Earth Fare.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s slightly less gentle, I&#x27;d probably avoid using this with a newborn, but I have no hesitations of using it with a baby 6 months and up who is sitting upright in the tub.</li>
            <li> My son is a little sensitive with soaps and lotions, he gets red spots and itch on regular baby soaps and lotions like aveno and j&amp;j.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because during the winter I had to switch to a creamier wash to help with baby&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> my skin is so dry, and I have searching for a long time for a body wash that would moisturize my skin - I finally found it!  </li>
            <li> Got it for the grand-kids, they absolutely love it, which isnt such a big deal unless you knew how much they hated baths before.</li>
            <li> All you have to do is lean baby back and carefully rinse their hair.</li>
            <li> This does and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and don&#x27;t have any problems with this product.  </li>
            <li> so it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The kids are not bathed daily due to dry skin issues.)</li>
            <li> and it does help my son with his dry skin</li>
            <li> None of them has had a single problem.</li>
            <li> Used on myself after nasty sunburn,  and it  was soothing and smelled great.  </li>
            <li> but it left my girls curly hair feeling limp and waxy.</li>
            <li> I had another pump on a neary empty lotion bottle</li>
            <li> I have spent $$$$ trying to treat him with difference creams, oils, vitamins, probiotics, dietary changes, seaweed baths, etc.  </li>
            <li> Over the past couple of months his skin has been irritated but I chalked it up to cold, dry weather and eating too many trigger foods like citrus, strawberries, pineapple.  </li>
            <li> week my older son complained that the Everyday Shea burned his skin-</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Will buy again and also look at other products in this line.</li>
            <li> I mean the entire family.</li>
            <li> I had previously tried the Bronners soap</li>
            <li> I wish the scent was a little stronger and lasted longer though.</li>
            <li> Smells yummy and a little goes</li>
            <li> This works well for cleaning my hair without being too harsh or drying.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not horribly strong.  </li>
            <li> daughter had frizzy mess of curls, it worked so well to get it under control!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s harsh and the smell isn&#x27;t too small.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of common allergies but also a lot of odd ones too</li>
            <li> NOTHING has ever irritated his skin in the past.  </li>
            <li> it has been a horrible past few weeks filled with worry!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not too hard to keep it out of the eyes.</li>
            <li> I put my hand over my sons eyes anyways because he doesn&#x27;t like the water to get in them and he hasn&#x27;t complained.</li>
            <li> This is because it doesn&#x27;t use benzos or other chemicals that basically numb the eye.</li>
            <li> This item is hard to find!  </li>
            <li> and this boy has skin that is tough as nails.  </li>
            <li> Plus a natural bug repellent!</li>
            <li> The soap is still usable, it&#x27;s just really hard to get out of the bottle, since it&#x27;s broken!!</li>
            <li> My nephew had a bad reaction to the Shea so he can&#x27;t use this brand.</li>
            <li> This product SUCKS!!!!  </li>
            <li> the worst it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an amazing natural product for babies and toddlers with a convenient pump.  It is very well priced and works great.  It smells good and it&#x27;s harsh and the smell isn&#x27;t too small.  This is the only baby shampoo/wash that I buy.</li>
            <li> The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because I wish it was organic. This shampoo and body wash works great. I&#x27;ve been using earth mama shampoo but it left my girls curly hair feeling limp and waxy. This cleans great with no residue! It&#x27;s not tear free but that&#x27;s not a big deal neither is earth mama. All you have to do is lean baby back and carefully rinse their hair. Not too hard to keep it out of the eyes. I use breast milk as her face wash because I wouldn&#x27;t want this on her face. Been doing this for 10 months and her skin looks great!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. You&#x27;ll need to pump more than you think, but it smells lovely and Im confident that its a safe product for my baby.</li>
            <li> Lathers up nice, smells beautiful.  I love washing my 20 month old with it!</li>
            <li> This was just ok. I didn&#x27;t like the eucalyptus smell, it was a bit strong.  I was expecting something milder. Also this isn&#x27;t a tear-free product I just assumed it was since it was for babies, but it&#x27;s not. So it irritated my babies eyes. I don&#x27;t use it for baby anymore. I sometimes use it as a wash for makeup removal when I can stand the smell. I like how a percentage of every purchase goes toward a worthy cause but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> Got it for the grand-kids, they absolutely love it, which isnt such a big deal unless you knew how much they hated baths before. Good price, good brand, gets the kids clean and gets them to take baths. Worth it.</li>
            <li> My son is a little sensitive with soaps and lotions, he gets red spots and itch on regular baby soaps and lotions like aveno and j&amp;j. So we tried organic products and first used the everyday shea butter shampoo and body wash. We love it so much that I had to try the lotion, and I love love it. It absorbs fast, gentle on my sons skin and leaves it with a velvety soft feeling. Never had those red spots and itch again</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this soap and it&#x27;s good to my kids skin, but the top was busted off in shipping and I never heard back from the shipping company after telling them about the damage.  The soap is still usable, it&#x27;s just really hard to get out of the bottle, since it&#x27;s broken!!</li>
            <li> Love the product! Love the company and it&#x27;s goals, mission and accomplishments. I also love that it&#x27;s made in Olympia, WA (a place I love and love supporting!)</li>
            <li> My youngest daughter has sensitive skin (eczema) and this is the only thing I will use in her hair for her bath.  It never dries out her skin and it smells WONDERFUL...lavender and all kinds of yumminess.  Both of my girls love the smell of lavender now.</li>
            <li> my skin is so dry, and I have searching for a long time for a body wash that would moisturize my skin - I finally found it!  I had a couple of samples of this, and I was hooked!  This item is hard to find!  Kind of pricey, but worth it not having to moisturize my skin after showering. Great feel - moisturizing but doesn&#x27;t leave a film</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! It is very gentle and a little bit cheaper online vs our local Earth Fare. I wish the scent was a little stronger and lasted longer though.</li>
            <li> This works well for cleaning my hair without being too harsh or drying. The smell is pleasant and the ingredients are more natural than most shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> We are always skeptical of Soaps, this one proved so good we have been using it for over 2 years now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never once caused a rash on our newborn Children, very gentle Soap!  No Allergy Issues as it is 100% all Natural and free of all that stuff that causes Cancer in California!  :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is great as both a Shampoo and a Soap leaving virtually no residue other than a very mild fragrance that is 100% Natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have a new Newborn and it is working great on her!  No fear for the Eyes, won&#x27;t cause any damage or burns!  Actually Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo burned my eyes in the shower more than this Soap did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes Great Bubble Bath too!  Enjoy!  :-)</li>
            <li> I love this body wash for my baby! I started using this for his first bath and still am 11 months later.  The smell is very mild and pleasant.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because during the winter I had to switch to a creamier wash to help with baby&#x27;s dry skin.</li>
            <li> I use the chamomile scented version of this product for my child and I&#x27;m very happy with it. The fragrance is light and leaves her skin and hair feeling soft. I feel good about purchasing a product that is good for the community, safe for the environment, and healthy for my family.</li>
            <li> I feel good about using this on all my kids&#x27; sensitive skin. (Disclaimer: The kids are not bathed daily due to dry skin issues.) None of them has had a single problem. Works great on our fine hair. I started using it a few months ago when mine ran out, and frankly, my hair has never looked better. Whatever recipe they&#x27;re using is great for our hair. The smell is mellow and natural. I will probably start buying this in bulk. I&#x27;ve never felt this strongly about a shampoo before, honestly! It rocks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is creamy and smooth, works great on my daughters sensitive skin. However it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair nice, my daughters hair was dry after using it. Works great as a body wash.</li>
            <li> Really love this stuff. It&#x27;s gentle and effective. You only need a pea sized amount. Leaves baby smelling great. A tiny bit of foam got in her eye yesterday and she didn&#x27;t even cry.</li>
            <li> My son has multiple allergies as well as a history of severe eczema. This is the ONLY body wash/sampoo I will use on him. He has no signs of eczema.</li>
            <li> After lots of research and many lifestyle changes I was on a mission to replace all my personal care products. After I started washing my face with a natural baby soap, I started using it as my body wash too and realized how much better my skin felt! I had previously tried the Bronners soap but I didnt like how it much. I saw this stuff at my local Sprouts one day and opened it to smell. I was in love instantly. Why do babies get the special gentle soap when adults skin should be treated no differently? I was so happy to find it lathered on my loofa and held up a good amount to scrub all over without having to add more. It smells wonderful but it doesnt stick to you so you dont have to worry about smelling like lavender all day, though I think that would be nice :)</li>
            <li> Very sensitive skin in our family and this has not bothered any of us. It also smells great.</li>
            <li> I really love this brand of soap. Smells yummy and a little goes a long ways Nice that it&#x27;s fair trade. They recently started selling them in smaller bottles but the price stayed the same so we aren&#x27;t getting as much. Beware though if you have nut sensitivities / allergies. My nephew had a bad reaction to the Shea so he can&#x27;t use this brand.</li>
            <li> I like this product, but would prefer it not be scented. The scent is way too strong for my little ones, especially a baby.</li>
            <li> I called Amazon after I received it because it&#x27;s a brown color. They were nice enough to coontact the manufacurer who explained that shea butter in its natural state is brown.  Once the color issue was cleared up, I began using it on my 3 year old son.  It smells nice, lathers nicely, and seems very moisturizing and gentle.  It is not tear free but not an issue with my son, as we don&#x27;t get any in his eyes. I love it and will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get the scent that I ordered but what I did get was OK..</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this on my grandson. He has sensitive skin.Now I use it  also. It lathers very nicely, rinses easy. Leaves my skin moisturized. The value is very good. Love the natural ingredients. Fast shipping. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> this product always delivers and gives to charity</li>
            <li> I bought this after finding out my beloved J&amp;J has petrochemicals in it.  I guess the baby induced lack of sleep kept my head in the sand as others have known this for years.  Oh well.  I bought it on sale at whole foods (got the calming scent)  and I have to say I have been very pleasantly surprised.  I lathers great, smells way better than J&amp;J and is cheaper than the Burt&#x27;s bees I was using.  My only complaint is the pump top was defective.  I had another pump on a neary empty lotion bottle so I swapped that out.  I love that its fair trade certified and some of the proceeds go back to Togo.  Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty much everything you could want in a product. It&#x27;s affordable at 16oz for $6.99 which is way below competing products like Burts Bees or California Baby. It&#x27;s fair trade and 10% of the sales go back to Togo for their sustainable community. The products are traceable and natural and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m putting weird things on my baby&#x27;s skin or my own. It suds up nicely and the smell is really mild of herby lemon and lavender. But it&#x27;s VERY mild, which I personally like because I find some baby products to have very cloying smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer noted, it&#x27;s not tear free. This is because it doesn&#x27;t use benzos or other chemicals that basically numb the eye. I try to avoid those chemicals, so I live with the non-tear free products. Because it&#x27;s slightly less gentle, I&#x27;d probably avoid using this with a newborn, but I have no hesitations of using it with a baby 6 months and up who is sitting upright in the tub. I put my hand over my sons eyes anyways because he doesn&#x27;t like the water to get in them and he hasn&#x27;t complained. When we used another product (Shea Moisture) that had similar ingredients, he cried when it got in his eyes so I know he didn&#x27;t like it. All in all, this is one of my favorite baby finds.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  It&#x27;s all natural and does not irritate my boy&#x27;s sensitive skin.  It does have a botanical smell that may not be for everyone but it&#x27;s not horribly strong.  It does a very good job with their hair too leaving it soft and clean.  Some shampoo and body wash combos do not do a good job on hair.  This does and the bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> We love this soap. My neighbor asked to borrow soap one night (we&#x27;re very close as our kids are around the same age) and I just handed her my jug of soap and conditioner. Later that night she came to my door so happy! She said &amp;#34;SO SO GOOD! Her hair much better!&amp;#34; Then handed me money to buy them some!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her daughter had frizzy mess of curls, it worked so well to get it under control! They&#x27;re Middle Eastern. My daughter has stick straight blond hair. It works so well to get hers clean! We also use it as soap and is very moisturizing. I found with other soaps we got my daughters hair too clean and it got static. This works perfect. The conditioner is a must have though</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE the scent!! A little bit goes a long way</li>
            <li> Smells like California Baby and just as good for a lot less!</li>
            <li> We try to use natural alternatives whenever possible, and as a biologist feel knowledgeable  and confident doing so. Bought for a dog with fleas and senstive skin-if it&#x27;s okay for  human newborns shouldn&#x27;t cause him harm.  Has neem which is anti bacterial/fungal and repells bugs.  Alaffia&#x27;s formulaters  must be well educated as they put everything you&#x27;d want in all the right % in it.  I happily use on my baby too, but hes 14 and like axe; )  Great addition for parents in areas with west nile, though I&#x27;d still use deet if outdoors for extended periods as the risks of WNV are so much worse than the posion.  Used on myself after nasty sunburn,  and it  was soothing and smelled great.  Will buy again and also look at other products in this line.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo and body wash for adults.  I have long hair and don&#x27;t have any problems with this product.  I follow up with an apple cider vinegar rinse.  My hair is tangle free and combable when wet, soft and shiny when dry.  As a body wash, it leaves me feeling clean and fresh, although there isn&#x27;t much lather.  It&#x27;s also great for a smooth shave.</li>
            <li> I rarely write reviews but I felt a responsibility to warn others of this product.  My youngest son has very mild eczema so I have always been careful to buy gentle, chemical free products for him.  Over the past couple of months his skin has been irritated but I chalked it up to cold, dry weather and eating too many trigger foods like citrus, strawberries, pineapple.  More recently in the last month his skin has been completely inflamed- the worst it has ever been.  I have spent $$$$ trying to treat him with difference creams, oils, vitamins, probiotics, dietary changes, seaweed baths, etc.  I even purchased a $300 UVB wand to begin light therapy treatment!  I have had sleepless nights and logged hours on the internet trying to figure out what was happening with his skin- it has been a horrible past few weeks filled with worry!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week my older son complained that the Everyday Shea burned his skin- and this boy has skin that is tough as nails.  He has never had eczema, or a diaper rash as a baby; he doesn&#x27;t sunburn- NOTHING has ever irritated his skin in the past.  Then I realized that I bought my first bottle of this hideous product right before Christmas because I couldn&#x27;t find the Lil Goats Milk body wash that we usually use.  I NEVER thought the soap would be the problem because I ALWAYS but gentle products and this one makes claims of being &amp;#34;extra gentle,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;nontoxic,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;handmade,&amp;#34; etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I immediately discontinued using this product last Thursday and 5 days later his skin is 60% HEALED!!!!!!  This product SUCKS!!!!  DO NOT BUY IT!!!!  IT IS HORRIBLE!!!!!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product after I had tried and loved the Everyday Shea Shea Butter Conditioner.  I had high hopes, which were dashed away the moment I rinsed this product from my daughters hair.  It left her hair dry and super tangled…so much so that the miracle conditioner couldn&#x27;t even take out the tangles.  We were incredible disappointed with the tears and drama that came along with bath time that morning.  I have since used the shampoo on my son&#x27;s hair and body (and I&#x27;ve shaved my legs with it), and it was fine for those jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product for girls hair, especially ladies with curly or wavy hair.</li>
            <li> We LOVE this Shampoo &amp; Body Wash for our daughter. We have been using it on her for almost 4 years for both body and hair. I love that every ingredient is recognizable and checks out safe in the skin deep database. It doesn&#x27;t have a super strong smell which is great for us since I actually hate lavendar smell. It rinses easily which is a plus if your child is like mine who hates hair washing. We rinse her hair with 4 small buckets of water and that is always more than enough. Hair comes out clean but not striped feeling. The only drawback is the color. Don&#x27;t let the brown color turn you off! Great Product!</li>
            <li> My daughter has a lot of common allergies but also a lot of odd ones too so we have to avoid a lot of ingredients often found in shampoos, etc.  Miraculously this shampoo fits the bill - it smells lovely, get their hair clean and I like that the lavender helps calm the children during their bath.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and how soft it keeps our kiddos&#x27; sensitive skin. Bonus - company supports a great cause!</li>
            <li> The best moisturizing kids wash! Plus a natural bug repellent!</li>
            <li> We enjoyed this soap very much and when I say we I mean the entire family. It&#x27;s pretty concentrated so it lasts a long time. The scent isn&#x27;t the best but once rinsed and dried you&#x27;re left with a much more pleasant scent on the skin. I&#x27;ve been changing everything in our house for more natural products and I now realize how harsh the soaps you typically find in the stores are.</li>
            <li> Do not use this product to bathe your baby.  While it doesn&#x27;t specifically say it&#x27;s tear-free, you&#x27;d think it was since it is marketed for babies and up.  When I started to wash my 10-month old son&#x27;s hair with this stuff, he started to cry and scream in pain.  Please don&#x27;t put your baby through that.  I&#x27;ll take Johnson&#x27;s Baby Shampoo any day if I never have to see him go through that again.</li>
            <li> smell great and it does help my son with his dry skin</li>
