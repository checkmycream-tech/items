            <li>she loved it and suggested to classmates to purchase one.</li>
            <li>Pricey but a fairly comprehensive collection of make-up.</li>
            <li>Daughter in law loved this gift for her birthday.</li>
            <li>She is very pleased with it, here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loved the many, many varieties in colors and was so happy it was Sephora--exactly what she hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>Attractive case easy to store or just leave out on display.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast and it arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>My wife was thrilled when I got it for her.</li>
            <li>Shipped in excellent condition and very timely.  </li>
            <li>But you quickly realize the transformer nature of it and it is simply perfect for teenage girls who are sure to apply their makeup to lay around the house!!  </li>
            <li>wouldnt as for anything better.</li>
            <li>Im in love with this parlette</li>
            <li>and I know she&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li>I love all the colors .</li>
            <li>It has everything a women needs, so she doesn&#x27;t have to buy more things.</li>
            <li>You get enough of each color without feeling ripped off and they are awesome!</li>
            <li>This was the favorite of our daughter and nieces this year.</li>
            <li>Our girls love this.  </li>
            <li>As it turns out the cube design is excellent for storing this array when they have completed their facial masterpieces.  </li>
            <li>Its a great product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>The colors are great and highly pigmented, and there are a ton of choices.</li>
            <li>Good product, fast shipping, lots of colours.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s perfect for someone who needs some variety of colors in their everyday life.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t because some of the eyeshadow broke, and i had to clean it up.</li>
            <li>Got this as a gift, pretty impressive set and much cheaper than in the local store.  </li>
            <li>Overall we a very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>Very compact and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>this product is worth every penny</li>
            <li>I guess that&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>However as I&#x27;ve used it, and lugged it around, that proves to be part of its charm.</li>
            <li>when it arrived it said right on the box 49.99 I feel kinda ripped off</li>
            <li>A favorite color would be used up after several uses.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t usually use make-up, but after getting this I find myself looking for excuses to dress up and use all the bright shadows and glosses.</li>
            <li>Easily fixable if I glue them back in.</li>
            <li>It was supposed to be good if not for the defect or mishandling of the product, I&#x27;m not sure of the real reason.</li>
            <li>I like it and it is more than what I expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very compact, and it has everything you need.</li>
            <li>THE SIZE ITS VERY CONFORTABLE,</li>
            <li>not a lot of product, very small, good for people that don&#x27;t use much makeup</li>
            <li>A little larger size for the eye shadows would have been nice.</li>
            <li>Not a bad collection, just not sure if it was worth the price.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I have a Sephora store near by and exchanged it with no problem.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 16 year old.</li>
            <li>This was a gift to my older teen granddaughter.  </li>
            <li>This is probably not for someone looking to do really thick heavy colors, like I said, great for everyday use and for the cost.</li>
            <li>just one note, one of the colors was totally broken and missed the other colors, other than that i loved the kit</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I saw this in Sephora when I went to buy a few last mi ute items and 2 people were in line buying this as well for their daughter and mother-in-law!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Color range covers a wide spectrum for experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes</li>
            <li> but i dont do my make up everyday</li>
            <li> One of the colors in the pallette was missing and the powder was all over the box.</li>
            <li> and she loves it, uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> and i know pple say is small</li>
            <li> Small</li>
            <li> One of the pigments was broken and ruined all of the other eyeshadows, lip glosses, ect.</li>
            <li> the product arrived two days after the deadline and a shadow came broken and spread in some lipsticks and other shadows</li>
            <li> The pallets were very small.</li>
            <li> Too bad this is only 50$ on sephora.com</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sephora!</li>
            <li> What a shame, just too bad...</li>

            <li> Too bad this is only 50$ on sephora.com it&#x27;s a great palette though . I love all the colors . Perfect travel buddy</li>
            <li> I like it and it is more than what I expected. It has everything a women needs, so she doesn&#x27;t have to buy more things.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my gf and she flipped over lots abd lots of makeup. Tons of colors. The only downside is I paid $80 for this and when it arrived it said right on the box 49.99 I feel kinda ripped off but oh well she&#x27;s happy I guess that&#x27;s worth atleast thirty bucks</li>
            <li> My daughter had this on her wish list.  I believe she will be very happy with it.  Lots of variety in color.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it she is going to cosmotology school and loves this product. she loved it and suggested to classmates to purchase one.</li>
            <li> The product is great! You get enough of each color without feeling ripped off and they are awesome! You can&#x27;t go wrong with Sephora!</li>
            <li> Pricey but a fairly comprehensive collection of make-up.</li>
            <li> Initially when I received this I was taken back by how small it was. However as I&#x27;ve used it, and lugged it around, that proves to be part of its charm. It&#x27;s very compact, and it has everything you need. The colors are great and highly pigmented, and there are a ton of choices.</li>
            <li> IM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS ITEM, FOR THE PRICE IT IS THE BEST YOU CAN GET, AND THE SIZE ITS VERY CONFORTABLE, WELL DISTRIBUTED!!! AND THE BEST MAKEUP EVER</li>
            <li> I am using this to practice with make up.  I think it&#x27;s perfect for someone who needs some variety of colors in their everyday life.  Very compact and easy to store.  Sephora is great make up.  This is probably not for someone looking to do really thick heavy colors, like I said, great for everyday use and for the cost.</li>
            <li> Good product, fast shipping, lots of colours.  The only issue was that when I opened one of the items, 2 eye shadows fell out.  Easily fixable if I glue them back in.</li>
            <li> One of the pigments was broken and ruined all of the other eyeshadows, lip glosses, ect. Thankfully I have a Sephora store near by and exchanged it with no problem.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have a Sephora close to you or they are out of stock on this item it is the same they sell in the store. My wife was thrilled when I got it for her.</li>
            <li> I was looking to be amazed. I couldn&#x27;t because some of the eyeshadow broke, and i had to clean it up. Not a bad collection, just not sure if it was worth the price.</li>
            <li> She loves it, I don&#x27;t know why but this is something all women have been wanting this year. Small but expands once you open it. Amazing!</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 16 year old. It is small, compact yet very complete! It has shadows and lipsticks of every imaginable color! She loved it! I saw this in Sephora when I went to buy a few last mi ute items and 2 people were in line buying this as well for their daughter and mother-in-law! Great for everyone.</li>
            <li> This is awesome! I don&#x27;t usually use make-up, but after getting this I find myself looking for excuses to dress up and use all the bright shadows and glosses. Definitely recommend</li>
            <li> The pallets were very small. A favorite color would be used up after several uses.  A little larger size for the eye shadows would have been nice.</li>
            <li> This was the favorite of our daughter and nieces this year. Tons of colors and folds up to a portable square.</li>
            <li> just one note, one of the colors was totally broken and missed the other colors, other than that i loved the kit</li>
            <li> Our girls love this.  When it arrived I was concerned because  it is a cube.  But you quickly realize the transformer nature of it and it is simply perfect for teenage girls who are sure to apply their makeup to lay around the house!!  As it turns out the cube design is excellent for storing this array when they have completed their facial masterpieces.  Shipped in excellent condition and very timely.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Daughter in law loved this gift for her birthday.</li>
            <li> the product arrived two days after the deadline and a shadow came broken and spread in some lipsticks and other shadows</li>
            <li> I bougt this Sephora Blockbuster for my mom and she loved it! Its size is ideal for travel. Its a great product and highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my GF and she loves it, uses it everyday. The quality of the makeup is wonderful and the compact design of this product makes it really easy to travel with.</li>
            <li> I bought this item for my girlfriend so she can experiment with different colors. She is very pleased with it, here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The construction of the box is well made and open and closes easily.&lt;br /&gt;-It has ample colors and tools for application.&lt;br /&gt;-Color range covers a wide spectrum for experimentation.&lt;br /&gt;-Comes with a separate card indicating which items are for what purpose (lip gloss, eyeliner, etc.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this was a steal. Overall we a very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> This was a gift to my older teen granddaughter.  She was beyond thrilled!!  A definite home run by me!  She loved the many, many varieties in colors and was so happy it was Sephora--exactly what she hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> Was a Christmas gift. The person loved it and thinks it is the greatest gift ever.  Would definitely recommend this as a gift.</li>
