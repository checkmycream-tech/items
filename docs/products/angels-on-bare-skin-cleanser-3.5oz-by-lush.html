            <li>My skin looks AWESOME since I started using this product!!</li>
            <li>I can see why this product is a Best Seller!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an absolutely perfect product for me.</li>
            <li>The bits are, in fact, lavender buds, and they give the cleanser a very pleasant lavender smell.  </li>
            <li>The smell of Angels is so great that I can&#x27;t resist using it all over my body, not just for my face.</li>
            <li>I just had to try this after seeing all the great reviews.</li>
            <li>been using it for over 10 years great stuff</li>
            <li>Love it !!</li>
            <li>It feels very nice going</li>
            <li>Good stuff, good stuff.</li>
            <li>This quite an honor for a cleanser which looks, by all accounts, fairly unassuming.  </li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>It feels good.</li>
            <li>It works good and it is good - about as good as it gets.</li>
            <li>I rather like the fresh lavender/herbal scent, but the scent is the best part.</li>
            <li>It is so refreshing while it&#x27;s on the skin, and smells great.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>The texture takes some getting used to (it has bits of plants and stuff it in), as does the smell, but once you&#x27;ve gotten over that the benefits are amazing.  </li>
            <li>It kind of smells like playdo-y oatmeal.</li>
            <li>I have found this cleanser is an effective cleanser but doesn&#x27;t aggravate either condition.</li>
            <li>I then wash it off with a warm washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face, I was so amazed at how wonderful it felt.  </li>
            <li>It sure feels nice to scrub it on--gently exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Angels on Bare Skin has the honor of being perhaps the best cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very important to follow the directions for using Angels-</li>
            <li>on- like a very light exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I am getting married in June and it seems I have made the right choice for perfectly glowing skin, even before the summer days begun!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>so maybe if you don&#x27;t, you will find that this product works better for you.</li>
            <li>so I almost feel disloyal leaving this review!  :-)</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love to use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li>The quality just looked much better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t just love and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>But my skin feels better than it did 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>Just lovely.</li>
            <li>Sure, it moisturizes, but it doesn&#x27;t control oil at all and doesn&#x27;t help blemishes..</li>
            <li>I love the branding and packaging and I love the results I am getting.</li>
            <li>As soon as I use Angels my skin feels so clean, so soft, and so perfect, I couldn&#x27;t wish for anything better.  </li>
            <li>i was pretty impressed that it really did visibly brighten my complexion.</li>
            <li>This is a great exfoliating scrub for my sensitive and breakout prone skin.  </li>
            <li>currently using this product with Imperialis moisturiser (great balancer) and Baby Face at night (fabulous!).</li>
            <li>I break out really easily</li>
            <li>Angels on Bare Skin (AOBS) is for all skin types, but it works great on my combination skin.  </li>
            <li>Although this is a weird-looking product, Angels is a pretty nice exfoliant.</li>
            <li>Not cleansing enough for me to use on its own (probably would be fine on its own for drier skin)</li>
            <li>But it is REALLY fabulous.  </li>
            <li>rub a bit of product between your palms and lightly scrub over your face.  </li>
            <li>Angels copes with it all and makes all of my face happy at the same time.</li>
            <li>The oils stay on and make you smooth.</li>
            <li>As someone else mentioned, it is important to rinse well with this product.</li>
            <li>AOBS is made with really soothing ingredients like rose and lavender, and it has ground almonds to help exfoliate your skin.  </li>
            <li>I so enjoy using this product on my face.</li>
            <li>It felt smooth and looked smooth in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I think that this is the absolute best facial cleanser on the market.  </li>
            <li>My skin was soft and looked like I had used a really good toner on it.</li>
            <li>After using it, my face is left very soft and cleansed perfectly.</li>
            <li>And best of all, I hardly ever break out when I am using it.</li>
            <li>LUSH has amazing skin products, so I&#x27;ll stick with FF and MoM.</li>
            <li>The scent is lite and refreshing and it provides gentle exfoliation without causing irritation.</li>
            <li>It is a lot more gentle than it looks.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to get a finger-sized scoop so that you can really get every part of it.</li>
            <li>I never understood the fuss until I invested in myself and purchased my own LUSH product.</li>
            <li>Honestly, for me, the results have been nothing less than amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is so incredibly mild</li>
            <li>acidic-ragweed was super over-powering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cleanser works wonders and leaves your face feeling super mosturized.</li>
            <li>so I follow with Fresh Farmacy.  </li>
            <li>I follow each wash up with the Breath of Fresh Air toner, and a non-Lush mosturizer.  </li>
            <li>I freaking love this stuff so far.</li>
            <li>have LOVED most other Lush products I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li>I love the clean and simple ingredients.</li>
            <li>This facial cleanser has a interesting smell and an even more interesting texture - a somewhat rough texture.   </li>
            <li>It made my face very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I most say like most other opinions of this product it is smelly and unattractive but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have good days.</li>
            <li>But wet your face with warm water...</li>
            <li>i, like others, use it in the shower first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li>well, it didn&#x27;t really work!  </li>
            <li>I had a problem at first trying to figure out the ratio of cleanser to water.  </li>
            <li>THe first time I used it I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I was hooked from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>My current cleanser was working okay, but there were still two problems that plagued my skin: milia and blackheads.     </li>
            <li>You have to be careful not to lose this product down the sink while you wash, but it makes your skin feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve been using this once daily for over a month, along with organic witch hazel with rose water and aloe, and ending with Lush celestial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re more dry, just scrub it on in the shower.</li>
            <li>I was quite interested in their fresh, all natural skin care cleansers.</li>
            <li>This is definatly a smart buy for the results.</li>
            <li>If your skin is more oily, scrub it gently onto your dry face and wipe off with a cloth.</li>
            <li>Light oatmealish scent and strange texture throw you off at first.  </li>
            <li>It does not impress me too much.</li>
            <li>Extremely gently on skin</li>
            <li>For a real treat for your face: mix up a 1 part Angels to 3 parts Coconut Almond Smoothie</li>
            <li>the fragrance really peps me.  </li>
            <li>It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>And really, I have to say again</li>
            <li>My skin had never felt so soft or looked so fresh.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It does a great job exfoliating my face without irritating my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get it, and when I popped open the container, this super-nast waft of ...</li>
            <li>I always needed something else to REALLY wash my face, so it made this product kind of pointless.  </li>
            <li>When I first discovered Lush</li>
            <li>I am a HUGE Lush fan ever since discovering them several years ago on a trip to London.</li>
            <li>It is extremly gentle, and has kept my face totally clear (not one blemish in tow months of use).  </li>
            <li>skin is really oily, and REALLY sensitive.</li>
            <li>The product does not really lather, but it does exfoliate and lightly cleanse.</li>
            <li>Angels on Bare Skin was the first product that I bought from the company when I was living in England.   </li>
            <li>It smeemed to have sloughed off the dead skin better than grittier soaps and scrubs.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin</li>
            <li>AoBS leaves my skin super soft and mosturized, without feeling oily or like it has a residue left on it.  </li>
            <li>In the mornings I put on a very very light moisturizer, so I haven&#x27;t had problems with drying out at all, but I&#x27;m not sure how it would be without.  </li>
            <li>also tried the cleanser on my rough knees, and they are now smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>, it was very soft.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like the scent of Angels on Bare Skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried regular towels, flannel, many scrubs, nothing, Cetaphyl only, scrubbing with face lotion, various oils, tweezers, yadda, yadda.</li>
            <li>Thank you again, LUSH!</li>
            <li>Lush!</li>
            <li>the method isn&#x27;t obvious at first.  </li>
            <li>Then, I proceeded to clean my face as I would w/ any other product.</li>
            <li>Yet I have gross fine dry skin that shows up when I put makeup on.</li>
            <li>It can be a little messy, so be prepared to use in the shower or to wipe down the sink, but this is one of the best cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin but this exfoliating cleanser is gentle enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li>I am nearly to the end of one pot and have not seen any noticeably improved results.</li>
            <li>For exfoliating, I recommend LUSH&#x27;s Ocean Salt over this product any day.</li>
            <li>My friend introduced me to Lush Products after spending a year in Oxford.  </li>
            <li>and it leaves your face baby&#x27;s bum soft.  </li>
            <li>It is so soft that I can even go without my mosturizer on warmer days.      </li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft immediately.  </li>
            <li>I have not found a Lush product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day!</li>
            <li>Notice - LUSH</li>
            <li>, the texture of the product (kind of crumbly, with bits of stuff in it) made it much harder to use than other facial cleansing products.  </li>
            <li>: Make sure you rinse well because the mosturizing oils in it go a long way and you only want a tiny bit left when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li>first glance the quantities are small and they all kind of had a base fragrance that kind of smelled like playdo.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s little chunks of almond in there to gently get rid of your dead skin, lavender buds to help it smell nice--which it does--and since you add the water to it yourself instead of it getting diluted at the factory, you get more for your money.</li>
            <li>I usually follow up this routine with a light moisturiser and a spritz or two of the Eau Roma toner to seal it in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a definite difference to my face without all the drying and over-oily affects I get from normal soaps.</li>
            <li>Usually I use a cleanser and a moisturizer in order to get a soft yet clean feeling.   </li>
            <li>This is LUSH&#x27;s 100% natural facial cleanser, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  </li>
            <li>I really recommend this product to all whom suffer from those dry days &amp; oily days!</li>
            <li>tried it right away on my face, which was a bit blemished, and right away I felt it react to my broken out skin.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this cleanser after reading countless glowing reviews on LUSH&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>I recently purchased a bunch of lush products having neither seen nor heard about the line before.</li>
            <li>Based on the site&#x27;s reviews, I decided to try Angels on Bare Skin.</li>
            <li>I gave it to my friend (who LOVES the way it smells), so maybe my nose is broken. :)</li>
            <li>My skin is calmer and smooth (I am very pale and my skin has a tendency to turn red and blotchy when irritated).</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s actually getting my face clean.</li>
            <li>I was interested in the reviews I read online and wanted to try out a few.  </li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>In only 2 weeks, I see a major difference in my skin and my overall complexion.</li>
            <li>I have dry skin that breaks out, and this cleanser makes my skin feel soft and has cleared up my breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Even though I have mature skin, I still have oily and dry patches.</li>
            <li>Take a little blob, add a few drops of water, make a paste, and smooth it on moistened skin.  </li>
            <li>product is very messy to use, but it&#x27;s powerful abilities to clear my face and soften all the rough spots forces me to give it 5 stars!</li>

            <li> This cleanser works wonders and leaves your face feeling super mosturized.</li>
            <li> so I follow with Fresh Farmacy.  </li>
            <li> I follow each wash up with the Breath of Fresh Air toner, and a non-Lush mosturizer.  </li>
            <li> I freaking love this stuff so far.</li>
            <li> have LOVED most other Lush products I&#x27;ve used...</li>
            <li> I love the clean and simple ingredients.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser has a interesting smell and an even more interesting texture - a somewhat rough texture.   </li>
            <li> It made my face very soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I most say like most other opinions of this product it is smelly and unattractive but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have good days.</li>
            <li> But wet your face with warm water...</li>
            <li> i, like others, use it in the shower first thing in the morning.  </li>
            <li> well, it didn&#x27;t really work!  </li>
            <li> I had a problem at first trying to figure out the ratio of cleanser to water.  </li>
            <li> THe first time I used it I noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I was hooked from the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> My current cleanser was working okay, but there were still two problems that plagued my skin: milia and blackheads.     </li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to lose this product down the sink while you wash, but it makes your skin feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve been using this once daily for over a month, along with organic witch hazel with rose water and aloe, and ending with Lush celestial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re more dry, just scrub it on in the shower.</li>
            <li> I was quite interested in their fresh, all natural skin care cleansers.</li>
            <li> This is definatly a smart buy for the results.</li>
            <li> If your skin is more oily, scrub it gently onto your dry face and wipe off with a cloth.</li>
            <li> Light oatmealish scent and strange texture throw you off at first.  </li>
            <li> It does not impress me too much.</li>
            <li> Extremely gently on skin</li>
            <li> For a real treat for your face: mix up a 1 part Angels to 3 parts Coconut Almond Smoothie</li>
            <li> the fragrance really peps me.  </li>
            <li> It really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> And really, I have to say again</li>
            <li> My skin had never felt so soft or looked so fresh.  </li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It does a great job exfoliating my face without irritating my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Tip</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get it, and when I popped open the container, this super-nast waft of ...</li>
            <li> I always needed something else to REALLY wash my face, so it made this product kind of pointless.  </li>
            <li> When I first discovered Lush</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE Lush fan ever since discovering them several years ago on a trip to London.</li>
            <li> It is extremly gentle, and has kept my face totally clear (not one blemish in tow months of use).  </li>
            <li> skin is really oily, and REALLY sensitive.</li>
            <li> The product does not really lather, but it does exfoliate and lightly cleanse.</li>
            <li> Angels on Bare Skin was the first product that I bought from the company when I was living in England.   </li>
            <li> It smeemed to have sloughed off the dead skin better than grittier soaps and scrubs.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin</li>
            <li> AoBS leaves my skin super soft and mosturized, without feeling oily or like it has a residue left on it.  </li>
            <li> In the mornings I put on a very very light moisturizer, so I haven&#x27;t had problems with drying out at all, but I&#x27;m not sure how it would be without.  </li>
            <li> also tried the cleanser on my rough knees, and they are now smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> , it was very soft.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent of Angels on Bare Skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried regular towels, flannel, many scrubs, nothing, Cetaphyl only, scrubbing with face lotion, various oils, tweezers, yadda, yadda.</li>
            <li> Thank you again, LUSH!</li>
            <li> Lush!</li>
            <li> the method isn&#x27;t obvious at first.  </li>
            <li> Then, I proceeded to clean my face as I would w/ any other product.</li>
            <li> Yet I have gross fine dry skin that shows up when I put makeup on.</li>
            <li> It can be a little messy, so be prepared to use in the shower or to wipe down the sink, but this is one of the best cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin but this exfoliating cleanser is gentle enough to use every day.  </li>
            <li> I am nearly to the end of one pot and have not seen any noticeably improved results.</li>
            <li> For exfoliating, I recommend LUSH&#x27;s Ocean Salt over this product any day.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to Lush Products after spending a year in Oxford.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves your face baby&#x27;s bum soft.  </li>
            <li> It is so soft that I can even go without my mosturizer on warmer days.      </li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft immediately.  </li>
            <li> I have not found a Lush product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day!</li>
            <li> Notice - LUSH</li>
            <li> , the texture of the product (kind of crumbly, with bits of stuff in it) made it much harder to use than other facial cleansing products.  </li>
            <li> : Make sure you rinse well because the mosturizing oils in it go a long way and you only want a tiny bit left when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> first glance the quantities are small and they all kind of had a base fragrance that kind of smelled like playdo.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s little chunks of almond in there to gently get rid of your dead skin, lavender buds to help it smell nice--which it does--and since you add the water to it yourself instead of it getting diluted at the factory, you get more for your money.</li>
            <li> I usually follow up this routine with a light moisturiser and a spritz or two of the Eau Roma toner to seal it in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a definite difference to my face without all the drying and over-oily affects I get from normal soaps.</li>
            <li> Usually I use a cleanser and a moisturizer in order to get a soft yet clean feeling.   </li>
            <li> This is LUSH&#x27;s 100% natural facial cleanser, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to all whom suffer from those dry days &amp; oily days!</li>
            <li> tried it right away on my face, which was a bit blemished, and right away I felt it react to my broken out skin.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this cleanser after reading countless glowing reviews on LUSH&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a bunch of lush products having neither seen nor heard about the line before.</li>
            <li> Based on the site&#x27;s reviews, I decided to try Angels on Bare Skin.</li>
            <li> I gave it to my friend (who LOVES the way it smells), so maybe my nose is broken. :)</li>
            <li> My skin is calmer and smooth (I am very pale and my skin has a tendency to turn red and blotchy when irritated).</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s actually getting my face clean.</li>
            <li> I was interested in the reviews I read online and wanted to try out a few.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, so the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> In only 2 weeks, I see a major difference in my skin and my overall complexion.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin that breaks out, and this cleanser makes my skin feel soft and has cleared up my breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Even though I have mature skin, I still have oily and dry patches.</li>
            <li> Take a little blob, add a few drops of water, make a paste, and smooth it on moistened skin.  </li>
            <li> product is very messy to use, but it&#x27;s powerful abilities to clear my face and soften all the rough spots forces me to give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> It actually spreads pretty far, lathers a little, and you&#x27;ll notice it leaves little flecks of seeds and such on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this product if you want to try something a little different.</li>
            <li> As with some other Lush products there is a bit of a learning curve.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin that is on the dryer side and tends to be a little ance-prone.      </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Angels on Bare Skin\\&quot; is one of the very few Lush items that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  </li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t find that i had any trouble getting it off, particularly compared with other generic scrubs i&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> far as use is concerned: the product comes in a little plastic container.</li>
            <li> The homemade and handcrafted little lump of wonderfulness that came in the jar has become my early morning date that I spend the night dreaming about.</li>
            <li> personally take a finger scoop, wet my face in the shower, rub the scoop between my hands and then cover my face.</li>
            <li> What it does look like is a grey blob of clay with some plant life stuck in.  </li>
            <li> It feels like you&#x27;re rubbing dry playdo on your face until it smooshes around a bit.</li>
            <li> My pores tightened up, my skin was sooo soft and my skin was not an oil slick by noon.</li>
            <li> w/ one hand and w/ the other dry hand</li>
            <li> My skin&#x27;s a combination mess of oily and too damn dry, and I am so prone to big dark pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is so darn messy that I only use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> this is how I use the product: I wet my face  </li>
            <li> I gathered a small pea-sized amount of the product and mixed a small amount of water until I developed a paste.</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, but only give it 4 stars because the ground almonds get in my eyes once in a while, and the clay base takes so getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s right unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I have slight combinattion skin, running from oily to dry in the T-Zone.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> Okay, call me crazy, but I think this is some of worst-smelling stuff ever!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to get used to the scent, but because of that sharp undertone I just can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Plus I now have not had normal monthly breakouts that I usually get, for a least two months now.</li>
            <li> Loses one star because I find the lavender flowers annoying (they do smell good though).</li>
            <li> And as for the seemingly small amount of product in the container, I still have half left</li>
            <li> Also, my skin tends to get really dull if I just use regular soap like Dove on my face, but when I use Angels, it brightens up.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, it ends up drying my skin out with repeated use (the very problem I was trying to fix).</li>
            <li> My skin seems to be super dry now that I&#x27;m in menopause. :(</li>
            <li> The texture is a bit odd, also.  </li>
            <li> I have now been using this product for a month and a half and my milia is gone</li>
            <li> the size of a dime and mix with just a little bit of water then rub my hand together.  </li>
            <li> It contains little buds of lavender.</li>
            <li> and I use a little dish to blend just a few drops of water into the glob.</li>
            <li> It always seemed that half of the product ended up in the sink before it ever hit my skin!</li>
            <li> My actualy skin quality is pretty bad as I have a lot of little bumps, imperfections and some areas of my skin where it just looks \\&quot;blah\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I use not much more then</li>
            <li> The product arrived in a small plastic container.</li>
            <li> At first glance, I was disappointed with the small amount, but still decided to try it.     </li>
            <li> No more pricey cleansers for me!</li>
            <li> I mix a very small amount of Angels with my cream cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Because LUSH uses the ground almonds, it is a lot gentler on your skin rather then using a sand/rough exfoliating base.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it, but is is a weird one.</li>
            <li> My nose is addicted to it, and so is my skin!</li>
            <li> I used to get terrible irritations from facial scrubs and exfoliators.  </li>
            <li> I know it sounds silly</li>
            <li> As for scent, it has a faint lavender scent to my nose.     </li>
            <li> Wanted to try this so bad...</li>
            <li> It smells TERRIBLE.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a wonderful cleanser. The scent is lite and refreshing and it provides gentle exfoliation without causing irritation. This is one of my favorite products.</li>
            <li> The smell of Angels is so great that I can&#x27;t resist using it all over my body, not just for my face. I put on scrubby gloves in the shower and go to town with it. I adore how it makes me smell!</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser has a interesting smell and an even more interesting texture - a somewhat rough texture.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I tried it right away on my face, which was a bit blemished, and right away I felt it react to my broken out skin.  It actually smoothed my skin out, and now only 12 hours later my face is almost cleared up!!! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also tried the cleanser on my rough knees, and they are now smooth and soft. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is very messy to use, but it&#x27;s powerful abilities to clear my face and soften all the rough spots forces me to give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I purchased this cleanser after reading countless glowing reviews on LUSH&#x27;s website. It does not impress me too much. I rather like the fresh lavender/herbal scent, but the scent is the best part. You have to mix it with a bit of water to form a paste and even after you&#x27;ve done this you lose a bit of it because it falls off your face when you go to rub it in. It sure feels nice to scrub it on--gently exfoliating. And it does seem to moisturize. But I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s actually getting my face clean. I am nearly to the end of one pot and have not seen any noticeably improved results. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll buy this again. For exfoliating, I recommend LUSH&#x27;s Ocean Salt over this product any day.</li>
            <li> Extremely gently on skin and yes, it does exfoliate. &lt;br /&gt;It is so darn messy that I only use it in the shower. The smash it in my hand method doesn&#x27;t work for me and I use a little dish to blend just a few drops of water into the glob. If it&#x27;s too watery it runs all over. You will find your best way.  I recommend it, but is is a weird one. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is a great exfoliating scrub for my sensitive and breakout prone skin.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate, but definitely works.  Not cleansing enough for me to use on its own (probably would be fine on its own for drier skin) so I follow with Fresh Farmacy.  Loses one star because I find the lavender flowers annoying (they do smell good though).</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to Lush Products after spending a year in Oxford.  I think that this is the absolute best facial cleanser on the market.  My nose is addicted to it, and so is my skin!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first. But it is REALLY fabulous.  Light oatmealish scent and strange texture throw you off at first.  But wet your face with warm water... rub a bit of product between your palms and lightly scrub over your face.  It is a lot more gentle than it looks.  I used to get terrible irritations from facial scrubs and exfoliators.  This is so incredibly mild however I use it DAILY - morning and night! and it leaves your face baby&#x27;s bum soft.  For a real treat for your face: mix up a 1 part Angels to 3 parts Coconut Almond Smoothie</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin but this exfoliating cleanser is gentle enough to use every day.  i, like others, use it in the shower first thing in the morning.  the fragrance really peps me.  i didn&#x27;t find that i had any trouble getting it off, particularly compared with other generic scrubs i&#x27;ve used.  i was pretty impressed that it really did visibly brighten my complexion. &lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m currently using this product with Imperialis moisturiser (great balancer) and Baby Face at night (fabulous!).</li>
            <li> You have to be careful not to lose this product down the sink while you wash, but it makes your skin feel wonderful.  I have dry skin that breaks out, and this cleanser makes my skin feel soft and has cleared up my breakouts.  A little goes a long way.  I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Okay, call me crazy, but I think this is some of worst-smelling stuff ever!  I was so excited to get it, and when I popped open the container, this super-nast waft of ... I don&#x27;t know ... acidic-ragweed was super over-powering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it once, but I just couldn&#x27;t get over the smell.  I gave it to my friend (who LOVES the way it smells), so maybe my nose is broken. :)</li>
            <li> I am a HUGE Lush fan ever since discovering them several years ago on a trip to London. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;However, \\&quot;Angels on Bare Skin\\&quot; is one of the very few Lush items that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend.  I just found that...well, it didn&#x27;t really work!  I always needed something else to REALLY wash my face, so it made this product kind of pointless.  I wear makeup (concealer, washable mascara, etc) so maybe if you don&#x27;t, you will find that this product works better for you. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, the texture of the product (kind of crumbly, with bits of stuff in it) made it much harder to use than other facial cleansing products.  It always seemed that half of the product ended up in the sink before it ever hit my skin! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have LOVED most other Lush products I&#x27;ve used...so I almost feel disloyal leaving this review!  :-)</li>
            <li> Good stuff, good stuff. There&#x27;s little chunks of almond in there to gently get rid of your dead skin, lavender buds to help it smell nice--which it does--and since you add the water to it yourself instead of it getting diluted at the factory, you get more for your money. Hurrah.    My skin&#x27;s a combination mess of oily and too damn dry, and I am so prone to big dark pores on my nose. Angels copes with it all and makes all of my face happy at the same time. Don&#x27;t know how, don&#x27;t care.     A note on usage: mush up a fingernail-sized lump in your palm with some water. If your skin is more oily, scrub it gently onto your dry face and wipe off with a cloth. If you&#x27;re more dry, just scrub it on in the shower. The oils stay on and make you smooth. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I had a problem at first trying to figure out the ratio of cleanser to water.  I use not much more then the size of a dime and mix with just a little bit of water then rub my hand together.  I love this stuff.  I know it sounds silly but my skin feels younger.  Plus I now have not had normal monthly breakouts that I usually get, for a least two months now.</li>
            <li> Although this is a weird-looking product, Angels is a pretty nice exfoliant. I use it in the shower myself. Make sure to get a finger-sized scoop so that you can really get every part of it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I personally take a finger scoop, wet my face in the shower, rub the scoop between my hands and then cover my face. I only let it set for a minute. As someone else mentioned, it is important to rinse well with this product.</li>
            <li> I use this wash in the morning and evening, and use Ocean Salt every three days.  I follow each wash up with the Breath of Fresh Air toner, and a non-Lush mosturizer.  I have very sensitive skin that is on the dryer side and tends to be a little ance-prone.      AoBS leaves my skin super soft and mosturized, without feeling oily or like it has a residue left on it.  It is extremly gentle, and has kept my face totally clear (not one blemish in tow months of use).  My skin is calmer and smooth (I am very pale and my skin has a tendency to turn red and blotchy when irritated). It is so soft that I can even go without my mosturizer on warmer days.      The texture takes some getting used to (it has bits of plants and stuff it in), as does the smell, but once you&#x27;ve gotten over that the benefits are amazing.  It can be a little messy, so be prepared to use in the shower or to wipe down the sink, but this is one of the best cleansers on the market.</li>
            <li> Angels on Bare Skin was the first product that I bought from the company when I was living in England.   &lt;br /&gt;My skin is really oily, and REALLY sensitive. I break out really easily and Angels was heaven sent. THe first time I used it I noticed a difference. My pores tightened up, my skin was sooo soft and my skin was not an oil slick by noon. Also, my skin tends to get really dull if I just use regular soap like Dove on my face, but when I use Angels, it brightens up. It really makes a difference. And best of all, I hardly ever break out when I am using it.</li>
            <li> This is LUSH&#x27;s 100% natural facial cleanser, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  Angels on Bare Skin (AOBS) is for all skin types, but it works great on my combination skin.  Never too drying or oily!  AOBS is made with really soothing ingredients like rose and lavender, and it has ground almonds to help exfoliate your skin.  Because LUSH uses the ground almonds, it is a lot gentler on your skin rather then using a sand/rough exfoliating base.  After using it, my face is left very soft and cleansed perfectly.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like the scent of Angels on Bare Skin.  It isn&#x27;t foul, just not what I prefer (I tend to go for fruity scents).  The texture is a bit odd, also.  BUT this product works.  My skin feels so soft immediately.  Yet it also feels like its been thoroughly cleaned.  My skin feels tighter.  Usually I use a cleanser and a moisturizer in order to get a soft yet clean feeling.   I love to use it at night before bed.</li>
            <li> I most say like most other opinions of this product it is smelly and unattractive but that doesn&#x27;t mean it doesn&#x27;t have good days. I like this product as a cleanser at night b/c i don&#x27;t have to use anything else. I still use a three step system in the morning and together they work for me.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have found this product to work wonders.  I find it easiest to use it in the shower.  I mix a pea sized amt. with a couple drops of water, rub my hands together and then apply to my face.  My skin looks AWESOME since I started using this product!!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased a bunch of lush products having neither seen nor heard about the line before. I was interested in the reviews I read online and wanted to try out a few.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Upon first glance the quantities are small and they all kind of had a base fragrance that kind of smelled like playdo. (After you use them though, the individual scent comes out.) &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this on my face though and it has made such a difference. I have slight combinattion skin, running from oily to dry in the T-Zone. My actualy skin quality is pretty bad as I have a lot of little bumps, imperfections and some areas of my skin where it just looks \\&quot;blah\\&quot;  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I used this on my face before I went to bed and when I woke up I could immediately notice a difference. It smeemed to have sloughed off the dead skin better than grittier soaps and scrubs. My skin was soft and looked like I had used a really good toner on it. The quality just looked much better. And really, I have to say again, it was very soft.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as use is concerned: the product comes in a little plastic container. It kind of smells like playdo-y oatmeal. I took the tiniest pea-sized amount and ran it into water and then rubbed it around on my damp face. It actually spreads pretty far, lathers a little, and you&#x27;ll notice it leaves little flecks of seeds and such on your face. It feels like you&#x27;re rubbing dry playdo on your face until it smooshes around a bit. In the mornings I put on a very very light moisturizer, so I haven&#x27;t had problems with drying out at all, but I&#x27;m not sure how it would be without.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I highly recommend this product if you want to try something a little different. I&#x27;ve noticed a definite difference to my face without all the drying and over-oily affects I get from normal soaps.</li>
            <li> I just had to try this after seeing all the great reviews. I have not found a Lush product yet I don&#x27;t just love and this is no exception. Even though I have mature skin, I still have oily and dry patches. I have found this cleanser is an effective cleanser but doesn&#x27;t aggravate either condition. I usually follow up this routine with a light moisturiser and a spritz or two of the Eau Roma toner to seal it in. Love it !!</li>
            <li> I love this cleanser, but only give it 4 stars because the ground almonds get in my eyes once in a while, and the clay base takes so getting used to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve been using this once daily for over a month, along with organic witch hazel with rose water and aloe, and ending with Lush celestial moisturizer. My skin had never felt so soft or looked so fresh.  I am 41, and have some sun damage. But my skin feels better than it did 10 years ago. A little goes a long way, so the price is worth it. I love it!</li>
            <li> I freaking love this stuff so far. I have rosacea and am &#x27;not supposed to&#x27; exfoliate. I&#x27;ve tried regular towels, flannel, many scrubs, nothing, Cetaphyl only, scrubbing with face lotion, various oils, tweezers, yadda, yadda. I&#x27;ve tried using the medication the derm gave me and not using it. Yet I have gross fine dry skin that shows up when I put makeup on. Not anymore! It&#x27;s frigging gone. Thank you again, LUSH! ------- Update: I so enjoy using this product on my face. It is so refreshing while it&#x27;s on the skin, and smells great. It contains little buds of lavender. Just lovely. Unfortunately for me, it ends up drying my skin out with repeated use (the very problem I was trying to fix). My skin seems to be super dry now that I&#x27;m in menopause. :(</li>
            <li> been using it for over 10 years great stuff</li>
            <li> Wanted to try this so bad...and so I did. It did nothing for me. Sure, it moisturizes, but it doesn&#x27;t control oil at all and doesn&#x27;t help blemishes..It smells TERRIBLE. There&#x27;s this underlying scent. My mom says it smells like pot. She&#x27;s right unfortunately. I&#x27;m trying to get used to the scent, but because of that sharp undertone I just can&#x27;t. It isn&#x27;t doing anything for my skin either...LUSH has amazing skin products, so I&#x27;ll stick with FF and MoM.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product to all whom suffer from those dry days &amp; oily days! This not only exfoliates, it soothes my skin. I have normal skin but I have my problem days. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use every day! I am getting married in June and it seems I have made the right choice for perfectly glowing skin, even before the summer days begun! Thanks Lush! I can see why this product is a Best Seller!</li>
            <li> Angels on Bare Skin has the honor of being perhaps the best cleanser I have ever used.  I was hooked from the first time I used it.  This quite an honor for a cleanser which looks, by all accounts, fairly unassuming.  What it does look like is a grey blob of clay with some plant life stuck in.  The bits are, in fact, lavender buds, and they give the cleanser a very pleasant lavender smell.  It&#x27;s very important to follow the directions for using Angels- the method isn&#x27;t obvious at first.  Take a little blob, add a few drops of water, make a paste, and smooth it on moistened skin.  It feels very nice going on- like a very light exfoliation.  I then wash it off with a warm washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let&#x27;s cut to the chase here, what about the results?  Honestly, for me, the results have been nothing less than amazing.  As soon as I use Angels my skin feels so clean, so soft, and so perfect, I couldn&#x27;t wish for anything better.  The first time I used it, I couldn&#x27;t stop touching my face, I was so amazed at how wonderful it felt.  I&#x27;m now a die-hard user of Angels.  It&#x27;s an absolutely perfect product for me.</li>
            <li> When I first discovered Lush I was quite interested in their fresh, all natural skin care cleansers. My current cleanser was working okay, but there were still two problems that plagued my skin: milia and blackheads.     Based on the site&#x27;s reviews, I decided to try Angels on Bare Skin. The product arrived in a small plastic container. At first glance, I was disappointed with the small amount, but still decided to try it.     As with some other Lush products there is a bit of a learning curve. After trial and error this is how I use the product: I wet my face  w/ one hand and w/ the other dry hand I gathered a small pea-sized amount of the product and mixed a small amount of water until I developed a paste. Then, I proceeded to clean my face as I would w/ any other product. The product does not really lather, but it does exfoliate and lightly cleanse. As for scent, it has a faint lavender scent to my nose.     After using this product, I immediately felt that my skin was softer. And after a week I could see a noticeable decrease in the milia around my eyes. I have now been using this product for a month and a half and my milia is gone and I have also seen a decrease in the amount of blackheads on my nose.     And as for the seemingly small amount of product in the container, I still have half left and I use it both in the morning and at night. This is definatly a smart buy for the results. No more pricey cleansers for me!</li>
            <li> This cleanser works wonders and leaves your face feeling super mosturized. It does a great job exfoliating my face without irritating my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Make sure you rinse well because the mosturizing oils in it go a long way and you only want a tiny bit left when you&#x27;re done.</li>
            <li> I mix a very small amount of Angels with my cream cleanser.  You have to squish it up good so it gets evenly distributed.  It made my face very soft and smooth.  It felt smooth and looked smooth in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I never understood the fuss until I invested in myself and purchased my own LUSH product. Now I finally get it. The homemade and handcrafted little lump of wonderfulness that came in the jar has become my early morning date that I spend the night dreaming about. In only 2 weeks, I see a major difference in my skin and my overall complexion. It smells good. It feels good. It works good and it is good - about as good as it gets. I love the clean and simple ingredients. I love the branding and packaging and I love the results I am getting. Notice - LUSH - if you want to send me any review samples... I will accept them by the truck load as I am now officially hooked!</li>
