            <li>It is really nice.</li>
            <li>It heats fast and I get excellent curl.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a longer cord too which is nice.</li>
            <li>My hair has a mind of its own when it comes to holding a curl, and my roommate had the Remington wand</li>
            <li>Its the perfect width, heats up fast, and doesn&#x27;t break the hair.  </li>
            <li>but this is a nice addition to my hair styling tools.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is really the best curling iron I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>I have used it once and liked the smoother feel when pulling out the hair and rolling it around the rod.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this as an ADD-ON ITEM, which is really, really nice in price</li>
            <li>the carrying sleeve is nice, though.</li>
            <li>Temperature control is nice.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own built in resting stand.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This gets hotter than the ones I remember in my own youth.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is very nice with great temperature gradation and gentle on your hair.</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and did a great job.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and was happy that it came with a heat proof &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and I could not be more pleased!</li>
            <li>this is a great product I was very pleased with the product I really love all the different setting and the heating capabilities it great for our hair</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best curling irons I have ever used.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>I have layered shoulder length hair and very fine hair also.</li>
            <li>Heats up very quick if you are in a hurry to get your hair done!</li>
            <li>Heats up fast an makes beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I tried a Remington Ceramic Curling Iron and I love it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and very effective.</li>
            <li>Perfect for short hair curls!</li>
            <li>It works great and heats of fast.  </li>
            <li>so I use the curling iron more as a wand</li>
            <li>I love that it heats up in a flash and has adjustable heat levels, as well.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t curling my hair at the top of my head.</li>
            <li>this almost makes it shine more.</li>
            <li>but this one is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also love the automatic shut-off.</li>
            <li>love the curls, they hold all day.</li>
            <li>Love how it fits my hand, not cumbersome.</li>
            <li>Wish the product manual could offer more tips for hair styling.</li>
            <li>With 350 degrees heat and 30 heat settings, ceramic construction, 30 second heat up, and auto shut off, this is an inexpensive unit with some impressive features.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is perfect - when I curl my hair with this iron, it stays all day and into the next day after sleeping.  </li>
            <li>but, the performance could be better.</li>

            <li>It gets HOT!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>I received this item and the first thing it does is not heat up!</li>
            <li>Well this curling iron heats up quickly and curls hair nice, I have mid length hair</li>
            <li>It was hard to pick up the right one after reading all the controversial reviews, but this one is good.</li>
            <li>The ceramic clip does a great job of keeping a tight hold during curling</li>
            <li>It gets just to the right temperature for my fine/normal hair and curls really quick.  </li>
            <li>This is a great little ceramic curler.</li>
            <li>This little curling iron works great.  </li>
            <li>This curling iron is sleek and amazing it has different settings and auto shut off after thirty seconds.</li>
            <li>It is nice for a different look.  </li>
            <li>Heats up really fast, the looks of the curling iron are great, be careful though on the settings, it will fry your hair if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.</li>
            <li>I stopped doing anything to my hair for about 20 years and got into the &amp;#34;natural look,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m having fun again with hair and makeup.  </li>
            <li>Quality is far better than my 100$ iron</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Curls in seconds, easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li>, it gets super hot..</li>
            <li>It does get very HOT though, so watch the controls the first time you use  it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right, though.</li>
            <li>amazon made it right</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s just the right size for my hand.  </li>
            <li>but after buying this i realized i made the right decision.</li>
            <li>Curl right.</li>
            <li>son would know, he stepped on it with full heat, lemmie tell ya, there is noo problem with how hot it gets ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>So the ceramic material really is better than my old stainless barrel!  </li>
            <li>I really like that the end of the barrel stays cool.  </li>
            <li>The curling iron was really cheap, and you can only expect it to be made out of decent quality, but I really LOVE it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product works great not only as a traditional clamp curling iron but also as a wrap around curling wand.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and curls hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>Heats up super fast.</li>
            <li>It hits up quickly and curls my hair really well.</li>
            <li>Like auto shut off very much.</li>
            <li>It heat up very fast.  </li>
            <li>Great little styling tool for the price!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>this gives me the even smaller curls i love.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a better curling iron, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Seems like a bargain at first, then it stops working.</li>
            <li>Its work well for a hot oil treatment tho</li>
            <li>Daughter loves it and says its the first curling iron that has worked for her.  </li>
            <li>I love that it heats up instantly and has 30 heat settings.  </li>
            <li>The first lasted for many years and actually still works, though the barrel is worn.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel they get as hot as my Conair and purchase them as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Pretty spiral bouncy shiny curls.</li>
            <li>The item is exactly as it was described.  </li>
            <li>im use to hot tools and babyliss,</li>
            <li>Gets hot, works well.</li>
            <li>The size is perfect, doesn&#x27;t make my curls too big and not too small.</li>
            <li>It is hot</li>
            <li>it works fast!</li>
            <li>It never worked after the first time.</li>
            <li>This makes it much easier to curl hair!  </li>
            <li>It heats very well, holds my hair and doesn&#x27;t slip off, and the switch works!</li>
            <li>I enjoy the quick heating and the various heat settings.  </li>
            <li>I love this and would recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality iron for a super low price!!</li>
            <li>This curling iron doesn&#x27;t only create long lasting curls but there beautiful and playful!</li>
            <li>I have very coarse, thick hair, and this curling iron works perfectly for my needs.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it for such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li>Wish I had one for my flat iron!! :-)</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast and the curls are exactly what I want them to be.</li>
            <li>The almost instant &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;  is fast and with the different heat settings it would be good for all types of hair.  </li>
            <li>I have really thin straight fine hair and my curls would always fall really easily!!</li>
            <li>If you put enough hair spray they will last for a couple of hours, other than that it worked great!</li>
            <li>Easy to hold; holds the curl well; several temps to choose from.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it long enough for a fair evaluation.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, a smart buy.</li>
            <li>I knew that it had to be because the curler I just bought for $80, barrel was to large.</li>
            <li>Nice soft curls on long hair!</li>
            <li>It gives nice tight curls.</li>
            <li>I have a more expensive one with a wider barrel, and this one works better!  </li>
            <li>Very light weight, heats up quickly and has a small non stick barrel.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be a quality curling iron, but based on other positive reviews, I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t mind it, that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I have no complaints, thanks.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is very well made and gives my hair lift and long-lasting curls.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Way better than expected.</li>
            <li>I really like the adjustable heat setting feature as well.</li>
            <li>It heats up instantly and keeps your hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>no matter how much product I put in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t stay curled longer than an hour or so.</li>
            <li>I keep mine out and ready to use.</li>
            <li>The cord swivels, and it heats up fast.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Works well, heats fast, and hangles well.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I think the ceramic barrel is how this is accomplished.</li>
            <li>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li>SO SO MUCH, if i could give this a 6/5</li>
            <li>This one works great-heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t scorch my hair.</li>
            <li>It had been a lot of years since I purchased a curling iron and if this is how they&#x27;ve evolved, it&#x27;s very exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not very expensive either.  </li>
            <li>Better than other ones I had.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time this morning and it works way better than my more expensive iron.</li>
            <li>I read all the reivews everyone left and when I got it I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li>Other than that I love it</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.. gets very hot be careful...</li>
            <li>Highly recommended over other brands, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It came with a small cloth pouch to store it in which was a nice addition to keep it from getting scratched and damaged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, lightweight, small, easy to take with you anywhere, and can give you beautiful tight</li>
            <li>I bought it as a gift to myself using my Christmas gift cards and used it to do my hair on New Year&#x27;s Eve!</li>
            <li>The only thing missing is a light to tell you when it&#x27;s hot enough, but it heats quickly, and there is a light that shows when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li>The ability to control exactly how hot it gets is great, too, and it shuts off by itself if you forget about it, the cord swivels, so it won&#x27;t tangle or get tight on you as you turn it, and finally, the heat proof sleeve it comes with protects your other stuff from melting so you can actually put it away before it&#x27;s completely cool.  </li>
            <li>Gets pretty hot pretty fast, maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve been spoiled with my flat iron that has a digital screen that tells you the exact temperature, but it took a couple of minutes for me to gauge what setting would get this curling iron to about 330-350 degrees.</li>
            <li>So I have used many curling irons, from the cheapest to the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as most that I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li>It works for me as I have super straight hair that won&#x27;t keep curls for long.</li>
            <li>plus the prices were extremely high.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I am just having an Austin Powers moment, but it&#x27;s hard for me to believe that you could get a better curling iron if you spent more.</li>
            <li>I really love this iron, I just received it a few days ago</li>
            <li>Nice but feels clumsy</li>
            <li>Its ok my curls do not last or hold to long as I would like it.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t need to leave it in my hair for more than a few seconds</li>
            <li>Does a good curl, it is a thin barrel</li>
            <li>There is just a little too much of a gap between the barrel and spring clip to easily hold onto the hair</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly, barrel is big enough for any type of hair and for any type of curl you want.</li>
            <li>Not the right size for short hair.</li>
            <li>the dial that turns the heat up or down turns WAY too easily.  </li>
            <li>and I wasnt looking forward to spending alot of money on a new one</li>
            <li>I received this curler on friday when I purchased it on wed I live in VA</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;i had to toss it in the Garbage as its usless now, i&#x27;m buying me new one</li>
            <li>Wish the cord was longer, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li>So I called Amazon and they are sending me a brand new one...</li>
            <li>one thing that might be a con to me would be that it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally slightly change the temperature while you are curling.</li>
            <li>Not as tight of a curl as last night but a nice natural wave.</li>
            <li>My hair is very, very straight and every time I tried to curl my hair with other products (curling irons and hot rollers)</li>
            <li>It makes really pretty curls, especially since the barrell is thinner.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty standard curling iron.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Curls come out soft shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li>I really loved this curling iron but after only a few months of use the spring broke and could not be replaced because the plastic barrel was striped and the screw would not go back in and stay.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad because the curl I got from the first use was great.</li>
            <li>The switch on my otherwise ideal curling iron went bad within 3 months, and I found myself searching for a replacement that might hold up longer.</li>
            <li>the price of this one, but was buying it for occasional use and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li>I used it only 2 days then it heated very</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, and it take m 10 minutes to make the ends all pretty.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a everyday curler</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have to hold it so far from my head.  </li>
            <li>The curls are soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>Heats fast with several settings.</li>
            <li>Auto shut off offers peace of mind.  </li>
            <li>My curls always would fall with my old curling iron.</li>
            <li>This one heats up fast and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li>I have purchased many irons over the years and they all lasted at least a couple years.</li>
            <li>I thought this curling iron would have a similar barrel size to my old one but it was a bit more narrow.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a huge deal, it does not move by much, and it&#x27;s easy and fast enough to just change it back as long as you are paying attention.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and cools down fast.</li>
            <li>I gave this one a chance because of the low price and high reviews.</li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t close tightly on hair making it hard to get a good curl.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>I did like the Remington CI5219 Instant Curls Ceramic Hair Curling Iron, 3/4 Inch size because the barrel was too large for short hair.</li>
            <li>Would recommend it to anyone with dry straight hair.</li>
            <li>Curling iron heats fast, but it takes smaller sections of hair because the barrel is short.  </li>
            <li>Somehow this iron seems clumsy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The part that heats up is shorter than most I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve burned my hand several times trying to get used to it.  </li>
            <li>But once you used to it, it won&#x60;t be a major problem anymore.</li>
            <li>perfectly fine, since the hair would be so thick around the barrel.</li>
            <li>It leaves a crinkle on your curls and it is hard to smooth it out.</li>
            <li>The ceramics seem to heat up much quicker and produce a smoother, long lasting curl.</li>
            <li>The quality far exceeds my expectations considering the astonishingly low price.</li>
            <li>Very Short not able to get much hair in curling iron, heats up fast, but want something longer for my longer hair.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get very gunky with hairspray like other curling irons I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>Use a low setting, it gets very hot--just hold the curl for about 20 second for a tighter curl, and about 10-12 seconds for a loose curl.</li>
            <li>yes i am black and the texture of my hair is very course</li>
            <li>Its not a flat iron and nothing stays curled without some sort of add chemical to your hair to help.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely cannot beat this curling iron for the price -- even comes with a little velvet-y sleeve.</li>
            <li>only problem I really have with it, is that it will turn off by itself after about 20 minutes if you don&#x27;t switch the temperature around a little bit</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but this is a nice addition to my hair styling tools.</li>

            <li> I have used it once and liked the smoother feel when pulling out the hair and rolling it around the rod.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this as an ADD-ON ITEM, which is really, really nice in price</li>

            <li> Perfect for short hair curls!</li>
            <li> It works great and heats of fast.  </li>

            <li> I love that it heats up in a flash and has adjustable heat levels, as well.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t curling my hair at the top of my head.</li>
            <li> this almost makes it shine more.</li>
            <li> but this one is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> Also love the automatic shut-off.</li>
            <li> love the curls, they hold all day.</li>
            <li> Love how it fits my hand, not cumbersome.</li>
            <li> Wish the product manual could offer more tips for hair styling.</li>
            <li> With 350 degrees heat and 30 heat settings, ceramic construction, 30 second heat up, and auto shut off, this is an inexpensive unit with some impressive features.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>

            <li> Its work well for a hot oil treatment tho</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it and says its the first curling iron that has worked for her.  </li>
            <li> I love that it heats up instantly and has 30 heat settings.  </li>
            <li> The first lasted for many years and actually still works, though the barrel is worn.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel they get as hot as my Conair and purchase them as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Pretty spiral bouncy shiny curls.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as it was described.  </li>
            <li> im use to hot tools and babyliss,</li>
            <li> Gets hot, works well.</li>
            <li> The size is perfect, doesn&#x27;t make my curls too big and not too small.</li>
            <li> It is hot</li>
            <li> it works fast!</li>
            <li> It never worked after the first time.</li>
            <li> This makes it much easier to curl hair!  </li>
            <li> It heats very well, holds my hair and doesn&#x27;t slip off, and the switch works!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the quick heating and the various heat settings.  </li>
            <li> I love this and would recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality iron for a super low price!!</li>
            <li> This curling iron doesn&#x27;t only create long lasting curls but there beautiful and playful!</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick hair, and this curling iron works perfectly for my needs.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it for such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> Wish I had one for my flat iron!! :-)</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast and the curls are exactly what I want them to be.</li>
            <li> The almost instant &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;  is fast and with the different heat settings it would be good for all types of hair.  </li>
            <li> I have really thin straight fine hair and my curls would always fall really easily!!</li>
            <li> If you put enough hair spray they will last for a couple of hours, other than that it worked great!</li>
            <li> Easy to hold; holds the curl well; several temps to choose from.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough for a fair evaluation.  </li>
            <li> In my opinion, a smart buy.</li>
            <li> I knew that it had to be because the curler I just bought for $80, barrel was to large.</li>
            <li> Nice soft curls on long hair!</li>
            <li> It gives nice tight curls.</li>
            <li> I have a more expensive one with a wider barrel, and this one works better!  </li>
            <li> Very light weight, heats up quickly and has a small non stick barrel.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be a quality curling iron, but based on other positive reviews, I decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t mind it, that much.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I have no complaints, thanks.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very well made and gives my hair lift and long-lasting curls.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Way better than expected.</li>
            <li> I really like the adjustable heat setting feature as well.</li>
            <li> It heats up instantly and keeps your hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> no matter how much product I put in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t stay curled longer than an hour or so.</li>
            <li> I keep mine out and ready to use.</li>
            <li> The cord swivels, and it heats up fast.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Works well, heats fast, and hangles well.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is more than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I think the ceramic barrel is how this is accomplished.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY</li>
            <li> SO SO MUCH, if i could give this a 6/5</li>
            <li> This one works great-heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t scorch my hair.</li>
            <li> It had been a lot of years since I purchased a curling iron and if this is how they&#x27;ve evolved, it&#x27;s very exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> very often.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not very expensive either.  </li>
            <li> Better than other ones I had.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time this morning and it works way better than my more expensive iron.</li>
            <li> I read all the reivews everyone left and when I got it I was not disappointed at all.</li>
            <li> Other than that I love it</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.. gets very hot be careful...</li>
            <li> Highly recommended over other brands, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It came with a small cloth pouch to store it in which was a nice addition to keep it from getting scratched and damaged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, lightweight, small, easy to take with you anywhere, and can give you beautiful tight</li>
            <li> I bought it as a gift to myself using my Christmas gift cards and used it to do my hair on New Year&#x27;s Eve!</li>
            <li> The only thing missing is a light to tell you when it&#x27;s hot enough, but it heats quickly, and there is a light that shows when it&#x27;s on.</li>
            <li> The ability to control exactly how hot it gets is great, too, and it shuts off by itself if you forget about it, the cord swivels, so it won&#x27;t tangle or get tight on you as you turn it, and finally, the heat proof sleeve it comes with protects your other stuff from melting so you can actually put it away before it&#x27;s completely cool.  </li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot pretty fast, maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve been spoiled with my flat iron that has a digital screen that tells you the exact temperature, but it took a couple of minutes for me to gauge what setting would get this curling iron to about 330-350 degrees.</li>
            <li> So I have used many curling irons, from the cheapest to the more expensive brands.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as most that I have had in the past.  </li>
            <li> It works for me as I have super straight hair that won&#x27;t keep curls for long.</li>
            <li> plus the prices were extremely high.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am just having an Austin Powers moment, but it&#x27;s hard for me to believe that you could get a better curling iron if you spent more.</li>
            <li> I really love this iron, I just received it a few days ago</li>
            <li> Nice but feels clumsy</li>
            <li> Its ok my curls do not last or hold to long as I would like it.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t need to leave it in my hair for more than a few seconds</li>
            <li> Does a good curl, it is a thin barrel</li>
            <li> There is just a little too much of a gap between the barrel and spring clip to easily hold onto the hair</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, barrel is big enough for any type of hair and for any type of curl you want.</li>
            <li> Not the right size for short hair.</li>
            <li> the dial that turns the heat up or down turns WAY too easily.  </li>
            <li> and I wasnt looking forward to spending alot of money on a new one</li>
            <li> I received this curler on friday when I purchased it on wed I live in VA</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;i had to toss it in the Garbage as its usless now, i&#x27;m buying me new one</li>
            <li> Wish the cord was longer, but I can live with it.</li>
            <li> So I called Amazon and they are sending me a brand new one...</li>
            <li> one thing that might be a con to me would be that it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally slightly change the temperature while you are curling.</li>
            <li> Not as tight of a curl as last night but a nice natural wave.</li>
            <li> My hair is very, very straight and every time I tried to curl my hair with other products (curling irons and hot rollers)</li>
            <li> It makes really pretty curls, especially since the barrell is thinner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty standard curling iron.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Curls come out soft shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I really loved this curling iron but after only a few months of use the spring broke and could not be replaced because the plastic barrel was striped and the screw would not go back in and stay.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad because the curl I got from the first use was great.</li>
            <li> The switch on my otherwise ideal curling iron went bad within 3 months, and I found myself searching for a replacement that might hold up longer.</li>
            <li> the price of this one, but was buying it for occasional use and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much.</li>
            <li> I used it only 2 days then it heated very</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, and it take m 10 minutes to make the ends all pretty.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a everyday curler</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to hold it so far from my head.  </li>
            <li> The curls are soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> Heats fast with several settings.</li>
            <li> Auto shut off offers peace of mind.  </li>
            <li> My curls always would fall with my old curling iron.</li>
            <li> This one heats up fast and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many irons over the years and they all lasted at least a couple years.</li>
            <li> I thought this curling iron would have a similar barrel size to my old one but it was a bit more narrow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a huge deal, it does not move by much, and it&#x27;s easy and fast enough to just change it back as long as you are paying attention.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and cools down fast.</li>
            <li> I gave this one a chance because of the low price and high reviews.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t close tightly on hair making it hard to get a good curl.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> I did like the Remington CI5219 Instant Curls Ceramic Hair Curling Iron, 3/4 Inch size because the barrel was too large for short hair.</li>
            <li> Would recommend it to anyone with dry straight hair.</li>
            <li> Curling iron heats fast, but it takes smaller sections of hair because the barrel is short.  </li>
            <li> Somehow this iron seems clumsy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The part that heats up is shorter than most I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve burned my hand several times trying to get used to it.  </li>
            <li> But once you used to it, it won&#x60;t be a major problem anymore.</li>
            <li> perfectly fine, since the hair would be so thick around the barrel.</li>
            <li> It leaves a crinkle on your curls and it is hard to smooth it out.</li>
            <li> The ceramics seem to heat up much quicker and produce a smoother, long lasting curl.</li>
            <li> The quality far exceeds my expectations considering the astonishingly low price.</li>
            <li> Very Short not able to get much hair in curling iron, heats up fast, but want something longer for my longer hair.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get very gunky with hairspray like other curling irons I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> Use a low setting, it gets very hot--just hold the curl for about 20 second for a tighter curl, and about 10-12 seconds for a loose curl.</li>
            <li> yes i am black and the texture of my hair is very course</li>
            <li> Its not a flat iron and nothing stays curled without some sort of add chemical to your hair to help.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot beat this curling iron for the price -- even comes with a little velvet-y sleeve.</li>
            <li> only problem I really have with it, is that it will turn off by itself after about 20 minutes if you don&#x27;t switch the temperature around a little bit</li>
            <li> the handle makes the grip easier to deal with... pretty colors black and pink...</li>
            <li> Bought this just to try something different but wanted the shine that my flat irons give me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve accidentally left it on one or two times and nearly burned down the house...</li>
            <li> I can use it to curl normally with the little clip thing, or just wrap my hair around and use it like a wand, it works all ways.</li>
            <li> My hair hardly holds curls and even after putting it up with multiple pins, taking it down, and sleeping on it my hair still had more curl in it than with previous curling irons.</li>
            <li> In the stores they didn&#x27;t have the size I needed, and they had a lot of flat irons, brushes etc.</li>
            <li> But don&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I have a larger more expensive curling iron that I spent $80 on</li>
            <li> I use mine for my flat iron anyway so who cares about the pouch.</li>
            <li> and so it tends to pull out, even though my length is long enough that I could wrap it twice around the barrel.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely make other purchases - smaller barrel for tighter curls and flat irons.</li>
            <li> It took me a verrrrry long time, a lot of frustration, several different types of scissors, knives, and tools from the garage, and a few curse words to finally get the packaging open!  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long that lasts.</li>
            <li> The curls stay all day long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this a 5 star if it didn&#x27;t do this and for long hair, it&#x27;s prob.</li>
            <li> well - my hair is long &amp; I go for ringlets that loosen up as the day goes on.</li>
            <li> I was so confused to which curler to get, and I think I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> i have colored hair and tends to be dry.</li>
            <li> Was not sure I should buy it because it was far less&lt;</li>
            <li> I was disappointed but maybe one day it will come In handy.</li>
            <li> Since I always use the highest heat setting, I just wrapped blue painter&#x27;s tape around the dial so it would stop turning down while I was curling.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because............the handle &amp; barrel are both black &amp; I accidentally picked it up with the barrel instead of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Only drawback is that there is a slight gap towards the bottom of the curler and my hair can&#x27;t &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; and falls through the curler</li>
            <li> I do wish I had bought a larger barrel, as 3/4&amp;#34; is fairly tight curls for my taste.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to burn your hands.</li>
            <li> My curls never really would stay curled</li>
            <li> so i was always left with limp curls at the end of the day,</li>
            <li> OR you can keep the clasp bar closed and use it for a wand.  </li>
            <li> so be careful and</li>
            <li> I find it does not have to be in contact with my hair nearly as long as previous curling irons.</li>
            <li> It usually heats up within 30-45 seconds, I&#x27;ve left it on for 10-15 minutes to see if it would heat up eventually, and it DID NOT!</li>
            <li> has been the first part to fail in my experience.</li>
            <li> but I have to turn the barrel very carefully</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and always had trouble holding a curl for a whole day.</li>
            <li> the dial to keep it at the setting I want, which as I said, even on the highest setting is not hot enough and I do not have hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little longer than I expected</li>
            <li> None of my other previous irons has done this</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the on/off switch on it</li>
            <li> it was down to $20 the day after I received it in the mail...</li>
            <li> I also like the self contained plastic stand rather than a metal bail with which to set down the iron.  </li>
            <li> and it did not let me down.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the size of the curls: too tight.</li>
            <li> the manufacturer&#x27;s packaging was extremely difficult to open, it was like I was trying to open a bank vault with a butter knife.  </li>
            <li> The curler is ceramic too which is less damaging to the hair.  </li>
            <li> These are a bit to tight for my taste.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the clamp though because I dont like tight curls</li>
            <li> They do not curl as tight as I would like.  </li>
            <li> It holds your hair tight and doesn&#x27;t slip; it DOESN&#x27;T smell like burning.  </li>
            <li> the product.&lt;br /&gt;It broke less than 2 weeks with a few times of use.</li>
            <li> but it was a little bit of a pain).</li>
            <li> My BIG complaint, however, is that it doesn&#x27;t grip thinner/finer hair well and allows the hair to slip off the iron!  </li>
            <li> It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> The temperature was not accurate an changes with out me manually doing it.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the very heavy molded plastic container which was extremely difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> I used to have to wash my hair at least every other day.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past month or so.  </li>
            <li> No more leaving home and then worrying if I had turned it off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and tried using it the past couple of days</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cinge the hair like some irons ive had in the past.</li>
            <li> Sadly I can&#x27;t return it because I left it in its packaging for a while before using it.</li>
            <li> Curls my hair in small sections</li>
            <li> it usually does help, but this was the supreme test.  </li>
            <li> No more.</li>
            <li> The hair does not look burned by excessive heat that you get with the others that are not ceramic.</li>
            <li> However, I waste a lot of time using this iron because the temperature dial in a position that when you use it, your inadvertently turn it down or off!!!</li>
            <li> It was hard finding a small rod curling iron for shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> the storage bag is pretty worthless...</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and hard to curl, but with this iron</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to explain, but combing out and arranging my hair resulted in a little nicer style than usual.  </li>
            <li> (if you know what I mean).  </li>
            <li> My hair is very VERY hard to curl and hard to keep the curl.  </li>
            <li> then I used this and my hair stayed curled for 3 days without hardly flattening at all!</li>
            <li> I was worried at first because I heard terrible things about smartpost.</li>
            <li> Money wasted!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try the curl secret instead.</li>
            <li> I was tired of the smell, so I figured I would try something else</li>
            <li> This was a purchase to replace a broken iron which had switchable sizes.  </li>
            <li> It was placed it the worst place as far as how your hands use the iron.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> The price had me skeptical</li>
            <li> but boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Very frustrating when you are working against the clock.</li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> One bad thing:  </li>
            <li> The temperature dial is in a bad spot, though, and moves while I&#x27;m trying to curl my hair.</li>
            <li> I always style my ultra-fine, stick-straight hair on the highest heat for maximum impact, and the heat setting on this bad boy doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> I was shocked the way the curling iron broke.</li>
            <li> so i threw it out :(</li>
            <li> The pouch it comes with is worthless though because it is not heat resistant.</li>
            <li> When I used to flip out my hair, it would fall to an awkward mid-flip by midday and look awful, but my style lasts all day with this nifty iron.</li>
            <li> I hate using hairspray or mousse and didn&#x27;t have to with this iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst curling iron I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> The design of it was horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I can depend on this anytime.  Thanks</li>
            <li> This curling iron is amazing. I can hair style my hair in minutes and the price is really good for what you get. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> All I wanted was a curling iron. In the stores they didn&#x27;t have the size I needed, and they had a lot of flat irons, brushes etc. plus the prices were extremely high. All I wanted was a curling iron--- went.to Amazon and there it was. Right size, right price, easy to use, heats up quickly and came with a traveling case. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Works well for my shorter layers, hair does not crease or frizz. Easy to work.</li>
            <li> Very Short not able to get much hair in curling iron, heats up fast, but want something longer for my longer hair. Perfect for short hair curls!</li>
            <li> I got my package one day before the expected date which made me happy. The curls turn out great! But don&#x27;t last long. If you put enough hair spray they will last for a couple of hours, other than that it worked great!</li>
            <li> I enjoy the quick heating and the various heat settings.  It definitely meets my needs.</li>
            <li> I had looked at curling irons 3x the price of this one, but was buying it for occasional use and didn&#x27;t want to spend too much. I gave this one a chance because of the low price and high reviews. I&#x27;m sold!! You can&#x27;t go wrong. It heats quickly and did a great job.</li>
            <li> I thought this curling iron would have a similar barrel size to my old one but it was a bit more narrow. If you want softer curls i would go up a size. These are a bit to tight for my taste.</li>
            <li> very good for the price. Better than other ones I had. would buy again in the future . Would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> It works great and heats of fast.  I would only change the tip to make that larger and easier to hold.  Then I would not burn my fingers</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the best curling irons ive had . my last one died 3 months ago and I wasnt looking forward to spending alot of money on a new one but then I found this curling iron ! Its great ! it heats up quickly as advertised . I don&#x27;t use the clamp though because I dont like tight curls so I use the curling iron more as a wand and it still works great both ways . (: I received my curling.iron 4 days after ordering and I couldnt be happier !</li>
            <li> Great product heats up very quick.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was going to be a quality curling iron, but based on other positive reviews, I decided to purchase it. I have very fine hair and this iron does a great job curling my ends. I love that it heats up in a flash and has adjustable heat levels, as well. The clamp is secure and a breeze to use with the swivel cord feature and cool-grip tip. What a great price, too. In my opinion, a smart buy.</li>
            <li> I used it only 2 days then it heated very and after it did not start working. It was a waste of money</li>
            <li> I have a larger more expensive curling iron that I spent $80 on but it wasn&#x27;t curling my hair at the top of my head. I knew that it had to be because the curler I just bought for $80, barrel was to large. I was on the hunt for a smaller iron but at a fraction of the price. This iron is perfect! The curls last all day!</li>
            <li> this gives me the even smaller curls i love. i have colored hair and tends to be dry. this almost makes it shine more. HIGHLY RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> I am happy with this curling iron.  It quickly curls, is adjustable, has a nice pivoting cord.  It is nice for a different look.  Save your money, you don&#x27;t need a more expensive curling iron.  This one does a great job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, heats up fast, curls stay for hours. I use it as more of a curling &amp;#34;wand&amp;#34; and it works great. I&#x27;m able to curl my hair quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for the past month or so.  The best curling iron&lt;br /&gt;I have ever used.  Was not sure I should buy it because it was far less&lt;br /&gt;money then the junk ones at all of the stores.  Best decision I ever made.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I really loved this curling iron but after only a few months of use the spring broke and could not be replaced because the plastic barrel was striped and the screw would not go back in and stay. Too bad.</li>
            <li> i was looking forward to using this product. when it eventually arrived i plugged it to a socket, and it comes on then it went off. it doesnt work anymore. i regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> This curling Iron works great! Heats up fast an makes beautiful curls. Price was really cheap I got it as an add on item and I could not be more pleased! Received several days before the estimated delivery date.</li>
            <li> Gone through a lot of curling irons but this one is probably my favorite. The ceramic surface  heats evenly for great curls. Doesn&#x27;t get very gunky with hairspray like other curling irons I&#x27;ve owned. Also love the automatic shut-off. No more leaving home and then worrying if I had turned it off. Would buy this style of curling iron again.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this purchase.  This curling iron heats up quickly, is very durable, has a good stand that does not get in the way when curling.  Great quality item.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is WONDERFUL !  Easy to handle, heats quickly, &amp; the hair does not stick to the barrel.  The only reason that I gave it 4 stars is because............the handle &amp; barrel are both black &amp; I accidentally picked it up with the barrel instead of the handle.  I have since used bright orange nail polish &amp; painted the very end of the plastic tip so that I don&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> The curling iron was really cheap, and you can only expect it to be made out of decent quality, but I really LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple to use, lightweight, small, easy to take with you anywhere, and can give you beautiful tight curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It came with a small cloth pouch to store it in which was a nice addition to keep it from getting scratched and damaged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I really have with it, is that it will turn off by itself after about 20 minutes if you don&#x27;t switch the temperature around a little bit (it&#x27;s like leaving your laptop unattended and it shuts off by itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I really don&#x27;t mind it, that much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for a great price! I&#x27;ll have to buy a larger one!! Will buy from this seller again!!</li>
            <li> Excellent barrel, heats well with many settings for temperature. I&#x27;ve never had a better curling iron, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY! SEEMS LIKE A BARGAIN....At first I loved this curling iron, it did its job. I&#x27;ve had it for 2 months and tried using it the past couple of days and it doesnt even heat up anymore. It usually heats up within 30-45 seconds, I&#x27;ve left it on for 10-15 minutes to see if it would heat up eventually, and it DID NOT! DO NOT BUY! Seems like a bargain at first, then it stops working.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.. gets very hot be careful... love the curls, they hold all day. Love how it fits my hand, not cumbersome.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly, barrel is big enough for any type of hair and for any type of curl you want. Even comes with a heat protectant bag!</li>
            <li> Very glad to find this and not have to pay more, especially since I don&#x27;t curl my hair very often. The only thing missing is a light to tell you when it&#x27;s hot enough, but it heats quickly, and there is a light that shows when it&#x27;s on. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Such a disappoinment. Does not do what it should.</li>
            <li> Does a good curl, it is a thin barrel so it gives you a good size curl and the material is nice.. the handle makes the grip easier to deal with... pretty colors black and pink... remington is always a good brand</li>
            <li> The best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used.  Use a low setting, it gets very hot--just hold the curl for about 20 second for a tighter curl, and about 10-12 seconds for a loose curl.</li>
            <li> Ehh!  Thats all I can say.  Its not a flat iron and nothing stays curled without some sort of add chemical to your hair to help.  Its work well for a hot oil treatment tho</li>
            <li> This curling iron performs well, is easy to use, heats up fast and has a nice range of temperature settings.  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> This product broke 5 mins after I used it!!&lt;br /&gt;I would not heat up anymore!! Money wasted!!!</li>
            <li> Very good buy is what I was looking for gifts, it is in very good condition and I have no complaints, thanks.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and gets the job done! Wish the product manual could offer more tips for hair styling.</li>
            <li> Exactly what my wife wanted!  Unususal.  Made her happy. Has one in cities across the country now. We&#x27;ll see how long that lasts.</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used. Highly recommended over other brands, and I&#x27;ve tried many. Heats up quickly, cools quickly. Several heat settings, doesn&#x27;t burn hair, doesn&#x27;t get tangled in hair. Easy to hold and handle. Travels well. Well made. If anything ever happens to it I will definitely buy another.</li>
            <li> I received this curler on friday when I purchased it on wed I live in VA and they shipped it from California. It was packaged very nicely and works great</li>
            <li> Daughter loves it and says its the first curling iron that has worked for her.  A + _ _+ +</li>
            <li> Great hair product!  I love that it heats up instantly and has 30 heat settings.  It glides through hair nicely.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Curling iron heats fast, but it takes smaller sections of hair because the barrel is short.  It&#x27;s all right, though.</li>
            <li> With 350 degrees heat and 30 heat settings, ceramic construction, 30 second heat up, and auto shut off, this is an inexpensive unit with some impressive features.</li>
            <li> This works amazingly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son would know, he stepped on it with full heat, lemmie tell ya, there is noo problem with how hot it gets ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s works well! Happy i bought it!&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> Terrific curling iron for short hair! It heats quickly and curls without burning. It is also easy to handle.</li>
            <li> It was hard to pick up the right one after reading all the controversial reviews, but this one is good.</li>
            <li> It is really nice. my only complaint is the size of the curls: too tight. It works for me as I have super straight hair that won&#x27;t keep curls for long.</li>
            <li> This product works great not only as a traditional clamp curling iron but also as a wrap around curling wand. And the curls stay for hours without any product! Would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> get this if you have feathery hair, anything stronger won&#x27;t work with this iron. you get what u pay for i guess.</li>
            <li> This iron has a good quality covering on the barrel and works well. My only complaint is the on/off switch on it</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very well made and gives my hair lift and long-lasting curls. I used to have to wash my hair at least every other day. Now my style lasts for four days. Amazing! I love it.</li>
            <li> this is a great product I was very pleased with the product I really love all the different setting and the heating capabilities it great for our hair yes i am black and the texture of my hair is very course</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Heats up fast and curls hair quickly.  Be careful not to burn your hands.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sons mother as a gift and she loves it because the temperature is adjustable which makes it ideal when you have children in the home.</li>
            <li> i did not like it i gave it away i am a retired hairdresser maybe just not use  to using it .</li>
            <li> Good. It does not damage my hair. Leaves hair shiny. Would buy again.  Like auto shut off very much. Great.</li>
            <li> This is my second one like this. The first lasted for many years and actually still works, though the barrel is worn. I&#x27;m just going to keep it as a back up. It heats fast and I get excellent curl. There are many heat settings and it&#x27;s easy to handle. There&#x27;s a longer cord too which is nice. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast, the looks of the curling iron are great, be careful though on the settings, it will fry your hair if you don&#x27;t know what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Way better than expected. I used it for the first time this morning and it works way better than my more expensive iron. And what a GREAT price! !!!</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for.  Heats up quick (and has a nice carrying case for travel).  Good for the price!</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron!  My hair is very, very straight and every time I tried to curl my hair with other products (curling irons and hot rollers) the curls would never stay longer than a couple of hours.  This curling iron is perfect - when I curl my hair with this iron, it stays all day and into the next day after sleeping.  It&#x27;s the best &amp; I cannot recommend it enough.</li>
            <li> This is by far one of the best curling irons I have ever used. I have gone through so many that never worked with my straight hair. Love this! It&#x27;s quick, easy and very effective.</li>
            <li> Very light weight, heats up quickly and has a small non stick barrel.  I really like the adjustable heat setting feature as well.</li>
            <li> This is the best Hair Curling Iron I have ever used.  It heats up instantly and keeps your hair smooth and shiny.  I love it!</li>
            <li> They do not curl as tight as I would like.  I don&#x27;t feel they get as hot as my Conair and purchase them as a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;I like the style but, the performance could be better.</li>
            <li> My mom is very happy with this gift.</li>
            <li> Great quality, 100% recommended! I love it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> It works perfect, and easy way. Curls are just fantastic!!! I really love this curling iron. It comes with a travel bag.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT NO MOE BURNING AND STICKY HAIR SRAY BUILD UPS</li>
            <li> This product makes perfect curls ..it gets very hot , so please caution when you use it.curls stay eaven without hairspray! Just what I needet!</li>
            <li> This was my first ceramic curling iron but have used Remington products for many years. The ceramics seem to heat up much quicker and produce a smoother, long lasting curl. I&#x27;ll definitely make other purchases - smaller barrel for tighter curls and flat irons.</li>
            <li> This is a good basic curling iron.  Has a temp control but no extra frills and works great.  Just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I bought it as a gift to myself using my Christmas gift cards and used it to do my hair on New Year&#x27;s Eve! My hair has a mind of its own when it comes to holding a curl, and my roommate had the Remington wand and I loved using that it worked well, but I find a curling iron like this is easier to use. I have medium short hair so this size barrel was awesome and it&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Day and my hair still looks great! Not as tight of a curl as last night but a nice natural wave. It was really easy to use as well the cord has a swivel feature so you don&#x27;t get tangled while you curl. Love it and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron.  Easy to use and hair does not slip away while rolling on clip.  Very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. It gives nice tight curls. Doesn&#x27;t seem to cinge the hair like some irons ive had in the past. I would recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> This curling iron met my expectations, yet I wish someone could tell me what product do they recommend so that the curls stay in longer, but other than that, this product is great!</li>
            <li> This does the job without ruining or burning hair and is perfect!!! This is the first time I tried a Remington Ceramic Curling Iron and I love it!!</li>
            <li> I was sure to test this before commenting. Received it earlier today with Final Fantasy 2 and a car charger. Works great. Fast shipping. I was worried at first because I heard terrible things about smartpost. It arrived at fed ex in grove city oh yesterday night and Columbus this morning. Got it from USPS around 11AM.</li>
            <li> Works great and heats very quickly. I also like the fact that it is ceramic, and is easier on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the way it works with automatic on, the settings, the automatic shut off features that make it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works great. Heats up super fast. You can change the temp. which is good for different lengths of hair.</li>
            <li> 5 stars all the way! my hair DOES NOT CURL. PERIOD. no matter how much product I put in my hair, it doesn&#x27;t stay curled longer than an hour or so. then I used this and my hair stayed curled for 3 days without hardly flattening at all! I love this and would recommend it to anyone who wants a high quality iron for a super low price!! loved it!!</li>
            <li> I have always used a flay iron. Sedu and Chi brands. Bought this just to try something different but wanted the shine that my flat irons give me. I LOVE this curling iron. So impressed with it. The price had me skeptical but I would pay triple with the results it gave me. Pretty spiral bouncy shiny curls. The pouch it comes with is worthless though because it is not heat resistant. I use mine for my flat iron anyway so who cares about the pouch. I keep mine out and ready to use. Buy this you will not be upset.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is sleek and amazing it has different settings and auto shut off after thirty seconds. Which is a great feature to have.</li>
            <li> Works well, gets nice and hot. Price fluctuated A LOT from one day to another (originally bought it for $30 and it was down to $20 the day after I received it in the mail...amazon made it right but it was a little bit of a pain).</li>
            <li> This is the best curling iron I have ever owned.  Easy to hold; holds the curl well; several temps to choose from.  It is just perfect.  I am considering purchasing another to keep in my camper.</li>
            <li> Totally recommend this product.  Its the perfect width, heats up fast, and doesn&#x27;t break the hair.  Salon quality! I have really long hair, and it take m 10 minutes to make the ends all pretty.  You WILL love it!</li>
            <li> This is a nice item for a good price. Heats up quick, and has a storage bag. I&#x27;m not a everyday curler but this is a nice addition to my hair styling tools.</li>
            <li> Esta Maquinita Es Wenisima Se La Compre a Mi Esposa Y Le Gusto Mucho Se Las Recomiendo Esa Mujer Salto Cuando Se La Regale :D</li>
            <li> It has no automatic turn off which is my primary concern with this product.  I&#x27;ve accidentally left it on one or two times and nearly burned down the house...</li>
            <li> I am in love with this curling iron. It heats really quickly, and the heat level is adjustable. I find it does not have to be in contact with my hair nearly as long as previous curling irons. The curls last longer. This is a great product, especially for the money.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this curling iron-it will not hold hair around the barrel-I&#x27;ve never had a curling iron that does that-useless!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic curling iron.  I stopped doing anything to my hair for about 20 years and got into the &amp;#34;natural look,&amp;#34; but I&#x27;m having fun again with hair and makeup.  I wanted a curling iron and liked the reviews on this one, and I have to say, it really works.  It&#x27;s very hot, and the barrel just glides over the hair.  The cord swivels, and it heats up fast.  Perhaps I am just having an Austin Powers moment, but it&#x27;s hard for me to believe that you could get a better curling iron if you spent more.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for my daughter who was dissatisfied with her current curling iron and she is very pleased.</li>
            <li> Somehow this iron seems clumsy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;The part that heats up is shorter than most I&#x27;ve used and I&#x27;ve burned my hand several times trying to get used to it.  Not my favorite curling iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good curling iron  i only use it four times and it broke so i threw it out :(&lt;br /&gt;i had to toss it in the Garbage as its usless now, i&#x27;m buying me new one</li>
            <li> I used this twice before the screw that held the handle popped off during curling. The screw is stripped after 1 use?! Sadly I can&#x27;t return it because I left it in its packaging for a while before using it. It&#x27;s too bad because the curl I got from the first use was great. I&#x27;m going to try the curl secret instead.</li>
            <li> So I have used many curling irons, from the cheapest to the more expensive brands.  My latest one before this one was a $60 curling iron that made me smell like burning all day.  I was tired of the smell, so I figured I would try something else out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really the best curling iron I have ever used.  It holds your hair tight and doesn&#x27;t slip; it DOESN&#x27;T smell like burning.  It gets just to the right temperature for my fine/normal hair and curls really quick.  The curls stay all day long.  I do wish I had bought a larger barrel, as 3/4&amp;#34; is fairly tight curls for my taste.  (And I will be doing that shortly.)  One bad thing:  the dial that turns the heat up or down turns WAY too easily.  Since I always use the highest heat setting, I just wrapped blue painter&#x27;s tape around the dial so it would stop turning down while I was curling.  It doesn&#x27;t look great, but hey, it&#x27;s a curling iron.</li>
            <li> I was shocked the way the curling iron broke. The curling iron just popped the spring went one way nuts.</li>
            <li> Grips hair well, I like the molded plastic stand since curling irons with a wire stand has been the first part to fail in my experience.</li>
            <li> This Curling iron is AWESOME.......I was shopping for a curling iron for a while and I came across this one on amazon. I read all the reivews everyone left and when I got it I was not disappointed at all. Love the fact that you can change the heat settings.</li>
            <li> I really love this iron, I just received it a few days ago and I am very pleased with it&#x27;s performance. Curls in seconds, easy to use and high quality.</li>
            <li> Nice but feels clumsy</li>
            <li> It curled hair. What the hell else do you need to know. PS it was for my wife. I don&#x27;t have hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for a great price.  Holds the hair, but slides through smoothly!  Thanks.</li>
            <li> This curling iron works great!  It heats up quickly and curls my naturally straight, fine hair easily!  I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Works well, heats fast, and hangles well.Enjoy it&#x27;s reliability and ease of handling. Would recommend it to anyone with dry straight hair.</li>
            <li> this is the best curler. My hair is fine but I have lots of hair. My curls never really would stay curled so i was always left with limp curls at the end of the day, but with this my curls last 3 days. Quality is far better than my 100$ iron and I love that the clip isn&#x27;t some cheap metal tong its a real sturdy clip that holds the hair in place to curl. Only drawback is that there is a slight gap towards the bottom of the curler and my hair can&#x27;t &amp;#34;grip&amp;#34; and falls through the curler and I have to re-curl. I just keep the hair in the middle of the iron. Other than that I love it and it was a great deal.</li>
            <li> Its ok my curls do not last or hold to long as I would like it.</li>
            <li> I really like that the end of the barrel stays cool.  It gives more control.  Heats up quickly. Great product for the $$.</li>
            <li> I DO like the 3/4\\&quot; size and I like the \\&quot;smaller\\&quot; handle - it&#x27;s just the right size for my hand.  The temp. dial seems to stay in place and is located in an appropriate location.  My BIG complaint, however, is that it doesn&#x27;t grip thinner/finer hair well and allows the hair to slip off the iron!  My hair is about mid-ear length and, obviously, thinner and finer hair.  There is just a little too much of a gap between the barrel and spring clip to easily hold onto the hair and so it tends to pull out, even though my length is long enough that I could wrap it twice around the barrel.  If I manipulate it *just so* it will work for me but I have to turn the barrel very carefully so the hair doesn&#x27;t slip out and sometimes it still doesn&#x27;t grip it sufficiently.  None of my other previous irons has done this so I&#x27;m debating whether to return or not.  I&#x27;d give this a 5 star if it didn&#x27;t do this and for long hair, it&#x27;s prob. perfectly fine, since the hair would be so thick around the barrel.</li>
            <li> Curls my hair in small sections well - my hair is long &amp; I go for ringlets that loosen up as the day goes on. The temperature dial is in a bad spot, though, and moves while I&#x27;m trying to curl my hair. I found the temp I like &amp; keep it in place with some electrical tape.</li>
            <li> Love the heat , styling , and all of the coating and seems better than others I have purchased. Love the swivel cord also.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, heat up really fast. Didn&#x60;t make my hair fuzzy at all, ( also I put some heat protection spray too )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have above shoulders length hair, the size of roll it&#x60;s perfect for hair length like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I think may need to change is the heat adjuster , sometimes I touched it and it changes the setting. But once you used to it, it won&#x60;t be a major problem anymore.</li>
            <li> i enjoyed this product worked as advertised</li>
            <li> So impressed with this curling iron: works great, heats up quickly and curls fabulously! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a good investment.</li>
            <li> This curler is really great. It hits up quickly and curls my hair really well. I like that it&#x27;s ceramic. It feels safer for my hair.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is the best! I just chopped my hair off to about shoulder length and this iron is the perfect size and shape for creating a gorgeous retro flipped &#x27;do in just minutes--great for someone like me who is always running a bit late! I always style my ultra-fine, stick-straight hair on the highest heat for maximum impact, and the heat setting on this bad boy doesn&#x27;t disappoint. When I used to flip out my hair, it would fall to an awkward mid-flip by midday and look awful, but my style lasts all day with this nifty iron. The ceramic clip does a great job of keeping a tight hold during curling so I don&#x27;t have to spend extra time styling irksome flyaways. The quality far exceeds my expectations considering the astonishingly low price. I am thrilled with this product!</li>
            <li> This thing is ready in seconds, I love it. The ability to control exactly how hot it gets is great, too, and it shuts off by itself if you forget about it, the cord swivels, so it won&#x27;t tangle or get tight on you as you turn it, and finally, the heat proof sleeve it comes with protects your other stuff from melting so you can actually put it away before it&#x27;s completely cool.  It&#x27;s got to be the best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that might be a con to me would be that it&#x27;s too easy to accidentally slightly change the temperature while you are curling. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, it does not move by much, and it&#x27;s easy and fast enough to just change it back as long as you are paying attention. It would not deter me from buying this one again.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this item. The temperature was not accurate an changes with out me manually doing it. I wish i could return it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is more than I expected.  I have been wanting one that has a shorter handle so I don&#x27;t have to hold it so far from my head.  It was a pleasant surprise to find this one has a shorter handle.  I have used it once and liked the smoother feel when pulling out the hair and rolling it around the rod.  So the ceramic material really is better than my old stainless barrel!  It&#x27;s difficult to explain, but combing out and arranging my hair resulted in a little nicer style than usual.  I also like the self contained plastic stand rather than a metal bail with which to set down the iron.  The numbered temperature gauge seems to be about correct when determining what your heat setting should be.  I&#x27;m tempted to buy a second one just so I don&#x27;t have to fuss around deciding what to purchase when this one quits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the very heavy molded plastic container which was extremely difficult to open.  And I have one of those yellow gizmos that is supposed to make it easier to cut this type of packaging to get out the item  - it usually does help, but this was the supreme test.  It took a lot of time, patience and made my hands sore.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough for a fair evaluation.  I don&#x27;t think it gets as hot as most that I have had in the past.  But if the heat is turned all the way up it works just fine.  I ordered it based on the fact that it had a 5 star rating from close to 200 evaluations.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron--it is the best I&#x27;ve ever had.  It curls very quickly on stubborn hair, and is smooth so hair does not tangle in it.  I recommend it!  One warning however--the manufacturer&#x27;s packaging was extremely difficult to open, it was like I was trying to open a bank vault with a butter knife.  It took me a verrrrry long time, a lot of frustration, several different types of scissors, knives, and tools from the garage, and a few curse words to finally get the packaging open!  Thinking about it stresses me out still!  Be prepared!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my sister and she absolutely loved it.  It works amazing and the curls are just perfect.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is very nice with great temperature gradation and gentle on your hair. Very good product and I would recommend any product from Remington!</li>
            <li> I did like the Remington CI5219 Instant Curls Ceramic Hair Curling Iron, 3/4 Inch size because the barrel was too large for short hair. I didn&#x27;t the the spring that clips onto your hair. This curling iron does not grip your hair in a way that you can rotate your hair around the curling iron. It leaves a crinkle on your curls and it is hard to smooth it out. Not the right size for short hair. I had to send it back.</li>
            <li> The item is exactly as it was described.  Heats quickly and was happy that it came with a heat proof &amp;#34;bag&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this curling iron the temp control great heats up fast and has automatic heat sensor shut off better quality than the ones that are so pricey in the Salon stores</li>
            <li> Well this curling iron heats up quickly and curls hair nice, I have mid length hair so it&#x27;s perfect for me. would recommend to anyone who looking a good curling iron..</li>
            <li> I was sceptical buying this becuase im use to hot tools and babyliss, but after buying this i realized i made the right decision. It heats us very quickly , my hair doesnt stick and burn and it leaves me with bouncy shiney curles. I would definatly recommend this to others to try. I have layered shoulder length hair and very fine hair also.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. I can use it to curl normally with the little clip thing, or just wrap my hair around and use it like a wand, it works all ways. And the price is great. I&#x27;m really happy I got it!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is awesome. My hair is very VERY hard to curl and hard to keep the curl.  It heat up very fast.  It does get very HOT though, so watch the controls the first time you use  it.</li>
            <li> curls quickly and curls last well</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron. It makes really cute curls, and I love using it without the clip and just wrapping my hair around the barrel. It makes really pretty curls, especially since the barrell is thinner. Heats up very quick if you are in a hurry to get your hair done!</li>
            <li> Gets hot, works well. However, I waste a lot of time using this iron because the temperature dial in a position that when you use it, your inadvertently turn it down or off!!! Very frustrating when you are working against the clock. Needs to be redesigned.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS GREAT. I USE IT LIKE A REGULAR CURLING IRON AND AS A WAND! VERY GOOD TO MAKE CURLS. IT&amp;#34;S ALSO GREAT BECAUSE IT HEATS UP VERY QUICKLY..DEFINITELY A MUST HAVE!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and hard to curl, but with this iron it&#x27;s effortless and easy to curl my hair, it gets super hot..i love it!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is magnificent! I thought it would just be a lil cheap iron to use on the side but boy was I wrong. This iron worked so well I used it on a recent photoshoot and it did not let me down. The barrel is a very quality ceramic &amp; it heats up very quickly. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so confused to which curler to get, and I think I made the right choice. It heats up really fast and the curls are exactly what I want them to be. It took me sometime to get the hang of it but once you get it, it works! The size is perfect, doesn&#x27;t make my curls too big and not too small. You just gotta learn how to hold it and how to curl your hair. Watch how your hairdresser does it, the way you love it and emulate! That&#x27;s my 2 cents.</li>
            <li> I like to have several different curling irons sizes for various hairstyles. This was a purchase to replace a broken iron which had switchable sizes.  I like this so much better.  The ceramic heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this iron it is the best. Curl right. And you can put up the heat to 450 I think I love how the curls come out when I use this iron.</li>
            <li> This is a great little ceramic curler. I prefer a tighter curl and this curler does the job.  It has the auto shutoff, which is a big plus. You never have to worry if you left your curlers on while you&#x27;re away. I also like this curler because it has a clasp to allow you to use it like a regular curling iron OR you can keep the clasp bar closed and use it for a wand.  It has so many features that are all great.  I purchased this as an ADD-ON ITEM, which is really, really nice in price (if you know what I mean).  And....it&#x27;s Remington. The curls are soft and bouncy. The curler is ceramic too which is less damaging to the hair.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am really impressed with this iron. It heats up quickly and has plenty of heat settings. It gets HOT! It is nice and smooth and does not pull on my hair. Creates really beautiful curls! Love the color! Great price too! Wish the cord was longer, but I can live with it. Great iron!</li>
            <li> This is a good product with variable heat adjustments to prevent you from burning out your hair.  It is light weight and comes with a cover to put it in when it is not in use.  I would recommend this unit to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this iron for a couple of years and decided to look on remington.com&lt;br /&gt;I sure was suprised to see it pop up. Thank you so much.&lt;br /&gt;  A well satisfied custoner.&lt;br /&gt;  Barb</li>
            <li> Works great. Heats fast with several settings. Also has auto shut off.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. I use it all the time.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and always had trouble holding a curl for a whole day. No more. This iron not only holds the curl (with no products used) but the next day I still have some curl!  It is hot so be careful and if not watched you can slip the button to off and not realize it (positional thing). But I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for! It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but works great!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  The price was good too.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is perfect! It curled my hair without burning it. Heats up fast and cools down fast. Didn&#x27;t need to leave it in my hair for more than a few seconds it works fast! My hair hardly holds curls and even after putting it up with multiple pins, taking it down, and sleeping on it my hair still had more curl in it than with previous curling irons. I hate using hairspray or mousse and didn&#x27;t have to with this iron. The price is unbeatable! After using it I would gladly pay way more for another. I will be buying this line from now on.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it . The iron was flimsy and doesnt work good at all. I thought it would have been better quality</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.  The dial moves every time you are using the clip.  I had to electric tape the dial to keep it at the setting I want, which as I said, even on the highest setting is not hot enough and I do not have hard to curl hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a Xmas prest for my gf, not knowing a lot about these things. However she loves it, and for the price I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li> I have very coarse, thick hair, and this curling iron works perfectly for my needs.  You can adjust the temperature setting and it has an auto-off switch.  Great value!!</li>
            <li> In love with this curling iron! I have been looking for a curling that can make my curls stick and I have finally got a winner!! I have really thin straight fine hair and my curls would always fall really easily!! Regardless of hairspray or not. This curling iron doesn&#x27;t only create long lasting curls but there beautiful and playful! Do with it what you please ladies, I recommend this iron !!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the worst curling iron I have ever bought. It never worked after the first time. Never heated again. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Curls wonderfully!</li>
            <li> It is not as good as the reviews I&#x27;ve read. I was disappointed but maybe one day it will come In handy.</li>
            <li> it is cheap and does what it needs to do well. no complaints, it was what was described on line.</li>
            <li> I bought this for travel because it got good reviews. It is light weight and no frills and di will probably only use it as a back up or to leave at the beach house. Like con air much better then this.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivered as promised.</li>
            <li> This makes it much easier to curl hair!  I love it! Not very expensive either.  For am iron that works this well, it&#x27;s definitely worth the money in my opinion.</li>
            <li> So far so good on this product.  My daughter rates it as &amp;#34;good&amp;#34;.  She hasn&#x27;t used it a ton yet but it seems to heat up quickly &amp; get the job done. Good value for price.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is fantastic. Once you unroll the curl it just stays and the hair looks shiny and healthy. I think the ceramic barrel is how this is accomplished. The hair does not look burned by excessive heat that you get with the others that are not ceramic.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t close tightly on hair making it hard to get a good curl. I&#x27;ve purchased Remington products before but these just aren&#x27;t the quality I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> Gets pretty hot pretty fast, maybe it&#x27;s just because I&#x27;ve been spoiled with my flat iron that has a digital screen that tells you the exact temperature, but it took a couple of minutes for me to gauge what setting would get this curling iron to about 330-350 degrees. the carrying sleeve is nice, though. Wish I had one for my flat iron!! :-) Great little styling tool for the price!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY A MUST HAVE FOR ANY HAIR TYPES. I LOVE THIS SO SO SO MUCH, if i could give this a 6/5 then i would. Please watch my tutoria/review  on this product on youtube, my channel is cocotommi512, or my name is yubin huh.</li>
            <li> Absolutely cannot beat this curling iron for the price -- even comes with a little velvet-y sleeve. I love the heat settings and it heats up almost immediately. I love it. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it for such an inexpensive product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty standard curling iron.  Temperature control is nice.  Auto shut off offers peace of mind.  It&#x27;s a little longer than I expected (not bad, just was thinking it would be a touch shorter) and the storage bag is pretty worthless...I can&#x27;t get the iron and cord to both fit in easily.</li>
            <li> This little curling iron works great.  I have a more expensive one with a wider barrel, and this one works better!  Nice soft curls on long hair!</li>
            <li> Love it! My curls always would fall with my old curling iron. This one heats up fast and the curls last all day.</li>
            <li> The switch on my otherwise ideal curling iron went bad within 3 months, and I found myself searching for a replacement that might hold up longer. This one is good, so far after a month or so. It heats very well, holds my hair and doesn&#x27;t slip off, and the switch works!</li>
            <li> I love it haven&#x27;t used one in five years and try to use it. Have to many fingers.LOL Good value</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! Heats up fast and works great</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Basic well-built curling iron at a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this curling iron as a present for my mom and she loves it! Uses it everyday. It is a nice design and heats up quickly</li>
            <li> It was hard finding a small rod curling iron for shorter hair.  The almost instant &amp;#34;on&amp;#34;  is fast and with the different heat settings it would be good for all types of hair.  Love the ease of use and it has it&#x27;s own built in resting stand.  No need to have the heated rod sitting on the counter top.</li>
            <li> No need to spend uber money on a curling iron. This one works great-heats up fast, doesn&#x27;t scorch my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help supplement my daughter&#x27;s curly hair. It had been a lot of years since I purchased a curling iron and if this is how they&#x27;ve evolved, it&#x27;s very exciting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gets hotter than the ones I remember in my own youth. It does have a clip, which for me, is a necessity, since I don&#x27;t curl hair very often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up quickly and has variable heat settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curls come out soft shiny and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I only had this curling iron 3 1/3 months and it just quit heating. The design of it was horrible. The nob that controls the heat selection always turned while you were curling your hair. It was placed it the worst place as far as how your hands use the iron. I have purchased many irons over the years and they all lasted at least a couple years. I have never had one quit within 3 months..The thing is junk!!</li>
            <li> I will not recommend to buy the product.&lt;br /&gt;It broke less than 2 weeks with a few times of use. it does not heat properly.</li>
            <li> I received this item and the first thing it does is not heat up! So I called Amazon and they are sending me a brand new one...hopefully this one will heat up.</li>
    </ol>
