            <li>Some eyeliners tend to leave a bright shine, this one doesn&#x27;t as much.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It is really good.</li>
            <li>Good liquid consistency too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product</li>

            <li>Nice product</li>
            <li>I love the eyeliner itself and the brush because it just looks so good after applying.</li>
            <li>product has nice shiny appearance which remains after it dries.  </li>
            <li>and I honestly Thor</li>
            <li>Love it &amp; the price was good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Love love love IT!</li>
            <li>If they had a higher quality brush or a felt tip, this would be a great product.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the brush applicator.</li>
            <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal Products and this is one I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay eyeliner for something you can get at a drugstore, but why have just okay eyeliner (unless you are stranded, in need of eyeliner, and at a drugstore)?</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>Love it, and it was delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>my favorite eyeliner is now a click away.  </li>
            <li>Furthermore, I am now exploring Amazon for more of my make up items... quite convenient.</li>
            <li>For top-</li>
            <li>i keep buying this same product over and over again because its perfect.</li>
            <li>When Mary Kay stopped making their liquid eye liner, I searched and tried many.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>This product was also prone to flaking but for the most part did not budge.</li>
            <li>Love It!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy Angelique Sprague</li>
            <li>Been using this for years I love it as its water proof and</li>
            <li>I dip and use the excess that might be on the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>and it might run but not terribly.</li>
            <li>Just would like L&#x27;Oreal to try using firmer brushes for this type of application, it would be a top seller.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>Of course, it was my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this liquid liner.  </li>
            <li>I will never ever use this again and to top if off there is no name on the liner.</li>
            <li>I would have came out better going to a beauty supply store</li>
            <li>The reviews were so great that I thought I&#x27;d take a gamble and see if something this cheap could be as good as my regular liner.  </li>
            <li>Comparable to Kat Von D&#x27;s Immortal Love Liquid Eyeliner but even better as it doesnt smudge or smear and super easy to apply!</li>
            <li>The was one of the best liquid eyeliners I had ever used--it was easy to apply (though you have to wait for it to dry before touching your eyelids) and stayed all day without smearing or wearing off.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, nice bold lines.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and lasts all day without smudges.</li>
            <li>Easy to work with.</li>
            <li>Just goes on easily and lasts.</li>
            <li>Its great--so easy applying , and it stays on.. have ordered this twice before and will continue doing so.</li>
            <li>It is also easy taking off.</li>
            <li>I have oily lids and it doesn&#x27;t move as easily as some products do.</li>
            <li>The formula of the liquid makes it easy to put on and even easier to adjust - wipe</li>
            <li>It seems easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, no muss no fuss.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>Works perfectly every time until it is too old to use, and that can be up to 5 or 6 months old.</li>
            <li>Glides on smooth with no clumps and causes no discomfort to my contacts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s cheaply priced</li>
            <li>but then again it&#x27;s a cheap product.</li>
            <li>This eye liner goes in so smoothly and does not cake or flake..</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>It makes everyone&#x27;s face just light up.  </li>
            <li>The tip of the brush is so smooth</li>
            <li>The liner goes on smooth, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>aside from my defective bottle, which as far as I can tell hasn&#x27;t happened to anyone else, the product was really good.</li>
            <li>But after a while I guess you get used to it, but the color is awesome, it&#x27;s a true black</li>
            <li>This kind of design requires a think, steady brush.</li>
            <li>The brush in this product is fine to give precision, but also the right amount of flexible, so that it makes application easy and forgiving.  </li>
            <li>Liked IT completely!!</li>
            <li>It lasts for about 12 hours usually so that is great!</li>
            <li>I am not particularly sensitive to any cosmetic products nor have I ever experienced an allergic/chemical reaction from makeup.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t provide as fine a line as I had hoped but for a liquid liner, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this eyeliner every day for years now, it&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li>but it is still not bad</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smear easily and dries very fast</li>
            <li>I love the soft brush, it makes is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t super shiny.</li>
            <li>I have used several different liquid eyeliners and THIS is the best for the price!</li>
            <li>Overall I would have to say this is the best liquid eyeliner you will find until the same thing comes out waterproof.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 20 years - it was the very first piece of makeup I ever used.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It applies so easily and is very definitive.  </li>
            <li>applicator has a great brush which can make fine line or thick per your preference.  </li>
            <li>When you open your eyes, it will look like a fine line across the top that just makes your eyes pop.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this one by far.</li>
            <li>I spend far more time applying it and fixing the smears than with my L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>This eye liner is not really black, is more like an &amp;#34;off black&amp;#34; or a gray.</li>
            <li>She was right.</li>
            <li>Price was right for the amount of liner you get.</li>
            <li>os lining the top of my lids with a nice slick line</li>
            <li>The brush is precise (if you have a steady hand).  </li>
            <li>It is soft but it is easy to use and works for lining and details like cat eyes.</li>
            <li>can easily take it off with abundance water and a soft soap or makeup remover.</li>
            <li>This was my first liquid liner, so as far as the actual liner goes, I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>I make my lash line really thin (which requires practice at the beginning) and the product has always worked perfect, with or with out eye shadows, is easy to apply especially for the bush tip it has, no need to pull your eye lid.</li>
            <li>tried lots of different types of liquid eyeliner and this comes out on top.</li>
            <li>After using this for the last 3 days, it is now my favorite liner.  </li>
            <li>, it stays on all day and dries pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When you first get it, the liquid coats the brush</li>
            <li>Also, some of them are pen liquid eyeliners not the brush tip, which is preferrable for an exact line.  </li>
            <li>Took me six months to finish the first tube.</li>
            <li>is because, it doesn&#x27;t run on my oily skin, even though it is not waterproof I can be sure the eyeliner will last all day on my eye.</li>
            <li>The top seal came out after several times uses ...</li>
            <li>(user error is usually responsible for the rare imperfect applications)</li>
            <li>I will find another more reliable brand in the future.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a busy woman who needs fast and easy make up in the morning.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and each bottle lasts more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason why I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li>Hands down my favorite liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li>Love this eyeliner, makes nice thin lines and does not iritate my eyes.</li>
            <li>&amp; I want something similar because it&#x27;s just such a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>You have to wipe the brush on the inner side of the bottle before sweeping product on the top of your eyelids (otherwise the brush will have too much product on it) and dot on the bottom eyelid until fully lined.</li>
            <li>but I find this liner pretty easy to use and definitely preferable to pencils.. with the exception to difficulty on the bottom lid.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re willing to spend the money, I really like MACs Penultimate eyeliner.</li>
            <li>the brush is very tiny at the end to make it easy to use on your eyes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very critical and don&#x27;t give out 5 stars easily.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this eyeliner to anyone who wants a nice slightly shine look.</li>
            <li>A couple of years ago I thought the black had gotten too harsh with my maturing skin, so I switched to brown, which is perfect.</li>
            <li>later I&#x27;m fine but wouldn&#x27;t dare try this again.</li>
            <li>No liner is as good as the liquid liners &amp; they&#x27;re getting hard to find.</li>
            <li>Bought this by accident at Walgreens, not paying too much attention and thinking I was buying mascara.  </li>
            <li>Much easier to just order 3 at a time on Amazon and be done with it.  </li>
            <li>The liner stays on very well.  </li>
            <li>Dries fast.</li>
            <li>honestly only ordered this to meet the minimum requirement for free shipping.  </li>
            <li>very long-lasting &amp; no flaking...great for aging eyelids.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I am very fond of eyeliners.</li>
            <li>REALLY DUDE ?</li>
            <li>I have good things to say and negative.</li>
            <li>this works perfect for drawing a thin line against the upper lashes.  </li>
            <li>Clean line, easy to apply, long lasting.</li>
            <li>This liquid eyeliner goes on better than any other liquid eyeliner that I have used before.</li>
            <li>It really is a great product, and I&#x27;m disappointed to not be able to use this product anymore.</li>
            <li>The small tip is great for precise lines and is very black.  </li>
            <li>No matter how many times L&#x27;Oreal tries to create a new eyeliner product, they are never going to match this one.  </li>
            <li>Lasts all day and the brush is awesome at getting precise lines, thick or thin.</li>
            <li>The pigment is wonderfully dark in comparison to most eyeliners that seem watered down or more of a charcoal vs</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter what shape your eyes are, big or small; run a fine line along (almost on top of)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge later.</li>
            <li>I wanted the L&#x27;Oreal eye liner that I had, but they no longer make that particular one.</li>
            <li>Brush tips (good ones) are getting harder &amp; harder to find.  </li>
            <li>---it does clump a little more than I would like...</li>
            <li>But it was sooo easy to use the other brands I&#x27;ve tried sucked.</li>
            <li>you can get a very fine line with it or go over a second time for a more dramatic evening look.  </li>
            <li>only thing about this is that it isn&#x27;t super quick drying - maybe about a minute to fully dry.</li>
            <li>The product is good but too pricey and the shipping cost, makes it worse.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t read the description properly, I didn&#x27;t really mean to by the brush tip and was looking for the felt tip brush, BUT besides that point the product itself is really amazing!</li>
            <li>so it won&#x27;t affect my future purchase of L&#x27;Oreal product, although I think I will stick to local instead of online purchases (so that it can be returned easily.)</li>
            <li>I cannot live without a liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Stays on great, and easy to apply thick or thin.</li>
            <li>Thick cat eyes were pretty easy though.</li>
            <li>it is not hard to use but it might irritate your eyelid if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The handle is pretty far from the actual brush and if like me, you feel the need to steady your hand with a finger on your face, this will definitely take some practice to not apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, except for being a little less waterproof (and that&#x27;s actually a good thing when you&#x27;re trying to remove it to take off your makeup)</li>
            <li>The product is fine for upper eyelids, but I find doing the lower ones, which I had mostly bought it for, quite difficult.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive eyes it makes mine burn sometimes.</li>
            <li>This time I just used my old brush.</li>
            <li>I suspect the product I received must be old, although no date is indicated on the package.  </li>
            <li>very pleasantly surprised by this liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li>It smooths on very evenly and fluidly.</li>
            <li>The liner brush is too soft.</li>
            <li>It must be an old design.</li>
            <li>Who knows how old.</li>
            <li>The brush is too soft, the lashes get in the way, so it smears.</li>
            <li>but the lines are as thin or thick as u pls and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li>I can do perfect lines with it - thick or thin.  </li>
            <li>clean, reapply, if you mess up.  </li>
            <li>I love this eye liner and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in the stores!  </li>
            <li>can make a bold cat-eye to a super thin line and without skipping lines.  </li>
            <li>definitely like the eye liner itself, but would prefer a shorter wand to make a steady application easier.</li>
            <li>Better safe than sorry, maybe I better stick with my usual eyeliner for a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and is a solid black.</li>
            <li>I used it a couple of times pushing the piece back in with my nail, but this last time when it popped out, it got a large amount (maybe 1/16 tsp?)</li>
            <li>don’t wear eye liner or mascara on my lower lid, but if applied with too much pressure on the brush, I do find I need to do clean-up on the lower, especially on the inner corner of my eye and have gotten the product in my eye a couple of times.&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I accidentally make my line too thick, I just take a Q-tip and wet it and pull off the excess-it comes right off and still leaves a clean line.</li>
            <li>Other than that good product if you are between eyeliners and like thin lines for drug store prices.</li>
            <li>They must have improved the brush that many of these reviews complain about because this is a very delicate one.</li>
            <li>The brush applicator is long, small, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand of liner for many years &amp; never had a single complaint.</li>
            <li>My sister used this eyeliner on her face for day of the dead detailing and it worked well with other makeup and washed off easily.</li>
            <li>Smooth application and looks nice, probably not best for making really thin lines.</li>
            <li>However, every time I&#x27;ve ordered it over the past 1-2 years (no matter where I place the order), the rubber part in the mouth of the bottle pops right out.</li>
            <li>Eyeliner was grey, not black.</li>
            <li>It is NOT water proof and makes a huge mess when crying or jumping in a pool.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do have to dab excess product off the inside of the brush when pulling it out for use because it pulls a lot each time, and you need a steady hand; but you can make your lines as thick or thin as you like (or progress them as you go from inside to out) very easily with this brush.&lt;br</li>

            <li> great product and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> THe day I found it on Amazon was a great day..</li>
            <li> It made my eyes look great.</li>
            <li> I was not to happy with the point on the brush however</li>
            <li> I am not at all experienced in using liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> This product is great and does what it says.</li>
            <li> This works great for me</li>
            <li> Great stuff and would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and thinks this product is great too.  </li>
            <li> Great texture on the liquid also, amazing pigment!</li>
            <li> easy to apply and the brush tip is perfect length.</li>
            <li> Some eyeliners tend to leave a bright shine, this one doesn&#x27;t as much.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It is really good.</li>
            <li> Good liquid consistency too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> this is a great eyeliner, much more forgiving than the felt tip applicators.  </li>
            <li> I bought it at a better price than I get at Walmart!</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> love this liner!</li>
            <li> Love the brush applicator!</li>
            <li> I use this eye liner for 10 year (and I really love it!)</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased that I can stock up on it here on amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never be able to leave the house again!  </li>
            <li> Nice product</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliner itself and the brush because it just looks so good after applying.</li>
            <li> product has nice shiny appearance which remains after it dries.  </li>
            <li> and I honestly Thor</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; the price was good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Love love love IT!</li>
            <li> If they had a higher quality brush or a felt tip, this would be a great product.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the brush applicator.</li>
            <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Products and this is one I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay eyeliner for something you can get at a drugstore, but why have just okay eyeliner (unless you are stranded, in need of eyeliner, and at a drugstore)?</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> Love it, and it was delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> my favorite eyeliner is now a click away.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, I am now exploring Amazon for more of my make up items... quite convenient.</li>
            <li> For top-</li>
            <li> i keep buying this same product over and over again because its perfect.</li>
            <li> When Mary Kay stopped making their liquid eye liner, I searched and tried many.  </li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> This product was also prone to flaking but for the most part did not budge.</li>
            <li> Love It!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy Angelique Sprague</li>
            <li> Been using this for years I love it as its water proof and</li>
            <li> I dip and use the excess that might be on the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> and it might run but not terribly.</li>
            <li> Just would like L&#x27;Oreal to try using firmer brushes for this type of application, it would be a top seller.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Of course, it was my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this liquid liner.  </li>
            <li> I will never ever use this again and to top if off there is no name on the liner.</li>
            <li> I would have came out better going to a beauty supply store</li>
            <li> The reviews were so great that I thought I&#x27;d take a gamble and see if something this cheap could be as good as my regular liner.  </li>
            <li> Comparable to Kat Von D&#x27;s Immortal Love Liquid Eyeliner but even better as it doesnt smudge or smear and super easy to apply!</li>
            <li> The was one of the best liquid eyeliners I had ever used--it was easy to apply (though you have to wait for it to dry before touching your eyelids) and stayed all day without smearing or wearing off.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, nice bold lines.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts all day without smudges.</li>
            <li> Easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Just goes on easily and lasts.</li>
            <li> Its great--so easy applying , and it stays on.. have ordered this twice before and will continue doing so.</li>
            <li> It is also easy taking off.</li>
            <li> I have oily lids and it doesn&#x27;t move as easily as some products do.</li>
            <li> The formula of the liquid makes it easy to put on and even easier to adjust - wipe</li>
            <li> It seems easy to apply.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, no muss no fuss.</li>
            <li> Easy to use</li>
            <li> Works perfectly every time until it is too old to use, and that can be up to 5 or 6 months old.</li>
            <li> Glides on smooth with no clumps and causes no discomfort to my contacts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaply priced</li>
            <li> but then again it&#x27;s a cheap product.</li>
            <li> This eye liner goes in so smoothly and does not cake or flake..</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> It makes everyone&#x27;s face just light up.  </li>
            <li> The tip of the brush is so smooth</li>
            <li> The liner goes on smooth, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> aside from my defective bottle, which as far as I can tell hasn&#x27;t happened to anyone else, the product was really good.</li>
            <li> But after a while I guess you get used to it, but the color is awesome, it&#x27;s a true black</li>
            <li> This kind of design requires a think, steady brush.</li>
            <li> The brush in this product is fine to give precision, but also the right amount of flexible, so that it makes application easy and forgiving.  </li>
            <li> Liked IT completely!!</li>
            <li> It lasts for about 12 hours usually so that is great!</li>
            <li> I am not particularly sensitive to any cosmetic products nor have I ever experienced an allergic/chemical reaction from makeup.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide as fine a line as I had hoped but for a liquid liner, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this eyeliner every day for years now, it&#x27;s my absolute favorite.</li>
            <li> but it is still not bad</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smear easily and dries very fast</li>
            <li> I love the soft brush, it makes is so easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t super shiny.</li>
            <li> I have used several different liquid eyeliners and THIS is the best for the price!</li>
            <li> Overall I would have to say this is the best liquid eyeliner you will find until the same thing comes out waterproof.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years - it was the very first piece of makeup I ever used.  </li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eyeliner.</li>
            <li> It applies so easily and is very definitive.  </li>
            <li> applicator has a great brush which can make fine line or thick per your preference.  </li>
            <li> When you open your eyes, it will look like a fine line across the top that just makes your eyes pop.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this one by far.</li>
            <li> I spend far more time applying it and fixing the smears than with my L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> This eye liner is not really black, is more like an &amp;#34;off black&amp;#34; or a gray.</li>
            <li> She was right.</li>
            <li> Price was right for the amount of liner you get.</li>
            <li> os lining the top of my lids with a nice slick line</li>
            <li> The brush is precise (if you have a steady hand).  </li>
            <li> It is soft but it is easy to use and works for lining and details like cat eyes.</li>
            <li> can easily take it off with abundance water and a soft soap or makeup remover.</li>
            <li> This was my first liquid liner, so as far as the actual liner goes, I thought it was pretty good.</li>
            <li> I make my lash line really thin (which requires practice at the beginning) and the product has always worked perfect, with or with out eye shadows, is easy to apply especially for the bush tip it has, no need to pull your eye lid.</li>
            <li> tried lots of different types of liquid eyeliner and this comes out on top.</li>
            <li> After using this for the last 3 days, it is now my favorite liner.  </li>
            <li> , it stays on all day and dries pretty quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When you first get it, the liquid coats the brush</li>
            <li> Also, some of them are pen liquid eyeliners not the brush tip, which is preferrable for an exact line.  </li>
            <li> Took me six months to finish the first tube.</li>
            <li> is because, it doesn&#x27;t run on my oily skin, even though it is not waterproof I can be sure the eyeliner will last all day on my eye.</li>
            <li> The top seal came out after several times uses ...</li>
            <li> (user error is usually responsible for the rare imperfect applications)</li>
            <li> I will find another more reliable brand in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a busy woman who needs fast and easy make up in the morning.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and each bottle lasts more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason why I love this eyeliner</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner, makes nice thin lines and does not iritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> &amp; I want something similar because it&#x27;s just such a good eyeliner.</li>
            <li> You have to wipe the brush on the inner side of the bottle before sweeping product on the top of your eyelids (otherwise the brush will have too much product on it) and dot on the bottom eyelid until fully lined.</li>
            <li> but I find this liner pretty easy to use and definitely preferable to pencils.. with the exception to difficulty on the bottom lid.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re willing to spend the money, I really like MACs Penultimate eyeliner.</li>
            <li> the brush is very tiny at the end to make it easy to use on your eyes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very critical and don&#x27;t give out 5 stars easily.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this eyeliner to anyone who wants a nice slightly shine look.</li>
            <li> A couple of years ago I thought the black had gotten too harsh with my maturing skin, so I switched to brown, which is perfect.</li>
            <li> later I&#x27;m fine but wouldn&#x27;t dare try this again.</li>
            <li> No liner is as good as the liquid liners &amp; they&#x27;re getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> Bought this by accident at Walgreens, not paying too much attention and thinking I was buying mascara.  </li>
            <li> Much easier to just order 3 at a time on Amazon and be done with it.  </li>
            <li> The liner stays on very well.  </li>
            <li> Dries fast.</li>
            <li> honestly only ordered this to meet the minimum requirement for free shipping.  </li>
            <li> very long-lasting &amp; no flaking...great for aging eyelids.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I am very fond of eyeliners.</li>
            <li> REALLY DUDE ?</li>
            <li> I have good things to say and negative.</li>
            <li> this works perfect for drawing a thin line against the upper lashes.  </li>
            <li> Clean line, easy to apply, long lasting.</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner goes on better than any other liquid eyeliner that I have used before.</li>
            <li> It really is a great product, and I&#x27;m disappointed to not be able to use this product anymore.</li>
            <li> The small tip is great for precise lines and is very black.  </li>
            <li> No matter how many times L&#x27;Oreal tries to create a new eyeliner product, they are never going to match this one.  </li>
            <li> Lasts all day and the brush is awesome at getting precise lines, thick or thin.</li>
            <li> The pigment is wonderfully dark in comparison to most eyeliners that seem watered down or more of a charcoal vs</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter what shape your eyes are, big or small; run a fine line along (almost on top of)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge later.</li>
            <li> I wanted the L&#x27;Oreal eye liner that I had, but they no longer make that particular one.</li>
            <li> Brush tips (good ones) are getting harder &amp; harder to find.  </li>
            <li> ---it does clump a little more than I would like...</li>
            <li> But it was sooo easy to use the other brands I&#x27;ve tried sucked.</li>
            <li> you can get a very fine line with it or go over a second time for a more dramatic evening look.  </li>
            <li> only thing about this is that it isn&#x27;t super quick drying - maybe about a minute to fully dry.</li>
            <li> The product is good but too pricey and the shipping cost, makes it worse.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description properly, I didn&#x27;t really mean to by the brush tip and was looking for the felt tip brush, BUT besides that point the product itself is really amazing!</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t affect my future purchase of L&#x27;Oreal product, although I think I will stick to local instead of online purchases (so that it can be returned easily.)</li>
            <li> I cannot live without a liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> Stays on great, and easy to apply thick or thin.</li>
            <li> Thick cat eyes were pretty easy though.</li>
            <li> it is not hard to use but it might irritate your eyelid if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The handle is pretty far from the actual brush and if like me, you feel the need to steady your hand with a finger on your face, this will definitely take some practice to not apply too much pressure.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, except for being a little less waterproof (and that&#x27;s actually a good thing when you&#x27;re trying to remove it to take off your makeup)</li>
            <li> The product is fine for upper eyelids, but I find doing the lower ones, which I had mostly bought it for, quite difficult.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive eyes it makes mine burn sometimes.</li>
            <li> This time I just used my old brush.</li>
            <li> I suspect the product I received must be old, although no date is indicated on the package.  </li>
            <li> very pleasantly surprised by this liquid eyeliner.  </li>
            <li> It smooths on very evenly and fluidly.</li>
            <li> The liner brush is too soft.</li>
            <li> It must be an old design.</li>
            <li> Who knows how old.</li>
            <li> The brush is too soft, the lashes get in the way, so it smears.</li>
            <li> but the lines are as thin or thick as u pls and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> I can do perfect lines with it - thick or thin.  </li>
            <li> clean, reapply, if you mess up.  </li>
            <li> I love this eye liner and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in the stores!  </li>
            <li> can make a bold cat-eye to a super thin line and without skipping lines.  </li>
            <li> definitely like the eye liner itself, but would prefer a shorter wand to make a steady application easier.</li>
            <li> Better safe than sorry, maybe I better stick with my usual eyeliner for a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is a solid black.</li>
            <li> I used it a couple of times pushing the piece back in with my nail, but this last time when it popped out, it got a large amount (maybe 1/16 tsp?)</li>
            <li> don’t wear eye liner or mascara on my lower lid, but if applied with too much pressure on the brush, I do find I need to do clean-up on the lower, especially on the inner corner of my eye and have gotten the product in my eye a couple of times.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I accidentally make my line too thick, I just take a Q-tip and wet it and pull off the excess-it comes right off and still leaves a clean line.</li>
            <li> Other than that good product if you are between eyeliners and like thin lines for drug store prices.</li>
            <li> They must have improved the brush that many of these reviews complain about because this is a very delicate one.</li>
            <li> The brush applicator is long, small, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of liner for many years &amp; never had a single complaint.</li>
            <li> My sister used this eyeliner on her face for day of the dead detailing and it worked well with other makeup and washed off easily.</li>
            <li> Smooth application and looks nice, probably not best for making really thin lines.</li>
            <li> However, every time I&#x27;ve ordered it over the past 1-2 years (no matter where I place the order), the rubber part in the mouth of the bottle pops right out.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner was grey, not black.</li>
            <li> It is NOT water proof and makes a huge mess when crying or jumping in a pool.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do have to dab excess product off the inside of the brush when pulling it out for use because it pulls a lot each time, and you need a steady hand; but you can make your lines as thick or thin as you like (or progress them as you go from inside to out) very easily with this brush.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it looks and if you make a mistake its as easy as swiping a wet Q-tip to esrase it, not good if your a crier, runs badly, but keep one in your purse and your good to go</li>
            <li> While the product is pretty good in that it seems to stay on as long as you don&#x27;t get wet eyes, the brush made it impossible to apply as I wanted to!</li>
            <li> In my experience L&#x27;Oreal generally makes a good product, and although disappointed, I think it must have been shelved too long</li>
            <li> WHAT A MESS --- &amp; every new bottle is the same.</li>
            <li> Took a few days until they were completely back to normal.</li>
            <li> , it completely rivals my super expensive eye liner.  </li>
            <li> Growing up, I have tried just about every type of eye liner there is - different shades, pencil, marker tip, different brands - expensive and cheap</li>
            <li> It last a long time.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to write a product review for a L&#x27;Oreal product that is less than satisfactory.  </li>
            <li> It carries a lot of liquid which means long time use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It lasts all day long</li>
            <li> I wear minimal make-up and my basic make up application</li>
            <li> I will say though that the makeup itself tends to stick for a long time, so I&#x27;ve been using a brush from another brand&#x27;s and this one&#x27;s makeup.</li>
            <li> Brush is very fine which allows you to control how thick or thin you want the line..</li>
            <li> Takes a LONG time to dry after applying.</li>
            <li> Listen to the other reviewers and purchase a different brush for this product.</li>
            <li> I opened a second tube I had bought, and my eyelids started itching and swelling a few hours later.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s better or worse than smearing or flaking, but either way, it looked pretty weird by the end.</li>
            <li> Only thing I saw that helped was placing black eyeshadow over it.</li>
            <li> Definitely go with this \\&quot;Black</li>
            <li> of eyeliner on my hands and would&#x27;ve made a bigger mess</li>
            <li> The fine brush tip gives me control of how thick or thin I want the liner to be.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used eyeliners like Milani and it would LAST even through sweat or a few tears.</li>
            <li> The next day my eyelids were swollen and dried.</li>
            <li> This eye liner seem like putting a coat of plastic on your eyes and then a few hours later it peels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found any other liner even close.  </li>
            <li> no more searching through the multiple aisles of mascara..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other liquid liners, so I can&#x27;t testify to better/best-</li>
            <li> I thought maybe there was something wrong with that specific tube, so I ordered a third pack and got it in the mail a week later.</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again due to the brush.</li>
            <li> Very weird that this didn&#x27;t happen with the first tube I bought, and this is the only beauty product I&#x27;ve ever been allergic to.</li>
            <li> It still smudged for me (probably my oily skin), but much less than other eyeliners.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not really liking this eye liner, once I put it on and wait about a few hours.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not meant for lower down</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Very black.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s black streaks!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I always get it in black.</li>
            <li> I wish it was really black...</li>
            <li> It is difficult to draw a thin line or to get product to go on smoothly (a drop hangs onto the end of the tip)</li>
            <li> (Note - they tried to improve the formula with a 2x black version, which I do not recommend - it burns)  </li>
            <li> Lasts a half hour before you are picking it out of the whites of your eyes and reapplying some eyeliner to your lids.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has decent staying power (not best when sweating or tears)</li>
            <li> I tried the ones that look like little markers.  </li>
            <li> I am a sucker for a liquid eyeliner and believe it or not, they are hard to find in your local store.  </li>
            <li> but liquid eyeliner are few in numbers.  </li>
            <li> The suction mechanism in the tube also makes for a messy finish when I screw it shut.</li>
            <li> I like the narrow brush too</li>
            <li> i do not enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> I have trouble getting a thin enough line with everything else.  </li>
            <li> The color was very black and opaque</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this eyeliner based alone on other customer reviews, but I am extremely disappointed with the product recieved.</li>
            <li> The next morning I woke up to painful, red inflamed eyelids -ouch!</li>
            <li> when i first used it i was skeptical and angry because the brush isn&#x27;t stiff and moves around.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Slightly thinner formula than other eye liner I’ve used, it took me a few times before I got used to applying a thin line.  </li>
            <li> It went on well, if a little thick, and kept from smudging well.</li>
            <li> thick heavy black.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and usually buy at drugstores.</li>
            <li> Immediately after applying this to both eyes it felt very heavy on my eyelids.</li>
            <li> It glides on very easily, no need to remove smudges while applying.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a rating less than POOR because they&#x27;ve earned it.</li>
            <li> The brush tip is always hard to use</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner because of the high star rating but when it showed up I was beyond disappointed.</li>
            <li> Mostly negative, hence the amount of stars given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve being using this eyeliner for at least 8 years.</li>
            <li> The brush is too thick at the end....</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if your what a thick eye lash line.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The included brush is too thick and the eyeliner does not go on evenly.</li>
            <li> I found this hard to control and could not make a thin line.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an eyeliner with a thin brush applicator.  </li>
            <li> After applying this eyeliner my eyes swelled up and became extremely red and painful.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good look for L&#x27;oreal either way.</li>
            <li> so one can do thin line or the thick one.</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said the brush on this liner sucks!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product ever since a classmate in junior high told me that a very thin line at the base of my lashes would make them look thicker.</li>
            <li> it needs to be thinner to make a thin line....</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeliner and it is absolutely the worst........</li>
            <li> But after a few days my eyes started to swell up really badly.</li>
            <li> The brush had some loose bristles that I couldn&#x27;t pull out and that made it impossible to apply this to my eyes!</li>
            <li> It gets really annoying; you get black liquid all over your hands and under your nails.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to control the amount of product that sticks to the wand when it comes out of the tube.</li>
            <li> I was so relieved to finally hear somebody else comment on the worthless bottle for this eyeliner!!!</li>
            <li> Makes me sad ):</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> Difficult to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Also it is very difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> The tip of the brush is seriously the worst I have ever seen on liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> This gives them a bad name.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s how bad it is.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Really annoying when I blink and it bleeds or smudges.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The rubber part around the mouth of the bottle that keeps the brush in place and prevents the liquid from pouring out is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Is one of the best liquid eye liner</li>
            <li> Easy to use and lasts all day without smudges. Glides on smooth with no clumps and causes no discomfort to my contacts.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner. I bought it at a better price than I get at Walmart! I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have good things to say and negative. Mostly negative, hence the amount of stars given.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very black. The pigment is wonderfully dark in comparison to most eyeliners that seem watered down or more of a charcoal vs thick heavy black.&lt;br /&gt;- Isn&#x27;t super shiny. Some eyeliners tend to leave a bright shine, this one doesn&#x27;t as much.&lt;br /&gt;- The brush applicator is long, small, and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;- You get a LOT. It carries a lot of liquid which means long time use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Chips off during the day. Yep, eats away and I have to reapply every day. I don&#x27;t have oily skin or sweaty eyes....I can&#x27;t imagine people who do what they have to go through with this. Only thing I saw that helped was placing black eyeshadow over it. Makes it last somewhat longer.&lt;br /&gt;- If you have sensitive eyes it makes mine burn sometimes. Also made one of my eyes swell and water for two days after getting some accidentally in.&lt;br /&gt;- Is not waterproof whatsoever. I know it doesn&#x27;t say it is....but I&#x27;ve used eyeliners like Milani and it would LAST even through sweat or a few tears. Any bit of water touches this and it&#x27;s black streaks!&lt;br /&gt;- Takes a LONG time to dry after applying. Really annoying when I blink and it bleeds or smudges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product unless using for costuming. My sister used this eyeliner on her face for day of the dead detailing and it worked well with other makeup and washed off easily. But it DID chip off towards the end of the day and had to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheaply priced but then again it&#x27;s a cheap product. I would not buy this eyeliner. Go elsewhere and save yourself multiple headaches!</li>
            <li> The eyeliner is a great product.  It applies so easily and is very definitive.  I cannot live without a liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this eyeliner every day for years now, it&#x27;s my absolute favorite. Lasts all day and the brush is awesome at getting precise lines, thick or thin. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried lots of different types of liquid eyeliner and this comes out on top. It lasts all day long and I always have people asking me what brand I use because they want to buy some for themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they ever quit making it, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do!</li>
            <li> great product and lasts all day. when i first used it i was skeptical and angry because the brush isn&#x27;t stiff and moves around. but the lines are as thin or thick as u pls and the quality is excellent.</li>
            <li> great product! Easy to work with. Love the brush applicator.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t provide as fine a line as I had hoped but for a liquid liner, it&#x27;s good enough.</li>
            <li> I have used several different liquid eyeliners and THIS is the best for the price! Comparable to Kat Von D&#x27;s Immortal Love Liquid Eyeliner but even better as it doesnt smudge or smear and super easy to apply! LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> After using this for the last 3 days, it is now my favorite liner.  I love the soft brush, it makes is so easy to apply. I have allergies and this liner does not come off when my eyes water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for years and years.  I can do perfect lines with it - thick or thin.  I&#x27;ve never found any other liner even close.  If this ever gets discontinued, I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do!</li>
            <li> Bought this by accident at Walgreens, not paying too much attention and thinking I was buying mascara.  But what the heck, it’s something I can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly thinner formula than other eye liner I’ve used, it took me a few times before I got used to applying a thin line.  Why?  The handle is pretty far from the actual brush and if like me, you feel the need to steady your hand with a finger on your face, this will definitely take some practice to not apply too much pressure.  I can&#x27;t claim to get the same line result every day.  But I like the look, it stays on all day and dries pretty quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t wear eye liner or mascara on my lower lid, but if applied with too much pressure on the brush, I do find I need to do clean-up on the lower, especially on the inner corner of my eye and have gotten the product in my eye a couple of times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely like the eye liner itself, but would prefer a shorter wand to make a steady application easier.</li>
            <li> I have been using this eyeliner product for years and still the best out there! The price is great and it glides on perfectly. I love L&#x27;Oreal Products and this is one I will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I threw it away. It&#x27;s an okay eyeliner for something you can get at a drugstore, but why have just okay eyeliner (unless you are stranded, in need of eyeliner, and at a drugstore)? If you&#x27;re willing to spend the money, I really like MACs Penultimate eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and always get compliments in how awsome and perfect it looks and if you make a mistake its as easy as swiping a wet Q-tip to esrase it, not good if your a crier, runs badly, but keep one in your purse and your good to go</li>
            <li> They must have improved the brush that many of these reviews complain about because this is a very delicate one. It is soft but it is easy to use and works for lining and details like cat eyes. It is also a shorter brush for control. Great texture on the liquid also, amazing pigment! Doesn&#x27;t smear easily and dries very fast</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner.  I&#x27;ve tried others, but I always return to this brand.</li>
            <li> I love this eye liner and it&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find in the stores!  Much easier to just order 3 at a time on Amazon and be done with it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and is a solid black. I apply primer beneath the eyeliner and it lasts all day.  The brush is precise (if you have a steady hand).  When you first get it, the liquid coats the brush so I&#x27;d watch out for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing about this is that it isn&#x27;t super quick drying - maybe about a minute to fully dry.</li>
            <li> Love it, and it was delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> I am a sucker for a liquid eyeliner and believe it or not, they are hard to find in your local store.  There are over 30 different types of mascara but liquid eyeliner are few in numbers.  Also, some of them are pen liquid eyeliners not the brush tip, which is preferrable for an exact line.  I wear minimal make-up and my basic make up application os lining the top of my lids with a nice slick line and this does the trick.  I used to buy it at my local drug store but looking for it was a chore.  THe day I found it on Amazon was a great day.. no more searching through the multiple aisles of mascara.. my favorite eyeliner is now a click away.  Furthermore, I am now exploring Amazon for more of my make up items... quite convenient.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used any other liquid liners, so I can&#x27;t testify to better/best- but I find this liner pretty easy to use and definitely preferable to pencils.. with the exception to difficulty on the bottom lid. For top- it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do have to dab excess product off the inside of the brush when pulling it out for use because it pulls a lot each time, and you need a steady hand; but you can make your lines as thick or thin as you like (or progress them as you go from inside to out) very easily with this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t smudge later. When I accidentally make my line too thick, I just take a Q-tip and wet it and pull off the excess-it comes right off and still leaves a clean line.</li>
            <li> The product is good but too pricey and the shipping cost, makes it worse. It&#x27;s not meant for lower down</li>
            <li> i keep buying this same product over and over again because its perfect. easy to apply and the brush tip is perfect length. love this liner!</li>
            <li> The was one of the best liquid eyeliners I had ever used--it was easy to apply (though you have to wait for it to dry before touching your eyelids) and stayed all day without smearing or wearing off. It made my eyes look great. Took me six months to finish the first tube. I opened a second tube I had bought, and my eyelids started itching and swelling a few hours later. The next day my eyelids were swollen and dried. Took a few days until they were completely back to normal. I thought maybe there was something wrong with that specific tube, so I ordered a third pack and got it in the mail a week later. Same thing happened--I had an allergic reaction again. Very weird that this didn&#x27;t happen with the first tube I bought, and this is the only beauty product I&#x27;ve ever been allergic to. It really is a great product, and I&#x27;m disappointed to not be able to use this product anymore.</li>
            <li> I use it every single day.  I have tried others but they do not work as well.  I tried the ones that look like little markers.  I am sticking to this product.</li>
            <li> When Mary Kay stopped making their liquid eye liner, I searched and tried many.  This is the best!!  I would be devastated if L&#x27;Oreal  stopped making this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product ever since a classmate in junior high told me that a very thin line at the base of my lashes would make them look thicker. She was right. That was over 40 years ago, and I virtually never leave home without it. A couple of years ago I thought the black had gotten too harsh with my maturing skin, so I switched to brown, which is perfect. I hope this liner never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> This product burnt my eyelids.  It&#x27;s now been 3 days since I used it and my eyelids are still red and swollen,  I have conctacted Loreal to see what they will do.  They need to stop selling this product.  Never ever again will I try to save money.  Use Kat Von D eyeliner it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, nice bold lines. Takes some effort to remove, even with makeup wipes. Price was right for the amount of liner you get.</li>
            <li> Love the brush applicator!</li>
            <li> Love it.  Just goes on easily and lasts. No flaking/</li>
            <li> The brush is too thick at the end....it needs to be thinner to make a thin line....</li>
            <li> Not a fan. It is difficult to control the amount of product that sticks to the wand when it comes out of the tube. The suction mechanism in the tube also makes for a messy finish when I screw it shut. A personal preference but I prefer either a sturdier brush or a felt tip liner. I found this hard to control and could not make a thin line. Thick cat eyes were pretty easy though. This product was also prone to flaking but for the most part did not budge. The color was very black and opaque so one star for that!</li>
            <li> I have used the liquid L&#x27;Oreal liner for several years. I have trouble getting a thin enough line with everything else.  The liner stays on very well.  I was not to happy with the point on the brush however and sometimes I have to take the sissors to it.  This time I just used my old brush. I always get it in black.</li>
            <li> This eye liner goes in so smoothly and does not cake or flake.. Brush is very fine which allows you to control how thick or thin you want the line.. Nice product</li>
            <li> Its great--so easy applying , and it stays on.. have ordered this twice before and will continue doing so. It is also easy taking off. I would recommend this, in fact I have.. I do water acrobatics 5 times a week and wear make-up.  This Never smears.  Love It!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dorothy Angelique Sprague</li>
            <li> The small tip is great for precise lines and is very black.  My only issue is that pulling the brush out of the bottle is a challenge which leads me to think it is much smaller than it appears.  Other than that good product if you are between eyeliners and like thin lines for drug store prices.</li>
            <li> Smooth application and looks nice, probably not best for making really thin lines.</li>
            <li> I was so relieved to finally hear somebody else comment on the worthless bottle for this eyeliner!!! I&#x27;ve used this brand of liner for many years &amp; never had a single complaint. However, every time I&#x27;ve ordered it over the past 1-2 years (no matter where I place the order), the rubber part in the mouth of the bottle pops right out. I did all of the things you mentioned --- turned, pulled, &amp; even &amp;#34;pushed the piece back in with my nail.&amp;#34; WHAT A MESS --- &amp; every new bottle is the same. So &#x27;no&#x27; .... you&#x27;re definitely not alone!</li>
            <li> I use this eye liner for 10 year (and I really love it!) and usually buy at drugstores. This eye liner is not really black, is more like an &amp;#34;off black&amp;#34; or a gray. I wish it was really black...</li>
            <li> I suspect the product I received must be old, although no date is indicated on the package.  It is difficult to draw a thin line or to get product to go on smoothly (a drop hangs onto the end of the tip) so I used the tip from a different tube of L&#x27;Oreal I had on hand, and it helped make the lining process easier.  In my experience L&#x27;Oreal generally makes a good product, and although disappointed, I think it must have been shelved too long so it won&#x27;t affect my future purchase of L&#x27;Oreal product, although I think I will stick to local instead of online purchases (so that it can be returned easily.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve being using this eyeliner for at least 8 years. I use it everyday and each bottle lasts more than a year.&lt;br /&gt;The main reason why I love this eyeliner is because, it doesn&#x27;t run on my oily skin, even though it is not waterproof I can be sure the eyeliner will last all day on my eye. I make my lash line really thin (which requires practice at the beginning) and the product has always worked perfect, with or with out eye shadows, is easy to apply especially for the bush tip it has, no need to pull your eye lid. Dries fast. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if your what a thick eye lash line.&lt;br /&gt;I can easily take it off with abundance water and a soft soap or makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find an eyeliner with a thin brush applicator.  this works perfect for drawing a thin line against the upper lashes.  It doesn&#x27;t crack or peel and stays in place all day until I remove it.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years I love it as its water proof and the brush is very tiny at the end to make it easy to use on your eyes</li>
            <li> I love the eyeliner itself and the brush because it just looks so good after applying. But after a few days my eyes started to swell up really badly. I now know that I am allergic to this product &amp; I want something similar because it&#x27;s just such a good eyeliner. Makes me sad ):</li>
            <li> Love this one by far. Gives me defined line</li>
            <li> The top seal came out after several times uses ... Cannot  return it because no receipt!!</li>
            <li> honestly only ordered this to meet the minimum requirement for free shipping.  very pleasantly surprised by this liquid eyeliner.  applicator has a great brush which can make fine line or thick per your preference.  product has nice shiny appearance which remains after it dries.  very long-lasting &amp; no flaking...great for aging eyelids.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is fantastic.  I was looking for another specific, much more expensive brand when I found this one on Amazon.  The reviews were so great that I thought I&#x27;d take a gamble and see if something this cheap could be as good as my regular liner.  I have to say, except for being a little less waterproof (and that&#x27;s actually a good thing when you&#x27;re trying to remove it to take off your makeup), it completely rivals my super expensive eye liner.  I&#x27;m only buying this one from now on!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t read the description properly, I didn&#x27;t really mean to by the brush tip and was looking for the felt tip brush, BUT besides that point the product itself is really amazing! I have oily lids and it doesn&#x27;t move as easily as some products do. The brush tip is always hard to use so that&#x27;s the only reason for the 4. But after a while I guess you get used to it, but the color is awesome, it&#x27;s a true black but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again due to the brush.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeliner!</li>
            <li> The applicator allows for plenty of control with line thickness and amount, but now that I use a pen-style liquid eyeliner I just can&#x27;t see myself ever going back to this. It would sometimes start peeling off during the day. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s better or worse than smearing or flaking, but either way, it looked pretty weird by the end.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this eyeliner to anyone who wants a nice slightly shine look. It&#x27;s definitely an eye opener. It smooths on very evenly and fluidly. To remove it, use a facial towelett.I wish I could find it in the local stores.</li>
            <li> I like this liner.  you can get a very fine line with it or go over a second time for a more dramatic evening look.  Thanks</li>
            <li> As another reviewer said the brush on this liner sucks!  I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 weeks and finally gotten the hang of working with the brush.  You have to wipe the brush on the inner side of the bottle before sweeping product on the top of your eyelids (otherwise the brush will have too much product on it) and dot on the bottom eyelid until fully lined. I dip and use the excess that might be on the top of the bottle. The product dries glossy and stay unless you have watery eyes some days and it might run but not terribly. All I have to say is try it and see if it works for you.</li>
            <li> I have used this eyeliner for years, it is just what they say it is. Awesome product from L&#x27;Oreal..</li>
            <li> The liner brush is too soft. The bristles collapse when applying. Just would like L&#x27;Oreal to try using firmer brushes for this type of application, it would be a top seller.</li>
            <li> Clean line, easy to apply, long lasting.</li>
            <li> This liquid eyeliner goes on better than any other liquid eyeliner that I have used before. It lasts for about 12 hours usually so that is great! after that though it definitely starts to crack and fall off. It is NOT water proof and makes a huge mess when crying or jumping in a pool. Overall I would have to say this is the best liquid eyeliner you will find until the same thing comes out waterproof.</li>
            <li> After applying this eyeliner my eyes swelled up and became extremely red and painful.  L&#x27;Oreal needs to stop selling it.</li>
            <li> Love this eyeliner, makes nice thin lines and does not iritate my eyes.</li>
            <li> After all the liners I&#x27;ve tried ... I always go back to this.  I get the best control out of the brush.&lt;br /&gt;I can make a bold cat-eye to a super thin line and without skipping lines.  No tugging.&lt;br /&gt;It has decent staying power (not best when sweating or tears) but on a day-to-day - I have found nothing better.&lt;br /&gt;Been using this since HS, 15 years ago!  Since the brush is packed separately (not in the tube) I like to trim the brush&lt;br /&gt;to give it a pointier tip before attaching to the tube.  I&#x27;m very critical and don&#x27;t give out 5 stars easily.  This is it, ladies!  Enjoy!</li>
            <li> I have been using this mascara for years and I&#x27;m pleased that I can stock up on it here on amazon! I wish this mascara was still sold in the stores. I can&#x27;t believe it was taken out of L&#x27;Oreals line of mascara.</li>
            <li> BEST PRODUCT EYELINER EVER!! this is the best eyeliner ever.. Ive been using it for years and still number one</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 20 years - it was the very first piece of makeup I ever used.  I have always been told that my eyes are one of my best features and I have to say, this liner only helps to enhance them!  Growing up, I have tried just about every type of eye liner there is - different shades, pencil, marker tip, different brands - expensive and cheap - you name it, I&#x27;ve probably tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing is, it&#x27;s all about Loreal&#x27;s brush and formula combination.  The brush in this product is fine to give precision, but also the right amount of flexible, so that it makes application easy and forgiving.  The formula of the liquid makes it easy to put on and even easier to adjust - wipe clean, reapply, if you mess up.  I have no problem lining the inside bottom of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friends and family members line up in every wedding, dance recital, party; etc. to have this liner applied to their eyes.  It makes everyone&#x27;s face just light up.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what shape your eyes are, big or small; run a fine line along (almost on top of) the lash line of your upper lid. You can even dot it along.  When you open your eyes, it will look like a fine line across the top that just makes your eyes pop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal - please don&#x27;t EVER discontinue this product!  I&#x27;ll never be able to leave the house again!  (Note - they tried to improve the formula with a 2x black version, which I do not recommend - it burns)  Definitely go with this \\&quot;Black, Noir\\&quot; version only.  Happy lining!!</li>
            <li> This was my first liquid liner, so as far as the actual liner goes, I thought it was pretty good. It went on well, if a little thick, and kept from smudging well. It still smudged for me (probably my oily skin), but much less than other eyeliners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle, however, was the reason I just threw it out. It&#x27;s unusable. The rubber part in the mouth of the bottle kept coming out, no matter whether I turned, pulled, or anything. I used it a couple of times pushing the piece back in with my nail, but this last time when it popped out, it got a large amount (maybe 1/16 tsp?) of eyeliner on my hands and would&#x27;ve made a bigger mess had I tried to push it back in. I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So aside from my defective bottle, which as far as I can tell hasn&#x27;t happened to anyone else, the product was really good.</li>
            <li> have used this product for years.  In my opinion best eye liner.</li>
            <li> I am surprised to write a product review for a L&#x27;Oreal product that is less than satisfactory.  This product simply does not meet the standards of L&#x27;Oreal. I wanted the L&#x27;Oreal eye liner that I had, but they no longer make that particular one. Of course, it was my favorite. (Shed some tears.) I will continue to search for something that does not smear and does not smell like charcoal. I&#x27;m a busy woman who needs fast and easy make up in the morning. The product I seek is out there. I know it is. It just is not this one.</li>
            <li> Hands down my favorite liquid eyeliner! Perfect application almost every time (user error is usually responsible for the rare imperfect applications)</li>
            <li> I bought this eyeliner and I honestly Thor it wasn&#x27;t gonna suck. But it was sooo easy to use the other brands I&#x27;ve tried sucked. I&#x27;m so amazed. I I highly recommend this!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is really good. brush take a bit ot get used to but lasts all day and does not flake. I would definitely keep buying for this price.</li>
            <li> Eyeliner was grey, not black. Disappointed.</li>
            <li> Have used this for years and it is the best!</li>
            <li> The fine brush tip gives me control of how thick or thin I want the liner to be. Good liquid consistency too.</li>
            <li> I am very fond of eyeliners.But this one is best.The tip of the brush is so smooth so one can do thin line or the thick one.Liked IT completely!!</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite eyeliner. I have been using liquid liner for 20 years, this is the best.  It&#x27;s very easy to use.  Love love love IT!</li>
            <li> Love this liquid liner.  Stays &amp; gives a perfect line.  Doesn&#x27;t aggravate my eyes at all.  Sometimes you may have to reapply towards the end of the day.  No liner is as good as the liquid liners &amp; they&#x27;re getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> I am not at all experienced in using liquid eyeliner so I have nothing to compare it to.  I like it.  It seems easy to apply. It stays on all day.  It&#x27;s a good product and I will probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> This product is great and does what it says. It has a brush instead of that felt tip and that&#x27;s what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Stays on great, and easy to apply thick or thin.</li>
            <li> The rubber part around the mouth of the bottle that keeps the brush in place and prevents the liquid from pouring out is terrible. It kept coming off, stuck to the applicator brush. I tried to push it back into place, but it just comes off the next time you open the bottle. It gets really annoying; you get black liquid all over your hands and under your nails. I ended up discarding it and buying a different eyeliner.</li>
            <li> I purchased this eyeliner and it is absolutely the worst........DO NOT PURCHASE you will be disapointed totally.&lt;br /&gt;The liquid is like water and leaks off the brush as soon as you pull it out of the tube. UNFIT. Even if you try to get the excess off it was unwearable if it runs like this what would it do on your eyelid ?....I wonder if L&#x27;oreal actual makes this product? This gives them a bad name. I will never ever use this again and to top if off there is no name on the liner. REALLY DUDE ?I will find another more reliable brand in the future. I would have came out better going to a beauty supply store yes that&#x27;s how bad it is. This is not a good look for L&#x27;oreal either way.I wish there was a rating less than POOR because they&#x27;ve earned it.</li>
            <li> I have used this liner off and on, for years. Every time I buy it, I wonder why I tried others. The liner goes on smooth, and lasts all day.</li>
            <li> This works great for me It last a long time. I like the narrow brush too</li>
            <li> The packaging is completely blank and different than you will find on the Loreal website. It must be an old design. Who knows how old.</li>
            <li> The product is fine for upper eyelids, but I find doing the lower ones, which I had mostly bought it for, quite difficult. The brush is too soft, the lashes get in the way, so it smears. I spend far more time applying it and fixing the smears than with my L&#x27;Oreal Telescopic liquid eyeliner. I have switched back to it.</li>
            <li> I use liquid eyeliner for cat eye makeup. This kind of design requires a think, steady brush. I bought this eyeliner because of the high star rating but when it showed up I was beyond disappointed. The tip of the brush is seriously the worst I have ever seen on liquid eyeliner and I cannot believe no one else has commented on it. I will say though that the makeup itself tends to stick for a long time, so I&#x27;ve been using a brush from another brand&#x27;s and this one&#x27;s makeup.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly every time until it is too old to use, and that can be up to 5 or 6 months old. I have been using these for decades and they cannot be improved on. A perfect product.  No matter how many times L&#x27;Oreal tries to create a new eyeliner product, they are never going to match this one.  It is the gold standard.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, no muss no fuss. It glides on very easily, no need to remove smudges while applying. Great stuff and would buy from seller again.</li>
            <li> The included brush is too thick and the eyeliner does not go on evenly. Also it is very difficult to remove. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lasts a half hour before you are picking it out of the whites of your eyes and reapplying some eyeliner to your lids.  It&#x27;s a fail.</li>
            <li> Well now &amp;#34;great value&amp;#34; says it all, doesn&#x27;t it?  My daughter has used the more expensive Urban Decay and MAC brands&lt;br /&gt;and thinks this product is great too.  The brush tip is well designed.</li>
            <li> Brush tips (good ones) are getting harder &amp; harder to find.  Easy to use---it does clump a little more than I would like...but it is still not bad</li>
            <li> it is not hard to use but it might irritate your eyelid if you have sensitive skin. also after like 1 to 2 hours it starts to flake. i do not enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> this is a great eyeliner, much more forgiving than the felt tip applicators.  Difficult to find in retail stores.</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; the price was good.</li>
            <li> Not really liking this eye liner, once I put it on and wait about a few hours. This eye liner seem like putting a coat of plastic on your eyes and then a few hours later it peels. Literally I can peel a piece of eye liner from my face.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this eyeliner based alone on other customer reviews, but I am extremely disappointed with the product recieved. I am not particularly sensitive to any cosmetic products nor have I ever experienced an allergic/chemical reaction from makeup. I should also note that I have been putting on winged eyeliner for years and have used plenty different brands of liquid eyeliner. Immediately after applying this to both eyes it felt very heavy on my eyelids. An hour into wearing it my eyes began to itch, so I washed it off deciding it wasn&#x27;t for me. The next morning I woke up to painful, red inflamed eyelids -ouch! Three days and a handful of anti-hystamines later I&#x27;m fine but wouldn&#x27;t dare try this again. Better safe than sorry, maybe I better stick with my usual eyeliner for a few extra bucks.</li>
            <li> Best liquid eyeliner!</li>
            <li> While the product is pretty good in that it seems to stay on as long as you don&#x27;t get wet eyes, the brush made it impossible to apply as I wanted to! The brush had some loose bristles that I couldn&#x27;t pull out and that made it impossible to apply this to my eyes! If they had a higher quality brush or a felt tip, this would be a great product. Listen to the other reviewers and purchase a different brush for this product.</li>
