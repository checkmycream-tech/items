            <li>Probably better not to post a photo with this review!</li>
            <li>I tried my best to stuff my large skin tag into the applicator cone to no avail.</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing and thoroughly recommended.</li>
            <li>Ive been using tea tree oil and all kind of stuff for 4 months and nothing work.</li>
            <li>Good product need access to more bands</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a lil pricey but works nice and easy..</li>
            <li>The bands needs to be stronger with alot more tension.</li>
            <li>Worked better than removal with a surgical laser.</li>
            <li>i was able to remove it with my fingernail.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>and I like it even more.</li>
            <li>I am a retired surgeon and very familiar with the ligation principle this works on.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, better with a helper.</li>
            <li>sure, the device is cheaply made and overly priced, but it worked and that&#x27;s all i care about.</li>
            <li>Super easy!</li>
            <li>The device works easy once you figure it out.</li>
            <li>makes tying off tags really easy.</li>
            <li>I found it easy to use you slide on the band position then slide the band over the skin tag.</li>
            <li>Originally I only gave this product two stars, but after it has been working great.</li>
            <li>and I was able to clip it off with some nail clippers, it did leave a fairly could red nub</li>
            <li>Successfully removed 4 tags on four days - waiting for others to fall off - seller sent me extra bands to get rid of the others I have  </li>
            <li>, I would recommend adding another band to the device and applying it on top of the first band.</li>
            <li>This product works really well and is easy to use ,fantastic response from the customer care team who will answer any queries you may have.</li>
            <li>Quick results.  </li>
            <li>There may be cheaper home options but not one that works this quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>I recommend that you clean the tag with hot water (or Hydrogen peroxide) twice a day to avoid infection.</li>
            <li>This is certainly a pain free way to remove those unsightly skin tags in a matter of days.</li>
            <li>But the payoff was worth it, it got the skin tag off pretty cleanly.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth it when the skintag comes off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very simple but effective.</li>
            <li>I had an unsightly, very large tag on my buttock.</li>
            <li>very pain full.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and effective on medium and large tags.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will certainly recommend!</li>
            <li>Great theoretical device, just needs more work for use on small to medium sized skin tags.</li>
            <li>The product description should be more specific.</li>
            <li>If you have a skin tag larger than this (as I do), you will not be able to use this product.</li>
            <li>At first I was having issues with the band not staying on the tags, or they broke.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in so much pain right now thanks to this product.</li>
            <li>&gt; please note that this product requires medium to large skin tags.</li>
            <li>After spending weeks (unsuccessfully) trying to remove a large skin tag with Tea Tree Oil, Apple cider vinegar etc.</li>
            <li>Not just Med to Large tags.  </li>
            <li>Bands are too large.  </li>
            <li>NOT FOR LARGE SKIN TAGS.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m contacting the company about this; nothing indicates a skin tag may be too large for the product.</li>
            <li>If my skin tag had been smaller though, it would have gone on just fine.</li>
            <li>Much better than expected.</li>
            <li>Innovations very prompt with srrvice and replies to my queries</li>
            <li>It really works......</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>but it should fall off very soon.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great idea, however, the rubber bands are not strong enough to cut off the blood flow</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to get rid of medium to large skin tags.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I was expecting some pain, so was very happy with a very mild discomfort on a few in bad areas.</li>
            <li>I could think of some ways to improve it, but it&#x27;s the best option I have found outside of a MD cutting them off.</li>
            <li>I should also add that my skin tag was located in a very embarrassing, private area - so these literally really work on ANY part of your body.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions provided and within four days my first skin tag fell off and hasn&#x27;t grown back.  </li>
            <li>But I was able to use on small ones by using 2 rubber bands at once.</li>
            <li>It does the exact same thing!</li>
            <li>I did this 3 days ago and it was a pretty large tag, as of now it is black and not quite ready to come off</li>
            <li>It is hard to use and very cheaply made.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be clear.  </li>
            <li>It is a simple device that works really well.</li>
            <li>the top has broken off but still able to use, and would think small tags will not work with the bands, would also suggest selling extra bands alone rather than complete kit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>cuticle scissors were not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plus, they are very small and easy to lose and several broke when trying to apply them.  </li>
            <li>The skin tags have to be a certain size and it take a few days</li>

            <li> cuticle scissors were not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Plus, they are very small and easy to lose and several broke when trying to apply them.  </li>
            <li> The skin tags have to be a certain size and it take a few days</li>
            <li> Was a little itchy when the little band was doing its job, but never painful.  </li>
            <li> Each time I put one of the tiny clear rubber bands on the hollow blue applicator and slide it down to the bottom, the band breaks like its been stretched too far, and becomes unusable!</li>
            <li> As the other reviewers stated this only works on larger skin tags.</li>
            <li> Also really expensive for how cheaply made, but because it worked, I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Only wish I had seen this before wasting money on the other products being advertised .</li>
            <li> I consider myself pretty tough when it comes to pain</li>
            <li> ,after a couple of days the tag went black and is currently waiting to drop off.</li>
            <li> this I am extremely displeased with this product and would not recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> Other tags have started to turn black</li>
            <li> like a constant dull pain.</li>
            <li> use the tool to push the floss down and the pull ends to tighten.  </li>
            <li> the band seem to slip half way down the skin tag , leaving half the tag.</li>
            <li> Well, I ended up having the one cut off anyway and have to deal with a slight infection.  </li>
            <li> Also for anyone who&#x27;s moles or tags don&#x27;t turn black in 2 days with this device</li>
            <li> /&gt;i used one of these bands and in two days it turned black.</li>
            <li> TagBand removed it in less than one week.</li>
            <li> The biggest tag that I had already turned black</li>
            <li> My complaint is the plastic is too thin and the tip broke off after 3rd use but we could still get the tiny band on</li>
            <li> so they end up just being little collars for your skin tags.  </li>
            <li> , I call them little worms as they are have bases of 1-2 mm and vary in length.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little annoying that you&#x27;re paying $23 for what is essentially two pieces of plastic and ten or so tiny rubber bands, but it works.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money if your tags are not huge.  </li>
            <li> but he&#x27;s busy for another 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;i used tree oil that was useless.</li>
            <li> also they fell off after a few days so need to put a plaster over it to keep on.</li>
            <li> It took a few days to fall off</li>
            <li> Well that was a waste of $22 dollars.</li>
            <li> It took about 7 days for the skin tag to &amp;#34;die&amp;#34; and then all i had to do was to use a small nail clipper and remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Does not work on medium or small tags.</li>
            <li> this doesnt work for small size tags</li>
            <li> , I had a really small tag.</li>
            <li> A waste of money, don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> I guess I have all small tags</li>
            <li> the down size is the tag holder is a bit weak</li>
            <li> Skin tags are hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with high hopes but am extremely disappointed and don&#x27;t think Amazon buyers should purchase this item.</li>
            <li> In a last desperate attempt to remove the tag myself, I looked up this product</li>
            <li> Works by using very small rubberr bands to cut off the blood supply to the skin tag.</li>
            <li> I had one big ugly one that was so embarrassing.</li>
            <li> I got rid of an annoying skin tag on my nose near my eye in about two days with this tool.</li>
            <li> they are tough pices of skin that are stubborn.</li>
            <li> The pain was worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
            <li> Tagband is too big to work on small to medium skin tags, worthless!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to remove them too, at least not in the delicate area I have my skin tags.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works since I was unable to get the bands on.</li>
            <li> the bands were a little painful and annoying.</li>
            <li> It causes no pain which either freezing or cutting can&#x27;t say.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m considering going to the emergency room, it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
            <li> The rubberband worked and the tag turned dark in 8 hours and then feel off by in about a day.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMANDED!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> painful!</li>
            <li> Painful, but it works!  </li>
            <li> but that was terrible.</li>

            <li> Excellent !!! Successfully removed 4 tags on four days - waiting for others to fall off - seller sent me extra bands to get rid of the others I have  - I had very large tags on my face and belly - worked brilliant !! For my smaller tags I have purchased the derma tag kit !!!</li>
            <li> Tagband is too big to work on small to medium skin tags, worthless!</li>
            <li> Works! I could think of some ways to improve it, but it&#x27;s the best option I have found outside of a MD cutting them off. I was expecting some pain, so was very happy with a very mild discomfort on a few in bad areas. Much better than expected.</li>
            <li> Tried lots of ways to remove skin tags none that have worked before, but bought these and it has worked !,after a couple of days the tag went black and is currently waiting to drop off. the down size is the tag holder is a bit weak the top has broken off but still able to use, and would think small tags will not work with the bands, would also suggest selling extra bands alone rather than complete kit.&lt;br /&gt;.But would recommend this product it has worked</li>
            <li> It works in 6 days it was gone.  it just works</li>
            <li> Works like a charm.  Was a little itchy when the little band was doing its job, but never painful.  Highly recommend to get rid of medium to large skin tags.  IT WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I have a medium sized skin tag on my neck I am trying to remove at home. I purchased this product with high hopes but am extremely disappointed and don&#x27;t think Amazon buyers should purchase this item. Each time I put one of the tiny clear rubber bands on the hollow blue applicator and slide it down to the bottom, the band breaks like its been stretched too far, and becomes unusable! The three bands I have tried to use have all been rendered unusable because they broke. this I am extremely displeased with this product and would not recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> This product works wonderfully.  I followed the instructions provided and within four days my first skin tag fell off and hasn&#x27;t grown back.  This is certainly a pain free way to remove those unsightly skin tags in a matter of days.</li>
            <li> The product description should be more specific. The applicator is only about 1/4&amp;#34; in diameter. If you have a skin tag larger than this (as I do), you will not be able to use this product. I tried my best to stuff my large skin tag into the applicator cone to no avail. Finally had to throw the product out. If my skin tag had been smaller though, it would have gone on just fine. I can&#x27;t speak to how well it works since I was unable to get the bands on.</li>
            <li> I have some skin tags on the inside of my thighs from sweating at working combined with alot of walking. I bought these so I wouldn&#x27;t have to have them cut off.  Well, I ended up having the one cut off anyway and have to deal with a slight infection.  Maybe these work where skin won&#x27;t rub together. The bands needs to be stronger with alot more tension. Great theoretical device, just needs more work for use on small to medium sized skin tags.</li>
            <li> I am a retired surgeon and very familiar with the ligation principle this works on.  Used it on myself and it could not have been easier, faster, or more painless!!!  Worked better than removal with a surgical laser.</li>
            <li> Waste of time and money if your tags are not huge.  Does not work on medium or small tags.</li>
            <li> Best skin tag remover on market!  As the other reviewers stated this only works on larger skin tags. But I was able to use on small ones by using 2 rubber bands at once. Also for anyone who&#x27;s moles or tags don&#x27;t turn black in 2 days with this device, I would recommend adding another band to the device and applying it on top of the first band. This worked for me in all cases! I love this thing!</li>
            <li> Quick results.  Great customer service.  I highly recommend this product. Only wish I had seen this before wasting money on the other products being advertised .</li>
            <li> It took about 2 weeks but worked. It just fell off.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and effective on medium and large tags.&lt;br /&gt;UK Innovations very prompt with srrvice and replies to my queries - Thank you Shannon</li>
            <li> Husband says it hurts. like a constant dull pain. But the payoff was worth it, it got the skin tag off pretty cleanly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great idea, however, the rubber bands are not strong enough to cut off the blood flow so they end up just being little collars for your skin tags.  Plus, they are very small and easy to lose and several broke when trying to apply them.  Needs some work.</li>
            <li> Outstanding customer service and this product is great!</li>
            <li> Save your money and tie dental floss around the skin tag. It does the exact same thing!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all is the skin yeahs aren&#x27;t significantly big enough. The tiny rubber band does not stay on.</li>
            <li> Painless? Hardly!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big guy and no crybaby but one hour was all I could take with the band applied to a skin tag under my arm.&lt;br /&gt;Besides skin, guess what else exists in a skin tag? Nerve cells! They do not appreciate being deprived of blood. They complain - with pain.&lt;br /&gt;Tried Tea Tree oil. Smelly.&lt;br /&gt;Go see your health professional.&lt;br /&gt;I tossed this.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be clear.  Skin tags are hard to remove. they are tough pices of skin that are stubborn. I had one big ugly one that was so embarrassing. i wore collear shirts to hide it. i tried to make a doctor&#x27;s appopintment. but he&#x27;s busy for another 6 months.&lt;br /&gt;i used tree oil that was useless. i tried to cut it off. painful! cuticle scissors were not sharp enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i used one of these bands and in two days it turned black. i was able to remove it with my fingernail.  sure, the device is cheaply made and overly priced, but it worked and that&#x27;s all i care about. the bands were a little painful and annoying. but it&#x27;s worth it when the skintag comes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; please note that this product requires medium to large skin tags. there is a youtube video to see how ithe product works.&lt;br /&gt;this product will get great reviews when it works for you. if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, then you will see low reviews.</li>
            <li> the band seem to slip half way down the skin tag , leaving half the tag. very pain full.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, better with a helper. Works by using very small rubberr bands to cut off the blood supply to the skin tag. I had to use a 2nd rubber band on some of the tags.</li>
            <li> Worked for me. I took the advice of another reviewer and doubled up the bands.</li>
            <li> Not enough bands and also they fell off after a few days so need to put a plaster over it to keep on.</li>
            <li> Took about a week but the skin tag on my bum is gone. Great product.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly :D, removed a medium size skin tag on my face. Ive been using tea tree oil and all kind of stuff for 4 months and nothing work. The rubberband worked and the tag turned dark in 8 hours and then feel off by in about a day.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY RECOMMANDED!!!!!!! this doesnt work for small size tags</li>
            <li> Painful, but it works!  It takes a  week, I had a really small tag.</li>
            <li> I got rid of an annoying skin tag on my nose near my eye in about two days with this tool. It&#x27;s a little annoying that you&#x27;re paying $23 for what is essentially two pieces of plastic and ten or so tiny rubber bands, but it works.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because it was as advertised..it&#x27;s a lil pricey but works nice and easy..but i guess my skin tags arent big enough..the elastic bands just fall off.. 😳</li>
            <li> Great product. I had a tag in a private area that I couldn&#x27;t even see, and was able to install it in about 5 minutes by doing it blind (took 2 try&#x27;s). Very simple but effective. I agree with some others it&#x27;s a bit overpriced for such a simple product, but it saved me the cost of a Dr. visit, not to mention saving me the embarrassment since it was in a private area, so all-in-all I&#x27;m happy with the product and the price. After installing the band, my tag fell off in 1 week.</li>
            <li> I had a medium sized skin tag on my shoulder. It took a few days to fall off but I was very pleased with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service by the seller. I will certainly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product works really well and is easy to use ,fantastic response from the customer care team who will answer any queries you may have. will definitely recommend to anyone with skin tags ☺</li>
            <li> It is a great product.  It really works......</li>
            <li> My husband has tried to remove skin tags for years....this actually worked! After the tags were off they left nubs that we treated with tea tree oil which made the nubs go away. The device works easy once you figure it out. My complaint is the plastic is too thin and the tip broke off after 3rd use but we could still get the tiny band on so we could keep using it, and they give you about 10 tiny bands, with no offer of extras. Also really expensive for how cheaply made, but because it worked, I&#x27;d buy again.</li>
            <li> Well that was a waste of $22 dollars. I couldn&#x27;t get the rubberband to stay on any of my skin tags. It is hard to use and very cheaply made. A waste of money, don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> After spending weeks (unsuccessfully) trying to remove a large skin tag with Tea Tree Oil, Apple cider vinegar etc. I was about to give up and head out to the doctor&#x27;s office. In a last desperate attempt to remove the tag myself, I looked up this product and I&#x27;m so happy I gave these TagBands a shot! It took about 7 days for the skin tag to &amp;#34;die&amp;#34; and then all i had to do was to use a small nail clipper and remove the dead skin. Super easy! I will say though that the skin tag will swell and hurt a bit the first few days, but trust me, suffer through it and leave the band on because the tag will fall off eventually! I recommend that you clean the tag with hot water (or Hydrogen peroxide) twice a day to avoid infection. I should also add that my skin tag was located in a very embarrassing, private area - so these literally really work on ANY part of your body. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Fantastic! Delivered following day as promised. I had an unsightly, very large tag on my buttock. TagBand removed it in less than one week. Absolutely amazing and thoroughly recommended. Probably better not to post a photo with this review!</li>
            <li> Costly, cheaply made and produces the best results..I would rebuy it if need be. Saved me a trip to the Dr....</li>
            <li> great idea, but they should tell you a base size of the tag that it will work on.  Not just Med to Large tags.  I guess I have all small tags, I call them little worms as they are have bases of 1-2 mm and vary in length.  Bands are too large.  I use the applicator to tie dental floss on and like the band use the tool to push the floss down and the pull ends to tighten.  makes tying off tags really easy.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR LARGE SKIN TAGS. I&#x27;m in so much pain right now thanks to this product. It&#x27;s impossible to remove them too, at least not in the delicate area I have my skin tags. I&#x27;m considering going to the emergency room, it&#x27;s that bad. UPDATE: I did end up having to go to the emergency room. The pain was worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever felt. I consider myself pretty tough when it comes to pain but that was terrible. I&#x27;m contacting the company about this; nothing indicates a skin tag may be too large for the product.</li>
            <li> The skin tags have to be a certain size and it take a few days but it&#x27;s very effective and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Originally I only gave this product two stars, but after it has been working great. At first I was having issues with the band not staying on the tags, or they broke. I tied it two days ago and The biggest tag that I had already turned black and I was able to clip it off with some nail clippers, it did leave a fairly could red nub I guess I would call it, but I am hoping it will disappear by putting some neosporene on it.. Other tags have started to turn black and I hope for them to fall off.</li>
            <li> It is a simple device that works really well. I found it easy to use you slide on the band position then slide the band over the skin tag. I did this 3 days ago and it was a pretty large tag, as of now it is black and not quite ready to come off but it should fall off very soon. It causes no pain which either freezing or cutting can&#x27;t say. And frankly it is way cheaper than an office visit at the Dermatologists office and they will do the same procedure. There may be cheaper home options but not one that works this quickly and painlessly. So today I want to add a post script to my initial review. So 9 days after initial using the tag band the skin tag is gone. I didn&#x27;t even notice it fell off, it worked great. I recommended it before the tag fell off and I like it even more.</li>
            <li> Good product need access to more bands</li>
