            <li>This is wonderful shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I will be a repeat customer for sure!!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I also purchased the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment Plus and it is just as amazing.</li>
            <li>But it makes my hair happier than most shampoos.</li>
            <li>Ojon is one of my favorite hair products.</li>
            <li>I needed to buy more of Ojon hair products and didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size when I ordered.  </li>
            <li>I used to love Ojon products but this combo was not a hit with me.</li>
            <li>Then, I thought of Amazon and sure enough Amazon had this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>This product leave the hair feeling silky, soft and great.</li>
            <li>Also note that this is not a sulfate free product</li>
            <li>Seriously love it and worth the money.</li>
            <li>It came earlier than promised which was great too.</li>
            <li>the breakage was off the charts and it took me a full week of conditioning to regain the manageability and softness of my hair and to minimize the breakage and shedding.  </li>
            <li>really really good one, especially for the conditioner, exactly can protect the damage hair</li>
            <li>Used this version of Ojon after using a regular version and I love the damage reverse!</li>
            <li>It is very good for hard water users.  </li>
            <li>I usually get it somewhere else, but I was happy to save some money here.</li>
            <li>I have been using Ojon for several years now and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I love the product but for this size definitely priced too high so beware.</li>
            <li>It cleans and really conditions my color stressed hair.</li>
            <li>Makes my fine, dry, tangly hair very soft, straight, and much easier to manage!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future.  </li>
            <li>If you have fragile, fine African American hair do not purchase this product.  </li>
            <li>directly from Ojon website.  </li>
            <li>this made my hair soft again...</li>
            <li>These products keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>Wow</li>
            <li>The shampoo was better than the conditioner by far, conditioner left a lot to be desired, did not condition well, left tangles, overall rough texture.</li>
            <li>I barely move it and never do any rigorous scrubbing or tossing.  </li>
            <li>The only draw back to these products is that it doesn&#x27;t exactly soften my hair since the tangles are harder to brush out, but I do like the way my hair looks.</li>
            <li>Kind of expensive (a little over priced really).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I thought I would buy something that I could include in my regime that would help me while I am stretching my relaxer.  I bought a kit that had the shampoo, conditioner, oil, and hair spray.  When I wash my hair I barely move it and never do any rigorous scrubbing or tossing.  As soon as I put the shampoo in my hair it started to stick together, so I put in the conditioner, I had several little nests of tangles all over my head.  the breakage was off the charts and it took me a full week of conditioning to regain the manageability and softness of my hair and to minimize the breakage and shedding.  If you have fragile, fine African American hair do not purchase this product.  Also note that this is not a sulfate free product either (didn&#x27;t look until I started pulling out nests of hair).</li>
            <li> Ojon is absolutely terrific.  My color processed hair was getting dried out by the coloring and blow drying.  One use of the Ojon and my hair is shiny and no frizzy ends.</li>
            <li> Kind of expensive (a little over priced really). But it makes my hair happier than most shampoos. Will continue using it.</li>
            <li> Ojon is one of my favorite hair products. My hair was very dry from swimming g and playing golf. The Florida sun is not forgiving. This product leave the hair feeling silky, soft and great.</li>
            <li> really really good one, especially for the conditioner, exactly can protect the damage hair</li>
            <li> Makes my fine, dry, tangly hair very soft, straight, and much easier to manage! Love it! This is also a deal, even with shipping included it&#x27;s cheaper than Sephora or Ojon.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I LOVE the Ojon damage restorative hair treatment, but I&#x27;m sad to say, it just didn&#x27;t stand up to the test for me. I felt I had to shampoo my hair twice and the conditioner didn&#x27;t work at all for me. I have VERY long hair and I found it very hard to brush out after my shower</li>
            <li> I simply love this set, my hair is fine and has been breaking off real bad. Just one use the next day my hair stop breaking off badly. I am very happy camper with ths product!</li>
            <li> I needed to buy more of Ojon hair products and didn&#x27;t pay attention to the size when I ordered.  For this price you can get 16.9 fl. oz. directly from Ojon website.  I&#x27;ll be more careful in the future.  I love the product but for this size definitely priced too high so beware.</li>
            <li> I used to love Ojon products but this combo was not a hit with me. The shampoo was better than the conditioner by far, conditioner left a lot to be desired, did not condition well, left tangles, overall rough texture.</li>
            <li> I color my hair every 6-8 weeks... The last coloring was rough this made my hair soft again... Seriously love it and worth the money. Will buy again in a second.</li>
            <li> Product was referred to me by my stylist. My hair was damaged and over-processed. Worth every penny!!!! I also purchased the Ojon Restorative Hair Treatment Plus and it is just as amazing. Please do not let the price deter you from making this purchase!! I will be a repeat customer for sure!!</li>
            <li> My hair feels wonderful after using it.</li>
            <li> This combo is one of my favorites. It cleans and really conditions my color stressed hair. I usually get it somewhere else, but I was happy to save some money here. It came earlier than promised which was great too.</li>
            <li> I have been using Ojon for several years now and this is my favorite.  I have long hair and I have it colored.  These products keep my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful shampoo and conditioner.  I tried it before -- purchased at Sephora -- and it was getting harder and harder to find there,  Then, I thought of Amazon and sure enough Amazon had this wonderful product.  It truly works to repair split ends, and make dry brittle hair soft and thick and shiny.  I&#x27;m definitely buying this from Amazon again and again.</li>
            <li> Used this version of Ojon after using a regular version and I love the damage reverse!</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and I have not seen any improvement in my hair, so back to the beauty supply house to find something that does work.  Wow and I did.</li>
            <li> It is very good for hard water users.  My hair is highlighted and my roots tend to show darker because of the hard water we have.  This shampoo/conditioner helps to wash some of that out.  The only draw back to these products is that it doesn&#x27;t exactly soften my hair since the tangles are harder to brush out, but I do like the way my hair looks.</li>
