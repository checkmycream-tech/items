            <li> Our daughter had a shop a few years ago and sold natural</li>
            <li> This soap is made with a special blend of essential oils from Young Living called \\&quot;Thieves.\\&quot; The oil blend is called that because it is based on a formula used by a group of robbers in medieval times who rubbed themselves with the oils to keep from getting sick while robbing plague victims</li>

            <li> Unfortunately it came with no top despensor so there is no way to get it out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I found this very annoying considering how small the bottle of product is for the money and how hard the bottle is to get open.</li>
            <li> Thieves used to put it upon themselves to keep from getting sick while robbing the dead bodies of their townspeople.  </li>
            <li> Expensive, but lasts.  </li>
            <li> There is nothing bad I can say about Thieves.</li>
            <li> it up if you don&#x27;t understand why it is so bad!</li>

            <li> this stuff is great got rid of a rash on me + price skin ...the seller was fast getting the product to me give him 5 star</li>
            <li> This is the best foaming soap I have found to date. Young Living produces the best quality essential oils I have ever found, and I use many of their oil blends.    This soap is made with a special blend of essential oils from Young Living called \\&quot;Thieves.\\&quot; The oil blend is called that because it is based on a formula used by a group of robbers in medieval times who rubbed themselves with the oils to keep from getting sick while robbing plague victims (yeah, nice people). They offered up the formula in return for more lenient sentences when they were caught.    Thieves blend has been tested in laboratories and is quite effective in killing a wide variety of microbes.     I have not found better essential oils than those produced by Young Living, and have been extremely happy with almost every product of theirs I have used.    If you are looking for a good foaming dispensed soap with mild germicidal properties yet without noxious chemicals, this is a great choice.    Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I tried this years ago in a doctor&#x27;s office and loved it. Just got around  to finding it online. It&#x27;s spendy but worth it being just as wonderful as I remember with a natural subtle fragrance and great lather that rinses well.</li>
            <li> The soap is good and smells like cinnamon, but the bottle is leaking while being shipped.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before buying.  I bought it primarily because it was recommended as a mix in a self-made essential oils mixture to deter fleas.  I am into essential oils as I am tired of the heavy chemical alternatives... so I read online that you can mix your own flea deterrant with some specific essential oils and add a little of this Thieves Foaming Hand Soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t say that this soap alone has a wonderful smell... it doesn&#x27;t smell that pretty taken alone but when you mix it with the other essential oils for my flea deterrant, the whole thing smells pretty good.  :-)</li>
            <li> Great product for the skin</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product it not only cleans but sanitizes and softens the hand too. It has a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> When I heard that Thieves was in a foaming soap, I had to have it.  While telling my sister that Bath &amp; Body Works still hasn&#x27;t come out with a foaming soap that doesn&#x27;t include Triclosan, she remembered that she was looking at this and sent me the link.  How awesome! Foaming soap works so much better for my little children washing hands after school than gel that just gets washed down the drain.  I love it! Only wish I bought a few more. When I reorder, I&#x27;ll include a few extras for each sink.</li>
            <li> the product is excellant, I saw it at my acupuncturial&#x27;s office and tried it and liked it so i ordered it here.  Unfortunately it came with no top despensor so there is no way to get it out of the bottle.  I emailed the seller and he told me he would send me another one as soon as it came in with the correct top and refunded me for this one.  I hope they stand by their  products and does that.  Once I get it I will give it a 5 star rating</li>
            <li> Nothing can beat the wonderful smell of this soap as well as the remarkable way it works as a face soap for my husband.  Expensive, but lasts.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li> We love the quality of Young Living products and this is a favorite at our house. It comes out of the pump foamy, feels soft on the hands and smells lovely.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the hand soap and the way it makes my hand feel clean.</li>
            <li> This product was a good buy and I absolutely love thieves essential oils.  I would recommend it for just about anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product. Smells great &amp; is effective. I wish it were cheaper.</li>
            <li> It is expensive but worth it.</li>
            <li> Go ahead. Splurge for what may be one of the most expensive hand soaps out there. But here&#x27;s the deal: it lasts a long long time, it smells amazing, and leaves your hands feeling fabulous. Go for it. You know you want to. You will be totally happy.</li>
            <li> Love this foaming hand soap and have in all my bathrooms.</li>
            <li> great hand wash and smells so good</li>
            <li> I have this at home and anytime I have visitors they comment on how great the soap smells and feels.  It&#x27;s a standard at our home.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy  the smell of this product, my guess all enjoy it too its so refreshing to have in my bathrooms!</li>
            <li> great smell, exacty what I was looking for, found this at a natural healing spa, loved the scent, happy to find online!</li>
            <li> Bought this to use in place of my regular hand soap for washing when coming home from being in public places during flu season.  It has a pleasing aroma due to the essential oils used in it.  Thieves&#x27; oil has been around since the plague days in Europe.  Thieves used to put it upon themselves to keep from getting sick while robbing the dead bodies of their townspeople.  My only complaint is that there is no pumper spout as shown in the photo of the product, just a flip lid and this makes it difficult to wash your hands without first contaminating the top of the bottle.  I put it in my own pump dispenser.  I found this very annoying considering how small the bottle of product is for the money and how hard the bottle is to get open.</li>
            <li> I love the thieves line of products-smell fabulous and better for us all. The price is the big killer. Shave your pennies for these products!</li>
            <li> There is nothing bad I can say about Thieves. It smells like a spiced pie in the oven with all the wonderful essential oils in it, and you can be confident to know its much healthier than all the stuff in the stores with their Sodium Lauryl Sulfate!(look it up if you don&#x27;t understand why it is so bad! And find out why everything from shampoo to hand soaps have SLS in it!) Natural ingredients is amazing! It gets really dry where I live during the winter months, and my hands feel so much better with this hand soap! Check it out!</li>
            <li> Our daughter had a shop a few years ago and sold natural&lt;br /&gt;products.  I began using Thieves Pump Hand Soap then and&lt;br /&gt;continue to enjoy the natural feel and fragrance.</li>
            <li> Excellent Product and great price</li>
            <li> Love this hand soap! It smells great and doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands like the anti-bacterial soaps do! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I do love Thieves Foaming Hand Soap.  I have also use it a s body wash.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and their hand sanitizer for those who don&#x27;t want to destroy their natural occurring immunity.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Thieves hand sanitizer for my grown children who are teachers, medical student on hospital rotations and a lawyer who is an ADA in the Bronx- regular delousing of offices for one thing or another.</li>
            <li> This stuff lasts forever and smells divine. I am sensitive to most scents-this one works for me! Great for cleansing what you need cleansed.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Great hand soap and smells great.</li>
