            <li> What a lovely color! Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> great deep red color, good quality nail polish. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> It is a classic red color that every women should own one. Easy to apply, cream finish and a one coater! However, if you have one already, you may want to pass.</li>
            <li> Beautiful, rich, dark red color. Professional and sophisticated looking so you can wear it to work or for fun. Chips a little easy, but a great polish nevertheless.</li>
            <li> its a favorite color and the packaging was perfect. no damages and absolutely love the color and texture is not lumpy.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  I will only buy my OPI products from this stored.  Excellent customer service.  You know you are getting the real thing and not a knock-off.  I trust this store and love OPI</li>
            <li> Very pretty color of red. Fantastic coverage. It&#x27;s not too bright, no glitter. Just a really classy polish for year round wear! I&#x27;m very pleased with this one. I use on toes and fingers. Not in your face red either. I&#x27;d purchase again. Just a touch of class and sex appeal with this one. Quite pleased. I live in a City/State where we have sun almost all year long so I can enjoy showing off my toes too. Packaged well and arrived on time of course! Roses are red, polish is sassy, paint up in style and wow are you classy !</li>
            <li> Favorite OPI Color!!!  Love this, on 3rd bottle.</li>
            <li> OPI is what I prefer to use over nail polishes next to Sally Hansen products. All the nail salons use it, so can I say more?</li>
            <li> wrong color both times</li>
            <li> I love it! Love the color &amp; how well it stays on my toes! Delivery was very quick, too.</li>
            <li> OPI is a quality nail polish and the &amp;#34;All I Want for Christmas&amp;#34; is a deep, beautiful red--exemplifying the color of the season beautifully!&lt;br /&gt;Service was quick and the quality bar none!</li>
            <li> arrived quickly. this nail polish is EXACTLY what i&#x27;ve been looking for. If you&#x27;re looking for a CHRISTMAS RED like I was, this is the one. Not too orange or too dark like other reds. perfectly toned with great depth of color. love.</li>
            <li> Really was excited to find this shade. Was not happy with the product. It had been thinned out and the consistency was horrible. Couldn&#x27;t use at all just smeared and looked greasy. Never had this problem with an opi polish before. Will not order again.</li>
            <li> Limited yes... So I got my own bottle. Shade rocks that fashion place between the big apple red and Lincoln park plum... Happy mani-pedi time. Lasts well.</li>
            <li> This color was see through and after two coats it still didn&#x27;t look like a normal quality OPI Product. I wouldn&#x27;t bother to wear it again.</li>
            <li> Great color! Arrived in just a couple of days!</li>
