            <li>My wife was very happy with the product and will not hesitate to reorder when required,all arrived safe and sound and on time thank you.</li>
            <li>No one makes anything better!</li>
            <li>love it!  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and looks great.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my wife ,she saw it on line and liked the color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a perfect matte finish and makes my face look very natural.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to apply and provides great coverage while still feeling light.</li>
            <li>Love the formula, the power finish is not drying nor oily.</li>
            <li>absolutely love the colour, and the price.  </li>
            <li>I love this foundation</li>
            <li>and  easily  doesn&#x27;t  feel  like  layers  of  makeup</li>
            <li>It was fine.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back to this stuff and so happy.</li>
            <li>A light foundation</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a better color match, it is easy to swipe with a flat top brush and swipe over face.</li>
            <li>I have experimented with so many different brands of foundation from liquid to powder and this has been my favorite.</li>
            <li>My wife says it&#x27;s nice not to have to wear liquid foundation, especially while traveling.</li>
            <li>I look fresh all the time.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t go around trying to wipe your face against anyone, then this can stay on pretty well during your work day without any touch ups.</li>
            <li>When I ran out of this the first time, I decided to try and switch over to Revlon&#x27;s ColorStay powder...</li>
            <li>going to now order some more but in a different shade.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly what I ordered, but not the case.  </li>
            <li>(I haven&#x27;t tried to set it with a powder yet), but if that&#x27;s not something that bothers you, then I really do recommend.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I could tell it was much darker on my face.</li>
            <li>: While I love this product, I would be careful if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This foundation does not stay on your face as it comes off quickly and is currently on my shirt collar and my work documents.</li>
            <li>When I looked on the bottom of that compact as well as the remaining one, I found I had been sent 2 Natural tans and 1 medium beige.</li>
            <li>I received an item that was packaged in a white (not black as shown) holder that looks like it is a SAMPLE.</li>
            <li>, she was a little suprised that it was much darker than the pic.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I prefer this foundation over nars bc it&#x27;s a better color match, it is easy to swipe with a flat top brush and swipe over face. I feel the coverage is a solid medium coverage. It does come off, as others have mentioned, but I haven&#x27;t set it with a powder. I will try and then update this review. If you don&#x27;t go around trying to wipe your face against anyone, then this can stay on pretty well during your work day without any touch ups. I would recommend this to friends and family. Love the formula, the power finish is not drying nor oily. It&#x27;s a perfect matte finish and makes my face look very natural.</li>
            <li> Inside it&#x27;s the same product as always, but now it&#x27;s packaged differently.  Instead of the sleek, dark compact with a mirror shown online, it&#x27;s a bigger, clunkier white container with no mirror.  When I saw this photo online, I ordered 4, but sent them back when the ugly white ones arrived.  I wrote Revlon, who said you can&#x27;t get this compact anymore.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It goes on so smooth and looks great. I have olive toned skin and it matches perfect. It&#x27;s really easy to apply and provides great coverage while still feeling light. When I ran out of this the first time, I decided to try and switch over to Revlon&#x27;s ColorStay powder...big mistake. The finish was chalky and made my skin feel incredibly dry. Now I&#x27;m back to this stuff and so happy. It&#x27;s great coverage and I hardly ever have to reapply. I have experimented with so many different brands of foundation from liquid to powder and this has been my favorite. I do admit it rubs off and tends to get on my clothes (I haven&#x27;t tried to set it with a powder yet), but if that&#x27;s not something that bothers you, then I really do recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: While I love this product, I would be careful if you have sensitive skin. For the many months I used it, I had pretty terrible breakouts in clusters around my chin and cheeks, which is not normal for me. Ironically, this was the makeup that best covered up the acne it was giving me. I am only writing this because I finally--with reluctance--have switched to a different oil-free liquid makeup and my breakouts have dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be without this compact. It&#x27;s a foundation and powder all in one. A light foundation but it lasts all day. The two-in-one compact is perfect for touch-ups. I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and hope Revlon never discontinues it. No one makes anything better!</li>
            <li> I received the 3 compacts but only opened 1 of the boxes, which was all I needed at the time. It was fine.  After I finished that compact I opened the 2nd box on April 2nd. It looked very dark. I tried using it but I could tell it was much darker on my face. When I looked on the bottom of that compact as well as the remaining one, I found I had been sent 2 Natural tans and 1 medium beige. Medium beige is what I had ordered. Now I have spent about $22.00 out of the $33.00 for products I can&#x27;t use. Because I did not open the box until after the return date (there was no need to because I trusted the seller) I am now stuck with 2 I cannot use and must try to find the shade I need.</li>
            <li> product does as stated.</li>
            <li> I loved this product.. It came as what I expected...</li>

            <li> This is my go-to cream foundation especially for travel when I want to limit on bringing liquid products.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly what I ordered, but not the case.  It is pictured in brown, received white.</li>
