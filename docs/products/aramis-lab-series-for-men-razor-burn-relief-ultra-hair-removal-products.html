    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>I use the Lab Series preshave which is also excellent and</li>
            <li>this lotion is perfect after shaving.  </li>
            <li>He is very impressed.</li>
            <li>I use this Razor Burn Relief after a very-close shaving session; it is an excellent follow-up.</li>
            <li>What I was received was great!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>I read good reviews of the Anthony Ingrown Hair Treatment, so I took a shot with that.</li>
            <li>Again, good reviews for this product, but no luck here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Lab Series products are among the best on the market, and well worth the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best for women too, after you shave your legs it really works.</li>
            <li>Both have a nice odor that isn&#x27;t too strong.  </li>
            <li>This is the ideal aftershave for any guy with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try both burn remedies to see which is better</li>
            <li>Lab series has excellent products overall.  </li>
            <li>OK all you manly men out there who wouldn&#x27;t think of rubbing a lotion on your mug after dragging 4 or 5 blades over it for 10 minutes, listen up: this stuff will make you glad you did shave.</li>
            <li>Been using this for many years and love it</li>
            <li>One can easily pair this with their favorite aftershave scent.</li>
            <li>Great scentless, or nearly scentless aftershave.</li>
            <li>Having sensitive skin, this product works great.</li>
            <li>I have tried their other post/after shave products and found them to be excellent!</li>
            <li>Look, you only get one face, so why not let it feel good after working it over?</li>
            <li>Helps with razor burn, ingrown hairs, healthy looking and soft skin.</li>
            <li>First, a bit of background</li>
            <li>One is more liquid, this one, and the 3 in 1 is more thick.  </li>
            <li>This lotion cools down the skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>Discovered this many years ago and never went back to my old aftershaves.</li>
            <li>I purchased this a few months ago and was kind of concerned because of the price being considerable cheaper compared to that of Dillard&#x27;s which is $32.00 a bottle now!</li>
            <li>but it is so mild that it is undetectable shortly after use.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but keeps ya young and the wrinkles away!!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, curly hair, and this really helps with irritation.</li>
            <li>If applied right after my shaving, it will reduce any reddening of my face and help to minimize any subsequent burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My husband has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have several other Lab Series products that I absolutely love, so I figured I would give this a shot.</li>
            <li>I have always suffered from razor burn/irritation and have tried many things to try to control it over the past year, including ditching the 5-blade plastic razor and going with a safety razor.</li>
            <li>actually liked the previous version of this product better; it was less viscous than this present one, so it came out of the bottle a little bit easier, and it seems I did not have to use as much because it appeared to spread easier than this thicker formulation.</li>
            <li>I use this stuff religiously on my sensitive neck and it keeps razor burn and ingrown hairs away.  </li>
            <li>This product does leave my skin soft, so it does have that going for it.</li>
            <li>This particular product by Lab Series did nothing for my facial skin one way or another after shaving.  </li>
            <li>but essentially they do much the same thing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> You may need to use a moisturizer after but having something to take down the burning sensation is a must.  </li>
            <li> maybe Jack Black.</li>
            <li> I was really surprised and disappointed - not worth the money spent in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little milky/creamy, like a thin aftershave balm.</li>
            <li> He puts this on immediately after a shave and no more burns!</li>
            <li> Leaves an oily film even though I use a very very small amount.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t produce the results you are looking for, you at least have a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ever and its getting very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive!</li>
            <li> Worst part, it is overpriced!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I use this stuff religiously on my sensitive neck and it keeps razor burn and ingrown hairs away.  Great stuff!</li>
            <li> Used this product for over 15 years.  A bit pricey, but keeps ya young and the wrinkles away!! No burning either!!</li>
            <li> This is the ideal aftershave for any guy with sensitive skin. And it is odorless for folks with allergies or just don&#x27;t want an overpowering scent. Discovered this many years ago and never went back to my old aftershaves.</li>
            <li> This lotion cools down the skin nicely.  You may need to use a moisturizer after but having something to take down the burning sensation is a must.  I use the Lab Series preshave which is also excellent and this lotion is perfect after shaving.  Also the 3 in 1 post shave by Lab series does the same thing.  I thought I&#x27;d try both burn remedies to see which is better but essentially they do much the same thing.  One is more liquid, this one, and the 3 in 1 is more thick.  Both have a nice odor that isn&#x27;t too strong.  Lab series has excellent products overall.  I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> This particular product by Lab Series did nothing for my facial skin one way or another after shaving.  I was really surprised and disappointed - not worth the money spent in my opinion.  However and in all fairness to Lab Series.  I have tried their other post/after shave products and found them to be excellent!</li>
            <li> My husband has very sensitive skin. After each shave his face became red, irritated and burned. I bought this for him based on other reviews and it did not disappoint. He puts this on immediately after a shave and no more burns! He is very impressed. Will always have this product in our house!</li>
            <li> My husband have used this for years and swears by this products</li>
            <li> I use this Razor Burn Relief after a very-close shaving session; it is an excellent follow-up. If applied right after my shaving, it will reduce any reddening of my face and help to minimize any subsequent burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually liked the previous version of this product better; it was less viscous than this present one, so it came out of the bottle a little bit easier, and it seems I did not have to use as much because it appeared to spread easier than this thicker formulation.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband because he has a tender face and this helps his skin too.  He likes it.</li>
            <li> OK all you manly men out there who wouldn&#x27;t think of rubbing a lotion on your mug after dragging 4 or 5 blades over it for 10 minutes, listen up: this stuff will make you glad you did shave. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, but I do have fairly sensitive facial skin. I use this after every shave and the few times I&#x27;ve had to go without it, I definitely missed it.

            <li> I have been using this for years. I have sensitive, curly hair, and this really helps with irritation. Give it a try.</li>
            <li> First, a bit of background so you know where I&#x27;m coming from with this review. I have several other Lab Series products that I absolutely love, so I figured I would give this a shot. I have always suffered from razor burn/irritation and have tried many things to try to control it over the past year, including ditching the 5-blade plastic razor and going with a safety razor. I have tried virtually all of the cheap/affordable lotions and creams that you can find at big box stores with no luck. I read good reviews of the Anthony Ingrown Hair Treatment, so I took a shot with that. No luck. Again, good reviews for this product, but no luck here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it doesn&#x27;t work for me, I don&#x27;t want to sabotage the item&#x27;s rating because it may work for some. This product does leave my skin soft, so it does have that going for it. My advice is to give it a shot if you&#x27;re on the fence about it. If it doesn&#x27;t produce the results you are looking for, you at least have a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years now. Helps with razor burn, ingrown hairs, healthy looking and soft skin. Lab series is the company that makes it and it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li> I shave with water only. No cream or soap. Pat dry and apply a pea sized amount of this cream and I&#x27;m good. I&#x27;ve had a 200ml tube last me 5 years since I shave only half the year (other half I go clippers w/o guard).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product and would say its overated. Leaves an oily film even though I use a very very small amount. Also it creates an itchy burning reaction. Worst part, it is overpriced! Will take it back and try something else- maybe Jack Black.</li>
            <li> Great scentless, or nearly scentless aftershave. It&#x27;s a little milky/creamy, like a thin aftershave balm. Does wonders for razor burn. There is a scent but it is so mild that it is undetectable shortly after use. One can easily pair this with their favorite aftershave scent. The only drawback... This stuff is expensive! However, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best for women too, after you shave your legs it really works.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years.</li>
            <li> Having sensitive skin, this product works great. The smallest amount goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product for 10 years.</li>
            <li> Been using this for many years and love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for ever and its getting very hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> I purchased this a few months ago and was kind of concerned because of the price being considerable cheaper compared to that of Dillard&#x27;s which is $32.00 a bottle now! What I was received was great!</li>
