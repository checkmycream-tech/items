            <li>Detangling Brush &#x3D; Happy wife with silky smooth hair.</li>
            <li>I just receive this brush is amazing</li>
            <li>It is a nice brush and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li>The bristles don’t have beads like another detangling brush I own.  </li>
            <li>I use it once in awhile and bristles feel nice on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the great brush!</li>
            <li>This brush is amazing, i just love it  </li>
            <li>Suits my fine hair, nice to hold and shaped well to hold..</li>
            <li>Very good brush for me 8 year old daughters</li>
            <li>my hair get tangle real quick</li>
            <li>i love the wave look.</li>
            <li>you feel refreshing in the morning after brushing.</li>
            <li>This brush is just okay.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have too many flyaways</li>
            <li>and it was able to run hair the length of my hair with no troubles at all.  </li>
            <li>I always bring this brush :)</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I guess I need to buy more of them.  </li>
            <li>Light weight!</li>
            <li>I love how it glides through my hair.</li>
            <li>That glue quickly gave way and the pad quickly came apart from the brush, so I was happy to see that this brush does not have a superglued pad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>bristles are NOT heat resistant , so make sure not to use the brush with or after using heat appliances because the bristles can easily melt.</li>
            <li>love that&#x27;s easy to grab and looks friendly</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nylon bristles are actually supposed to be perfect for detangling hair as they glide through the hair and the Debonhair brush proves that.  </li>
            <li>This brush is easy to use on both of their hair</li>
            <li>This brush is easy to hold and brusing is easy and pain free.</li>
            <li>This is fine.  </li>
            <li>It detangles her fine hair with ease and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>Love it and really works as stated!!</li>
            <li>: I received a free sample for the purposes of review.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great brush if you are looking for something that will truly assist in detangling.</li>
            <li>It seems to smooth away the hair as well as comb through the knots.  </li>
            <li>And this brush did an amazing job, it was fast and painless.</li>
            <li>She was excited when I ordered this brush and after using it she said it makes a huge difference.</li>
            <li>It got the knots and tangles out of my hair quick, painless, and easily.</li>
            <li>This is my first detangling brush and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Bought it for my daughter because her hair is super fine and gets kinks for days.</li>
            <li>I was a doubting Thomas, thinking that without those special bristles it wouldn’t part and separate the hair.  </li>
            <li>And that&#x27;s good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using this removes one more hurdle we face in getting her ready for school in the mornings.</li>
            <li>She was surprised how well it work, sliding right through her hair leaving it detangled and nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>Is very effective on wet hair</li>
            <li>My younger daughter who has similar but far more fine hair (and always complains about brushes getting stuck) loved the brush and said it was much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>My first thought was, this cheap quality.</li>
            <li>I got this brush to use on my two year old and have been quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it two times so far since getting it yesterday but it works great</li>
            <li>but I am thinking this would be better for a young child or teenager to untangle their hair or for someone with shorter thinner hair.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a gift - They love the brush , said it works great in both wet and dry hair</li>
            <li>When I press in the center of the brush, the bristles flex and move with the motion, making it perfect for detangling long hair.  </li>
            <li>Most brushes I use barely get the knots out.</li>
            <li>The bristles are different heights which helps brush through and detangles your hair easily!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a flat, curve paddle brush and is quite comfortable and easy to grasp.  </li>
            <li>Especially good on wet hair as doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand due to the handle.</li>
            <li>I have long hair that gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li>If they do then they hurt so much!</li>
            <li>Works great on my thick curly hair</li>
            <li>More effective than Ceramic Hair Brushes, Standard Bristle Hair Brushes, Paddle Hair Brushes and Wet Hair</li>
            <li>This brush makes it so much easier to brush my hair right out of the shower without spraying any detangler or anything on it.</li>
            <li>none of the other brushes she uses are effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The longer and thicker your hair the more problems you are likely to get with knotting and tangling but with this brush you don&#x27;t have to put your hair up into a pony tail when you are in a rush as this gets the job done very well indeed.</li>
            <li>It works perfect for those mornings when your hair is a bit unruly and you need help getting it in place with the least amount of pain as possible.</li>
            <li>It is very gentle on the knots and works really well.</li>
            <li>Love it with my long hair</li>
            <li>My 10 year-old daughter has long - but frizzy at the top - hair that drives me nuts.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using the product for 2 days I found that it was easy to use, moved smoothly through hair and got rid of knots and tangles much quicker with less effort.</li>
            <li>Not only it can remove knots easily without pain, also it message scalp and help brain circulation that leaves</li>
            <li>I will continue using this brush and will repurchase for certain.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is certainly a well made Detangling hair Brush that&#x27;s lightweight and ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it does do a great job detangling my hair in either wet, damp or dry</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s gentle on my daughter&#x27;s hair but gets the job done</li>
            <li>This Debonhair no-tangle brush is very lightweight, easy-to-handle, and has an eye-popping design.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using this on my daughters very curly hair.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li>That proofs to me that it does not pull my hair out and gently combs through my tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m amazed that a hair brush can make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li>It means that you are using your whole hand to hole it, not just your grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li>and she absolutely LOVES it.  </li>
            <li>My whole family fights over this brush.  </li>
            <li>my daughter run alway from me when she sees other brushes in my hand this one not so much. :)</li>
            <li>They like it more than their other brushes, since their hair gets tangled so often.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Although this brush is primarily for detangling long hair I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it for all types of hair.  </li>
            <li>The brush feels quite durable and it would be quite easy to toss it in a bag to head out to the beach (wet hair there!)</li>
            <li>The brush feels quite durable and it would be quite easy to toss it in a bag to head out to the beach (wet hair there!)</li>
            <li>Not a great brush, but good at detangling.</li>
            <li>I am able to brush my hair straight through in 5 minutes or less!!</li>
            <li>No more pain and tears for Children, the soft, flexible teeth gently massage the scalp increasing circulation and making hair brushing time more a pleasurable experience.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I actually think this one combs through better than the Wet brush.  </li>
            <li>but I think it works fine even with a little water spritz.</li>
            <li>such a stylish brush, it replaces all my previous ones.</li>
            <li>☼  Unique long and short bristle design flex on contact with knots and tangles, removing the damaged</li>
            <li>key differences between this and a standard brush is that the Debonhair is much lighter with a much smaller handle and the bristles are much softer, shorter and have a mixture of medium and large sized bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No crying,</li>
            <li>Used it on my hair without issues and even my stubborn 3 year old</li>
            <li>Obviously its not magic and doesn&#x27;t just comb thru smoothly with the first brush, but I just keep brushing</li>
            <li>Bristles are directly attached to the brush.</li>
            <li>This will probably not make a big difference to most people, but I had to mention this because my most recent (and expensive) brush had bristles attached to a pad that was superglued to the brush.</li>
            <li>It works well on my 5, and 8 year old hair.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my daughter who has the most beautifully thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li>Her hair gets really knotted as well, especially underneath in the back where it rubs against collars.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old is constantly complaining when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised once I combed my hair with the Detangling Brush by Debonhair that the bristles actually touched my scalp</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it because I use it everyday.</li>
            <li>It was used mainly on thick hair first thing in the morning, after swimming and when high winds were present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I needed a heavy-duty brush that could completely brush through the length of my hair, while also permitting me to create a middle part in my hair on a daily basis (detangling combs can&#x27;t do this, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I still spray a little de tangling spray first</li>
            <li>I don’t have long hair, but I was surprised at how well it worked brushing out my unruly mop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not as many stray hairs get caught and left behind in this particular brush as compared to my previous brushes</li>
            <li>and they put up way less of a fight when we are getting ready.  </li>
            <li>They are pretty uncomfortable; however, completely understandable as the unpadded bristles really help with detangling</li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;After using the product for 2 days I found that it was easy to use, moved smoothly through hair and got rid of knots and tangles much quicker with less effort.</li>
            <li> Not only it can remove knots easily without pain, also it message scalp and help brain circulation that leaves</li>
            <li> I will continue using this brush and will repurchase for certain.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is certainly a well made Detangling hair Brush that&#x27;s lightweight and ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it does do a great job detangling my hair in either wet, damp or dry</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s gentle on my daughter&#x27;s hair but gets the job done</li>
            <li> This Debonhair no-tangle brush is very lightweight, easy-to-handle, and has an eye-popping design.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this on my daughters very curly hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair straight and shiny.</li>
            <li> That proofs to me that it does not pull my hair out and gently combs through my tangles.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m amazed that a hair brush can make that much of a difference.</li>
            <li> It means that you are using your whole hand to hole it, not just your grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> and she absolutely LOVES it.  </li>
            <li> My whole family fights over this brush.  </li>
            <li> my daughter run alway from me when she sees other brushes in my hand this one not so much. :)</li>
            <li> They like it more than their other brushes, since their hair gets tangled so often.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Although this brush is primarily for detangling long hair I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it for all types of hair.  </li>
            <li> The brush feels quite durable and it would be quite easy to toss it in a bag to head out to the beach (wet hair there!)</li>
            <li> The brush feels quite durable and it would be quite easy to toss it in a bag to head out to the beach (wet hair there!)</li>
            <li> Not a great brush, but good at detangling.</li>
            <li> I am able to brush my hair straight through in 5 minutes or less!!</li>
            <li> No more pain and tears for Children, the soft, flexible teeth gently massage the scalp increasing circulation and making hair brushing time more a pleasurable experience.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I actually think this one combs through better than the Wet brush.  </li>
            <li> but I think it works fine even with a little water spritz.</li>
            <li> such a stylish brush, it replaces all my previous ones.</li>
            <li> ☼  Unique long and short bristle design flex on contact with knots and tangles, removing the damaged</li>
            <li> key differences between this and a standard brush is that the Debonhair is much lighter with a much smaller handle and the bristles are much softer, shorter and have a mixture of medium and large sized bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No crying,</li>
            <li> Used it on my hair without issues and even my stubborn 3 year old</li>
            <li> Obviously its not magic and doesn&#x27;t just comb thru smoothly with the first brush, but I just keep brushing</li>
            <li> Bristles are directly attached to the brush.</li>
            <li> This will probably not make a big difference to most people, but I had to mention this because my most recent (and expensive) brush had bristles attached to a pad that was superglued to the brush.</li>
            <li> It works well on my 5, and 8 year old hair.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who has the most beautifully thick head of hair.  </li>
            <li> Her hair gets really knotted as well, especially underneath in the back where it rubs against collars.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old is constantly complaining when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised once I combed my hair with the Detangling Brush by Debonhair that the bristles actually touched my scalp</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it because I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It was used mainly on thick hair first thing in the morning, after swimming and when high winds were present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I needed a heavy-duty brush that could completely brush through the length of my hair, while also permitting me to create a middle part in my hair on a daily basis (detangling combs can&#x27;t do this, for example).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still spray a little de tangling spray first</li>
            <li> I don’t have long hair, but I was surprised at how well it worked brushing out my unruly mop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not as many stray hairs get caught and left behind in this particular brush as compared to my previous brushes</li>
            <li> and they put up way less of a fight when we are getting ready.  </li>
            <li> They are pretty uncomfortable; however, completely understandable as the unpadded bristles really help with detangling</li>
            <li> I actually have two brushes - this one for detangling and smoothing my hair out, and the other one for soft, overall brushing/styling.</li>
            <li> My older kids will hide it in their room from the little kids.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting Bristles which will not bend or break.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I am Asian and have long hair that extends to my waistline, so my hair is always tangled by the end of the day from all the movement and activity.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about the technology behind this brush, I only know the results.</li>
            <li> I got my detangler brush and so far not sure how I feel about it yet.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this glides with ease through my wet hair.  </li>
            <li> We tried it with dry hair, I&#x27;m going to try it on wet hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> Has a handle ensuring it will not slip from your hand when wet so can be used as a Wet Hair Brush.</li>
            <li> I have both the Wet Brush and this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have mid-back length hair that tangles a bit unless I run a wide tooth comb through it before styling.</li>
            <li> Her Asian hair is very thick and very long, reaching down to the middle of her back.</li>
            <li> I made the mistake of using my flat iron and than immediately using the brush afterwards and a few of the bristles are now in a curved shape and facing outwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bristles of this brush take apart the tangles after only a couple of tugs, whereas my previous brush would have taken quite a few tugs before my hair would untangle</li>
            <li> On the other hand, the bristles are kinda pointy which sometimes poke my scalp when I get too close to it.  </li>
            <li> in mind that the unpadded bristles are pretty uncomfortable, so if you are looking for a softer brush to use, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> all unlike all my other brushes I did not have a bunch of my hair dangling from the brush.  </li>
            <li> I can use it on my wet hair too with no troubles!</li>
            <li> I do use a round brush for blow dry styling however.</li>

            <li> or to just have on hand when the hair gets slightly windblown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She says the bristles are a little pointier than her other brush with the little balls on the end of the bristles.</li>

            <li> I have very long and thick hair.</li>
            <li> My little girls use it.</li>
            <li> I am not big on brushing on my hair with a regular brush after showering and thats why I usually use a wide tooth comb because I am afraid of breaking my hair.</li>
            <li> It is a little awkward to hold since you don&#x27;t hold it like a regular brush, but hold it in the middle.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to anyone who has trouble getting tangles out of your hair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t cry and whine and a job that used to take a few minutes is over in a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> She has very long thin hair</li>
            <li> The handle of the brush is not very long, so you have to hold the brush close to your head, which can be uncomfortable</li>
            <li> No more tears.</li>
            <li> So I can recommend it for hard to manage hair</li>

            <li> I have long thick hair and its very painful to detangle my hair with a comb or regular brush.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, with all of her activities, she also has the most horrific tangles.  </li>
            <li> Looks a little cheesy because of the color, but it otherwise does what it says.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t attest to this unfortunately, but I would imagine that it helps tame flyaways as well</li>
            <li> I am Latina and have very thick dense hair.  </li>
            <li> Not worth what I paid for it very disappointed</li>

            <li> This is fine.  You hold it in the middle not like a regular brush is.  We regularly use \\&quot;Wet Brush\\&quot; but there are advantages and disadvantages between the two.  This has shorter bristles which prevents it from entangling itself with longer hairs.  On the other hand, the bristles are kinda pointy which sometimes poke my scalp when I get too close to it.  Construction is OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided for this review.</li>
            <li> I take this brush with me into my purse :) it comes in handy! It works alright my hair get tangle real quick &amp; i hate brushing my hair. Cus i love the wave look. But using this brush it helps take out the tangle without yanking my hair but hair still fallout when trying to brush it out.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and this glides with ease through my wet hair.  It is a nice brush and fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> such a stylish brush, it replaces all my previous ones. Not only it can remove knots easily without pain, also it message scalp and help brain circulation that leaves you feel refreshing in the morning after brushing.</li>
            <li> The brush came as a &#x27;for review&#x27; item but it doesn&#x27;t matter because what follows was written by our 12 yr. old little girl who is actually using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Debonhair Detangling Brush is great! I have long thick hair so it gets in tangles a lot. Most brushes I use barely get the knots out. If they do then they hurt so much! With this brush it didn&#x27;t hurt at all! It got the knots and tangles out of my hair quick, painless, and easily. I recommend this to anyone who has trouble getting tangles out of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it. No more tears.</li>
            <li> I gave this to my wife to try out. Her Asian hair is very thick and very long, reaching down to the middle of her back. She&#x27;s always on the lookout for something to help manage it, and spends quite a lot of time brushing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was dubious about this &amp;#34;Detangling Brush&amp;#34;--until seconds after she tried it. She was surprised how well it work, sliding right through her hair leaving it detangled and nice and smooth. I don&#x27;t know much about the technology behind this brush, I only know the results. Detangling Brush &#x3D; Happy wife with silky smooth hair. And that&#x27;s good enough for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This brush is great! My 6 year old is constantly complaining when I brush her hair. We tried this detangling brush and it worked great! We tried it with dry hair, I&#x27;m going to try it on wet hair in the morning. She was excited when I ordered this brush and after using it she said it makes a huge difference. So it passes my 6 year olds test!</li>
            <li> I just looooooove this brush it&#x27;s gentle on my daughter&#x27;s hair but gets the job done</li>
            <li> This brush is just okay. I have very long and thick hair. It does detangle and glide through my hair well. It is a little awkward to hold since you don&#x27;t hold it like a regular brush, but hold it in the middle. It also didn&#x27;t tear my hair out like some brushes do.</li>
            <li> Works great on my thick curly hair</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair and this brush just glides right through it; wet or dry. Like the way the bristles are made. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift - They love the brush , said it works great in both wet and dry hair - I plan on buying  one for myself .</li>
            <li> This Debonhair no-tangle brush is very lightweight, easy-to-handle, and has an eye-popping design.  The bristles don’t have beads like another detangling brush I own.  I was a doubting Thomas, thinking that without those special bristles it wouldn’t part and separate the hair.  I don’t have long hair, but I was surprised at how well it worked brushing out my unruly mop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nylon bristles are actually supposed to be perfect for detangling hair as they glide through the hair and the Debonhair brush proves that.  The entire bed of bristles is slightly is densely packed, some of them long, while others short.  It’s a formula, if you could call it that, that works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a flat, curve paddle brush and is quite comfortable and easy to grasp.  When I press in the center of the brush, the bristles flex and move with the motion, making it perfect for detangling long hair.  Children will especially love it when their hair isn’t being pulled by a brush.  It’s a big problem with little ones who need to have their hair brushed, but dislike the discomfort that goes along with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;☼  Removes knots and tangles with ease, gliding through and straightening your hair. The Ultimate Detangling Brush.&lt;br /&gt;☼  Unique long and short bristle design flex on contact with knots and tangles, removing the damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;☼  Has a handle ensuring it will not slip from your hand when wet so can be used as a Wet Hair Brush. Long lasting Bristles which will not bend or break.&lt;br /&gt;☼  No more pain and tears for Children, the soft, flexible teeth gently massage the scalp increasing circulation and making hair brushing time more a pleasurable experience.&lt;br /&gt;☼  Creates healthier hair by helping remove damaged hair and split ends. More effective than Ceramic Hair Brushes, Standard Bristle Hair Brushes, Paddle Hair Brushes and Wet Hair Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although this brush is primarily for detangling long hair I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend it for all types of hair.  The brush feels quite durable and it would be quite easy to toss it in a bag to head out to the beach (wet hair there!) or to just have on hand when the hair gets slightly windblown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.t hesitate to recommend it for all types of hair.

            <li> So great, brushimg my hair is much more pleasant now</li>
            <li> I have two biracial daughters with curly hair.  Two different textures and lengths.  This brush is easy to use on both of their hair and they put up way less of a fight when we are getting ready.  I use it once in awhile and bristles feel nice on my hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> The brush works well for detangling. My little girls use it. They like it more than their other brushes, since their hair gets tangled so often. Brush received for review.</li>
            <li> My daughter hair is so thin and tangles if someone walks past me too fast... It is insane! After I shower my hair is a ball of tangled mess like I haven&#x27;t brushed it in weeks and with this brush.. WITH THIS BRUSH! I am able to brush my hair straight through in 5 minutes or less!! I can truly say it is a life changing experience!&lt;br /&gt;my daughter is happy</li>
            <li> I got this brush to use on my two year old and have been quite pleased.  It detangles her fine hair with ease and doesn&#x27;t hurt.  It is her favorite brush now!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter who has the most beautifully thick head of hair.  Unfortunately, with all of her activities, she also has the most horrific tangles.  Have used it for 2 days.  No crying, no fussing, no refusing to brush her hair.  SHE LOVES IT!  I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> My first thought was, this cheap quality. My granddaughter goes through conditioner like crazy because of her tangles. She saw the brush and after I told her what it was for, she couldn&#x27;t wait to try it. She used just a dab of conditioner and she brushed her hair with no problems. She&#x27;s used it a few times now, and it&#x27;s the only brush she wants to use. So, it&#x27;s not the highest quality brush, but I&#x27;d buy it again just to keep from dealing with all the tangled hair drama and tears. I only give it 4 stars for the materials used, otherwise, it&#x27;s a 5.</li>
            <li> My tender-headed daughter is on the autism spectrum. I searched in brick-and-mortar stores for a brush she could tolerate without tears, and I&#x27;m happy Debonhair and Amazon helped! She loves that it doesn&#x27;t pull at her scalp, and she loves purple. Using this removes one more hurdle we face in getting her ready for school in the mornings. I would buy this product again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Looks a little cheesy because of the color, but it otherwise does what it says.  The bristles are different heights which helps brush through and detangles your hair easily!</li>
            <li> Love it and really works as stated!!</li>
            <li> Love it with my long hair</li>
            <li> This is a great detangling brush for hair that is a bit finer but still curly.  My oldest daughter has thick wavy hair and found that the brush was just ineffective in getting out her tangles.  My younger daughter who has similar but far more fine hair (and always complains about brushes getting stuck) loved the brush and said it was much more comfortable.  So I can recommend it for hard to manage hair that&#x27;s a a bit finer - it&#x27;s a great tool for removing those tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I received a free sample for the purposes of review.</li>
            <li> This brush actually works! I have long hair that gets tangled very easily.</li>
            <li> Wife is so happy with her purchase. She said this is the only brush she would use. none of the other brushes she uses are effective. this one just works great on her tangling hair. Lol.</li>
            <li> Not worth what I paid for it very disappointed</li>
            <li> t&#x27;s great! Used it on my hair without issues and even my stubborn 3 year old let me use it on her hair and she didn&#x27;t complain one bit.</li>
            <li> This is my first detangling brush and I absolutely love it. This is real easy to brush my hair. I have long and thick hair. My hair length is like 28&amp;#34; long. Brusing hair can be a pain sometimes especially when my hair is wet after shower. This brush is easy to hold and brusing is easy and pain free. I will continue using this brush and will repurchase for certain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this on my daughters very curly hair. It is very gentle on the knots and works really well. I still spray a little de tangling spray first but I think it works fine even with a little water spritz.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my daughter because her hair is super fine and gets kinks for days. Used it when she woke up and after her bath and seems to work great! Obviously its not magic and doesn&#x27;t just comb thru smoothly with the first brush, but I just keep brushing and it just works itself out. Definitely worth it because I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Love this brush! I am Asian and have long hair that extends to my waistline, so my hair is always tangled by the end of the day from all the movement and activity.

They are pretty uncomfortable; however, completely understandable as the unpadded bristles really help with detangling&lt;br /&gt;- The handle of the brush is not very long, so you have to hold the brush close to your head, which can be uncomfortable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that the unpadded bristles are pretty uncomfortable, so if you are looking for a softer brush to use, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one. I actually have two brushes - this one for detangling and smoothing my hair out, and the other one for soft, overall brushing/styling. Overall, this is a great brush if you are looking for something that will truly assist in detangling.</li>
            <li> Suits my fine hair, nice to hold and shaped well to hold..</li>
            <li> This Debonhair detangling hair brush was sent to me for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly a well made Detangling hair Brush that&#x27;s lightweight and ergonomic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in what initially looks like a hair colourant box with no instructions inside as you are meant to use it in the same way as you would a standard hair brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key differences between this and a standard brush is that the Debonhair is much lighter with a much smaller handle and the bristles are much softer, shorter and have a mixture of medium and large sized bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the product for 2 days I found that it was easy to use, moved smoothly through hair and got rid of knots and tangles much quicker with less effort. It was used mainly on thick hair first thing in the morning, after swimming and when high winds were present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longer and thicker your hair the more problems you are likely to get with knotting and tangling but with this brush you don&#x27;t have to put your hair up into a pony tail when you are in a rush as this gets the job done very well indeed.</li>
            <li> I am Latina and have very thick dense hair.  I was pleasantly surprised once I combed my hair with the Detangling Brush by Debonhair that the bristles actually touched my scalp and it was able to run hair the length of my hair with no troubles at all.  No snags, hesitations or pulling involved.  Best of all unlike all my other brushes I did not have a bunch of my hair dangling from the brush.  That proofs to me that it does not pull my hair out and gently combs through my tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are NOT heat resistant , so make sure not to use the brush with or after using heat appliances because the bristles can easily melt. I made the mistake of using my flat iron and than immediately using the brush afterwards and a few of the bristles are now in a curved shape and facing outwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it does do a great job detangling my hair in either wet, damp or dry condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review sample.</li>
            <li> I was a skeptic but I&#x27;m amazed that a hair brush can make that much of a difference. My 10 year-old daughter has long - but frizzy at the top - hair that drives me nuts. Every morning I tell her she needs to brush her hair and she says she already did. It never looks neat. This brush has made a difference. I am impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smooths out the flyaways, especially on top. It looks shinier and tidier and she loves using it. Her hair gets really knotted as well, especially underneath in the back where it rubs against collars. This gets through it all. She says the bristles are a little pointier than her other brush with the little balls on the end of the bristles. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to bother her. I like the shape of the handle. It means that you are using your whole hand to hole it, not just your grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible brush. It hurts extremely bad when used.  I would not recommend this product. I am returning it</li>
            <li> My daughters hair can be a nightmare to comb through, especially in the winter.  I have both the Wet Brush and this brush.  I actually think this one combs through better than the Wet brush.  It seems to smooth away the hair as well as comb through the knots.  I have only used it two times so far since getting it yesterday but it works great and my daughter doesn&#x27;t complain when I brush her hair.</li>
            <li> love that&#x27;s easy to grab and looks friendly my daughter run alway from me when she sees other brushes in my hand this one not so much. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my niece and she absolutely LOVES it.  She has very long thin hair and this brush gets all her knots out.</li>
            <li> I dyed my hair frequently, so hair condition is bad. I spend a lot of time to brush my hair. After use this item, I can save tume. Also, it doesn&#x27;t bring pain. I like it! I always bring this brush :)</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing, i just love it  I have long thick hair and its very painful to detangle my hair with a comb or regular brush. And this brush did an amazing job, it was fast and painless.</li>
            <li> I just receive this brush is amazing I love it my 12 years old said that is the best purchase I ever make works perfectly</li>
            <li> Imagine waking up in the morning and you grab your brush to untangle your hair. Instead of wrestling with your mane for 10 minutes you have perfectly untangled hair in just minutes with this wonderful product! I can use it on my wet hair too with no troubles!</li>
            <li> Very good brush for me 8 year old daughters long hair and she hates getting her hair brushed.  Especially good on wet hair as doesn&#x27;t slip out of your hand due to the handle.</li>
            <li> Not a great brush, but good at detangling. Hard to hold.</li>
            <li> My whole family fights over this brush.  My older kids will hide it in their room from the little kids.  I guess I need to buy more of them.  It works well on my 5, and 8 year old hair.  They don&#x27;t cry and whine and a job that used to take a few minutes is over in a few seconds.  Thanks for the great brush!</li>
            <li> Love this brush and my kids too! Will buy again.</li>
            <li> HURTS!  Broke my hair and pulled it out just as much as my regular brush.</li>
            <li> Works great! Light weight!</li>
            <li> This brush makes it so much easier to brush my hair right out of the shower without spraying any detangler or anything on it. I love how it glides through my hair. It works perfect for those mornings when your hair is a bit unruly and you need help getting it in place with the least amount of pain as possible.</li>
            <li> Had a similar brush but without the handle. The handle makes the brush easier to use. My daughter loves that it doesn&#x27;t pull her hair or hurt to brush her hair.</li>
            <li> Brush works well. It helps detangle my hair as it should.</li>
            <li> I got my detangler brush and so far not sure how I feel about it yet. I have mid-back length hair that tangles a bit unless I run a wide tooth comb through it before styling. I am not big on brushing on my hair with a regular brush after showering and thats why I usually use a wide tooth comb because I am afraid of breaking my hair. I do use a round brush for blow dry styling however. I am going to keep using it as it says it creates healthier hair but I am thinking this would be better for a young child or teenager to untangle their hair or for someone with shorter thinner hair.</li>
