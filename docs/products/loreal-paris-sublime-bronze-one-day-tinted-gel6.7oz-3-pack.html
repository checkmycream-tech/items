            <li>Excellent product so much better than letting my face leather up in a tanning booth or in the sun Using for 8 years.</li>
            <li>Once it dries, you&#x27;re good.</li>

            <li>I am very pleased with this product, I use latex gloves to avoid staining my hands and mix it with body lotion.</li>

            <li>I am beyond pleased with this product!</li>
            <li>and it applies really nice and evenly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice product</li>
            <li>This product is so nice because it washes off.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a self tanning fiend like me, you probably have a box of disposable gloves handy anyways.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t rub off -- Does the trick for me without any commitment.</li>
            <li>This product works pretty good, and trust me I have used everything out there!</li>
            <li>I love it-so much better than paying for tanning booth!</li>
            <li>My 3 pack came two days after ordering and was very securely packaged.</li>
            <li>ALSO LOVE THIS PRODUCT......</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better than orange palms.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>I wish it had more staying power.  </li>
            <li>Get yourself some cheap rubber gloves (the kind for doing dishes, about $3) and cut them off at the wrist.</li>
            <li>MY FAVORITE must have beauty product.</li>
            <li>going the safe way</li>
            <li>I simply love.....</li>
            <li>I love Loreal Paris</li>
            <li>I have found something better</li>
            <li>I love this lotion because it&#x27;s not a self tanner</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;tint lotion&amp;#34; for many years.  </li>
            <li>Okay, that&#x27;s a lie.  </li>
            <li>I was able to look tan again :)</li>
            <li>Love the product please keep it in stock will continue to order.</li>
            <li>Stay tan! :)</li>
            <li>I love this self-tanner but for me, this is not something to just apply and go.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I am very fair, and I like to be able to get a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; without the hassle of instant tanners (orange hands, waiting for it to work, etc.).  </li>
            <li>i found an awesome self tanner that is amazing but its a pain to put on every few days</li>
            <li>Works good but need to really rub it in and wash your hands afterwards .</li>
            <li>the next morning I was absolutely delighted when I looked in the mirror!</li>
            <li>no streaks and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I Love this product it gives your face a nice tan look with out really tanning.</li>
            <li>and it washes off so easily.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t wash off easily in water however, it does come off easily with soap and water.</li>
            <li>Note that this is NOT a self-tanner but a one-day application that easily rinses off at the end of the day in the shower with soap and water.</li>
            <li>if you dont put enough time into putting this on and making sure its 100% perfect it would probably be very streaky.</li>
            <li>Product gets in creases of skin and doesn&#x27;t look smooth, it could be my skin type and age though</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s obviously important to research the product to see if it streaks, stains or leaves your skin an unflattering color.  </li>
            <li>It was so cheap if you buy it in the 3 pack.</li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s vendors became my answer to getting what I want at a great price (about 1/3 to 1/4 of what I have to pay at Sephora for a totally substandard product.)</li>
            <li>It comes out VERY brownish/bronze but blends out very smoothly to a nice tan color.</li>
            <li>Be sure &amp; wash your hands right away or it will stain them.</li>
            <li>While I worked there so many women came in saying that they have skin cancer yet hopped right into the tanning bed anyway.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>very easy to apply, dries fast and smells like baby powder so over all a plesent smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using faux tan for many years, but this is a daily tan, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>Color is nice and very natural looking...</li>
            <li>I got this today and was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li>Glitter on a man&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t cool.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for everyone who wants a healthy look without baking in the sun</li>
            <li>This has a nice natural looking color to it.</li>
            <li>Sigh, thanks dad love you too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m REALLY light skinned and this product makes my face look healthy and very natural.  </li>
            <li>and I had applied it SUPER sparingly.</li>
            <li>Do note: You need to apply quickly &amp; evenly and work it in.</li>
            <li>and I was very pleased with it, until I walked outside.</li>
            <li>Fast seller!!  </li>
            <li>As it dried the smell went away and was able to apply my own lotion and perfume without any interference.</li>
            <li>I specifically read the reviews on this product carefully because when you&#x27;re fair skinned and purchasing a bronzer or self tanning product</li>
            <li>In my opinion, it&#x27;s better than the newer Loreal bronzers by far.</li>
            <li>Having this one-day tan, let&#x27;s me keep up the tanned appearance while s being able to exfoliate the old tan off.</li>
            <li>Perfect for a day in the park, to camouflage your lily white legs without incurring sun damage from a real tan, or having to commit to a long term wearing faux tan.  </li>
            <li>RIGHT AFTER also.</li>
            <li>For the first time I have felt totally let down by reviews - LOL!</li>
            <li>Overall, great product, everyone who uses self tanners regularly should have this in their arsenal</li>
            <li>This stuff is OK especially if you are allergic to self tanners containing DHA, as is my case.</li>
            <li>This product leaves me looking like I have natural color, and doesn&#x27;t look like &amp;#34;tan in a bottle.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m rather light skinned.</li>
            <li>I would put the bronzer on first then do hair, make up, and then get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had purchased this product when it first came out (</li>
            <li>Unlike the expensive competitors, it truly does not transfer on to clothing, it smells good all day, washes off easily at night in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t  emphasize every skin flaw and wrinkle like those super shiny bronzers.  </li>
            <li>MIX WITH SALLY HANSEN AIRBRUSH LEGS FOR A SUPER- NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li>I love this product because I have Vitiligo and if I have some place to go to and haven&#x27;t had time to apply self tanner that needs to \\&quot;process\\&quot;, I can just get out of the shower, dry off and apply immediately.</li>
            <li>I got smart &amp; use gloves now.</li>
            <li>I am naturally pretty fair skinned and love having a little color all year round.</li>
            <li>I am already very tan from using a tanning bed</li>
            <li>Use too much and you&#x27;ll look a bit &amp;#34;Well Done&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Gosh this stuff really works well.</li>
            <li>thanks to this merchant</li>
            <li>It looks so real.  </li>
            <li>so I feel comfortable baring those white legs!</li>
            <li>Once it sets it&#x27;s very water resistant, yet washes off with soap and water when its time.  </li>
            <li>I love to use this product when I want to darken up my existing tan or daily when I&#x27;m letting an old tan fade out.</li>
            <li>True, it&#x27;s not really a self-tanner, more of a skin stain, BUT it does not streak like regular tanners and lasts about 3 days if you don&#x27;t exfoliate it off in the shower.  </li>
            <li>have used other loreal self tanners and love.</li>
            <li>It is the rich tan to die for without actually having to die&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li>This stuff also works great if you mix a little bit of moisturizer lotion with it for dry areas like knees.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to fix if you make a mistake since it washes off (unlike self tanners) and gives me just enough color for early spring</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re a redhead, even one with not particularly pasty skin, get AeroTan Sex Symbol, this looks much more natural.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the new tanning bed!  </li>
            <li>I decided to give this a try after all the reviews I read were positive and indicated no orangeness and that it looked totally natural.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The tan doesn&#x27;t come off with normal day-to-day activities, even with sweating or if it rubs against clothes.  </li>
            <li>And right after I apply, the Loreal tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t run on my clothes, especially my whites.</li>
            <li>Did not appear to be new items.</li>
            <li>Sublime Bronze One-Day Tinted Gel is my new savior.</li>
            <li>This gives a very natural bronze/ tan color.</li>
            <li>I usually use Sex Symbol by AeroTan and love it to pieces.</li>
            <li>I prefer a natural looking tan instead of a shimmery bronze and when you apply this stuff, especially when you do it with your hands or even a glove, it&#x27;s pretty streaky.</li>
            <li>Im not sure about how this shows up in the natural light but from what i see it looks very bronze not orange but that could be because of how tan i am already.</li>
            <li>This is a great product if you want to look tan but not have the dangerous sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>Not heavy.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it develops a beautifully delicate sun-kissed color.  </li>
            <li>A natural tan that looked the equivalent of using Jergens tanning lotion every day for a week.</li>
            <li>Natural tan with no streaks.</li>
            <li>So next time around I put regular lotion on my hands first.......</li>
            <li>Although an everyday application may be a pain in the fanny, I find the one-day tanner to be the much better option in the long run.</li>
            <li>she is extremely pale so this will prove the worth of the product!</li>
            <li>and I thin Sally Hanson Spraybrush Legs works much better, it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes if you sweat (I live in the desert and am accustomed to 110</li>
            <li>The product is designed rather for models who need a quick tan for a photo secion and already, the profucto little to recommend outdoor</li>
            <li>It truly fades much more evenly than other bronzers and is less streaky if applied like I do.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s better if you wait a few hours (this is usually spent watching TV and painting my nails or lip-syncing into my brush to Lana Del Ray wishing I had her lips.)</li>
            <li>was surprised how quickly it worked, shocked at how dark your hands get when applying - only used once but was happy with results.  </li>
            <li>I have been using self-tanners for a very long time and the main problem I found with them</li>
            <li>Was a little worried at first because it did have a little bit of a &amp;#34;self tanner smell&amp;#34; at first.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I just rubbed it all over, waited until it dried</li>
            <li>My hands were dry when I applied the tanner the first time so it did slightly stain my hands.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It comes out VERY brownish/bronze but blends out very smoothly to a nice tan color.</li>
            <li> Be sure &amp; wash your hands right away or it will stain them.</li>
            <li> While I worked there so many women came in saying that they have skin cancer yet hopped right into the tanning bed anyway.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> very easy to apply, dries fast and smells like baby powder so over all a plesent smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using faux tan for many years, but this is a daily tan, and I love it!  </li>
            <li> Color is nice and very natural looking...</li>
            <li> I got this today and was super excited to try it.</li>
            <li> Glitter on a man&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t cool.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for everyone who wants a healthy look without baking in the sun</li>
            <li> This has a nice natural looking color to it.</li>
            <li> Sigh, thanks dad love you too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m REALLY light skinned and this product makes my face look healthy and very natural.  </li>
            <li> and I had applied it SUPER sparingly.</li>
            <li> Do note: You need to apply quickly &amp; evenly and work it in.</li>
            <li> and I was very pleased with it, until I walked outside.</li>
            <li> Fast seller!!  </li>
            <li> As it dried the smell went away and was able to apply my own lotion and perfume without any interference.</li>
            <li> I specifically read the reviews on this product carefully because when you&#x27;re fair skinned and purchasing a bronzer or self tanning product</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s better than the newer Loreal bronzers by far.</li>
            <li> Having this one-day tan, let&#x27;s me keep up the tanned appearance while s being able to exfoliate the old tan off.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a day in the park, to camouflage your lily white legs without incurring sun damage from a real tan, or having to commit to a long term wearing faux tan.  </li>
            <li> RIGHT AFTER also.</li>
            <li> For the first time I have felt totally let down by reviews - LOL!</li>
            <li> Overall, great product, everyone who uses self tanners regularly should have this in their arsenal</li>
            <li> This stuff is OK especially if you are allergic to self tanners containing DHA, as is my case.</li>
            <li> This product leaves me looking like I have natural color, and doesn&#x27;t look like &amp;#34;tan in a bottle.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m rather light skinned.</li>
            <li> I would put the bronzer on first then do hair, make up, and then get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product when it first came out (</li>
            <li> Unlike the expensive competitors, it truly does not transfer on to clothing, it smells good all day, washes off easily at night in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t  emphasize every skin flaw and wrinkle like those super shiny bronzers.  </li>
            <li> MIX WITH SALLY HANSEN AIRBRUSH LEGS FOR A SUPER- NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li> I love this product because I have Vitiligo and if I have some place to go to and haven&#x27;t had time to apply self tanner that needs to \\&quot;process\\&quot;, I can just get out of the shower, dry off and apply immediately.</li>
            <li> I got smart &amp; use gloves now.</li>
            <li> I am naturally pretty fair skinned and love having a little color all year round.</li>
            <li> I am already very tan from using a tanning bed</li>
            <li> Use too much and you&#x27;ll look a bit &amp;#34;Well Done&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Gosh this stuff really works well.</li>
            <li> thanks to this merchant</li>
            <li> It looks so real.  </li>
            <li> so I feel comfortable baring those white legs!</li>
            <li> Once it sets it&#x27;s very water resistant, yet washes off with soap and water when its time.  </li>
            <li> I love to use this product when I want to darken up my existing tan or daily when I&#x27;m letting an old tan fade out.</li>
            <li> True, it&#x27;s not really a self-tanner, more of a skin stain, BUT it does not streak like regular tanners and lasts about 3 days if you don&#x27;t exfoliate it off in the shower.  </li>
            <li> have used other loreal self tanners and love.</li>
            <li> It is the rich tan to die for without actually having to die&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> This stuff also works great if you mix a little bit of moisturizer lotion with it for dry areas like knees.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to fix if you make a mistake since it washes off (unlike self tanners) and gives me just enough color for early spring</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re a redhead, even one with not particularly pasty skin, get AeroTan Sex Symbol, this looks much more natural.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the new tanning bed!  </li>
            <li> I decided to give this a try after all the reviews I read were positive and indicated no orangeness and that it looked totally natural.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The tan doesn&#x27;t come off with normal day-to-day activities, even with sweating or if it rubs against clothes.  </li>
            <li> And right after I apply, the Loreal tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t run on my clothes, especially my whites.</li>
            <li> Did not appear to be new items.</li>
            <li> Sublime Bronze One-Day Tinted Gel is my new savior.</li>
            <li> This gives a very natural bronze/ tan color.</li>
            <li> I usually use Sex Symbol by AeroTan and love it to pieces.</li>
            <li> I prefer a natural looking tan instead of a shimmery bronze and when you apply this stuff, especially when you do it with your hands or even a glove, it&#x27;s pretty streaky.</li>
            <li> Im not sure about how this shows up in the natural light but from what i see it looks very bronze not orange but that could be because of how tan i am already.</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want to look tan but not have the dangerous sun exposure.  </li>
            <li> Not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it develops a beautifully delicate sun-kissed color.  </li>
            <li> A natural tan that looked the equivalent of using Jergens tanning lotion every day for a week.</li>
            <li> Natural tan with no streaks.</li>
            <li> So next time around I put regular lotion on my hands first.......</li>
            <li> Although an everyday application may be a pain in the fanny, I find the one-day tanner to be the much better option in the long run.</li>
            <li> she is extremely pale so this will prove the worth of the product!</li>
            <li> and I thin Sally Hanson Spraybrush Legs works much better, it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes if you sweat (I live in the desert and am accustomed to 110</li>
            <li> The product is designed rather for models who need a quick tan for a photo secion and already, the profucto little to recommend outdoor</li>
            <li> It truly fades much more evenly than other bronzers and is less streaky if applied like I do.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s better if you wait a few hours (this is usually spent watching TV and painting my nails or lip-syncing into my brush to Lana Del Ray wishing I had her lips.)</li>
            <li> was surprised how quickly it worked, shocked at how dark your hands get when applying - only used once but was happy with results.  </li>
            <li> I have been using self-tanners for a very long time and the main problem I found with them</li>
            <li> Was a little worried at first because it did have a little bit of a &amp;#34;self tanner smell&amp;#34; at first.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I just rubbed it all over, waited until it dried</li>
            <li> My hands were dry when I applied the tanner the first time so it did slightly stain my hands.</li>
            <li> It gives you a streaky dark brown look, if that is what you are into, this product is for you, otherwise, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li> This product is very messy and doesn&#x27;t really work that well.</li>
            <li> It dries while I dry my hair or put on makeup,almost instantly, and then I can get dressed without worrying about transferring to my clothing!</li>
            <li> I recommend using a pair of rubber gloves when applying to the body and then squirting some of the gel on a cotton swab to apply to hands/wrists and feet/ankles in a circular motion and then definitely allow some time to dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad, because I love it!  </li>
            <li> but, If you drop water or liquid sweat on the skin derramarte you&#x27;re ice cream, be careful with the clothes, especially in areas that have painted skin contact</li>
            <li> and I can use this when I&#x27;m really pale and it looks totally natural.</li>
            <li> Let it fully dry before putting on any clothes.</li>
            <li> Once it&#x27;s dry it stays on and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes.</li>
            <li> If I step in the shower it instantly runs down my body and I do not even have to scrub it off.</li>
            <li> Has absolutely no after-smell, like the self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my skin with an orange, very unnatural tint or, leaves a glitter-like substance behind.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful not to get on your hands as it stains.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Excuse me, is that your tan running down the rain gutter?\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I do see that I am in the extreme minority here with my review.</li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint...</li>
            <li> It was so streaky and so dark</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product locally, although I&#x27;ve bought it from Walgreen&#x27;s in the past!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bit of a pain</li>
            <li> Wear them to apply this Bronzer and you will save your palms from turning dark!</li>
            <li> So sometimes my tans get a little spotty.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it staining my hands</li>
            <li> but my point is im very dark and this stuff made me darker!</li>
            <li> That makes it hard to find something for some color since I am so</li>
            <li> its hard to spread onto your skin.</li>
            <li> Now I have my process for using this stuff: I rub it all over and wait at least an hour</li>
            <li> But, not this product, and it gives me a daily bronze tan, that others can&#x27;t believe is fake!</li>
            <li> It looks kinda fake</li>
            <li> Sadly I bought 3 bottles to get my Amazon PRIME discount</li>
            <li> I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fake looking shimmer to it like some tinted lotions do.</li>
            <li> , You can leave brown spots that appear dirty, but is removed when washing clothes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really terrible about moisturizing EVERYDAY....</li>
            <li> I work for my dad and he took one look and said it looked like I painted myself with a bad paintbrush...</li>
            <li> I hate to leave bad reviews</li>
            <li> this stains your hands SO BADLY!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even believe how horrible it looked.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Product gets in creases of skin and doesn&#x27;t look smooth, it could be my skin type and age though</li>
            <li> I came across this while shopping at The Christmas Tree Shop in Nashua, NH.  It costs $3.99.  I am going on a day trip to Hampton Beach tomorrow and I think that I am going to use this and try it out at the beach.</li>
            <li> ALSO LOVE THIS PRODUCT......MIX WITH SALLY HANSEN AIRBRUSH LEGS FOR A SUPER- NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li> This stuff is OK especially if you are allergic to self tanners containing DHA, as is my case. It looks kinda fake and I thin Sally Hanson Spraybrush Legs works much better, it doesn&#x27;t stain your clothes if you sweat (I live in the desert and am accustomed to 110+ degrees every summer.) If you sweat, this drips or comes off on your clothes. Will stain all synthetic materials.</li>
            <li> This product works pretty good, and trust me I have used everything out there! I am a melanoma survivor, so no sun, and I am allergic to whatever is in the self-tanners.  That makes it hard to find something for some color since I am so pale!&lt;br /&gt;As for the staining of the hands, I never have this problem.  The key is to apply it to both arms, wash your hands, one leg, wash your hands, next leg, wash your hands, etc.  It&#x27;s a little bit of a pain but it&#x27;s better than orange palms.&lt;br /&gt;One reviewer said it did not come off when splashed with water.  I wish it worked that way for me but it doesn&#x27;t. If I step in the shower it instantly runs down my body and I do not even have to scrub it off. That would be my only complaint...I wish it had more staying power.  And of course, if a rain shower pops up it makes me nervous.  It also rubs off for me if I cross my legs so that&#x27;s a bummer.  It does not look orange though and it applies really nice and evenly so the benefits definitely outweigh the cons.</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanners for 20 years, everything from Estee Lauder to Banana Boat and this stuff is my fav! True, it&#x27;s not really a self-tanner, more of a skin stain, BUT it does not streak like regular tanners and lasts about 3 days if you don&#x27;t exfoliate it off in the shower.  It truly fades much more evenly than other bronzers and is less streaky if applied like I do. Also, have you ever applied a self-tanner and then accidentally dripped water on yourself? Streaky, drippy city. NOT this stuff. Once it dries, you&#x27;re good. No worries about someone splashing you at the pool or getting rained on. (Talk about embarrassing. \\&quot;Excuse me, is that your tan running down the rain gutter?\\&quot; HA.)  Here is the best way to apply it:  Get yourself some cheap rubber gloves (the kind for doing dishes, about $3) and cut them off at the wrist. Wear them to apply this Bronzer and you will save your palms from turning dark! Wash gloves when you are done and save them for the next time.  This stuff also works great if you mix a little bit of moisturizer lotion with it for dry areas like knees.  I just hope they don&#x27;t discontinue this...if so I am buying a case!</li>
            <li> It works great! Was a little worried at first because it did have a little bit of a &amp;#34;self tanner smell&amp;#34; at first. As it dried the smell went away and was able to apply my own lotion and perfume without any interference. I didn&#x27;t have any trouble with it staining my hands and I applied lotion to them before using the bronzer and washed immediately. Color is nice and very natural looking...no streaks and easy to use.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE must have beauty product. I wish it was still sold i stores. It will stain your hands and clothes if you aren&#x27;t careful but the color looks natural and isn&#x27;t streaky and it doesn&#x27;t smell like a self tanner. I&#x27;ve hooked three of my friends on this!</li>
            <li> I Love this product it gives your face a nice tan look with out really tanning. Through Amazon it is cheaper then in the store and I recieved it remarkably fast.&lt;br /&gt;Great Product.</li>
            <li> This is only a one application tint and washes off. I thought I was purchasing a product which was also a self tanner.</li>
            <li> I got this today and was super excited to try it. I am already very tan from using a tanning bed but I that and going the safe way but my point is im very dark and this stuff made me darker! very easy to apply, dries fast and smells like baby powder so over all a plesent smell. Im not sure about how this shows up in the natural light but from what i see it looks very bronze not orange but that could be because of how tan i am already. I will be letting my sister try out a bottle. she is extremely pale so this will prove the worth of the product!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my legs when wearing shorts.  It&#x27;s very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t rub off -- Does the trick for me without any commitment.</li>
            <li> Love the way my legs look, flawless. It&#x27;s gorgeous on my already born tan. And right after I apply, the Loreal tanning lotion doesn&#x27;t run on my clothes, especially my whites. And it drys instantly. I simply love.....</li>
            <li> For the first time I have felt totally let down by reviews - LOL! I do see that I am in the extreme minority here with my review. I specifically read the reviews on this product carefully because when you&#x27;re fair skinned and purchasing a bronzer or self tanning product it&#x27;s obviously important to research the product to see if it streaks, stains or leaves your skin an unflattering color.  I usually use Sex Symbol by AeroTan and love it to pieces. I decided to give this a try after all the reviews I read were positive and indicated no orangeness and that it looked totally natural.  I can see how for some people that might be the case but...beware redheads.  This product looked great in my house and I was very pleased with it, until I walked outside. It was so streaky and so dark and I had applied it SUPER sparingly. I couldn&#x27;t even believe how horrible it looked.  I hate to leave bad reviews but I do have to say, if you&#x27;re a redhead, even one with not particularly pasty skin, get AeroTan Sex Symbol, this looks much more natural.  Sadly I bought 3 bottles to get my Amazon PRIME discount and now I&#x27;m stuck with them.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this product locally, although I&#x27;ve bought it from Walgreen&#x27;s in the past!  I&#x27;ve been using faux tan for many years, but this is a daily tan, and I love it!  Has absolutely no after-smell, like the self-tanners.  They all say they don&#x27;t smell/stink, but self-tanners all contain thee same chemical dye, and they do!  But, not this product, and it gives me a daily bronze tan, that others can&#x27;t believe is fake!</li>
            <li> This is a great product if you want to look tan but not have the dangerous sun exposure.  Goes on and washes off.  I put on every morning and it gives me that tan glow.  Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best bronzer so far...used sparingly it does not look phony. Use too much and you&#x27;ll look a bit &amp;#34;Well Done&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love Loreal Paris Sublime Bronze One-Day Tinted Gel because it is so versatile. I don&#x27;t wear foundation, but I add this product to my moisturizer, using whatever amount gives me a hint of color to match my skin tone whether I am tan or not. If you don&#x27;t like to look made-up, and you aren&#x27;t trying to hide flaws, this stuff is the best!</li>
            <li> i have a wonderful tan no streaks no orange just tan&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;since i cant be in the sun I have found something better</li>
            <li> I love this lotion because it&#x27;s not a self tanner and it washes off so easily.  No you can&#x27;t wear it swimming.  This should only be used to make yourself look tan when you&#x27;re not on the beach or going swimming.  I wish L&#x27;oreal had not discontinued this because I don&#x27;t like the one they replaced it with.  It&#x27;s a self tanner and it wears off splotchy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using &amp;#34;tint lotion&amp;#34; for many years.  Every product, with the exception of this one does one of two things, if not both.  Leaves my skin with an orange, very unnatural tint or, leaves a glitter-like substance behind.  Glitter on a man&#x27;s skin isn&#x27;t cool.  This product leaves me looking like I have natural color, and doesn&#x27;t look like &amp;#34;tan in a bottle.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m rather light skinned. Okay, that&#x27;s a lie.  I&#x27;m REALLY light skinned and this product makes my face look healthy and very natural.  Washes off my face when I shower, and doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.  There is residue left on the collar of my shirts, but it also washes out, even on whites.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice product but, If you drop water or liquid sweat on the skin derramarte you&#x27;re ice cream, be careful with the clothes, especially in areas that have painted skin contact, You can leave brown spots that appear dirty, but is removed when washing clothes. The product is designed rather for models who need a quick tan for a photo secion and already, the profucto little to recommend outdoor</li>
            <li> Gosh this stuff really works well. I use it all over my body. It was so cheap if you buy it in the 3 pack. I look tan &amp; healthy all year around! Be sure &amp; wash your hands right away or it will stain them. I got smart &amp; use gloves now. Great product!</li>
            <li> Damaged labels on products. Did not appear to be new items.</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE and BEST &amp;#34;foundation!&amp;#34;  No talc!  Not heavy.  Light-weight, perfect!  And finding it on Amazon at this price is just icing on the cake!  I always recommend this product to women who ask me about my &amp;#34;makeup.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I use this a lot for work when I don&#x27;t want the shimmer self tanner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have received a lot of compliments and I am happy with this product that I purchased. Do note: You need to apply quickly &amp; evenly and work it in. You will need to wash your hands RIGHT AFTER also. My hands were dry when I applied the tanner the first time so it did slightly stain my hands. So next time around I put regular lotion on my hands first....... then applied the Loreal Bronze on my legs, arms, and chest area. Let it fully dry before putting on any clothes. ... I would put the bronzer on first then do hair, make up, and then get dressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;M VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE AND YES I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN!.</li>
            <li> was surprised how quickly it worked, shocked at how dark your hands get when applying - only used once but was happy with results.  have used other loreal self tanners and love.</li>
            <li> My sister gave me some to try-I love it-so much better than paying for tanning booth! Also cheaper than at the store!!</li>
            <li> Found this product just as they were discontinuing it.  It&#x27;s too bad, because I love it!  I am very fair, and I like to be able to get a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; without the hassle of instant tanners (orange hands, waiting for it to work, etc.).  Plus I can see how it looks as soon as I apply, and there&#x27;s the option to wash it off immediately if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tan doesn&#x27;t come off with normal day-to-day activities, even with sweating or if it rubs against clothes.  But...the downside is it comes off if you go swimming.</li>
            <li> Great service and great stuff. I could not find it anywhere and thanks to this merchant I was able to look tan again :)</li>
            <li> This gives a very natural bronze/ tan color. I&#x27;m a guy and I can use this when I&#x27;m really pale and it looks totally natural. None of that orange stuff you get with self tanners. Its great for your face but of course works all over. A tremendious value compared to &#x27;Cliniques&#x27; tiny tube of bronzer for men. Great stuff!!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product, I use latex gloves to avoid staining my hands and mix it with body lotion. It provides a good color to my fair skin.</li>
            <li> This product is so nice because it washes off.  But it works best if you mix it with a moisturizer.  And definitely wash your hands immediately!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product because it develops a beautifully delicate sun-kissed color.  In my opinion, it&#x27;s better than the newer Loreal bronzers by far.</li>
            <li> Love this tinted gel!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product so much better than letting my face leather up in a tanning booth or in the sun Using for 8 years. doesn&#x27;t look orange looks like a tan.  I would recommend this product for everyone who wants a healthy look without baking in the sun</li>
            <li> This product is very messy and doesn&#x27;t really work that well. It gives you a streaky dark brown look, if that is what you are into, this product is for you, otherwise, I&#x27;d steer clear.</li>
            <li> This has a nice natural looking color to it. Once it&#x27;s dry it stays on and doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes. It doesn&#x27;t wash off easily in water however, it does come off easily with soap and water. I also like that it doesn&#x27;t have a fake looking shimmer to it like some tinted lotions do. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love the product please keep it in stock will continue to order.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because i use to tan a lot and also working at a tanning salon. While I worked there so many women came in saying that they have skin cancer yet hopped right into the tanning bed anyway. i stopped tanning. i found an awesome self tanner that is amazing but its a pain to put on every few days so i figured with this i can put it on when i pt on my lotion after my showers. this stains your hands SO BADLY! its hard to spread onto your skin. I also feel like the color is almost nonexistent. if you dont put enough time into putting this on and making sure its 100% perfect it would probably be very streaky. since this is a three pack i will have to use the rest. If my opinion changes on this I will update my review.</li>
            <li> This tanning product is awesome!  It looks so real.  It&#x27;s the new tanning bed!  It is the rich tan to die for without actually having to die&lt;br /&gt;for it.  Good seller!  Fast seller!!  Will use again!!</li>
            <li> Unlike the expensive competitors, it truly does not transfer on to clothing, it smells good all day, washes off easily at night in the shower, and doesn&#x27;t  emphasize every skin flaw and wrinkle like those super shiny bronzers.  I used to get it at WalMart or Walgreens or Target, but now all three stores seem to run out all the time.  Amazon&#x27;s vendors became my answer to getting what I want at a great price (about 1/3 to 1/4 of what I have to pay at Sephora for a totally substandard product.)</li>
            <li> I love this product because I have Vitiligo and if I have some place to go to and haven&#x27;t had time to apply self tanner that needs to \\&quot;process\\&quot;, I can just get out of the shower, dry off and apply immediately. It dries while I dry my hair or put on makeup,almost instantly, and then I can get dressed without worrying about transferring to my clothing! Only comes off with soap and water and vigorous washing! Love it! Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> My go to when I don&#x27;t want to wear foundation.  I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product several times.  It&#x27;s easy to fix if you make a mistake since it washes off (unlike self tanners) and gives me just enough color for early spring so I feel comfortable baring those white legs!</li>
            <li> Question: Where has this been all my life!? I am naturally pretty fair skinned and love having a little color all year round. I am not a big fan of tanning beds and living in Massachusetts, the only time to catch some rays are in the summer months. I am very happy to say that Loreal Paris Sublime Bronze One-Day Tinted Gel is my new savior. Note that this is NOT a self-tanner but a one-day application that easily rinses off at the end of the day in the shower with soap and water. I have been using self-tanners for a very long time and the main problem I found with them is that after a few days it starts to \\&quot;chip\\&quot; off leaving a very unnatural look. Although an everyday application may be a pain in the fanny, I find the one-day tanner to be the much better option in the long run. I recommend using a pair of rubber gloves when applying to the body and then squirting some of the gel on a cotton swab to apply to hands/wrists and feet/ankles in a circular motion and then definitely allow some time to dry. My 3 pack came two days after ordering and was very securely packaged. I am beyond pleased with this product! Stay tan! :)</li>
            <li> Good product for one day.  Just be careful not to get on your hands as it stains.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this self-tanner but for me, this is not something to just apply and go. I prefer a natural looking tan instead of a shimmery bronze and when you apply this stuff, especially when you do it with your hands or even a glove, it&#x27;s pretty streaky. The first time I used it I just rubbed it all over, waited until it dried like the instructions said (I waited about 30 minutes) and then got dressed and went to work. I work for my dad and he took one look and said it looked like I painted myself with a bad paintbrush... Sigh, thanks dad love you too. Anyway, I went home, took a shower and the next morning I was absolutely delighted when I looked in the mirror! A natural tan that looked the equivalent of using Jergens tanning lotion every day for a week. Now I have my process for using this stuff: I rub it all over and wait at least an hour but it&#x27;s better if you wait a few hours (this is usually spent watching TV and painting my nails or lip-syncing into my brush to Lana Del Ray wishing I had her lips.) Then I take a shower and properly use my perfumed body wash with a loofah and then I&#x27;m done. POOF! Natural tan with no streaks. Love this stuff and it is very appropriately priced.</li>
            <li> Great tinted gel bronzer.  Perfect for a day in the park, to camouflage your lily white legs without incurring sun damage from a real tan, or having to commit to a long term wearing faux tan.  Once it sets it&#x27;s very water resistant, yet washes off with soap and water when its time.  Not orangey, so you don&#x27;t look like an oompa loompa.</li>
            <li> Works good but need to really rub it in and wash your hands afterwards . I did get a lot of complements</li>
            <li> I had purchased this product when it first came out (2010 I think) and I loved it then and love it now! It comes out VERY brownish/bronze but blends out very smoothly to a nice tan color. I love to use this product when I want to darken up my existing tan or daily when I&#x27;m letting an old tan fade out. I&#x27;m really terrible about moisturizing EVERYDAY.... So sometimes my tans get a little spotty. Having this one-day tan, let&#x27;s me keep up the tanned appearance while s being able to exfoliate the old tan off. I know a lot of reviews on this product say you need gloves and you DO. I cannot stress that enough. If you DONT wear gloves to apply this product, you will NOT be happy. If you&#x27;re a self tanning fiend like me, you probably have a box of disposable gloves handy anyways. Overall, great product, everyone who uses self tanners regularly should have this in their arsenal</li>
