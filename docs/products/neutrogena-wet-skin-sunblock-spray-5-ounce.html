    <ol>
            <li>Excellent product ...</li>
            <li>This stuff is absolutely brilliant and is perfect for the snorkeling, now a staple in my bag for every trip!!</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This is a great sunblock product.  </li>
            <li>My son tans and this works great for him</li>
            <li>Very effective, the product does what it says.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and works great!  </li>
            <li>so not for the fair skin.</li>
            <li>We are spending our Summer vacation on Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast where the Sun is strong and the beaches are great.</li>
            <li>This one is perfect for after you get out of the water, and the water kind of washed off the lotion sunscreen I put on first</li>
            <li>It smells nice.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and smells good.</li>
            <li>wife and three year old are perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m not so sure what that means, our skin is waterproof by design</li>
            <li>I used to love the purple stuff because it let you know where you had managed to cover them.  </li>
            <li>I put it on them a couple of times during the afternoons but mostly out of paranoia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Bought this product hoping that it would be more waterproof than the others.  </li>
            <li>I love this product also because it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>As I said I LOVE Neutrogena and have never had a problem with their products before.</li>
            <li>Lotion works better for her</li>
            <li>It keeps me from scorching, which I can&#x27;t say for most sunscreen.</li>
            <li>I am very fair skinned and burn easily but normally can keep it at a minumum with Neutrogena products.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to no wash away easily.</li>
            <li>Using it is also easy since it is a spray.</li>
            <li>I think this works so well because it doesn&#x27;t get washed off so easily.</li>
            <li>Did it&#x27;s job, easy to spray on on wet/sandy skin.</li>
            <li>, then you layer with this &amp;#34;wet skin&amp;#34; and it sticks to you body really easily.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and get sweaty easily</li>
            <li>The fragrance was too strong.    </li>
            <li>This particular listing has this product between $8 and $9 per can which is the best pricing I&#x27;ve seen online so far.</li>
            <li>I am a loyal Johnson &amp; Johnson user and I LOVE Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>oil free</li>
            <li>PABA free</li>
            <li>I picked this up on a recent Lightning Deal at a great price.  </li>
            <li>I have a very fair complexion and burn easily, however on my last 2 trips to Mexico, no sunburn to report, this is easy to apply and stays on really well.</li>
            <li>but not this particular kind.  </li>
            <li>This is my new favorite sunscreen!  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price in my opinion!</li>
            <li>Two cans were shipped in an over-sized bubble-wrap envelope, quick and cheap, and one of the cans was damaged.  </li>
            <li>I have 4 very white girls, this product is awesome, I always use this and can&#x27;t understand the prior comments</li>
            <li>This sunscreen is my new favorite for body ...</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Any water you have on you seems to shed right off.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has worked great in protecting small children from sunburns.  </li>
            <li>We do spray some more after a couple of hours following the first application, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We do a lot of work in the yard and get pretty sweaty</li>
            <li>This is the first time I used a sunscreen while swimming</li>
            <li>First off I NEVER take the time to leave reviews EVER</li>
            <li>For the days where I&#x27;ll be in the sun for an extended period of time, I need something that is strong, covers a broad spectrum, and doesn&#x27;t come off when I sweat.</li>
            <li>The Dry Touch really felt nice on my skin, prevented sunburn, and was moisturizing.</li>
            <li>The problem is that normally you have to keep catching them every time they have been in the water, dry them off, and respray.  </li>
            <li>On the morning of a three hour motorcycle ride in the mid day sun I decided that I would stop and get some sunblock and bought this product because it was the most expensive by far, I figured hey it must be the best</li>
            <li>But this is even better than that because you don&#x27;t have to dry them off</li>
            <li>Perhaps there was some critical step or wait time we skipped, but the Coppertone Water Babies worked perfectly in the same situation for less money.</li>
            <li>The sunscreen was applied very liberally, and reapplied after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>There is a difference, but, the sunscreen works really well also</li>
            <li>, 2 of my girls are very allergic with their skin, no problems at all, I give 100</li>
            <li>Overall, the only thing I liked about this product was that it was non-greasy.</li>
            <li>but, yes, this one does seem to stick better to wet skin than most other sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried in the past&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>From the other posts it looks like most people are saying it worked well for them</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase of the product purchase online on this store, recommend and hopefully make future purchases in the same, because they are really acceptable.</li>
            <li>and we like it because it&#x27;s easy to apply on wet skin - no need to rub it in - provides sunburn protection</li>
            <li>main sunscreen ingredient is Helioplex which, according to Wikipedia, provides UVA/UVB protection</li>
            <li>right away I noticed sand was starting to stick to my body, which isn&#x27;t unusual for being at the beach</li>
            <li>highly recommended by my dermatologist.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Technicalities aside, we are happy enough to standardize on this product and use it on both wet and dry skin.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin and really thought this product would give me some protection from the sun while I was vacationing in Puerto Rico</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m extrememly sun sensitive and live in LA !</li>
            <li>70\\&quot; to myself and my 5 year old.</li>
            <li>it were only purple, I probably wouldn&#x27;t go through so much.  </li>
            <li>went in the ocean and the sunscreen had completely bonded with the sand: It wouldn&#x27;t rub in</li>
            <li>and I am completely FRIED as if I wore nothing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re sweaty or dripping wet from the pool, you can spray right on and rub in.</li>
            <li>I usually burn very quickly in the sun.  </li>
            <li>It is much less oily than others and protects me when I pedal my bike for more than 5 hours in any weather conditions under the extreme UV days near Sao Paulo, Brazil</li>
            <li>but I ended up getting the same rashes I would normally get from using sun tan lotion.     </li>
            <li>couple other reviewers commented that the Neutrogena works if the directions are followed exactly.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a hell of a deal, apparently.</li>
            <li>Never had this happen before and definitely know how to properly apply suntan lotion with an 8 and 10 year old!  </li>
            <li>previously had been using the Dry Touch Sunblock because I have very sensitive skin and am always hot (even in the winter time I have my fan on</li>
            <li>It is a small bottle but worth it for peace of mind.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry or sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am super concious about sunscreen use and with use of other brands none of my children have ever had a single burn even after hours in the sun and water due to dilligent application.  </li>

            <li> I am super concious about sunscreen use and with use of other brands none of my children have ever had a single burn even after hours in the sun and water due to dilligent application.  </li>
            <li> The only drawback I&#x27;ve found is that this product isn&#x27;t like other sprays where you can get the middle of your back with just a spray.</li>
            <li> A whole day at the beach for this pale redhead and absolutely no sunburn!</li>
            <li> This product however does not prevent you from getting tanned from the sun, and although the product is stated to last for hours, if you get wet or sweat a lot, you must reapply often.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that you can use when wet which is verrrry convenient.</li>
            <li> That said, Neutrogena makes other formulas specifically for the face, which I will definitely try.</li>
            <li> Who doesn&#x27;t wipe or pat their sweaty skin dry?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on returning this and will stick with the Dry Touch Sunblock.</li>
            <li> We bought this product and reapplied often, but after only a few hour outdoors with reapplication in the middle of the time we were all severely sunburnt.</li>
            <li> I did reapply the spray every single hour on the hour</li>
            <li> It lasts for a long time on wet and dry skin.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for a very pale and sun sensitive skin person.</li>
            <li> applied the \\&quot;Neutrogena Wet Skin SPF</li>
            <li> I will have to refit the spray nozzle to the spent can at some point to use it.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to try it since I knew I would be in the water and the advertising said you can apply to wet skin.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I would try the Wet Skin spray for my beach trip to Florida.</li>
            <li> we&#x27;ve purchased it in the past from different sources ...</li>
            <li> like I remember with other sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> Half of the time we are using this &#x27;wet skin&#x27; product</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s extremely oily, so I can&#x27;t use it on my face.</li>
            <li> (have glow in the dark red-heads in the house).</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;m really, really white.</li>
            <li> We ended up throwing away the bottle half way through it as everyone no longer can tolerate its smell.  </li>
            <li> Very unfortunate though as we really like other Neutrogena Wet Skin sunscreen products, just not the spray bottle type.</li>
            <li> I did not get a sunburn, or even a little redness.  </li>
            <li> but I agree that if it&#x27;s oil it must be altered in a way that allows the skin to breath freely; no discomfort</li>
            <li> Note that I go through a bottle in about 2 days of heavy, all-day use.</li>
            <li> I used this in a Triathlon and it worked wonders, no sun burn or that feeling of UV on my pale skin.</li>
            <li> At least my sunburn isn&#x27;t pealing like some other people&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely dry from the alcohol and the sunburn is making it even worse.</li>
            <li> I have used Neutrogena in the past</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have anything against the Neutrogena brand, in fact I usually prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but usually it brushes off no problem.</li>
            <li> I was surprised as I have never had anything bad to say about any Neutrogena product before.  </li>
            <li> I offered it around the group of riders and thankfully most declined because everyone who used it was terribly sunburned, much worse than not using anything at all.</li>
            <li> this is a common experience, if you read through reviews.</li>
            <li> product performed so poorly it would be wrong not to warn other parents.&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
            <li> Applied 30 minutes prior to beach exposure, kids were sunburned badly at end of day, even with reapplying.</li>
            <li> three year old and his mother used a can of \\&quot;Coppertone Water Babies SPF 50 Lotion Spray\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;After two hours in the pool, my son and I ended up with horrible sunburns.</li>

            <li> I have tried a number of products over the years, but for the last couple of years this has been my go to product. I have a very fair complexion and burn easily, however on my last 2 trips to Mexico, no sunburn to report, this is easy to apply and stays on really well. Well worth the price in my opinion!</li>
            <li> Went to the pool today with the kiddos.&lt;br /&gt;Got a side by side comparison with this and another sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the \\&quot;Neutrogena Wet Skin SPF 70\\&quot; to myself and my 5 year old. The sunscreen was applied very liberally, and reapplied after an hour.&lt;br /&gt;My three year old and his mother used a can of \\&quot;Coppertone Water Babies SPF 50 Lotion Spray\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;After two hours in the pool, my son and I ended up with horrible sunburns. His face is almost purple.&lt;br /&gt;My wife and three year old are perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;This product performed so poorly it would be wrong not to warn other parents.&lt;br /&gt;A couple other reviewers commented that the Neutrogena works if the directions are followed exactly. Perhaps there was some critical step or wait time we skipped, but the Coppertone Water Babies worked perfectly in the same situation for less money.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Too bad that the company sent me &amp;#34;sunscreen&amp;#34; instead of the &amp;#34;sunblock&amp;#34;.  There is a difference, but, the sunscreen works really well also so I kept it. (have glow in the dark red-heads in the house).</li>
            <li> This product is not greasy, oily or gooey like sun tan lotions, which is what I like about this product. This product however does not prevent you from getting tanned from the sun, and although the product is stated to last for hours, if you get wet or sweat a lot, you must reapply often. Also, the fragrance of this sun tan spray can be unpleasant after a while. The fragrance was too strong.    I have really sensitive skin and really thought this product would give me some protection from the sun while I was vacationing in Puerto Rico but I ended up getting the same rashes I would normally get from using sun tan lotion.     Overall, the only thing I liked about this product was that it was non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product ... we&#x27;ve purchased it in the past from different sources ... highly recommended by my dermatologist.  However, the shipping method left something to be desired.  Two cans were shipped in an over-sized bubble-wrap envelope, quick and cheap, and one of the cans was damaged.  I will have to refit the spray nozzle to the spent can at some point to use it.  Have not contacted the provider about this problem yet, however.</li>
            <li> On the morning of a three hour motorcycle ride in the mid day sun I decided that I would stop and get some sunblock and bought this product because it was the most expensive by far, I figured hey it must be the best, right? I applied re-applied throughout the ride. I offered it around the group of riders and thankfully most declined because everyone who used it was terribly sunburned, much worse than not using anything at all. It was the joke of the day that neutrogena sunblock is just like SPRAY COOKING OIL.</li>
            <li> We are spending our Summer vacation on Florida&#x27;s Gulf Coast where the Sun is strong and the beaches are great. We  spend hours at a time swimming and playing in the water or on the beach and neither myself or the kids have had sunburn issues yet. Half of the time we are using this &#x27;wet skin&#x27; product and we like it because it&#x27;s easy to apply on wet skin - no need to rub it in - provides sunburn protection and it seems to no wash away easily. We do spray some more after a couple of hours following the first application, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the statement on the container, the product is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- sweatproof, waterproof - I&#x27;m not so sure what that means, our skin is waterproof by design but, yes, this one does seem to stick better to wet skin than most other sunscreens we&#x27;ve tried in the past&lt;br /&gt;- hypoallergenic - my skin happens to be allergic to a lot of things to the degree that I can&#x27;t use fragrant soap, wool fabrics or any deodorant sprays but I have no issues with this product&lt;br /&gt;- oil free - the skin does take a shiny appearance but I agree that if it&#x27;s oil it must be altered in a way that allows the skin to breath freely; no discomfort&lt;br /&gt;- PABA free - I hope so&lt;br /&gt;- continuous spray - check&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main sunscreen ingredient is Helioplex which, according to Wikipedia, provides UVA/UVB protection and it contains avobenzone and oxybenzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technicalities aside, we are happy enough to standardize on this product and use it on both wet and dry skin.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen is my new favorite for body ... Doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re sweaty or dripping wet from the pool, you can spray right on and rub in. Any water you have on you seems to shed right off. And it literally creates a waterproof barrier that says for what seems like hours ... We do a lot of work in the yard and get pretty sweaty and/or are in and out of the pool a lot. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that you can use when wet which is verrrry convenient. It smells nice. And seems to last and protect well. The only drawback I&#x27;ve found is that this product isn&#x27;t like other sprays where you can get the middle of your back with just a spray. This product has to be rubbed in once sprayed. But that&#x27;s what spouses, kids, or friends are for, I guess! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, we discovered this product at Costco -- a 2 can package for $15. That&#x27;s a hell of a deal, apparently. Online I&#x27;ve seen the same package go for literally twice that. This particular listing has this product between $8 and $9 per can which is the best pricing I&#x27;ve seen online so far. Note that I go through a bottle in about 2 days of heavy, all-day use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extrememly sun sensitive and live in LA ! I used this in a Triathlon and it worked wonders, no sun burn or that feeling of UV on my pale skin. It is a small bottle but worth it for peace of mind.  I&#x27;ll be using this for any sweaty sport in the future.</li>
            <li> I picked this up on a recent Lightning Deal at a great price.  I prefer spray bottles for the children because all you have to do is catch them by the collar and spray them all over.  The problem is that normally you have to keep catching them every time they have been in the water, dry them off, and respray.  I used to love the purple stuff because it let you know where you had managed to cover them.  But this is even better than that because you don&#x27;t have to dry them off first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has worked great in protecting small children from sunburns.  I put it on them a couple of times during the afternoons but mostly out of paranoia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it were only purple, I probably wouldn&#x27;t go through so much.  :)</li>
            <li> Very effective, the product does what it says. It lasts for a long time on wet and dry skin. Using it is also easy since it is a spray.</li>
            <li> Went to a water park from 11:30 AM to 6 PM.  Bought this product hoping that it would be more waterproof than the others.  I have used Neutrogena in the past but not this particular kind.  I am very fair skinned and burn easily but normally can keep it at a minumum with Neutrogena products.  However this product did not help me at all.  I wanted to try it since I knew I would be in the water and the advertising said you can apply to wet skin.  I might as well have used butter on my skin.  I used several applications through out the day and got a severe sunburn.  I personally will not be using this product again.  From the other posts it looks like most people are saying it worked well for them but my red and semi blistered skin says it didn&#x27;t.  I was surprised as I have never had anything bad to say about any Neutrogena product before.  Definately did not work on me as advertised.</li>
            <li> Horrible product that offered no protection what so ever. I am super concious about sunscreen use and with use of other brands none of my children have ever had a single burn even after hours in the sun and water due to dilligent application.  We bought this product and reapplied often, but after only a few hour outdoors with reapplication in the middle of the time we were all severely sunburnt. this offered no protection what so ever.  The rest went in the trash. Nuetrogena should be ashamed. Never again.</li>
            <li> I used the SPF 50 and SPF 85+ spray bottles while snorkeling every day for a week in Hawaii.  I usually burn very quickly in the sun.  This is the first time I used a sunscreen while swimming and it actually worked!  I did not get a sunburn, or even a little redness.  I love this product also because it doesn&#x27;t sting my eyes.  One time I accidentally oversprayed into my eye and I didn&#x27;t feel any sting at all, like I remember with other sunscreens.  This is my new favorite sunscreen!  I think this works so well because it doesn&#x27;t get washed off so easily.</li>
            <li> I did not like it. Too greasy. Prefer lotion.</li>
            <li> I have 4 very white girls, this product is awesome, I always use this and can&#x27;t understand the prior comments, 2 of my girls are very allergic with their skin, no problems at all, I give 100 + to this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunblock product.  The only problem is, it says it covers through sweat, but you must re-apply if toweling off.  Who doesn&#x27;t wipe or pat their sweaty skin dry?  So then you have to reapply the product.  Overall, I like it, but I think the advertising is misleading.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and works great!  A whole day at the beach for this pale redhead and absolutely no sunburn!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product for a very pale and sun sensitive skin person. Did it&#x27;s job, easy to spray on on wet/sandy skin. Will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Applied 30 minutes prior to beach exposure, kids were sunburned badly at end of day, even with reapplying. Never had this happen before and definitely know how to properly apply suntan lotion with an 8 and 10 year old!  This  is dangerous- this is a common experience, if you read through reviews.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is much less oily than others and protects me when I pedal my bike for more than 5 hours in any weather conditions under the extreme UV days near Sao Paulo, Brazil</li>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely brilliant and is perfect for the snorkeling, now a staple in my bag for every trip!!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase of the product purchase online on this store, recommend and hopefully make future purchases in the same, because they are really acceptable.</li>
            <li> It smells funky.  We ended up throwing away the bottle half way through it as everyone no longer can tolerate its smell.  Very unfortunate though as we really like other Neutrogena Wet Skin sunscreen products, just not the spray bottle type.</li>
            <li> I pair this with the neutrogena sunscreen thats in lotion form. This one is perfect for after you get out of the water, and the water kind of washed off the lotion sunscreen I put on first, then you layer with this &amp;#34;wet skin&amp;#34; and it sticks to you body really easily. Easy to apply and smells good.</li>
            <li> First off I NEVER take the time to leave reviews EVER but I had to. I am a loyal Johnson &amp; Johnson user and I LOVE Neutrogena. I use the makeup remover wipes, facial moisturizer, and the hair masques regularly. I don&#x27;t have anything against the Neutrogena brand, in fact I usually prefer it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I previously had been using the Dry Touch Sunblock because I have very sensitive skin and am always hot (even in the winter time I have my fan on so when the sun is out it can be especially brutal for me.) The Dry Touch really felt nice on my skin, prevented sunburn, and was moisturizing. I have oily skin and get sweaty easily so I figured I would try the Wet Skin spray for my beach trip to Florida. I thoroughly applied the product on every crevice of my body (after I put on Aveeno Daily Moisturizing Lotion and a facial moisturizer) 30 minutes before getting to the beach. It was windy and right away I noticed sand was starting to stick to my body, which isn&#x27;t unusual for being at the beach but usually it brushes off no problem. I think something with the spray alcohol formula created this weird layer on my skin because literally I could not get the sand to come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went in the ocean and the sunscreen had completely bonded with the sand: It wouldn&#x27;t rub in but it wouldn&#x27;t come off either. I literally had to scrub it off with my finger nails because it was streaking so bad. I did reapply the spray every single hour on the hour and I am completely FRIED as if I wore nothing. Even after I showered the spray still wasn&#x27;t coming off and neither was the sand. My skin is extremely dry from the alcohol and the sunburn is making it even worse. I&#x27;m planning on returning this and will stick with the Dry Touch Sunblock. As I said I LOVE Neutrogena and have never had a problem with their products before. It&#x27;s a shame this product is such a dud. At least my sunburn isn&#x27;t pealing like some other people&#x27;s. If you have dry or sensitive skin I WOULD NOT use this product, myskin feels like sandpaper now.</li>
            <li> My son tans and this works great for him but my daughter burns and it did not for her so not for the fair skin. Lotion works better for her</li>
            <li> Be advised that the second ingredient in this sunscreen is a carcinogen known as ether. Buyer beware of the hazard associated with this sunscreen, we just placed our in the trash.</li>
            <li> I am white as hell. I mean, I&#x27;m really, really white. I also have vitiligo. Therefore, it&#x27;s imperative that I wear sunscreen every day. For the days where I&#x27;ll be in the sun for an extended period of time, I need something that is strong, covers a broad spectrum, and doesn&#x27;t come off when I sweat. This stuff fits the bill. It keeps me from scorching, which I can&#x27;t say for most sunscreen. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s extremely oily, so I can&#x27;t use it on my face. That&#x27;s the only reason I subtracted a star. That said, Neutrogena makes other formulas specifically for the face, which I will definitely try.</li>
            <li> Two kids who have never had the slightest of tan lines are in bed with sunburns. Out about 2 hours and applied 4 times. I am throwing it out!</li>
