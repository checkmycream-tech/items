            <li>I love these strips.  </li>
            <li>I love nail polish strips and this design is one of my most favorites.  </li>
            <li>They were so cute</li>
            <li>sure you use a quality brand topcoat to protect them</li>
            <li>my 56 years old husband stated he loved the look!</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t care but after 5 days I took them off because it was very much chipped and no longer looked good.</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen nails are easy to use and the numbskull pattern is so unique!</li>
            <li>My grown daughter talked me out of some of the wraps because she loved them so much, too.</li>
            <li>: It is a huge time saver, the designs are adorable, and it is really easy to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the design really cool!</li>
            <li>easy to use&lt;br /&gt;pretty</li>
            <li>Hands down this is the best product I have found.  </li>
            <li>And the patterns are so fun!</li>
            <li>I have to use a tiny pair of sharply pointed grooming scissor to get the wraps to fit just perfectly, but you do get an assortment of sizes.</li>
            <li>I am 50 and she is 26, so you can see that these are appropriate for a wide range of women who love to show unique nails.</li>
            <li>Having used several Kiss nail strip packs--which were very easy to apply, worked really well, and lasted two weeks--I was confident I could make these work.</li>
            <li>Application takes some practice but worth the effort.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, last 10 days &amp; easy to remove.</li>
            <li>just right.</li>
            <li>So when I first applied these I notice I was discarding so much nail polish.</li>
            <li>They last and are easy to remove when I want to change.  </li>
            <li>I really do like this Item.</li>
            <li>I really like the design even though I am not a fan of the product.</li>
            <li>I use a clear top coat as my last step</li>
            <li>In other words, many of the nail strips just disintegrated in parts.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for a fun night out but not for a manicure that you want to last the whole week.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have high hopes ...but who knows.</li>
            <li>Love these little guys.  </li>
            <li>and I could never get such fun designs</li>
            <li>and they last just fine for occasional touch ups</li>
            <li>As for Salon Effects Strips overall, it stands up to my exact expectations.</li>
            <li>You can cut just one strip in half and one box can last you for two separate uses! :)</li>
            <li>Because these did not have any sticky-quality at all I used clear nail polish as a work around to make them stick to my nails.</li>
            <li>Within the hour the strips were worn at the tip of my nail and near the cuticle.</li>
            <li>But this this product there is so much work needed that the strips can only be used for one nail ...</li>
            <li>At the very minimum the description should alert you that the product pictured is not the actual product colors.</li>
            <li>I can double the amount of times I use them by not doing my whole hand.  </li>
            <li>in fact  I find it much much easier than actually painting my nails</li>
            <li>First off, don&#x27;t expect these to stay on as long as polish.</li>
            <li>I am super hard on my nails and can ruin a manicure in 10 minutes.  </li>

            <li> I only open one of the pouches and save the other for another time.  </li>
            <li> These were old and dried out when I received them.</li>
            <li> I also purchased two other packets with different designs.</li>
            <li> It takes less time to paint my nails with regular polish and wait for them to dry.</li>
            <li> Instead I received product with a white background &amp; black skull &amp; crossbones design.</li>
            <li> : These things are not cheap and can run from $9.99-$12.99 in stores for an only one time use that last less than a week.</li>
            <li> Delivered what I expected.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t doing anything other than watching TV.</li>
            <li> With other products like this I can cut the strips in half.</li>

            <li> This is a problem for a few reasons.</li>

            <li> I have never had any trouble putting them on  </li>
            <li> a waste of money</li>
            <li> But this product is just badly cut so that it really doesn&#x27;t work well with nails and has to be pre-cut before application.</li>
            <li> They were so dried up I couldn&#x27;t even get them to stick to my nails!</li>
            <li> In addition, and as noted earlier, the strips are cut badly.</li>
            <li> I think these were old stock or something; absolutely horrible!</li>
            <li> In addition, these strips are badly cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so terribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was counting on wearing them for Halloween. :(</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I really do like this Item. For someone like me who not only makes a huge mess when using polish I never sit long enough for it to dry and then end up messing up all the hard work and time I Put into it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: It is a huge time saver, the designs are adorable, and it is really easy to do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It does not last up to 10 days! I found mine to start chipping after just one day. It was not terribly noticeable so I didn&#x27;t care but after 5 days I took them off because it was very much chipped and no longer looked good. I found this to happen with everyone that I bought and applied so it DOES NOT last 10 days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS: These things are not cheap and can run from $9.99-$12.99 in stores for an only one time use that last less than a week. So when I first applied these I notice I was discarding so much nail polish. If you have short to medium nails like I do. You can cut just one strip in half and one box can last you for two separate uses! :)</li>
            <li> None of these nail strips stick at all. I have used Kiss nail strips and they worked great--although I don&#x27;t think they can be purchased through Amazon. In addition, these strips are badly cut. Because these did not have any sticky-quality at all I used clear nail polish as a work around to make them stick to my nails. This kind of worked but the chemicals--or whatever--in the nail polish and Sally Hansen product don&#x27;t work well together. In other words, many of the nail strips just disintegrated in parts. Next I used a glue to attach them. The strips look like a quality product but they are not. Within the hour the strips were worn at the tip of my nail and near the cuticle. Note: I wasn&#x27;t doing anything other than watching TV. In addition, and as noted earlier, the strips are cut badly. Having used several Kiss nail strip packs--which were very easy to apply, worked really well, and lasted two weeks--I was confident I could make these work. But this product is just badly cut so that it really doesn&#x27;t work well with nails and has to be pre-cut before application. This is a problem for a few reasons. I keep my nail somewhat short. With other products like this I can cut the strips in half. But this this product there is so much work needed that the strips can only be used for one nail ...I have no idea how someone would use this product if they had longer nails. Anyway, I am keeping these on for a little while to see what happens. With a lot of work I was able to make most of them look okay--I really like the design even though I am not a fan of the product. Final Note: I also purchased two other packets with different designs. I&#x27;ll update this when I try those out. I&#x27;m hoping that this packet was just defective and that the others work. Although even if this product is defective the cut of the strips is going to be the same so I don&#x27;t have high hopes ...but who knows.</li>
            <li> So bummed out on the product. From the picture &amp; description I thought I was actually receiving a white background with an opaque skull &amp; crossbones design. Instead I received product with a white background &amp; black skull &amp; crossbones design. It is really too stark of a contrast for me. Good thing Halloween is coming up or I&#x27;d never wear it. At the very minimum the description should alert you that the product pictured is not the actual product colors. As for Salon Effects Strips overall, it stands up to my exact expectations. Easy to apply, last 10 days &amp; easy to remove. ThatscwhybI gave it 2 stars  Only issue is incorrect color in design.</li>
            <li> These real nail polish strips are great I love them. These work so well for me and the life style that I lead. I have always had each set last for a minimum of 10 days up to 18 days.</li>
            <li> Love these little guys.  They work well, and last longer then polish.  I can double the amount of times I use them by not doing my whole hand.  I only open one of the pouches and save the other for another time.  Then do 2 nails on each hand.  Like that look the best.</li>
            <li> Got this for my niece she loves the skulls and crossbones.  This press on polish lasts like steel.  Application takes some practice but worth the effort.</li>
            <li> Delivered what I expected. Looks like picture.</li>
            <li> Best invention ever!!! I am terrible at doing my own nails but this product makes it way easier. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> easy to use&lt;br /&gt;pretty</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift for a friend and she loves them.  She says it is all the great look of painted nails without the hassle of smearing, chipping, and flaking.</li>
            <li> I love the sally hansen stick-ons, I use dthe skulls for halloween and got lots of compliments,  and you can&#x27;t beat this price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would purchase again</li>
            <li> These were old and dried out when I received them.</li>
            <li> Hands down this is the best product I have found.  I am super hard on my nails and can ruin a manicure in 10 minutes.  I love these strips.  They last and are easy to remove when I want to change.  And the patterns are so fun!</li>
            <li> I like the design really cool! I havent used them yet though... I plan to use them on a weekend out!</li>
            <li> I thought this product was a waste of money. It takes less time to paint my nails with regular polish and wait for them to dry. Will not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I love nail polish strips and this design is one of my most favorites.  I have never had any trouble putting them on  in fact  I find it much much easier than actually painting my nails and I could never get such fun designs&lt;br /&gt;I  save my extras and scraps in a zip lock bag and they last just fine for occasional touch ups but they last a long time without needing to &amp; I use a clear top coat as my last step</li>
            <li> I think these were old stock or something; absolutely horrible! They were so dried up I couldn&#x27;t even get them to stick to my nails! The 2 I got to stick as accent nails CRACKED by day 2! I didn&#x27;t know this was even possible! I&#x27;m so terribly disappointed. They were so cute and I was counting on wearing them for Halloween. :( boo!</li>
            <li> I purchased for Halloween and put them on a couple of days ago. I get compliments ALL THE TIME! Very easy to put on and SO adorable.</li>
            <li> Tried to apply it on my nail and it got all crumbled up immediately. I have used these some what a lot in the past...disappointed.</li>
            <li> love this pattern, lasted 2 weeks with good topcoat over the nailstrips.make sure you use a quality brand topcoat to protect them</li>
            <li> it was terribble! none of the strips sticked ... at all . a waste of money</li>
            <li> Sally Hansen nails are easy to use and the numbskull pattern is so unique! Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> First off, don&#x27;t expect these to stay on as long as polish. That is why I only gave them 4 stars. That being said, they give a beautiful and unique look to the nails and I am a repeat buyer of the Sally Hansen nail wraps. I have to use a tiny pair of sharply pointed grooming scissor to get the wraps to fit just perfectly, but you do get an assortment of sizes. I also use the scissors to trim the ends of the wraps rather than filing the excess off. When I try to file the excess, it pulls the wrap out of place. I may not have the technique down just right. My grown daughter talked me out of some of the wraps because she loved them so much, too. I am 50 and she is 26, so you can see that these are appropriate for a wide range of women who love to show unique nails. I have even switched up the patterned wraps to accent my ring finger and my 56 years old husband stated he loved the look! Go figure!!! I would recommend this product for a fun night out but not for a manicure that you want to last the whole week.</li>
