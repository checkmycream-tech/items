    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I started using this eye cream about 3 weeks ago, and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just really impressed at the lighter look of my eyes...</li>
            <li>ALL have been excellent quality for a great price!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m told I have beautiful skin at the age of 72</li>
            <li>A good product, like all of the Boots</li>
            <li>Since using Boots eye cream and face creams I have gotten so many compliments that my skin is beautiful.</li>
            <li>I have tried many eye creams and this is a great cream for price.</li>
            <li>Boots eye cream seems to be very good but really</li>
            <li>strangely, I kind of like it when products sting because it feel like they are more potent or &amp;#34;working,&amp;#34; but</li>
            <li>Quick shipper, good price.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I love Boots products but this didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>I just add a bit more.</li>
            <li>like more awake and firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love all the Boots line of products that I have tried.</li>
            <li>ok but don&#x27;t expect too much more than what your night cream may already be doing.</li>
            <li>my eyes are looking younger by the minute real nice cream</li>
            <li>Lovely to apply; smooth easily glides on...</li>
            <li>feel like it works fine.</li>
            <li>As for helping with fine lines??</li>
            <li>are also smooth and I no longer have those deeper wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>and wow does that feel good.</li>
            <li>Some of the others are greasy and this one is not; you can apply make up easily over it and you can also apply it over makeup (yes, you read that right).</li>
            <li>I decided to choose a new eye cream because so many of them are full of toxins and retinol which I&#x27;ve heard can impact hormones.</li>
            <li>So far, it works just ok.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say this is a basic non-toxic eye cream which would be great for someone with sensitive skin--</li>
            <li>They named it right.</li>
            <li>This little tube of magic has made my under eye dark circles go away for good!</li>
            <li>Definitely the cheaper of the two eye creams gives you more for your money.</li>
            <li>They are reasonably priced and they work!</li>
            <li>There may be more potent products out there that work better but to me its not worth absorbing strange ingredients all the while.</li>
            <li>I can easily apply my make up over it and if I want it to be more of a heavy eye moisturizer at night</li>
            <li>Has a nice glow on your skin but probably need to use it longer to see a difference in helping those little lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li>but I like their other eye product better.  </li>
            <li>I love Boots No7 as my other reviews have stated.</li>
            <li>All the ingredients found in this eye cream can be found in more expensive eye creams so why should I pay more for that?</li>
            <li>I actually prefer a different over the counter eye cream a lot better</li>
            <li>Am 66 years old but this product really helps.  </li>
            <li>New product for me.</li>
            <li>so I switched over to Boots Lift and Luminate mostly since it has as a third ingredient sheabutter which has anti oxidants and other anti aging benefits.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 52, light medium skin tone, with dark circles and undereye puffness, and somewhat crepy eyelids (boo).  </li>
            <li>Actually can see and feel the difference and improvement in eye area immediately after just first use.</li>
            <li>The little fine lines under my eye are gone as well.</li>
            <li>to early to tell.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to all women young or old.</li>
            <li>As far as &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; the eye--</li>
            <li>eh.... I&#x27;ve used better I&#x27;ve used worse</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a few weeks and like it very much.</li>
            <li>I have been using this cream over two years and like it better than some of the very expensive eye creams, Strivectin for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend NO7 products.</li>

            <li> What more can I say other than if you don&#x27;t buy it you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> Works better than my expensive Eye Cream recommended by a dermatologist!</li>
            <li> No 7 line to me, including their night cream, eye cream, cleanser, scrub and dry oil body spray.....</li>
            <li> But I am also tired of department stores charging us \\&quot;desperate\\&quot; women way too much for a simple cream.</li>
            <li> I wear less make up which is always a big plus!</li>
            <li> Just a little drop for both eyes is all you need.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again because it is one of the few eye creams that don&#x27;t sting/burn.</li>
            <li> Too thin a cream that doesn&#x27;t dissolve into the skin.</li>
            <li> My undereye circles have diminished and the am puffiness has def decreased along with crows feet.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect that so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, but I can see how someone with that expectation would be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Have used some really expensive eye creams and been allergic.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong by buying this 07product</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

            <li> Love this product. Works for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but I like their other eye product better.  I saw no Lift or Illumination or reduction of wrinkles.  Definitely the cheaper of the two eye creams gives you more for your money.</li>
            <li> Am 66 years old but this product really helps.  Have used some really expensive eye creams and been allergic.  This one works for me</li>
            <li> Boots eye cream seems to be very good but really to early to tell. Need to use longer but see some difference.  Regards MG</li>
            <li> New product for me. Quick shipper, good price.</li>
            <li> Too thin a cream that doesn&#x27;t dissolve into the skin. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> Works better than my expensive Eye Cream recommended by a dermatologist!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and like it very much. I definitely would order this product again.</li>
            <li> I love Boots products but this didn&#x27;t work for me. No changes in my eyes.</li>
            <li> I like this product as well. You won&#x27;t go wrong by buying this 07product</li>
            <li> I use all the No, 7 products.  They are reasonably priced and they work!</li>
            <li> Has a nice glow on your skin but probably need to use it longer to see a difference in helping those little lines around the eyes.</li>
            <li> eh.... I&#x27;ve used better I&#x27;ve used worse</li>
            <li> my eyes are looking younger by the minute real nice cream no skin irritation</li>
            <li> This little tube of magic has made my under eye dark circles go away for good! The little fine lines under my eye are gone as well. Since using Boots eye cream and face creams I have gotten so many compliments that my skin is beautiful. I wear less make up which is always a big plus! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream over two years and like it better than some of the very expensive eye creams, Strivectin for one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend NO7 products.</li>
            <li> I was totally dismayed when Clinique discontinued their anti gravity line so I switched over to Boots Lift and Luminate mostly since it has as a third ingredient sheabutter which has anti oxidants and other anti aging benefits. But I am also tired of department stores charging us \\&quot;desperate\\&quot; women way too much for a simple cream. All the ingredients found in this eye cream can be found in more expensive eye creams so why should I pay more for that? Thankfully there is no retinol in this eye cream like with the Boots no 7 P&amp;P cream so I prefer this line. It moisturizes well and makes the eye area look brighter. It definitely lifts and firms around the eyes. I can easily apply my make up over it and if I want it to be more of a heavy eye moisturizer at night I just add a bit more. I am hooked on boots no 7!</li>
            <li> I love Boots No7 as my other reviews have stated. What more can I say other than if you don&#x27;t buy it you&#x27;ll be sorry. I&#x27;m told I have beautiful skin at the age of 72 and wow does that feel good. I&#x27;ve noticed under my eyes are also smooth and I no longer have those deeper wrinkles.  They named it right. It does illuminate your skin. I recommend it to all women young or old.</li>
            <li> Lovely to apply; smooth easily glides on...but, it hasn&#x27;t &amp;#34;lifted&amp;#34; anything.  I would buy this again because it is one of the few eye creams that don&#x27;t sting/burn.</li>
            <li> A good product, like all of the Boots No 7</li>
            <li> My eyes don&#x27;t seem so droopy.  I am going to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 52, light medium skin tone, with dark circles and undereye puffness, and somewhat crepy eyelids (boo).  I started using this eye cream about 3 weeks ago, and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed.  My lids have lifted and appear brighter.  My undereye circles have diminished and the am puffiness has def decreased along with crows feet.  I&#x27;m just really impressed at the lighter look of my eyes...like more awake and firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Esthetician recommeded the Boots No 7 line to me, including their night cream, eye cream, cleanser, scrub and dry oil body spray.....ALL have been excellent quality for a great price!</li>
            <li> So far, it works just ok.  I don&#x27;t know what all the hubub is about.  I actually prefer a different over the counter eye cream a lot better (Pro-X) This doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many eye creams and this is a great cream for price. Actually can see and feel the difference and improvement in eye area immediately after just first use. Feels smoother under eye and looks firmer. Use twice a day. Love all the Boots line of products that I have tried. Just a little drop for both eyes is all you need.</li>
            <li> I decided to choose a new eye cream because so many of them are full of toxins and retinol which I&#x27;ve heard can impact hormones. I chose this one based off of reviews and its low toxicity ranking on www.ewg.org.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it works fine. Some of the others are greasy and this one is not; you can apply make up easily over it and you can also apply it over makeup (yes, you read that right). As another reviewer says it does not sting. strangely, I kind of like it when products sting because it feel like they are more potent or &amp;#34;working,&amp;#34; but I guess that&#x27;s just psychological. As far as &amp;#34;lifting&amp;#34; the eye-- I didn&#x27;t really expect that so I wasn&#x27;t disappointed, but I can see how someone with that expectation would be disappointed! I&#x27;d say this is a basic non-toxic eye cream which would be great for someone with sensitive skin-- As for helping with fine lines?? I believe any sort of moisture-rich product will help with that-- this one does the job ok but don&#x27;t expect too much more than what your night cream may already be doing. With that said, I will still probably buy this product because it meets the criteria I prioritize. There may be more potent products out there that work better but to me its not worth absorbing strange ingredients all the while.</li>
