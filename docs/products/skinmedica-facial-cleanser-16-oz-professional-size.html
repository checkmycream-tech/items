            <li> this size lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Usually, when I start a new skin care, I can&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> One bottle lasted me for a very long time.</li>
            <li> did not break my face out or leave it feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Product came as expected</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 years old and still suffer from seriously oily Tzone.  </li>
            <li> The product itself seems ok but since the pump was badly damaged in shipping and is unusable to it hard to dispense the proper amount.</li>
            <li> /&gt; not sure why it is such a RIP OFF.</li>
            <li> I have been using SkinMedica facial cleanser for the past 8 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The pump on this soap is not large enough to accommodate the thick gel.  </li>
            <li> Odd not to be &#x27;squeaky-clean&#x27;</li>
            <li> can I have a little trouble with the pump working efficiently as in my other skin medica item also</li>
            <li> I leave it on my face for a few minutes and them rinse.</li>
            <li> I think it enhances the other products I am using in this line, Lytera and the retinol complex.  </li>
            <li> I am in my 40&#x27;s and have been having troubled skin for the last 10 years.</li>
            <li> I had to transfer it to another plastic container and wasted some product doing so---never again!</li>
            <li> Not sure if i will buy this product again</li>
            <li> Once we opened the plastic we saw the pump head was completely broken in half.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 5 years and would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> It was such a mess, I threw it away :(  </li>
            <li> and it is not tall enough to get a Clarisonic brush under--very disappointing!  </li>
            <li> I did buy the skin redness cream and that has helped my skin, but I&#x27;m not very impressed with this face wash.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tired them all.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, she passed away in 2010.</li>

            <li> This is an excellent facial cleanser.  When I do opt for a treated microdermabrasion @ my special facial salon in Newport, Rhode Island, this is what is used.  Matter-of-fact, all the SkinMedica products at this salon are recommended to their clients, and are sold on the Amazon website.  Since I begin using this and other SkinMedica products, I have compliments on my skin, and I&#x27;m 64 years old!  (These compliments have come from young women in their 20s &amp; 30s).  Hee. I tell them it must be in my genes...amd now you readers know my secrets!</li>
            <li> I keep ordering this.  It is a very good cleanser for face and doesn&#x27;t sting the eyes. Run out of words</li>
            <li> I love skinmedica nothing more to say.</li>
            <li> SkinMedica has been recommended to me by my dermatologist, but I was hesitant to add too many new products at once.  I&#x27;m 47 years old and still suffer from seriously oily Tzone.  This product is very different from any cleanser I&#x27;ve used before.  Feels like washing with a lotion!  Odd not to be &#x27;squeaky-clean&#x27;, skin feels smooth and moisturized.  I do try to avoid getting too close to the hairline or I try to use before shampooing to keep my oily roots cleaner.  Since I have most likely been overstimulating my face with harsh products, this is a real gem.  Works very nicely with my ultrasonic - (once a week maximum per doctor recommendation with the scrubber).  Also started using the .25 Retinol Complex about a month ago, and recommend that also - BE SURE to follow instructions with the Retinol.  Just ordered another product in this line, Ultra Sheer Moisturizer which is also sold here on Amazon in a large 8 oz size.  Super excited to see how this next product works.  I never ever believed I could have great skin.....saying goodbye to my old favorites by Simple &amp; Cerave!</li>
            <li> what in this stuff GOLD.?&lt;br /&gt; not sure why it is such a RIP OFF. Not sure if i will buy this product again</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser and the large size is really a bargain. Works perfectly with my skin and would recommend this to anyone. The entire line is one of the best and amazing results.</li>
            <li> I liked the cleanser. It made my face feel clean and not dried out. One bottle lasted me for a very long time. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> SkinMedica Facial cleanser was recommended to me by my dermatologist...he carries this product in his office suites.  I love the look and feel of my face when using the product and know it is healthy for my complexion and not caustic in any way.  This big 16 ounce sixe lasts me about a year and the pump action is so convenient.  I have told all my female family to use this for their faces on a daily basis.  I recommend this to all who are interested in a healthy glowing skin and like a quick routine in the process.  This came from Amazon and was/is a great price compared to other places..it also ships quickly if you are already using the product and depleted your supply.  Get your today!!</li>
            <li> Works great and got it for a great price!!</li>
            <li> I had the best dermatologist in the world! Unfortunately, she passed away in 2010. She introduced me to Skin Medica facial cleanser when I was having problems with my occasional acne and eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive skin especially my face but after using this product to clean my face I knew I was not going to try anything else. I have been using SkinMedica facial cleanser for the past 8 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not break my face out or leave it feeling dry. It smells so good almost like hair shampoo but for the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product leaves your skin clean and refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire line of SkinMedica products are absolutely the best. This company has made a huge impression and built such a stellar reputation of their skin care products. To me, they have the best products especially their facial cleanser on the market!</li>
            <li> Excellent product works great. Skinmedica is the best line of skincare products I have tired and I&#x27;ve tired them all. The professional size is an excellent saving and Amazon ships quickly. Love this cleaner my skin love it too</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 5 years and would not use anything else. The only way to cleanse your face.</li>
            <li> can I have a little trouble with the pump working efficiently as in my other skin medica item also</li>
            <li> The product itself seems ok but since the pump was badly damaged in shipping and is unusable to it hard to dispense the proper amount. When I opened the box it was shipped in I could see right away there was a problem as blue goo was inside the plastic it was wrapped in. Once we opened the plastic we saw the pump head was completely broken in half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never found better!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at my doctor&#x27;s office at a much higher price. So excited to see that it is available in a bulk size (since all 5 family members use it). It&#x27;s the real deal, not a counterfeit formulation. I love it for its ability clean thoroughly but it doesn&#x27;t irritate or strip the skin. Removes all traces of make-up; I don&#x27;t even use remover anymore since this takes it all away. I follow by toner and there are no traces of dirt or make up on the cotton ball after using SkinMedica cleanser. Very important for those of us who have acne prone skin. Great price and great service.</li>
            <li> A family member recommended this product to me to use with my sonicare.  My skin feels clean and smooth after use.  The larger bottle lasts longer and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry.  My skin looks and feels smoother and healthier.  I love SkinMedica and the aroma is very pleasant.</li>
            <li> This product is a gel like substance.  It has low lather and is at this point just so-so.  I was using a different cleanser made by the same company; a foam cleanser which I liked better.</li>
            <li> This is a product line recommended by my dermatologist, all of which I have been very pleased with.  This cleanser has a nice mild lather, and smell.  I think it enhances the other products I am using in this line, Lytera and the retinol complex.  Basically, they all do what they say.  Amamzon has the better price that my doc, for sure.</li>
            <li> great product.  good seller</li>
            <li> Great great product. Love how it cleans without stinging my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;My dermatologist recommended and it is the best I have used in years</li>
            <li> Great facial cleanser that I use on a daily basis and would absolutely recommend to others with out any hesitation.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my mom.  She later learned this product was likely ordered removed from the market by the FDA for using a chemical/component not approved for use by humans.  This product was received in good condition and my mom did use it; however, before I re-ordered another supply for her, she relayed the FDA news.  So, I&#x27;m relaying it to Amazon viewers, too.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend purchasing the 16oz professional&lt;br /&gt;Just use 1 pump at a time and product would easily last a year&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser provides a nice foam and leaves your skin feeling clean an refreshed&lt;br /&gt;Great service from seller</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Keeps skin clear!</li>
            <li> Good size, the skin feels clean and soft.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have literally tried hundreds of face washes and all were high end.  This one cleans very well without stripping the oils from your skin.  It also tones my skin and makes it look radiant.</li>
            <li> Excellent service and delivery.  Product as described. My wife likes all Skin Medica products</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it every day. It cleans my sensitive skin wonderfully.  My skin feels smooth and clean.  It removes quick and easy.  A great product to add to your skin regiment.</li>
            <li> The pump on this soap is not large enough to accommodate the thick gel.  It was such a mess, I threw it away :(  I cannot really rate it&#x27;s effectiveness for that reason.  I love other SkinMedica products and use them daily.  I now use Garnier oil cleansing product which I like very much for my 60 year old skin.</li>
            <li> I keep going back to this cleanser because it smells good and cleans really well with out drying.  I leave it on my face for a few minutes and them rinse. reasonable price.</li>
