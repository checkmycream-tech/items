            <li>Good luck to you all!</li>
            <li>I suggested them to a friend of mine as well, and my friend just had a beautiful baby girl..</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m a happy healthy 13 weeks along!</li>
            <li>Even good numbers don&#x27;t guarantee a baby - but they help.    </li>
            <li>but he thinks they are good.</li>
            <li>Good luck to all couples that are trying to conceive.</li>
            <li>We can&#x27;t express our happiness in words.</li>
            <li>I am very glad I took this product</li>
            <li>best advise for trying to conceive along with this proudct is (1) Do not smoke (2) Limit liquor (3) eliminate caffeine (4) exercise (5) relax and have fun.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that it will work again!</li>
            <li>Good luck to all of you trying :)</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own if you have a problem like Varicocele</li>
            <li>and he said to just eat a healthy diet, with plenty of antioxidants.  </li>
            <li>My sa last month had me at 76, which is good, but now I&#x27;m at 97, which is great.</li>
            <li>In the middle of month 3, she&#x27;s pregnant!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Get the three month supply for sure.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been taking Fertility blend for more than 9 months and there was no improvement.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m sure this is doing something.</li>
            <li>and it improved my testosterone pretty good</li>
            <li>We decided to give these a try based on the great reviews, and I LOVE the concept of using a natural herb before going and taking a manufactured product from a drug company.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say for sure if this works since I haven&#x27;t had a sperm analysis since hearing the good news, but I really do think it did.  </li>
            <li>So my sincere suggestion is please go see your urologist and ask him to prescribe testicle ultrasound, this test will tell you the most important things about your reproductive health.</li>
            <li>Like most of the people who have reviewed this product, I really have no idea effective</li>
            <li>I strongly believe that this Fertility blend won&#x27;t work on</li>
            <li>Six weeks after using them we find out my wife is pregnant!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pregnant!</li>
            <li>I was in shock, I am now 8 1/2 months pregnant :)</li>
            <li>I hope others are having more success.</li>
            <li>While my husband didn&#x27;t get tested before or after taking this product, I am pretty sure it was the magic bullet we needed in order to get pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure all those things contributed, but I really think the Fertility Blend made a huge difference.</li>
            <li>After taking the pills for 2 months, we got pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Also, we have not had a \\&quot;chance\\&quot; to get pregnant since he&#x27;s been taking them, so</li>
            <li>She took his advice and now it appears that we&#x27;re pregnant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve scheduled Varicolectomy surgery in October and boom my wife was pregnant in January.</li>
            <li>Within 76 days of surgery, my wife became pregnant.</li>
            <li>and we got pregnant a month after hubby started taking them...</li>
            <li>and I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>We are hoping we get pregnant this month.</li>
            <li>Me and my wife were trying to get pregnant for a couple years.</li>
            <li>Neither of us have any weight issues, but we could not get pregnant.</li>
            <li>and my wife found out that she pregnant.</li>
            <li>he feels that hopefully this is what is needed to allow me to get pregnant.  </li>
            <li>, we didn&#x27;t get pregnant while using this product.</li>
            <li>so had months left gave to a friend who was trying to conceive for over a year and again worked like magic within a month!</li>
            <li>After the first month of using it I got pregnant and now I am 10 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>ok i have been with my girlfriend now wife since 2002 when we was both 16 years old.</li>
            <li>I did not repeat the semen analysis to be honest, but I was diagnosed with moderate varicocele..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 years old and we have been trying for more than a year.</li>
            <li>I always want to make it clear that this Fertility blend didn&#x27;t give any side effects also so it may be safe to take these</li>
            <li>I now have a two month old healthy baby boy.</li>
            <li>Just received confirmation we are 4 weeks and 2days pregnant AFTER our first month of &amp;#34;trying.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>we sure enough got pregnant.  </li>
            <li>After two more months I will get back on this website and review this product again.</li>
            <li>I bought this after reading the reviews, I took 3/day for the first bottle.</li>
            <li>I could never say for sure if these were the cause or even helpful obviously, but they were suggested my my friend.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>and they do EXACTLY what they promise, not to mention increase urine flow.</li>
            <li>My first test showed sperm count of just 50 thousand which is practically zero.</li>
            <li>This really does work!</li>
            <li>should add that he was taking maca powder in addition to this, as well as exercising more and eating a healthier diet overall.</li>
            <li>For Real!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve changed so many things to improve my sperm count like taking organic green tea, Maca powder, L-arginine, Horny goat weed with maca, gozi berries and most important of all Fortege tablets by Alarsin company (herbal product from India which my herbal doctor uncle personally vouched for it, so ordered them through ebay).</li>
            <li>Btw - we have both been checked and given the green light that everything is OK.</li>
            <li>This got me really worried that with the combination of her PCOS and my low sperm count that we would have to do in vitro or that we would not be able to have kids at all.</li>
            <li>Hopefully soon we will have some positive news.</li>
            <li>Even if your numbers are normal, they can still be improved which will improve your chances of success.  </li>
            <li>stopped taking normal Multi-vitamins while taking this (as it provides many of the same vitamins) and have not noticed any difference in my energy levels or how I feel on a day to day basis.</li>
            <li>couple weeks later, I went to the Urologist and showed him the product package; he said it was fine to take and would not do any harm, though it probably wouldn&#x27;t do anything.  </li>
            <li>He usually gets colds very easily, but recently was able to fight one off</li>
            <li>My boys were high quality when tested!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know how to correctly rate this product.  </li>
            <li>So it really does help.  </li>
            <li>So you need to be on this product for 3 months to really judge it.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this product hoping it would help, though it doesn&#x27;t really mention morphology specifically in the product</li>
            <li>My husband had tried it before and it helped on his sperm quality really well.</li>
            <li>this product really works.  </li>
            <li>however it didn&#x27;t improve my sperm count much.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>We question if this really works or not.</li>
            <li>Although his numbers came back normal, two months after trying this product we were pregnant!</li>
            <li>but this is the truth, I stopped using it after I knew my wife was pregnant, so I used it a total of 2 week all together.</li>
            <li>Then she bought the female pills and after about a month she got pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I took Maca myself to help regulate my cycle, but we still didn&#x27;t seem to get pregnant after trying without monitoring the calendar for 8 months and after actively following the calendar for 10 months.  </li>
            <li>My wife made an appointment with her doctor after not getting pregnant last month, and he told her to take baby aspirin and mucinex during her fertile time this month.</li>
            <li>I personally cannot tell if this product helped us to get pregnant or not because the label says it takes 72 days for it to affect a man&#x27;s sperm</li>
            <li>I have taken this product twice daily for about three months (you have to be consistent with taking two each day in order to achieve positive results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product just over a month, and I took another sperm test and my results came back normal for the first time!</li>
            <li>That was below normal.</li>
            <li>analysis conducted and found out my sperm count was normal</li>
            <li>Just remember it takes 70-90 days to produce new sperm.</li>
            <li>My husband was a bit low and slow, sperm wise.</li>
            <li>These were suggested by my infertility doctor, and while we were not successful using them (nor through several IVF attempts), he thinks they are an amazing product!</li>
            <li>I increased to dosage for the first month and then dropped to the regular dosage.</li>
            <li>and I am now looking at my 9 week old baby!</li>
            <li>Funny part is that we never used birth control over the last 12 years, and nada.</li>
            <li>The only test I took was one of those home sperm count tests that are sold on Amazon for $40, and I took it about halfway through month one with a positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was the third month of my husband using this supplement that I finally got pregnant after 9 months of trying to conceive.</li>
            <li>it worked from one day of use, I know  it sound too little</li>
            <li>She tried other ways to get pregnant as well.  </li>
            <li>I have a 3 month old daughter because of it.</li>
            <li>Sperm take almost 3 months to mature.</li>
            <li>Wife and I have a 3 1/2 year old.  </li>
            <li>I supposed the only way to really tell if this stuff works is if you have a semen analysis before and after taking the pills for 3 months.</li>
            <li>I only had 2% morphology (the other measurements were fine).  </li>
            <li>Also, I got more serious about taking two capsules of fish oil a day.  </li>
            <li>I have a bottle and a half left, but I&#x27;ll keep that for the next kid :)</li>
            <li>My wife and I tried to get pregnant for a year and a half.</li>
            <li>We have been trying for the past 2 years and now my wife is 6 weeks pregnant!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to any male who is trying to conceive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now eight months pregnant with a little boy</li>
            <li>The other reviews said it took 3 months but lucky for us only 2.  </li>
            <li>We got pregnant using these and one round of IUI.  </li>
            <li>I hax to purchas this product directly from Daily Wellness with of course no issues &amp; btw</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these if you&#x27;re having trouble getting pregnant and have ruled out other fertility issues.</li>
            <li>Ordered this product after five months of trying to conceive without success started taking for a few weeks and it worked right aways only used a few weeks supply</li>
            <li>I suffered from a High morphology rate and after taking this medication over a few months time period I was tested again at a Normal morphology</li>
            <li>I was having slow sperms and after using the product for 4-5 months my wife got pregnant..</li>

            <li> I have taken this product twice daily for about three months (you have to be consistent with taking two each day in order to achieve positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product just over a month, and I took another sperm test and my results came back normal for the first time!</li>
            <li> That was below normal.</li>
            <li> analysis conducted and found out my sperm count was normal</li>
            <li> Just remember it takes 70-90 days to produce new sperm.</li>
            <li> My husband was a bit low and slow, sperm wise.</li>
            <li> These were suggested by my infertility doctor, and while we were not successful using them (nor through several IVF attempts), he thinks they are an amazing product!</li>
            <li> I increased to dosage for the first month and then dropped to the regular dosage.</li>
            <li> and I am now looking at my 9 week old baby!</li>
            <li> Funny part is that we never used birth control over the last 12 years, and nada.</li>
            <li> The only test I took was one of those home sperm count tests that are sold on Amazon for $40, and I took it about halfway through month one with a positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was the third month of my husband using this supplement that I finally got pregnant after 9 months of trying to conceive.</li>
            <li> it worked from one day of use, I know  it sound too little</li>
            <li> She tried other ways to get pregnant as well.  </li>
            <li> I have a 3 month old daughter because of it.</li>
            <li> Sperm take almost 3 months to mature.</li>
            <li> Wife and I have a 3 1/2 year old.  </li>
            <li> I supposed the only way to really tell if this stuff works is if you have a semen analysis before and after taking the pills for 3 months.</li>
            <li> I only had 2% morphology (the other measurements were fine).  </li>
            <li> Also, I got more serious about taking two capsules of fish oil a day.  </li>
            <li> I have a bottle and a half left, but I&#x27;ll keep that for the next kid :)</li>
            <li> My wife and I tried to get pregnant for a year and a half.</li>
            <li> We have been trying for the past 2 years and now my wife is 6 weeks pregnant!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to any male who is trying to conceive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now eight months pregnant with a little boy</li>
            <li> The other reviews said it took 3 months but lucky for us only 2.  </li>
            <li> We got pregnant using these and one round of IUI.  </li>
            <li> I hax to purchas this product directly from Daily Wellness with of course no issues &amp; btw</li>
            <li> I highly recommend these if you&#x27;re having trouble getting pregnant and have ruled out other fertility issues.</li>
            <li> Ordered this product after five months of trying to conceive without success started taking for a few weeks and it worked right aways only used a few weeks supply</li>
            <li> I suffered from a High morphology rate and after taking this medication over a few months time period I was tested again at a Normal morphology</li>
            <li> I was having slow sperms and after using the product for 4-5 months my wife got pregnant..</li>
            <li> and my wife came back with a positive home pregnancy test late last week.</li>
            <li> The doctor told us it was unlikely he could get me pregnant naturally.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first with this product but my wife (after two years) is pregnant.</li>
            <li> Even worse is that I was very irresponsible as a very young man and never used protection with my girlfriends, they all have litters of children now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially considering the minor cost for a 3 month supply of this product in comparison to paying for fertility treatment.  </li>
            <li> Give it a try, you have nothing to loose only to gain.</li>
            <li> little background, I&#x27;m 30 years old and my wife is 27, and we had been trying to conceive for about 10 months with zero luck.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe when I saw the second pink line on the pregnancy test</li>
            <li> I was skeptical if a supplement would actually help us to get pregnant</li>
            <li> A couple months after taking this, his count and motility skyrocketed to above average.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s taken at least one pregnancy test per day for the past 5 days and every one has come back positive.</li>
            <li> Hubby hated the smell so as soon as I got preganant he stopped taking them and tossed them away, Good Price for the quantity though.</li>
            <li> It usually works the opposite away around!    </li>
            <li> Even then, there are a million other variables that could correlate with a change in sperm count/quality other than these pills.</li>
            <li> Judging from past reviews, it&#x27;s a mixed bag.</li>
            <li> but there are no exact correlation between the pregnancy and this product itself but rather a combination of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure which one of these things did the trick, but I suppose spending less that $100 on over-the-counter medicine/vitamins is a lot cheaper than fertility treatments, which was probably the next step.</li>
            <li> the other reason is the pills were pretty big, and they also tasted bad, or wierd.  </li>
            <li> All my numbers were within average limits except for morphology.  </li>
            <li> It really made us sad to hear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so they went down easier.  </li>
            <li> Like the previous poster, we were trying for six months with no luck.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it took about a month and a half of taking the Fertility Blend to get</li>
            <li> We are not pregnant yet but this could be unrelated to the vitamins.</li>
            <li> After a few months of taking this, my SA has been redone and all my numbers are improved - including morphology.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to us since we are having trouble conceiving, it worked for them after 8 months of trying.</li>
            <li> My husband had a very low sperm count and motility was poor.</li>
            <li> Waste of money and</li>
            <li> I made a few changes to try to help get my sperm count up.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> She has a common condition that makes it difficult to conceive, and has been on Metformin for several years.</li>
            <li> one reason is that I have to take them 3 times a day, and seeing how i have never took any sort of vitamins before, its kinda hard to get into the habit.  </li>
            <li> I had a scare when the doctor detected a varicocele, but it turned out negative after an ultrasound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improvement in my sperm quality, it might even be having a negative effect on my erection, hope not.</li>
            <li> nothing too serious.</li>
            <li> Not Happy w/ Bigflysports for not taking any responsibility.</li>
            <li> On our options seemed grim since IVF would only be allowed if my morphology was at least 4%.  </li>
            <li> Bottom line is that I failed to take them as recommended and may try again...</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband and I have been trying to conceive for four years. Although his numbers came back normal, two months after trying this product we were pregnant! I believe it was because of these vitamins. Just remember it takes 70-90 days to produce new sperm.</li>
            <li> We have been trying for a 6 months prior to taking these pills with no results. After taking the pills for 2 months, we got pregnant.  I increased to dosage for the first month and then dropped to the regular dosage. The other reviews said it took 3 months but lucky for us only 2.  In addition to the pills, ate fish once a week and started eating a lot of oatmeal and nuts which is supposed to help the men rev up.</li>
            <li> My boys were high quality when tested!</li>
            <li> My husband was a bit low and slow, sperm wise. His levels were \\&quot;enough to do the job,\\&quot; according to the doctor, but not optimal. A couple months after taking this, his count and motility skyrocketed to above average.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know how to correctly rate this product.  It arrived when they said it would.  However, my husband has only been taking them for a month and has not been tested again, so we don&#x27;t know if his count has gone up.     Also, we have not had a \\&quot;chance\\&quot; to get pregnant since he&#x27;s been taking them, so I can&#x27;t review this item correctly yet. I do know that my husband has felt healthier since taking them.  He usually gets colds very easily, but recently was able to fight one off and I got it.  It usually works the opposite away around!    After two more months I will get back on this website and review this product again.</li>
            <li> Improved motility, sperm count, and quality. I have a 3 month old daughter because of it. Might not solve everyone&#x27;s fertility problems, but definately increases the chance.</li>
            <li> These were suggested by my infertility doctor, and while we were not successful using them (nor through several IVF attempts), he thinks they are an amazing product!</li>
            <li> My wife and I have been trying to conceive for a while.  When we saw an RE, I had my SA done.  All my numbers were within average limits except for morphology.  That was below normal. I asked the RE about improving morphology and he said to just eat a healthy diet, with plenty of antioxidants.  After some searching, I decided to try the Fertility Blend for Men.  After a few months of taking this, my SA has been redone and all my numbers are improved - including morphology.  So it really does help.  Just a couple of things to remember:  1. Sperm take almost 3 months to mature. So you need to be on this product for 3 months to really judge it.  2. Even good numbers don&#x27;t guarantee a baby - but they help.    I highly recommend this to any male who is trying to conceive.  Even if your numbers are normal, they can still be improved which will improve your chances of success.  Good luck on your journey!</li>
            <li> it worked from one day of use, I know  it sound too little but this is the truth, I stopped using it after I knew my wife was pregnant, so I used it a total of 2 week all together. We have been trying for the past 2 years and now my wife is 6 weeks pregnant!</li>
            <li> I bought this because wife and I have been trying for months for another baby. My motility was low (I&#x27;m a smoker). My sa last month had me at 76, which is good, but now I&#x27;m at 97, which is great. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Wife and I have a 3 1/2 year old.  We&#x27;ve tried for a second child for 2 years.  Nothing happened.  We finally got to the point of looking up in vitro clinics.  She saw this online and bought it for me.  I took it for about 3 months.  Then she bought the female pills and after about a month she got pregnant.  She tried other ways to get pregnant as well.  Acupuncture and Chinese herb doctor.  This stuff worked for us and I believe it helped us.  Don&#x27;t lose hope.  I started to and voila.</li>
            <li> This stuff worked for us!  Like the previous poster, we were trying for six months with no luck.  I had a sperm analysis (on the order of my wife&#x27;s ob-gyn) and found out I only had 2% morphology (the other measurements were fine).  I ordered this product hoping it would help, though it doesn&#x27;t really mention morphology specifically in the product details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple weeks later, I went to the Urologist and showed him the product package; he said it was fine to take and would not do any harm, though it probably wouldn&#x27;t do anything.  I had a scare when the doctor detected a varicocele, but it turned out negative after an ultrasound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My urologist advised to wait and see and do another sperm analysis at another lab.  On our options seemed grim since IVF would only be allowed if my morphology was at least 4%.  It really made us sad to hear this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lo and behold, the next week my wife told me she missed her period!  She did two separate tests and found that she was pregnant!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The regiment was taking this stuff 3-4 times a day (per the instructions) and powedered flax seed with water once a day.  Also, I got more serious about taking two capsules of fish oil a day.  Also, we changed up doing the deed to once every two days (around the same time each time).  All in all, it took about a month and a half of taking the Fertility Blend to get preggers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure I have a bottle and a half left, but I&#x27;ll keep that for the next kid :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure if this works since I haven&#x27;t had a sperm analysis since hearing the good news, but I really do think it did.  Good luck to you all!</li>
            <li> While my husband didn&#x27;t get tested before or after taking this product, I am pretty sure it was the magic bullet we needed in order to get pregnant.  I took Maca myself to help regulate my cycle, but we still didn&#x27;t seem to get pregnant after trying without monitoring the calendar for 8 months and after actively following the calendar for 10 months.  We decided to give these a try based on the great reviews, and I LOVE the concept of using a natural herb before going and taking a manufactured product from a drug company.  Especially considering the minor cost for a 3 month supply of this product in comparison to paying for fertility treatment.  The product says that it will take 3 months to take effect, and the third month my husband was on it we sure enough got pregnant.  I couldn&#x27;t believe when I saw the second pink line on the pregnancy test and I am now looking at my 9 week old baby!</li>
            <li> We have been trying for a while, about 6 months. We were about to have to see a fertility doctor. Funny part is that we never used birth control over the last 12 years, and nada. She has a common condition that makes it difficult to conceive, and has been on Metformin for several years. Even worse is that I was very irresponsible as a very young man and never used protection with my girlfriends, they all have litters of children now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I bought this after reading the reviews, I took 3/day for the first bottle. Then switched to 2/day. In the middle of month 3, she&#x27;s pregnant!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband had tried it before and it helped on his sperm quality really well. He is trying for the second time and I&#x27;m sure that it will work again!</li>
            <li> The advertisement shows 3 containers and only one container came!  I like the product and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> ok i have been with my girlfriend now wife since 2002 when we was both 16 years old. in all that time she have only been prego twice. once in 2010 &amp; again in 2013. both did not end well. i know she can get prego, so it did not take no Dr. to tell me that i was the issue. so i got these pills and started taking them on 01/04/2014 at the start of my wife ovulation and i SWEAR today 01/08/2014 after my wife missed her &amp;#34;P&amp;#34; day we took a HPT and WE GOT A BFP!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i know it say 2-3 months but i know in my heart that she is ONLY prego because of the pills!!!!!</li>
            <li> Never tested my sperm since I got this thing so I have no idea if it is working but well it could not hurt.</li>
            <li> My wife and I tried to get pregnant for a year and a half. I had a semen  analysis conducted and found out my sperm count was normal but I had low motility (30%).  I ordered these and took 4 a day for a month and then 2 a day for a couple weeks.  BINGO.  Six weeks after using them we find out my wife is pregnant!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pregnant! I could never say for sure if these were the cause or even helpful obviously, but they were suggested my my friend. I suggested them to a friend of mine as well, and my friend just had a beautiful baby girl.. And I&#x27;m a happy healthy 13 weeks along! We only tried for 3 months. Good luck to all of you trying :)</li>
            <li> We got pregnant using these and one round of IUI.  Product was recommended by Kaiser Permanente Nurse.</li>
            <li> My husband began taking the supplement 3 months before we began our conception efforts.  Just received confirmation we are 4 weeks and 2days pregnant AFTER our first month of &amp;#34;trying.&amp;#34;  Keep in mind I am in my upper 30s and he is in his mid 50s ... We are not the ideal age for conception, but I do believe Fertility blend aided his swimmers!</li>
            <li> This Fertility medication works as directed. I suffered from a High morphology rate and after taking this medication over a few months time period I was tested again at a Normal morphology rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped taking normal Multi-vitamins while taking this (as it provides many of the same vitamins) and have not noticed any difference in my energy levels or how I feel on a day to day basis.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> These pills definitely work!! a lot of energy and they do EXACTLY what they promise, not to mention increase urine flow. Unbelievable. Triple the sex drive.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I have no idea if they worked&amp;#34; said my husband...but he thinks they are good. We are not pregnant yet but this could be unrelated to the vitamins.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product just over a month, and I took another sperm test and my results came back normal for the first time! Motility and all!</li>
            <li> Like most of the people who have reviewed this product, I really have no idea effective it actually is at improving sperm count and quality. I supposed the only way to really tell if this stuff works is if you have a semen analysis before and after taking the pills for 3 months. Even then, there are a million other variables that could correlate with a change in sperm count/quality other than these pills. The only test I took was one of those home sperm count tests that are sold on Amazon for $40, and I took it about halfway through month one with a positive result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little background, I&#x27;m 30 years old and my wife is 27, and we had been trying to conceive for about 10 months with zero luck. I started taking this stuff about 2 months ago 3x per day. I switched to twice per day after a couple of weeks because I could never remember to take a pill with lunch anyway. I&#x27;m just about finished with the second bottle and my wife came back with a positive home pregnancy test late last week. She&#x27;s taken at least one pregnancy test per day for the past 5 days and every one has come back positive. My wife made an appointment with her doctor after not getting pregnant last month, and he told her to take baby aspirin and mucinex during her fertile time this month. She took his advice and now it appears that we&#x27;re pregnant. I&#x27;m not sure which one of these things did the trick, but I suppose spending less that $100 on over-the-counter medicine/vitamins is a lot cheaper than fertility treatments, which was probably the next step. Regardless of whether or not you decided to use this product, best of luck to everyone out there trying to start a family.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to us since we are having trouble conceiving, it worked for them after 8 months of trying. Everyone&#x27;s situation is different but for us, we went through 3 bottles (not that affordable IMO). It did make me husband feel a bit queasy but nothing too serious. We&#x27;re going to move onto FertilAid and see where that takes us. Btw - we have both been checked and given the green light that everything is OK. It&#x27;s just timing I guess. It may or may not work for you. Judging from past reviews, it&#x27;s a mixed bag. Baby dust to all!</li>
            <li> TWO fertility docs told us we had a 1% chance to conceive. My husband took these plus ate a bunch of antioxidant-rich foods...BAM...pregnant in just under three months! Get the three month supply for sure.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product before.. I was having slow sperms and after using the product for 4-5 months my wife got pregnant.. I did not repeat the semen analysis to be honest, but I was diagnosed with moderate varicocele..</li>
            <li> Perfect condition! Thank you!</li>
            <li> After 9 months of trying, I gave these a try, based on the recommendation from a friend. We conceived within 2 months.  We used these for child 2 and we conceived within 2 months. It could be coincidence, but I would recommend based on our experience.</li>
            <li> My husband had a very low sperm count and motility was poor. We were TTC for over a year. He started taking these as directed and 3 months later we had a semen analysis done. His numbers all quadrupled!!! I was in shock, I am now 8 1/2 months pregnant :)</li>
            <li> Does not work, does not even bring sperm counts up at ALL!!!! Waste of money and when you try to return it, they wont take it!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product after five months of trying to conceive without success started taking for a few weeks and it worked right aways only used a few weeks supply so had months left gave to a friend who was trying to conceive for over a year and again worked like magic within a month! Will use this product again if needed!</li>
            <li> I paid/ordered a three month supply from Bigflysports &amp; I recieved only 1 bottle w/ my order, which was only 1 month supply.  I called Bigflysports to leave a message on how dissatisfied I was &amp; they responded days later, telling me to go back to Amazon via E-mail.  Well Amazon refunded my 2 bottles back.  I hax to purchas this product directly from Daily Wellness with of course no issues &amp; btw this product really works.  Not Happy w/ Bigflysports for not taking any responsibility.</li>
            <li> It does work. My husband&#x27;s morphology level was very low and we were recommended to get some antioxidants for him. I went to GNC and they suggested this. I looked it up online and I read all the reviews on Amazon, so I thought let&#x27;s give it a try. After the first month of using it I got pregnant and now I am 10 weeks pregnant. Give it a try, you have nothing to loose only to gain. Good luck to all couples that are trying to conceive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 30 years old and we have been trying for more than a year. My first test showed sperm count of just 50 thousand which is practically zero. My urologist gave me Clomid 50mg and it improved my testosterone pretty good however it didn&#x27;t improve my sperm count much. The sperm count after 4 months was just 1 million and it didn&#x27;t improve from there. I&#x27;ve been taking Fertility blend for more than 9 months and there was no improvement. Finally after 6 months my urologist asked me to go for ultrasound and the test showed that I&#x27;ve had a medium size varicocele. I&#x27;ve scheduled Varicolectomy surgery in October and boom my wife was pregnant in January. Within 76 days of surgery, my wife became pregnant. We can&#x27;t express our happiness in words. My semen analysis after 3 months of surgery showed 12 million count. So we believe it&#x27;s a mix of miracle and varicolectomy surgery, that helped me. I&#x27;ve changed so many things to improve my sperm count like taking organic green tea, Maca powder, L-arginine, Horny goat weed with maca, gozi berries and most important of all Fortege tablets by Alarsin company (herbal product from India which my herbal doctor uncle personally vouched for it, so ordered them through ebay). I strongly believe that this Fertility blend won&#x27;t work on it&#x27;s own if you have a problem like Varicocele and it&#x27;s the dominant cause of all infertile men. So my sincere suggestion is please go see your urologist and ask him to prescribe testicle ultrasound, this test will tell you the most important things about your reproductive health. I always want to make it clear that this Fertility blend didn&#x27;t give any side effects also so it may be safe to take these but don&#x27;t rely 100% only on it.</li>
            <li> It says people are supposed to take this for 3 months and then some to expect results, I just couldnt do it.  one reason is that I have to take them 3 times a day, and seeing how i have never took any sort of vitamins before, its kinda hard to get into the habit.  the other reason is the pills were pretty big, and they also tasted bad, or wierd.  I did like the fact that they were coated so they went down easier.  Bottom line is that I failed to take them as recommended and may try again...</li>
            <li> I personally cannot tell if this product helped us to get pregnant or not because the label says it takes 72 days for it to affect a man&#x27;s sperm and we got pregnant a month after hubby started taking them...So don&#x27;t wanna give all the credit to these pills but again I can&#x27;t guarantee that it was not their help either. Hubby hated the smell so as soon as I got preganant he stopped taking them and tossed them away, Good Price for the quantity though.</li>
            <li> This really does work! My husband had a sperm count of 8 million, with only 15% motility. The doctor told us it was unlikely he could get me pregnant naturally. Well, we ordered this and a month later, his sperm count was up to 24 million with almost 50% motility and I was pregnant. We could not be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should add that he was taking maca powder in addition to this, as well as exercising more and eating a healthier diet overall. I&#x27;m sure all those things contributed, but I really think the Fertility Blend made a huge difference. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> My husband is taking them and this is his 1st month so no results yet. We are hoping we get pregnant this month.</li>
            <li> It was the third month of my husband using this supplement that I finally got pregnant after 9 months of trying to conceive. I&#x27;m now eight months pregnant with a little boy and we have had a wonderful, blessed pregnancy. I was skeptical if a supplement would actually help us to get pregnant but my husband only took one a day and it obviously did the trick!! I highly recommend these if you&#x27;re having trouble getting pregnant and have ruled out other fertility issues.</li>
            <li> Me and my wife were trying to get pregnant for a couple years. Neither of us have any weight issues, but we could not get pregnant. My wife was diagnosed with PCOS and was taking metformin for this. I decided to get tested to see if I was the issue. It turns out that I had low sperm count. This got me really worried that with the combination of her PCOS and my low sperm count that we would have to do in vitro or that we would not be able to have kids at all. I made a few changes to try to help get my sperm count up. Number one was to stop using my laptop on my lap since the heat can cause issues with low sperm count. Number two was to take these. I was taking these for just over two months and my wife found out that she pregnant. I now have a two month old healthy baby boy. If we decide to have another child I will start taking these again.</li>
            <li> My husband and I picked this out to try. We have noticed a change in amount and in texture. So I&#x27;m sure this is doing something.</li>
            <li> I think this helped! . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . For Real!</li>
            <li> We tried it, took it religiously, no help. I hope others are having more success. Maybe it&#x27;s just not meant to be.</li>
            <li> My husband loves your product he feels that hopefully this is what is needed to allow me to get pregnant.  Hopefully soon we will have some positive news.</li>
            <li> We question if this really works or not. I can tell you this, we didn&#x27;t get pregnant while using this product.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first with this product but my wife (after two years) is pregnant. I have taken this product twice daily for about three months (you have to be consistent with taking two each day in order to achieve positive results. I am very glad I took this product but there are no exact correlation between the pregnancy and this product itself but rather a combination of things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My best advise for trying to conceive along with this proudct is (1) Do not smoke (2) Limit liquor (3) eliminate caffeine (4) exercise (5) relax and have fun.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed any improvement in my sperm quality, it might even be having a negative effect on my erection, hope not.</li>
