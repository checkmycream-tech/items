            <li>Good price.</li>
            <li>The gel is a good consistency - not too runny.</li>

            <li>It is not greasy, oily or undesirable in any way, it dries very clean!</li>
            <li>The product is fine, and it is effective.</li>
            <li>Given the scarcity of large bottle hand sanitizers in the stores, because of drug-use fears, this is the best way to get an economical size hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>I use it more.</li>
            <li>so this was an OK substitute.</li>
            <li>I love this hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>Love the bulk size...good price.</li>
            <li>it is better priced than others.</li>

            <li>This is a great size for frequent use!  </li>
            <li>I love that this huge bottle of hand sanitizer comes with a hand pump.  </li>
            <li>and i found this pump easy to use as a refill.</li>
            <li>so this does just fine for my group of folks.</li>
            <li>This was my second order - it arrived promptly - works great</li>
            <li>With Prime I get free shipping</li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh scent and it does nor irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>The price was just right for me</li>
            <li>I like the fact that this container is very large.  </li>
            <li>For the price this is a great deal too as I can do multiple refills on my smaller bottles around the home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good sanitizer but a little drying for my hands.</li>
            <li>It is generic and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Large quantity, right price.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a large container of hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li>fast delivery,</li>
            <li>Came in three shipments and two were not packed very well leading to some of the sanitizer leaking out.</li>
            <li>Excluding light alcohol sent until the sanitizier is dry, there is no odor.  </li>
            <li>Decent purchase.  </li>
            <li>I had a very tiny amount of seepage that  luckily didn&#x27;t get out of the plastic wrap.  </li>
            <li>Adding some sort of fresh scent would be my only suggestion to the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>It makes it easy to refill all of my hand sanitizer dispensers, however large or small.</li>
            <li>Only wish it was price a bit lower but love the long lasting container.</li>
            <li>As well, it is great to use after preparing chicken in the kitchen.</li>
            <li>So far we have not had any problems</li>
            <li>Prefect for refilling smaller bottles or placing large bottles in public areas of offices, food establishments, etc.  </li>
            <li>Germ killing capacity is the same as the much more expensive sanitizers, but at a much lower price.  </li>
            <li>I usually take a small bottle of hand sanitizer with me when I go out, and now that the wether is warm and were are in the park alot</li>
            <li>We stocked our office with them in the winter time, and then donated a few to the local elementary school.</li>
            <li>, however they need to start using a small box or ship and not the envelope which was no adequate for such a large bottle full of liquid.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> I purchased this item few weeks ago for my office. The price was just right for me&lt;br /&gt;It was a lot cheaper then buying from Office Depot. So far we have not had any problems&lt;br /&gt;With this product. Looks great, works good. Would recommend this to others.</li>
            <li> product as advertised.  fast delivery,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a large container of hand sanitizer. I use it to fill up my smaller store-sized containers that I have around the apartment and in my backpack. It works by all accounts. Then again, I&#x27;m no chemist and haven&#x27;t tested it for germ-killing efficacy.</li>
            <li> Came in three shipments and two were not packed very well leading to some of the sanitizer leaking out.</li>
            <li> Good price. Does the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly drying, like some brands.  The gel is a good consistency - not too runny.</li>
            <li> If you are a penny pincher like me and like to buy stuff in bulk then this is the hand sanitizer for you.  I usually take a small bottle of hand sanitizer with me when I go out, and now that the wether is warm and were are in the park alot I use it more. I find those little bottle too expensive to buy over and over. Therefore i refill my small bottle all the time and i found this pump easy to use as a refill.</li>
            <li> Product came fast and generous amount of sanitizer for the price, I had enough to refill smaller bottle for my mom and had hardly a dent in mine</li>
            <li> Giant jug of hand sanitizer with a big pump.  Easy to refill smaller bottles with.  Not overly perfumed.  Simple.  Works.</li>
            <li> cant complain about it, just like any brand name sanitizer at a good price and seems to do the job.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my local Costco wasn&#x27;t selling sanitizers anymore, but since then they have brought them back into the store. I wouldn&#x27;t have discovered this brand, though, and it is really very good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good sanitizer but a little drying for my hands. If they could add some moisturizer, then it would five stars.</li>
            <li> Only wish it was price a bit lower but love the long lasting container.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had an complaints from employees so this does just fine for my group of folks. Good price for the prize.</li>
            <li> Good product.  We use it for our Dining Hall as visitors enter.  So helpful.  Big jugs are convenient and easy to keep on hand.</li>
            <li> Prefect for refilling smaller bottles or placing large bottles in public areas of offices, food establishments, etc.  Germ killing capacity is the same as the much more expensive sanitizers, but at a much lower price.  Excluding light alcohol sent until the sanitizier is dry, there is no odor.  Adding some sort of fresh scent would be my only suggestion to the manufacturer.  This is a great buy!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that this container is very large.  We have several small pump containers in our church building, and they need filling every now and then!  The product is fine, and it is effective.</li>
            <li> Great buy! We get these to regill and reuse the small plastic containers for the car, work and travel.</li>
            <li> Given the scarcity of large bottle hand sanitizers in the stores, because of drug-use fears, this is the best way to get an economical size hand sanitizer. Shipping is steep, but then the bottle is big and heavy. We use it to refill our small, travel bottles and our &amp;#34;guest&amp;#34; bottles in the bathrooms. As well, it is great to use after preparing chicken in the kitchen.</li>
            <li> This was my second order - it arrived promptly - works great</li>
            <li> Works for us. Like the option of waterless sanitizing.</li>
            <li> Decent purchase.  In the past, I&#x27;ve purchased hand sanitizer on sale in local big chain pharmacies (not necessarily in the same large container but the product totaled the same amount of ounces) for a cheaper price - but this time around, I was too impatient to wait for a sale and too lazy to shop around multiple stores so this was an OK substitute.</li>
            <li> Great product, very pleased.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s not much to say. its hand sanitizer it does the job just like the rest. but this one is great for the price. i use it to refill my smaller bottles</li>
            <li> I love this hand sanitizer. It has a clean fresh scent and it does nor irritate my skin. The economy size is a great value. I use this size to refill my smaller bottles.</li>
            <li> We use this daily...in the world today it&#x27;s a necessity.  Love the bulk size...good price.</li>
            <li> This hand sanitizer works just as well as any other, the size lasts a long time and it is better priced than others.</li>
            <li> It is generic and I love it.  it is less than half of the Perrel I usually order and I was not sure when I order it, but after getting it, I am pleased.</li>
            <li> This is a great size for frequent use!  We stocked our office with them in the winter time, and then donated a few to the local elementary school.</li>
            <li> Large quantity, right price. Does not leave hand feeling greasy or slimy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this size in my local grocery store and rather than drive all over town I just buy on Amazon now.  With Prime I get free shipping so it&#x27;s a no brainer.  Arrived on time and in one piece., however they need to start using a small box or ship and not the envelope which was no adequate for such a large bottle full of liquid.  I had a very tiny amount of seepage that  luckily didn&#x27;t get out of the plastic wrap.  For the price this is a great deal too as I can do multiple refills on my smaller bottles around the home.</li>
            <li> This can kill the H1Z1-Virus &amp; stop the Zombie apocalypse before it starts.</li>
            <li> I love that this huge bottle of hand sanitizer comes with a hand pump.  It makes it easy to refill all of my hand sanitizer dispensers, however large or small.</li>
            <li> The label on the bottle is different than the one pictured but in the end it&#x27;s regular hand-sanitizer which I expected and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> Great .. fast shipping</li>
            <li> If you haven&#x27;t tried it yet, slap some of this in your pits before you shower. Forget the deodorant. Works wonders for about 4-6 hours at least.</li>
            <li> just what it says. a big bottle of hand sanitizer. i use this to refill the ones around the house. a good price, but shipping is a bit high, but even if you factor that in, its a great deal!!</li>
            <li> For the quantity user (germaphobic household!!!)  This is a great buy.  It is not greasy, oily or undesirable in any way, it dries very clean!</li>
