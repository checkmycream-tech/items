    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy that I did.  </li>
            <li>The convenience of having a case to carry it in was great!</li>
            <li>The case they came in is great and does a very good job protecting them.  </li>
            <li>They do a great job on my nails...</li>
            <li>I had a glass file for years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Nice items.</li>
            <li>I will say though they were super cute lol.</li>
            <li>Great file and the case is so pretty and convenient.  </li>
            <li>I just love how they feel afterwords as opposed to a metal file or Emory board.  </li>
            <li>I love these much better than an emery board.</li>
            <li>The case is cute.  </li>
            <li>THEY ARE CUTE</li>
            <li>Great deal and super quick shipping for the price.</li>
            <li>I used and while it did file it didn&#x27;t seam to be as quick as another kind I tried.</li>
            <li>Fine a better product.</li>
            <li>and it still works fine.  </li>
            <li>AND THEY FUNCTION FINE</li>
            <li>Cheaply made.</li>
            <li>and I could not see any of the fabulous results as described.</li>
            <li>The small size and included carrying case make these ones perfect for storing in your desk, purse, glove box, etc</li>
            <li>Overall price for the product was great but willing to pay twice as much for better quality!</li>
            <li>It is simple but a cute detail that made a nice gift for my friends.</li>
            <li>Case is cheap plastic and doesn&#x27;t close right.</li>
            <li>very pretty, just the right size,quick delivery.  </li>
            <li>Nice try, back to the drawing board.</li>
            <li>This item is a pretty novelty piece that was never meant to be used as a nail</li>
            <li>First of all I ordered them in October</li>
            <li>The file itself so far is adequate for carrying in my purse and not poking holes like the metal files do.</li>
            <li>The one in my car is used for emergency snags only and still works fine.  </li>
            <li>Nice little glass nail file.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that they were small and had a case.  </li>
            <li>I love the little case so will keep it and try to find a quality glass file to store in it.  </li>
            <li>A great idea, unfortunately after a few uses the grit, which is just glued to the glass blade shape, rubs off and you&#x27;re left with a smooth surface.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re still okay for fixing a snag on a natural nail, but don&#x27;t expect to do any serious filing on a set of gel&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I read some of the reviews that were pretty harsh about some of these glass nail files, but I like them.  </li>
            <li>When it finally broke after years of surviving loose in a purse, I immediately looked for a new one.  </li>
            <li>The center pane of glass is perfectly smooth with just a bit of grit on the edges so pretty much useless.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Small and very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping these last as long.    </li>
            <li> I think the files that are longer are a little bit easier to use and use the longer one to do my major filing, but I bought several of these short ones so that I could keep one in each car, by my bed, by the tv, etc.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as rough as it was initially</li>
            <li> and when I finally did, it seemed like it took to long to actually file them down.</li>
            <li> Unlike other similar files I purchased in the past, the surface rubbed off almost immediately and the file stuck in the case due to poor fit.</li>
            <li> The one I tried to use regularly lost all its grit within just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; came off after only a few uses</li>
            <li> Pretty files, but very poor quality.</li>
            <li> They are almost completely smooth and won&#x27;t file anything :(</li>
            <li> waste your money, keep shopping.</li>
            <li> After just a few use they were both lacking.  </li>
            <li> but I just rinse it off every few weeks</li>
            <li> so its not genuine crystal.  </li>
            <li> But overall the performance of the file was poor.</li>
            <li> Now I can just pick up my file and fix a rough spot instead of picking away at it and making it worse.</li>
            <li> BUT JUST SMALL.</li>
            <li> The glass is a bit thicker than my previous file, and unfortunately the file itself does not work as well as other glass files I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> so I could hardly get under my nails</li>
            <li> It was way too thick</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Pretty files, but very poor quality. Unlike other similar files I purchased in the past, the surface rubbed off almost immediately and the file stuck in the case due to poor fit. It&#x27;s a struggle to get them out to use. Won&#x27;t be using these in the future.</li>
            <li> They are almost completely smooth and won&#x27;t file anything :(</li>
            <li> I had a glass file for years and loved it.  When it finally broke after years of surviving loose in a purse, I immediately looked for a new one.  I liked the fact that they were small and had a case.  The glass is a bit thicker than my previous file, and unfortunately the file itself does not work as well as other glass files I&#x27;ve had.

            <li> This item is a pretty novelty piece that was never meant to be used as a nail file.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap and doesn&#x27;t work well. You will ruin your nails try to file a snag, forget about evening out the nail after a break or snag. Case is cheap plastic and doesn&#x27;t close right. The cap of the case keep coming off in my purse.  I couldn&#x27;t even tell you were the case is now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, even if it was at the Dollar Store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money, keep shopping.</li>
            <li> Cheaply made. I would buy these at your local Hallmark store and pay the extra money. The quality of these files are crappy. I used them twice and the coating rubbed off!</li>
            <li> Great deal and super quick shipping for the price. It costs double for just one of these in the drugstore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m please with this item. It is simple but a cute detail that made a nice gift for my friends.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews that were pretty harsh about some of these glass nail files, but I like them.

            <li> After just a few use they were both lacking.  As if the file surface wore off.  Way over priced. Fine a better product.</li>
            <li> I prefer glass files.  The small size and included carrying case make these ones perfect for storing in your desk, purse, glove box, etc so you always have a file nearby.  I have a similar one I bought three years ago.  It isn&#x27;t as rough as it was initially but I just rinse it off every few weeks and it still works fine.  I&#x27;m hoping these last as long.    Update: I placed the two files in two different locations.  The one in my car is used for emergency snags only and still works fine.  The one I tried to use regularly lost all its grit within just a few weeks.  The center pane of glass is perfectly smooth with just a bit of grit on the edges so pretty much useless.  I love the little case so will keep it and try to find a quality glass file to store in it.  Overall price for the product was great but willing to pay twice as much for better quality!</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; came off after only a few uses and I could not see any of the fabulous results as described.</li>
            <li> Great file and the case is so pretty and convenient.  The case keeps the file from ruining my reading or sunglasses.</li>
            <li> The case never did catch to stay shut, then immediately fell apart. The file itself so far is adequate for carrying in my purse and not poking holes like the metal files do.</li>
            <li> Nice items. They work well</li>
            <li> Small and very convenient.  I bought 6, 1 for my car, 1 for my husbands care, 1 for my husband, a for myself and last but notleat 1 for my girlfriend with 1 spare.  I love these much better than an emery board.</li>
            <li> Nice little glass nail file.  The case is cute.  The nail file works.  I did have to re-glue the case connector, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> They are a lot smaller then what I thought they were going to be. I used and while it did file it didn&#x27;t seam to be as quick as another kind I tried. For the price what can you expect. I will say though they were super cute lol.</li>
            <li> very pretty, just the right size,quick delivery.  I use only crystal files on my fragile  nails.</li>
            <li> I DONT KNOW WHY BUT I THOUGHT THESE WOULD BE BIGGER. THEY ARE CUTE AND THEY FUNCTION FINE BUT JUST SMALL.</li>
            <li> I bought these as a Christmas gift.  First of all I ordered them in October and I almost did not get them by Christmas.  Secondly, one of the recipiants of this gift just showed me that the coating is coming off and its plastic underneath so its not genuine crystal.  I will never buy this again!</li>
            <li> A great idea, unfortunately after a few uses the grit, which is just glued to the glass blade shape, rubs off and you&#x27;re left with a smooth surface.  Nice try, back to the drawing board.</li>
