            <li>Brut has been my favorite fragrance for 23 years.</li>
            <li>Original Brut, authentic smell.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>problem is that the huge bottle does not some with a sprayer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>HUGE bottles.  </li>
            <li>The bottle is huge.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge.  </li>
            <li>Huge bottle that I get my dad once a year...</li>
            <li>It has a classic fragrance, which brings back many great memories, and you cant beat the delivery and price.</li>
            <li>An oldie but a goodie--tried and true.</li>
            <li>This one is close enough to still be good.  </li>
            <li>I tried Pinaud Clubman, Aqua Velva, Old Spice, Kaloderma, Canoe and others but Brut stays simply the best after shave widely available at reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The large size almost looked like a gag gift for my husband, Smells great and the chuckles were an extra bonus.</li>

            <li>Good price for such a large bottle.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making it available</li>
            <li>Certainly better than Axe, Old Spice and Nivea</li>
            <li>Sadly most of my old favorites have been reformulated.  </li>
            <li>I laugh every time I look at it.</li>

            <li> I received what I ordered - it arrived undamaged.</li>
            <li> Very good ! I like the smell very nice.</li>
            <li> I showed this bottle to by friend and he flipped!  Last a long time!</li>
            <li> I LOVE FABERGE BRUT COLOGNE SPLASH IT BRING BACK THE OLD DAYS, THIS IS NICE TO USE WHEN YOU TAKE A SHOWER AND YOU SPLASH IT ON FOR A NICE SMELL.</li>
            <li> Always looking for minimum additives and no aluminum so choice is limited for my husband. This works great and has a great fragrance.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s favorite. Great price.</li>
            <li> This one will last youy 2 years .... I use it after a shower when I&#x27;m just ganging at the house. Might be old fashion cheap colonge...but it smells nice! An oldie but a goodie--tried and true. For REAL men! Now I just gotta find my Jade East and Hi Karate! Got the Canoe already.  Watch out ladies....you smell me coming.  LOL</li>
            <li> There is no spray option.. so you will be spilling and wasting more than you use</li>
            <li> Original Brut, authentic smell.&lt;br /&gt;Only problem is that the huge bottle does not some with a sprayer.&lt;br /&gt;You have to pour it in your hands and then it hard to control and flows all over the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An sprayer in this bottle would have made this product awesome</li>
            <li> price is save money , but too large for me</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad, we got a big laugh out of it, didn&#x27;t realize the size! We don&#x27;t even live in Texas!</li>
            <li> Brut is one of the scents that I tried in my youth but I didn&#x27;t fully appreciate it back then. Now when I am in my mid 30&#x27;s Brut become my signature aftershave. I tried Pinaud Clubman, Aqua Velva, Old Spice, Kaloderma, Canoe and others but Brut stays simply the best after shave widely available at reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Classic Men Barbershop scent that still smells modern after all these years. Certainly better than Axe, Old Spice and Nivea</li>
            <li> What a bargain...  and I get to smell like a 70&#x27;s porn star...lol</li>
            <li> I wanted to relive my youth so I purchased this item. It has a classic fragrance, which brings back many great memories, and you cant beat the delivery and price.</li>
            <li> Fast Ship Time, Item just as described.  Great seller.  Very happy with purchase</li>
            <li> Wore daily for years.  Stopped all frageranceses for years, getting back in a big way.  Sadly most of my old favorites have been reformulated.  This one is close enough to still be good.  Sure wish there was more lasting power.</li>
            <li> Brut has been my favorite fragrance for 23 years. I have been unable to find the original cologne in glass for a number of years, and it just doesn&#x27;t smell the same from plastic. It was great to have such a large bottle delivered to me in a timely manner and at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Read the ounces on this.  I thought it was a regular sized bottle.  It&#x27;s about the size of a bottle of champagne.  Good thing I like Brut on my man.  At our age we will be able to hand it down to our future great grand kids...lol.</li>
            <li> HUGE bottles.  I didn&#x27;t realize how big and then I couldn&#x27;t return them. Argghhh</li>
            <li> Awesome! The bottle is huge. This will last me a lifetime!</li>
            <li> Great product at a good price.Has the same fresh scent as the old Brut.</li>
            <li> Wow was I surprised when this arrived. The large size almost looked like a gag gift for my husband, Smells great and the chuckles were an extra bonus. Looks and smells just like the smaller bottles we usually bought locally.</li>
