            <li>so here are some more words for this review lalalalalla lallala</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>The aroma doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the store bought product.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes my skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>My face feels so clean after applying this lotion.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel cool and clean.  </li>
            <li>No matter how much you clean your face, this takes the rest of the dirt off of it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great toner for oily or normal skin- tightens the pores without being too drying and leaves your skin feeling toned and soft and ready for makeup.</li>
            <li>It is the same as the picture, and the quality is so nice.</li>
            <li>Of course, she has been using Clinique products all of our married life.</li>
            <li>have used this a long time and when I don&#x27;t, I get more breakouts.</li>
            <li>This really helps get the dirt, grime, and makeup of the day off your face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>I always love Clinique products, but being an elderly person when I used this it really dried my skin.  </li>
            <li>this seems to perform as expected but I thought it cost more than it did at my local store</li>
            <li>Helps keep wrinkles at bay, soft unmarred skin.  </li>
            <li>This claryifing lotion is an old standby.  </li>
            <li>Not harsh on my skin but still does the job.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I was happy to order the Clarifying Lotion on line, it saved me an annoying trip to the mall.  I have used this product for years and with moisturizer applied afterwards it keeps my skin in excellent shape.  Helps keep wrinkles at bay, soft unmarred skin.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> This claryifing lotion is an old standby.  It&#x27;s a great toner for oily or normal skin- tightens the pores without being too drying and leaves your skin feeling toned and soft and ready for makeup. I always return to it and it&#x27;s deep cleansing and toning effects. Excellent product.</li>

            <li> In excelent condition. delivered as expected</li>

            <li> I always love Clinique products, but being an elderly person when I used this it really dried my skin.  I will use other Clinique products but this one I wasn&#x27;t pleased with.</li>

            <li> BUEN PRODUCTO, DE ACUERDO A LO QUE ESPERABA QUE SEA, LA TALLA ADECUADO COLOR REQUERIDO, ENVIÓ RÁPIDO, SE O PUDO UBICAR CON FACILIDAD DURANTE TODO EL TRAYECTO</li>
            <li> this seems to perform as expected but I thought it cost more than it did at my local store I guess the excess was for the s/h</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Works very well.  Just like what you get at the department store and I paid way less.</li>
            <li> This is a part of Clinique&#x27;s 3 step program and I have been using it for 6 or 7 years.  Love the way it makes my skin feel clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> Good value, nice product.</li>
