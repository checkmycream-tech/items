            <li>This monthly organizer is great.</li>
            <li>It would also make a great gift for parents/or grandparents who take medications.</li>
            <li>The idea is great but the product is junk.</li>
            <li>otherwise I will understand their great annoyance.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li>I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li>Great medication organizer</li>
            <li>The monthly storage is great.  </li>
            <li>For any one who has elderly parents its great</li>
            <li>Fill it once a month, date on both sides, and the green/red concept work great.  </li>
            <li>This works great for me because I travel.</li>
            <li>Looks great and holds all the pills you would want.  </li>
            <li>I would order again although with the great quality of this, I don&#x27;t think I would ever have to.</li>
            <li>and you need to find a place for it, LOL.</li>
            <li>This works great to handle my 20-30 pills a day, and splits them into 4 time slots.</li>
            <li>This is a great concept;  </li>
            <li>and I love it!!  </li>
            <li>Very handy -- I don&#x27;t use it the way it was intended, though (knew that before I bought it).</li>
            <li>Awesome for us who take many pills throughout the day.</li>
            <li>This 31 day organizer  is the largest one I was able to find and is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li>we have two of these and this one was for my father .it was perfect for him,easy to load and easy to handle.he was 90.</li>
            <li>Things were getting very overwhelming, but not any more!!</li>
            <li>It made the dispensing of her medications very easy for all involved.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li>Everyone who has received it has loved it.  </li>
            <li>The system to help keep track of when you take them (and whether you DID take them) is good.</li>
            <li>Now, just one container, and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li>This item would be good for anyone taking a lot of medications or vitamins.  </li>
            <li>This would be good for someone who is at home a lot, but I did not opt for that since I leave home for work.  </li>
            <li>The concept is good but the execution leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li>Fairly affordable and sturdy.</li>
            <li>Design is good, but the quality is sub-par.</li>
            <li>a good thing since yep</li>
            <li>Many of the pill compartments don&#x27;t close - what good is that!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering one today for my father to add to the joy :)    </li>
            <li>However, once set up its great because you don&#x27;t have to organize your pills by the day or week any more.</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing pill scheduler.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the concept of the system</li>
            <li>The ability to prepare a month at a time is nice.</li>
            <li>Kind of a pain to fill them at the beginning of the month</li>
            <li>So nice my husband got one too.</li>
            <li>My husband and I each have our own.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and still very useful.</li>
            <li>It makes keeping track of my Dad&#x27;s medication very easy.</li>
            <li>We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this organizer!</li>
            <li>and it is the best system I have used so far.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if they could stand up to that kind of abuse, so I&#x27;d proceed with caution there until you were confident.    </li>
            <li>I love, love, love this vitamin organizer!</li>
            <li>It works just fine!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is made well and each cartridge has 4 good-sized sections with very secure snapping lids.</li>
            <li>It is made well and each cartridge has 4 good-sized sections with very secure snapping lids.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I also love that all the pills for one day are in a separate tray that can be taken with you on day trips or vacations.  </li>
            <li>More than once we have had pills spill out.  </li>
            <li>Rearrange that to a five by seven slot arrangement -- it maps better to people&#x27;s concept of a monthly calendar.</li>
            <li>Wished they had better quality control</li>
            <li>That said, there are two things that could be better:  </li>
            <li>For a younger person who does not have dexterity challenges, this is a great system!</li>
            <li>I will surely be referring them to fellow caregivers.</li>
            <li>Instead of having pill bottles scattered on counter top</li>
            <li>i can take over 40 pills in a day and they are mostly horse pills.  </li>
            <li>It helps to be able to take my pills with me when I need to and to not miss a dose.</li>
            <li>I know most people nowadays have probably never even seen a pocket watch, let alone handled one, but</li>
            <li>I take so many vitamins that I used to lose track sometimes and be wondering if I&#x27;d taken this or that supplement yet that day, or how many I&#x27;d taken.</li>
            <li>I asked disability skilled sites if they could recommend anything or buy a supply</li>
            <li>I love this organizer.  </li>
            <li>The MedCenter 31 Day Vitamin Organizer needs to be redesigned with the largest indentions towards the top--or better still make them all VERTICAL.  </li>
            <li>and this makes the unit a lot more stable and a lot easier to use.  </li>
            <li>There needs to be more quality control with this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I get most drugs in 30 day quantities, and as a result I can see at a glance when I need to refill.  </li>
            <li>The vitamin organizer compactment are more spacious.</li>
            <li>(they are really more square, but you get my meaning) and the tubes can be taken with you.  </li>
            <li>Would have preferred a more rigid thermoset type plastic even if it costs more.</li>
            <li>Would love to see more compartments and perhaps a way to customize the labels (i.e. perhaps add times to the compartments).  </li>
            <li>Overall, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this vitamin organizer.</li>
            <li>i love that you can store all your vitamins for the month, had the ds (duodenal switch)</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>What is not to love.</li>
            <li>This worked perfect for my husband&#x27;s supplement schedule daily.  </li>
            <li>I love the Green/Red system.</li>
            <li>I used to sort my meds once a week, then bought more units to sort them every 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Unlike most people I have to take around 40 pills a day.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s the point of saving foot print when the top is protruding out, it&#x27;s not like you can use that space for anything else.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great idea, but needs a lot more refining and perfecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t find a better deal then this.</li>
            <li>Love this medcenter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok because they offer a Night AND Bedtime slot.</li>
            <li>They all fit nicely inside the cubby holes with plenty of room to spare.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.  </li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t staying on top of it.  </li>
            <li>This product gives me the ability to organize once a month, and take out however many days as needed for trips, placing them in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But that does not work well on most days.  </li>
            <li>I would not recommend this pill organizer unless you are ok with hunting on the floor for spilled pills.  </li>
            <li>love this dispenser.  </li>
            <li>Pill case should have on-the-wall mounting design to save table top space.</li>
            <li>I had weight loss surgery and because of that I need to supplement with many vitamins.</li>
            <li>It is much more convenient to do that and be done for a while.</li>
            <li>but I like the design of the Monthly Pill&lt;br /&gt;Holder much better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a great item that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>My meds management is a struggle and I am able to do two weeks or a month at a time easily.  </li>
            <li>There is plenty of room inside each slot for easy storage, so you get the most bang for your buck.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li>The compartments are absolutely huge and I love this company and their products.</li>
            <li>and so far, it has been great.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, my dad is able to use this technique.  </li>
            <li>This is a huge pain to fill up, but once its filled, I am good for a month, so its worth the pain.</li>
            <li>Night \\&quot;Bedtime\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Which is great because most multivitamins or supplements in general require you to take them about 3 times during the day.</li>
            <li>Most of the compartments don&#x27;t close and secure that well.</li>
            <li>Also, if you have to take meds at different times of teh day, this is ideal.</li>
            <li>I have struggled (valiantly) for years with special needs rescued DOGS!</li>
            <li>This box easily accommodates them all.  </li>
            <li>PLUS I can easily see what I have taken and what I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>If you need someone to sort your meds this makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>so each compartment is easily reachable.  </li>
            <li>Its easy to stay on track both for the day, and the allotment for the time of day.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Not something easy for the elderly to have to work with.   </li>
            <li>It is really easy to take one with you and</li>
            <li>but once you get the nack it is fairly easy.  </li>
            <li>like this design because it makes it easy to stash in my purse for the day and easy for travel.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Everything works fine</li>
            <li>The compartments were fine if I just wanted to use it for my medications, but it does not come close to holding my vitamins.</li>
            <li>fine</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll love how quickly the task goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the morning I just take that days container with me in my purse and am able to take my supplements at the adequate time.</li>
            <li>The boxes are on a stand that holds them aloft so they&#x27;re easily seen and accessible</li>
            <li>These are great - large enough to hold all my pills, and it&#x27;s WONDERFUL only needing to fill cases once a month.  </li>
            <li>Which is a huge inconvenience.</li>
            <li>they all still fit.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i bought one of the x-large daily pill holders to go along and the combination is great.  </li>
            <li>I take a LOT of vitamins &amp; supplements, and they all fit.</li>
            <li>Having a whole month of drugs laid out at once is amazingly convenient.  </li>
            <li>All my pills fit in the separate compartments</li>
            <li>This is a great tool to use especially for the elderly.  </li>
            <li>I thought this was a great idea as I take several vitamins and suppliments (a couple of medications also).</li>
            <li>This organizer is filled once a month</li>
            <li>the pill boxes close securely and I&#x27;ve had no problem with pills falling out.  </li>
            <li>There are four compartments, and I can comfortably fit four supplements in each.</li>
            <li>This item is great for those who take the same pills day after day.  </li>
            <li>i like being able to put a months worth of medicine in at once.</li>
            <li>The containers fit snugly into the slots (though, not overly so, they&#x27;re just well-fitting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>On the contrary, I love being able to keep all my pills organized for the whole month.  </li>
            <li>If the manufacturer had added one more row to the bottom and made seven columns with the days of the week across the top, like a write-on calendar, it would have been so much easier to use.</li>
            <li>It would also be good for someone with memory issues (e.g. an older person living at home) or someone with vision issues because someone else can load up the whole box for the month and then the user can just take the tube out for the day and take the meds appropriately.  </li>
            <li>Also, I selected this vitamin size container as I have a very large quantity of pills to take, many of them in elongated shapes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t want to buy a whole new system, so it would be great if we could get one-day-only cartridge replacements.  </li>
            <li>I have been telling my husband how I wished they made one of these, so I was so excited when I saw this one.</li>
            <li>But otherwise I am happy so long as the units do not lose their ability to latch.  </li>
            <li>[ As an aside, for people who take lots of pills many times per day, as I once did the first year after an organ transplant, you might want to look at crafting bead jars.</li>
            <li>Each slot can hold a great many vitamins, and I&#x27;m not talking just little pills.</li>
            <li>The basic idea is great, however the design flaws keep the product from being useful.  </li>
            <li>This is a near perfect pill organizer and fits all my needs of organizing the 20+ pills I take daily.</li>
            <li>I suppose if you don&#x27;t want to take a container with you when you are going anywhere, and these will sit calmly on your counter, then they are fine.  </li>
            <li>Could certainly be made better.</li>
            <li>Might as well make it stable by making the foot print as large as the top.</li>
            <li>This a a good product for keeping medication seperated, especially if you take many pills or large pills.  </li>
            <li>Still, I am super pleased with the product and the positive difference it has made in my routine.</li>
            <li>Once a month I sort my meds and don&#x27;t have to sort through dozens of bottles to fine the right ones.  </li>
            <li>My Dad started having some mental status changes which were obviously a great concern to my siblings and me.</li>
            <li>Anyway, in the end, after discussing the matter with my partner we agreed to buy it - fortunately my family help prepare my month&#x27;s worth of medication</li>
            <li>It would be good for a younger person with, say, a transplant because the medications can be loaded into the &#x27;tubes&#x27;</li>
            <li>: The monthly refill goes much faster if you take out all the containers and group them side by side on your table top.  </li>
            <li>It is wonderful to be able to go an entire month and not really have to think about what supplements I have already taken  and am I doubling up?</li>
            <li>did I take my Meds or not because I can see if the pill container is full or not.</li>
            <li>This product does a good job with its basic needs.</li>
            <li>Ok I really like how this product organized my vitamins.  </li>
            <li>far, I&#x27;m loving this MedCenter, though.</li>
            <li>The compartments are nice and big and can hold his pills just fine.</li>
            <li>That way, I know that particular dog doesn&#x27;t require any more meds today.</li>
            <li>that particular day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pill boxes themselves are more than adequate size in width, height, and depth.  </li>
            <li>Since I take pills four times daily and a liquid twice daily, this is just perfect.  </li>
            <li>Filling 28 sections accurately for all 7 dogs took me exactly 4 minutes</li>
            <li>I use to take my multivitamin gummy and fiber gummy in the morning with my first set of meds, BUT they dont all fit in the Morning slot.</li>
            <li>i take a lot of supplements and this is the first container that all of them fit and keep organized.</li>
            <li>I was hoping this new sorter was it, and it could be if the company has better quality control.</li>
            <li>It was an ok product but very top heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li>I searched the internet to find something that would work for me &amp; the MEDCENTER MONTHLY VITAMIN ORGANIZER is the exact thing I have been searching for!</li>
            <li>Most were the Evening compartment door that open to easily.</li>
            <li>Makes it easy to see what day you are on and the red and green sides are great!  </li>
            <li>Another option available for this med box is a large clock with timer.  </li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s worth every inch of the space.  </li>
            <li>And man is it worth it, when you don&#x27;t have to think about it for the rest of the month.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money both for convenience and longevity of the product.  </li>
            <li>It would be more complete system if the one-day pill holder was included.</li>
            <li>Its nice to fill it and forget it until a month later.</li>
            <li>There is no lock so this wouldn&#x27;t be good for a person at-risk for over dose; but it&#x27;s great for a person who just needs help keeping the medications straight or has trouble getting in and out of multiple pill containers.  </li>
            <li>so I wonder if vitamins will degrade since you are supposed to load 30 days worth at a time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loading about two weeks worth since it takes a while</li>
            <li>We received it in expected time and it was in good shape.</li>
            <li>I love filling up so far in advance.</li>
            <li>This \\&quot;vitamin organizer\\&quot; is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>It is so much easier to fill all or most of the containers once every three or four weeks rather than once a week, and it doesn&#x27;t take much longer to do so.</li>
            <li>Overall its nice to have supplements organized this way.</li>
            <li>but it is definitely worth both the time and the money.</li>
            <li>But I quickly figured out that all you need to do is place both thumbs on the edge of the lid and very gently push in, when both opening and closing.</li>
            <li>This is not a wear-and-tear issue, since one of trays did it out of the box and others quickly started having problems within the first month.</li>
            <li>It is easy to open, easy to use and eliminates have to fill pill boxes every week.</li>
            <li>The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is that the pill containers don&#x27;t seal easily, and the colors/dates are easily rubbed off.</li>
            <li>other wise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of high quality materials, and is good looking enough to leave out on the pass-through counter between the kitchen and dining room.  </li>
            <li>I ordered it right away</li>
            <li>AT THE RIGHT TIMES EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li>right now).&lt;br</li>
            <li>I returned it almost right away.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true many of the 31 boxes were extremely tight, but I learned right away to press in on the top of lid first</li>
            <li>3/2/10 - Liked this so much for the dogs that I recently purchased a second one for my own use.</li>
            <li>- Liked this so much for the dogs that I recently purchased a second one for my own use.</li>
            <li>He has been doing great on the new system and his mental staus has returned to</li>
            <li>It is a very large product.</li>
            <li>I think the system is a great idea but the size of the compartments are too small.</li>
            <li>I would fork out a little more and get something better, or not buy at all and save yourself some money</li>
            <li>It is little tricky learning the best way to open</li>
            <li>Yeah, right at first I struggled with the lids too.</li>
            <li>seller was super fast with her delivery.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with it and definitely recommend it to anyone trying to keep control of lots (and lots) of pills and vitamins on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>This sits on the bathroom counter easily, takes up minimal space, easily releases each day&#x27;s container and is just the handiest gizmo ever.</li>
            <li>This sits on the bathroom counter easily, takes up minimal space, easily releases each day&#x27;s container and is just the handiest gizmo ever.</li>
            <li>It is very sturdy!</li>
            <li>Love it; except the covers sometimes sneak open and the pills sneak out</li>
            <li>Overall, I think the concept and setup is ingenious.</li>
            <li>Most have only 1 inch x 1-1/2 inch sized boxes.</li>
            <li>Pretty costly as it</li>
            <li>it does help that i can space them out more evenly so that i&#x27;m taking the same number of pills at each</li>
            <li>anyway that&#x27;s exactly what it reminds me of.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>You will probably be thinking surely there must be something in the UK similar</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing one for my elderly father... :)</li>
            <li>This product was exactly what I need since I take mediations 4 times a day.</li>
            <li>I like that it has a whole month&#x27;s worth of doses.  </li>
            <li>Exactly as described</li>
            <li>I can instantly see how many days I have to purchase products</li>
            <li>This monthly organizer really helps keep me on track!</li>
            <li>The only suggestion would be to have better quality control on the lids and boxes.  </li>
            <li>Its enough space for my many vitamins and meds.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my mom and dad since the are taking more vitamins ad regular pills.  </li>
            <li>so they are aware of what the have taken and not.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this medication organizer for my husband who takes several prescription medications as well as many over-the-counter supplements.</li>
            <li>I used these the first year:</li>
            <li>If you take a lot of supplements, especially large pills like fatty acid softgels, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li>The individual containers dont always fit securely into the main stand...</li>
            <li>I take 2 multivitamin gummies and 2 fiber gummies that are pretty large, on top of all my regular pills.</li>
            <li>I am very thankful we were able to solve a major problem with such an easy fix.</li>
            <li>can not find a large weekly pill sorter where you can remove each day&#x27;s pills as needed, to replace our old ones we got for free at a seminar years ago.  </li>
            <li>I find the red/green color coding handy as it is a quick visual reminder if I have not taken my daily meds.</li>
            <li>/&gt;it is very top heavy</li>
            <li>This item is pretty much as advertised.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a real relief to plan far ahead with such a nice organizer.      </li>
            <li>Once I started using this, I could fit both my meds and my supplements in the same container and only having to fill it once a month has made things so much better.  </li>
            <li>So this is not user friendly for people that arn&#x27;t very strong or are simply impatient like me and don&#x27;t feel like battling with a plastic latch.&lt;br /&gt;The pill slots are a normal size and don&#x27;t fit many larger pills or gummy type vitamins in the one slot, you would have to utilize a different slot.</li>
            <li>of the lids do come open easily</li>
            <li>Once I loaded up the initial set of meds, the boxes opened easily as I went to remove them.  </li>
            <li>Just in case anyone needs to know exactly how big the box filled measures for placement in a counter or on a shelf, at its max points</li>
            <li>It is supper easy for me to organize for him and he only has to remember to take the day he needs out of the system.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to keep track of the medication I&#x27;ve taken for the day by turning the pill box over to display a different color.</li>
            <li>It took me 25 minutes to set up the months supply, which is about 20 capsules per day, and now it takes seconds to open and swallow what I need - no fuss, no reluctance, just an easy way to take my vitamins.  </li>
            <li>Some of the doors open to easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s LARGE.  </li>
            <li>This is a fairly large, well-made container, holding four doses of pills per day for thirty-one days.</li>
            <li>We like the large compartments.</li>
            <li>so i know for sure that is where the loose pills came from.</li>
            <li>I was looking for an easy, convenient way to organize the many vitamins that I take daily and was told about the Med Center by a friend.  </li>
            <li>; to the main stand (heat glue is where they used a hot knife like item to get the plastics to melt together).  </li>
            <li>Recommend this product and seller very highly.</li>
            <li>the bottom of the box is now pushed up against the wall and makes a handy little shelf for me to put my inhalers and the cat&#x27;s meds</li>
            <li>There was an error in the shipment and they fix the problem right away, very professional and fast service.  </li>
            <li>It has large compartments enough tot fit 7 plus pills in a meal.</li>
            <li>The compartments of each box are huge allowing enough space for each section to hold multiples of large multi-vitamin sized pills.  </li>
            <li>The daily trays fit neatly into the tower and it doesn&#x27;t take much space on the counter.</li>
            <li>The red/green box ends keep me secure that I actually took the whole day&#x27;s allotment, too, and didn&#x27;t forget the evening or afternoon selection.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You only have to replace the meds inside of them once a month, which is a huge time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I saw this behemoth of a pillbox, I was curious and had to explore it more and read about it.  </li>
            <li>this thing works very well and it makes it much easier to remember whether i&#x27;ve taken my meds or not.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li>so i can don&#x27;t have to wait to the very end of the day to refill the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is so much easier for my mother to take all of her meds at the correct time.</li>
            <li>This pill organizer allows the whole month to be in one casing.</li>
            <li>Found this medication organizer very helpful for my elderly mother.  </li>
            <li>I bought the vitamin one instead of the med one because the compartments are larger, so all my meds fit into one compartment.  </li>
            <li>some compartments are more securely closed than others.</li>
            <li>Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li>Setting up pills and supplements for a month at a time is very convenient and a time-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint</li>
            <li>This product has really helped me organize my med/vitamin regimen.</li>
            <li>Should have gotten this for myself much sooner than I</li>
            <li>Should have gotten this for myself much sooner than I did.</li>
            <li>Very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I really like it for my father.</li>
            <li>So much easier to organize all the prescriptions and vitamin/supplements.</li>
            <li>a well designed product - very helpful for remembering meds.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH EASIER A MONTH AT A TIME.</li>
            <li>READY</li>
            <li>I take a lot of Meds every month and this makes my life so much easier, it eliminates the question of</li>
            <li>It so much easier than having all those pill bottles around.</li>
            <li>That is where it really benefited me.  </li>
            <li>Thus far the product is well worth its&#x27; price.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this system!</li>
            <li>I have had this for a while now and really like it.  </li>
            <li>Yes - it does have some issues with the opening and closing of the sections, but not so much that it has made into a raving lunatic.  </li>
            <li>Some work could be done on making them all stay closed better though.  </li>
            <li>His smaller pill case needed to be replaced and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Now, I fill all the individual containers for 25-31 days (depending on how many complete &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; of each one I have.</li>
            <li>Instead of using one 4-slot thing for 1 day, I use it for 4 days, which means I only need to refill only every 4 months -- handy.</li>
            <li>Having the ability to keep track of multiple medications/vitamins for a month&#x27;s span comes in very useful.</li>
            <li>I had an issue when my older, one week pill case was too small to fit all my calcium pills - what a pain!!  </li>
            <li>: Sometimes the lids can either be to loose or to strong.</li>
            <li>I have found this product meets my medication organizing needs very well, much better than previous types of medication organizers.   </li>
            <li>It also allowed me to set up the full month without having to search for all the individual containers</li>
            <li>If you can get all your meds refilled on the same day, then it really isawesome to do the whole month (plus, you can tell right off if you refill is over/short).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already recommended this to family members, who were interested to witness such an easy way to organize a month&#x27;s vitamins in such a compact unit.  </li>
            <li>The red and green ends are good</li>
            <li>My vote would be just to get others that are better quality though than mess with it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to all my spoonie friends or anyone else who takes a lot of medication or supplements.</li>
            <li>/&gt;to be that the plastic sides of the containers are&lt;br /&gt;relatively soft and since they are large, the walls&lt;br /&gt;tend</li>
            <li>Having the green on one end to indicate the column is full and red on the other end to indicate the column is empty is a great idea!  </li>
            <li>The footprint is pretty significant but it still takes up a lot less space than all the pill bottles would.  </li>
            <li>This is a HUGE time and mental health saver.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks now, and every day when I put back an empty container and get out the next day&#x27;s full container, I say to myself, \\&quot;I LOVE this thing!\\&quot;     </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s normal state.  </li>
            <li>This wouldn&#x27;t normally be a problem, but the piece of plastic they use, is bowed out and appears to be hastily &amp;#34;heat glued&amp;#34</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the compartments easily pop open on their own.</li>
            <li>It does take up a large amount of space on whatever surface you plan to set it on, but if you&#x27;re concerned about the possibility of missing an important medication, I highly recommend this organizer.</li>
            <li>Several containers had cracked lids right out of the box.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d love to hear from other buyers about its longevity - because if they don&#x27;t I really CANNOT afford to post it back or to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Other than that minor inconvenience, it really is a nice solution.</li>
            <li>Again, this is only if you take A LOT of pills or if your pills are very LARGE.</li>
            <li>Moreover, the ingenuity behind its design is worth rewarding by purchasing it, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Mine however came with to holders for the second of the month and none for first day, but easiy corrected with a label make.</li>
            <li>I think it would be helpful to give the exact inside measurement of each compartment so the buyer can determine weather it will meet their individual needs.</li>
            <li>The slant makes it easier for me to see the dogs&#x27; names I taped on the very top (for those days when I&#x27;m so tired</li>
            <li>The slant makes it easier for me to see the dogs&#x27; names I taped on the very top (for those days when I&#x27;m so tired</li>
            <li>The only thing is the original setup of the daily pills.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>x 12&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34;) would be much larger.</li>
            <li>It is big and bulky and exactly the size it should be to get the job</li>
            <li>When fully loaded, as in the image above, larger fingers may find it just a tad challenging to get to the inner day containers.</li>
            <li>Which makes a lot of sense, because that will keep the plastic from wearing down (which would eventually cause a not-so-tight fit).</li>
            <li>There is a bigger version of this organizer that the company offers, but it&#x27;s another $10-20 and after reading the reviews was not willing to pay even more for a product that needs some</li>
            <li>Good concept, but individual pill box lids was hard to open for older persons.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that with a little pressure on the side of the container the snaps work just fine.</li>
            <li>The boxes on this do not stay closed very well and we were constantly having to redo them since we travel with the full set of boxes on road trips.</li>
            <li>I recommend if you need to take numerous pills at once that a shot glass really helps to get them down smoothly.</li>
            <li>And, this one is big enough to fit all my daily vitamins and supplements that I normally take.  </li>
            <li>The containers are large enough to accommodate both.  </li>
            <li>And I can see from clear across the room whether or not I&#x27;ve taken my pills for the day.  </li>
            <li>-I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t have any mobility problems, but I can see how an elderly customer, or a customer with hand mobility issues, would have some issues opening and shutting the compartments.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (the pillbox is ready) and red means \\&quot;empty\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>i got this after much research since i take a rather extensive combination of vitamins, supplements, and prescription pills a day</li>
            <li>This has been very helpful with my Mom&#x27;s pills on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife and she really enjoys putting out her medicines only once every month!</li>
            <li>The whole setup is also totally stable, so no fear of knocking it over and spilling pill containers everywhere.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 88 year old father.</li>
            <li>Those that don&#x27;t close well can be partially remedied by pressing outside wall of the offending compartment and creating more resistance on the hinged cap for that individual compartment.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s getting the job done.</li>
            <li>I really could use larger storage capacity in the units.  </li>
            <li>We purchased this for our 83 year old mother.  </li>
            <li>Withouth this medication sorter, my life would be complete chaos.  </li>
            <li>I realize I won&#x27;t have 7 dogs forever, and some may require more than one cartridge at some time, but I still have an empty \\&quot;rabbit hole\\&quot; for the extra cartridges I removed at the end of each row that would handle this extra.</li>
            <li>I realize I won&#x27;t have 7 dogs forever, and some may require more than one cartridge at some time, but I still have an empty \\&quot;rabbit hole\\&quot; for the extra cartridges I removed at the end of each row that would handle this extra.</li>
            <li>It worked for my 87 year old father quite well.</li>
            <li>Given that considerable force has to be exerted to close the lids, I suspect that eventually the lids will have pieces breaking off along the cracks.</li>
            <li>and they are already ready to go when I get in to my hotel.&lt;br /&gt;Saves time for me taking all my pills out each day of their prescription bottles, because I spend 20min at the beginning of the month filling the entire organizer, so I can grab and</li>
            <li>The pill container is really the only thing on the market that allows you to do a month at a time (there is another option with a alarm clock).</li>
            <li>Finally, a monthly vitamin/medication system that really works.  </li>
            <li>They snap open and closed mostly without any extra effort.</li>
            <li>It offers 4 compartments per day for supplements, vitamins or prescriptions.  </li>
            <li>There are a few minor notes to be aware of, though not enough to take off a start for (more of just a heads-up):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li>of the individual boxes are much more&lt;</li>
            <li>This unit holds more than 23 pills and allows you to keep track of days used by turning the containers to reveal red or green backgrounds under the number of days.</li>
            <li>The red and green facings are also nice and simple touch.    </li>
            <li>: So, most of the cases were not closing all the way anymore, and I have been forced to tape them shut.</li>
            <li>If you are like me and hate filling your pill packs weekly, then this is perfect!!  </li>
            <li>If you hate getting out bottles of pills each day or week, this is the best solution.</li>
            <li>Make one of the colors intense and the other color pale - that would work better.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the exorbitant ultimate cost I would like to say to all you American customers that you are lucky to buy such a useful and helpfulitem at such a low cost.</li>
            <li>The product is a good idea, but the quality of the doors are very poor.</li>
            <li>At first the compartments looked like they&#x27;d be too small, but I was pleasantly surprised that they&#x27;re roomier than they first appear.     </li>
            <li>No mess at all.</li>
            <li>No mess at all.</li>
            <li>Other lids are really right and need considerable effort to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>larger than most with four separate daily compartments -- top tabs are a little tight and tough to shut on some - but overall quality good and about what I expected.  </li>
            <li>Just in case anyone needs to know exactly how big the tubes are for carrying with them in a purse or something, the individual tubes measure at their max points</li>
            <li>I was quite sure that this medications holder would be too small  for ALL of our daily pills and supplements.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine an older person having to open these.</li>
            <li>I searched high and low</li>
            <li>Highly recommended to those who have several pills to take throughout the day.</li>
            <li>Easy to open and close for even shaky hands and very sturdy.</li>
            <li>and there are actually no better ones made that fit my ideological description.</li>
            <li>My guess is that these cracks appeared in the factory when the lids were being closed for the first time in the assembly lines for packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the price, I would have expected a little better finish.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 32 and the doctor&#x27;s keep adding on new diagnosis and prescriptions.</li>
            <li>I take multiple medications, and it takes quite awhile to fill all of the pill boxes, but it&#x27;s well worth the time spent.</li>
            <li>Since the trays are stored on their sides, this is a major drawback to this product.</li>
            <li>The MedCenter keeps You on track in a way no other device can.</li>
            <li>, now i fill all the boxes and i am good for the month, or when a week is up i refill before i am totally out, i would give it 5 stars but sometimes the lids pop open and some are very tight, for the price the little carry case should come with the organizer instead of buying it seperate</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to tell from the pic, but once filled, this topples easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hubby has multiple medical problems and has to take a large number of pills each day at different times.  </li>
            <li>explanation may sound a bit confusing, but I tried a number of ways and this worked for me without writing on the cartridges, etc.</li>
            <li>My explanation may sound a bit confusing, but I tried a number of ways and this worked for me without writing on the cartridges, etc.</li>
            <li>so when i&#x27;m loading up for a month, i just transfer the last day&#x27;s pills to the clear cartridge</li>
            <li>I like the vitamin bin organizer and the boxes just barely hold each of my day&#x27;s supply of vitamins.</li>
            <li>Frequently, the compartments come open and all the pills fall out when you are getting pills out for another time of day.  </li>
            <li>I chose the vitamin organize due to the large compartments.</li>
            <li>Took me less than 10 minutes to fill up a month&#x27;s worth of &#x27;meds&#x27; once I got this second unit.</li>
            <li>Took me less than 10 minutes to fill up a month&#x27;s worth of &#x27;meds&#x27; once I got this second unit.</li>
            <li>I am so annoyed about the huge cost and even more annoyed when the box arrived saying \\&quot;Made in Vietnam\\&quot;, I may research the production company and ask them to consider a cost and offer me a posting charge as I really need the box to have a long life</li>
            <li>I recently purchased 2 (one for my wife) of the Med Center Monthly Vitamin Organizer with large pill boxes.  </li>
            <li>The container for each day is shorter than other organizers I have used, however they are much deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>If you have any problems with your hands, you will not be able to use this unit because you have to press so hard on some of the containers just to get them to open, that occasionally the pills go flying across the room when the container finally decides to open.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for the reviews that complain about the occasional container lid that doesn&#x27;t close properly, here&#x27;s how I fixed the two problem lids on my organizer.  </li>
            <li>Still, if they were larger, the whole thing (roughly 12&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Most of the compartments are very hard to open, and some just pop open by themselves when you are getting an adjacent day&#x27;s pill container from the rack.  </li>
            <li>In the other, the&lt;br /&gt;holder is upright and the individual containers&lt;br /&gt;slide into straight up boxes.</li>
            <li>Had I not already spent so much time placing 31 days of pills in my 31 Day Vitamin Organizer, I definitely would have sent it back.  </li>
            <li>i have no excuse not to take my vits</li>
            <li>Green means filled, pills not yet taken, and red means empty, already taken for</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as I haven&#x27;t found any other with large enough daily strips to hold all my supplements.</li>
            <li>Some I had to almost force closed, but I think that is because it is new.</li>
            <li>Some I had to almost force closed, but I think that is because it is new.</li>
            <li>The containers can be stiff at first.</li>
            <li>I proceed through the day, when a particular dog&#x27;s cartridge is empty, I place it back in its rabbit hole with the red side showing.</li>
            <li>The only major drawback of it is that each of the individual containers for each day is segmented into 4 different compartments (Morning, afternoon, evening, night).</li>
            <li>We had an issue with a few of the individual lids that fit either too loosely or could barely get them closed with all my might.</li>
            <li>http://www.amazon.com/Storage-Stackable-Containers-Crafts-Findings/dp/B001AS6OLK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1415659765&amp;sr&#x3D;8-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;craft+bead+jars , and just connected the 10-15 jars I needed for each day and marked them with a dry erase pen--again, this is just an fyi for anyone who&#x27;s going through the same thing</li>
            <li>It is a little large but the size is necessary for people with multiple daily medications and multiple times when they have to take them.  </li>
            <li>I actually hate filling this little baby, but it&#x27;s the one the facility likes best</li>

            <li> This monthly organizer is great.</li>
            <li> It would also make a great gift for parents/or grandparents who take medications.</li>

            <li> I am so happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> Great medication organizer</li>
            <li> The monthly storage is great.  </li>
            <li> For any one who has elderly parents its great</li>
            <li> Fill it once a month, date on both sides, and the green/red concept work great.  </li>
            <li> This works great for me because I travel.</li>
            <li> Looks great and holds all the pills you would want.  </li>
            <li> I would order again although with the great quality of this, I don&#x27;t think I would ever have to.</li>
            <li> and you need to find a place for it, LOL.</li>
            <li> This works great to handle my 20-30 pills a day, and splits them into 4 time slots.</li>
            <li> This is a great concept;  </li>
            <li> and I love it!!  </li>
            <li> Very handy -- I don&#x27;t use it the way it was intended, though (knew that before I bought it).</li>
            <li> Awesome for us who take many pills throughout the day.</li>
            <li> This 31 day organizer  is the largest one I was able to find and is perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> we have two of these and this one was for my father .it was perfect for him,easy to load and easy to handle.he was 90.</li>
            <li> Things were getting very overwhelming, but not any more!!</li>
            <li> It made the dispensing of her medications very easy for all involved.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> Everyone who has received it has loved it.  </li>
            <li> The system to help keep track of when you take them (and whether you DID take them) is good.</li>
            <li> Now, just one container, and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li> This item would be good for anyone taking a lot of medications or vitamins.  </li>
            <li> This would be good for someone who is at home a lot, but I did not opt for that since I leave home for work.  </li>
            <li> The concept is good but the execution leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> Fairly affordable and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Design is good, but the quality is sub-par.</li>
            <li> a good thing since yep</li>
            <li> Many of the pill compartments don&#x27;t close - what good is that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering one today for my father to add to the joy :)    </li>
            <li> However, once set up its great because you don&#x27;t have to organize your pills by the day or week any more.</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing pill scheduler.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the concept of the system</li>
            <li> The ability to prepare a month at a time is nice.</li>
            <li> Kind of a pain to fill them at the beginning of the month</li>
            <li> So nice my husband got one too.</li>
            <li> My husband and I each have our own.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and still very useful.</li>
            <li> It makes keeping track of my Dad&#x27;s medication very easy.</li>
            <li> We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this organizer!</li>
            <li> and it is the best system I have used so far.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know if they could stand up to that kind of abuse, so I&#x27;d proceed with caution there until you were confident.    </li>
            <li> I love, love, love this vitamin organizer!</li>
            <li> It works just fine!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is made well and each cartridge has 4 good-sized sections with very secure snapping lids.</li>
            <li> It is made well and each cartridge has 4 good-sized sections with very secure snapping lids.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I also love that all the pills for one day are in a separate tray that can be taken with you on day trips or vacations.  </li>
            <li> More than once we have had pills spill out.  </li>
            <li> Rearrange that to a five by seven slot arrangement -- it maps better to people&#x27;s concept of a monthly calendar.</li>
            <li> Wished they had better quality control</li>
            <li> That said, there are two things that could be better:  </li>
            <li> For a younger person who does not have dexterity challenges, this is a great system!</li>
            <li> I will surely be referring them to fellow caregivers.</li>
            <li> Instead of having pill bottles scattered on counter top</li>
            <li> i can take over 40 pills in a day and they are mostly horse pills.  </li>
            <li> It helps to be able to take my pills with me when I need to and to not miss a dose.</li>
            <li> I know most people nowadays have probably never even seen a pocket watch, let alone handled one, but</li>
            <li> I take so many vitamins that I used to lose track sometimes and be wondering if I&#x27;d taken this or that supplement yet that day, or how many I&#x27;d taken.</li>
            <li> I asked disability skilled sites if they could recommend anything or buy a supply</li>
            <li> I love this organizer.  </li>
            <li> The MedCenter 31 Day Vitamin Organizer needs to be redesigned with the largest indentions towards the top--or better still make them all VERTICAL.  </li>
            <li> and this makes the unit a lot more stable and a lot easier to use.  </li>
            <li> There needs to be more quality control with this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I get most drugs in 30 day quantities, and as a result I can see at a glance when I need to refill.  </li>
            <li> The vitamin organizer compactment are more spacious.</li>
            <li> (they are really more square, but you get my meaning) and the tubes can be taken with you.  </li>
            <li> Would have preferred a more rigid thermoset type plastic even if it costs more.</li>
            <li> Would love to see more compartments and perhaps a way to customize the labels (i.e. perhaps add times to the compartments).  </li>
            <li> Overall, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin organizer.</li>
            <li> i love that you can store all your vitamins for the month, had the ds (duodenal switch)</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> What is not to love.</li>
            <li> This worked perfect for my husband&#x27;s supplement schedule daily.  </li>
            <li> I love the Green/Red system.</li>
            <li> I used to sort my meds once a week, then bought more units to sort them every 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Unlike most people I have to take around 40 pills a day.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s the point of saving foot print when the top is protruding out, it&#x27;s not like you can use that space for anything else.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great idea, but needs a lot more refining and perfecting.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t find a better deal then this.</li>
            <li> Love this medcenter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok because they offer a Night AND Bedtime slot.</li>
            <li> They all fit nicely inside the cubby holes with plenty of room to spare.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.  </li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t staying on top of it.  </li>
            <li> This product gives me the ability to organize once a month, and take out however many days as needed for trips, placing them in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But that does not work well on most days.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend this pill organizer unless you are ok with hunting on the floor for spilled pills.  </li>
            <li> love this dispenser.  </li>
            <li> Pill case should have on-the-wall mounting design to save table top space.</li>
            <li> I had weight loss surgery and because of that I need to supplement with many vitamins.</li>
            <li> It is much more convenient to do that and be done for a while.</li>
            <li> but I like the design of the Monthly Pill&lt;br /&gt;Holder much better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a great item that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My meds management is a struggle and I am able to do two weeks or a month at a time easily.  </li>
            <li> There is plenty of room inside each slot for easy storage, so you get the most bang for your buck.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li> The compartments are absolutely huge and I love this company and their products.</li>
            <li> and so far, it has been great.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, my dad is able to use this technique.  </li>
            <li> This is a huge pain to fill up, but once its filled, I am good for a month, so its worth the pain.</li>
            <li> Night \\&quot;Bedtime\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Which is great because most multivitamins or supplements in general require you to take them about 3 times during the day.</li>
            <li> Most of the compartments don&#x27;t close and secure that well.</li>
            <li> Also, if you have to take meds at different times of teh day, this is ideal.</li>
            <li> I have struggled (valiantly) for years with special needs rescued DOGS!</li>
            <li> This box easily accommodates them all.  </li>
            <li> PLUS I can easily see what I have taken and what I haven&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> If you need someone to sort your meds this makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> so each compartment is easily reachable.  </li>
            <li> Its easy to stay on track both for the day, and the allotment for the time of day.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Not something easy for the elderly to have to work with.   </li>
            <li> It is really easy to take one with you and</li>
            <li> but once you get the nack it is fairly easy.  </li>
            <li> like this design because it makes it easy to stash in my purse for the day and easy for travel.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Everything works fine</li>
            <li> The compartments were fine if I just wanted to use it for my medications, but it does not come close to holding my vitamins.</li>
            <li> fine</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll love how quickly the task goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the morning I just take that days container with me in my purse and am able to take my supplements at the adequate time.</li>
            <li> The boxes are on a stand that holds them aloft so they&#x27;re easily seen and accessible</li>
            <li> These are great - large enough to hold all my pills, and it&#x27;s WONDERFUL only needing to fill cases once a month.  </li>
            <li> Which is a huge inconvenience.</li>
            <li> they all still fit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i bought one of the x-large daily pill holders to go along and the combination is great.  </li>
            <li> I take a LOT of vitamins &amp; supplements, and they all fit.</li>
            <li> Having a whole month of drugs laid out at once is amazingly convenient.  </li>
            <li> All my pills fit in the separate compartments</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to use especially for the elderly.  </li>
            <li> I thought this was a great idea as I take several vitamins and suppliments (a couple of medications also).</li>
            <li> This organizer is filled once a month</li>
            <li> the pill boxes close securely and I&#x27;ve had no problem with pills falling out.  </li>
            <li> There are four compartments, and I can comfortably fit four supplements in each.</li>
            <li> This item is great for those who take the same pills day after day.  </li>
            <li> i like being able to put a months worth of medicine in at once.</li>
            <li> The containers fit snugly into the slots (though, not overly so, they&#x27;re just well-fitting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> On the contrary, I love being able to keep all my pills organized for the whole month.  </li>
            <li> If the manufacturer had added one more row to the bottom and made seven columns with the days of the week across the top, like a write-on calendar, it would have been so much easier to use.</li>
            <li> It would also be good for someone with memory issues (e.g. an older person living at home) or someone with vision issues because someone else can load up the whole box for the month and then the user can just take the tube out for the day and take the meds appropriately.  </li>
            <li> Also, I selected this vitamin size container as I have a very large quantity of pills to take, many of them in elongated shapes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to buy a whole new system, so it would be great if we could get one-day-only cartridge replacements.  </li>
            <li> I have been telling my husband how I wished they made one of these, so I was so excited when I saw this one.</li>
            <li> But otherwise I am happy so long as the units do not lose their ability to latch.  </li>
            <li> [ As an aside, for people who take lots of pills many times per day, as I once did the first year after an organ transplant, you might want to look at crafting bead jars.</li>
            <li> Each slot can hold a great many vitamins, and I&#x27;m not talking just little pills.</li>
            <li> The basic idea is great, however the design flaws keep the product from being useful.  </li>
            <li> This is a near perfect pill organizer and fits all my needs of organizing the 20+ pills I take daily.</li>
            <li> I suppose if you don&#x27;t want to take a container with you when you are going anywhere, and these will sit calmly on your counter, then they are fine.  </li>
            <li> Could certainly be made better.</li>
            <li> Might as well make it stable by making the foot print as large as the top.</li>
            <li> This a a good product for keeping medication seperated, especially if you take many pills or large pills.  </li>
            <li> Still, I am super pleased with the product and the positive difference it has made in my routine.</li>
            <li> Once a month I sort my meds and don&#x27;t have to sort through dozens of bottles to fine the right ones.  </li>
            <li> My Dad started having some mental status changes which were obviously a great concern to my siblings and me.</li>
            <li> Anyway, in the end, after discussing the matter with my partner we agreed to buy it - fortunately my family help prepare my month&#x27;s worth of medication</li>
            <li> It would be good for a younger person with, say, a transplant because the medications can be loaded into the &#x27;tubes&#x27;</li>
            <li> : The monthly refill goes much faster if you take out all the containers and group them side by side on your table top.  </li>
            <li> It is wonderful to be able to go an entire month and not really have to think about what supplements I have already taken  and am I doubling up?</li>
            <li> did I take my Meds or not because I can see if the pill container is full or not.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job with its basic needs.</li>
            <li> Ok I really like how this product organized my vitamins.  </li>
            <li> far, I&#x27;m loving this MedCenter, though.</li>
            <li> The compartments are nice and big and can hold his pills just fine.</li>
            <li> That way, I know that particular dog doesn&#x27;t require any more meds today.</li>
            <li> that particular day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pill boxes themselves are more than adequate size in width, height, and depth.  </li>
            <li> Since I take pills four times daily and a liquid twice daily, this is just perfect.  </li>
            <li> Filling 28 sections accurately for all 7 dogs took me exactly 4 minutes</li>
            <li> I use to take my multivitamin gummy and fiber gummy in the morning with my first set of meds, BUT they dont all fit in the Morning slot.</li>
            <li> i take a lot of supplements and this is the first container that all of them fit and keep organized.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this new sorter was it, and it could be if the company has better quality control.</li>
            <li> It was an ok product but very top heavy and bulky.</li>
            <li> I searched the internet to find something that would work for me &amp; the MEDCENTER MONTHLY VITAMIN ORGANIZER is the exact thing I have been searching for!</li>
            <li> Most were the Evening compartment door that open to easily.</li>
            <li> Makes it easy to see what day you are on and the red and green sides are great!  </li>
            <li> Another option available for this med box is a large clock with timer.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s worth every inch of the space.  </li>
            <li> And man is it worth it, when you don&#x27;t have to think about it for the rest of the month.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money both for convenience and longevity of the product.  </li>
            <li> It would be more complete system if the one-day pill holder was included.</li>
            <li> Its nice to fill it and forget it until a month later.</li>
            <li> There is no lock so this wouldn&#x27;t be good for a person at-risk for over dose; but it&#x27;s great for a person who just needs help keeping the medications straight or has trouble getting in and out of multiple pill containers.  </li>
            <li> so I wonder if vitamins will degrade since you are supposed to load 30 days worth at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loading about two weeks worth since it takes a while</li>
            <li> We received it in expected time and it was in good shape.</li>
            <li> I love filling up so far in advance.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;vitamin organizer\\&quot; is well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> It is so much easier to fill all or most of the containers once every three or four weeks rather than once a week, and it doesn&#x27;t take much longer to do so.</li>
            <li> Overall its nice to have supplements organized this way.</li>
            <li> but it is definitely worth both the time and the money.</li>
            <li> But I quickly figured out that all you need to do is place both thumbs on the edge of the lid and very gently push in, when both opening and closing.</li>
            <li> This is not a wear-and-tear issue, since one of trays did it out of the box and others quickly started having problems within the first month.</li>
            <li> It is easy to open, easy to use and eliminates have to fill pill boxes every week.</li>
            <li> The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is that the pill containers don&#x27;t seal easily, and the colors/dates are easily rubbed off.</li>
            <li> other wise</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of high quality materials, and is good looking enough to leave out on the pass-through counter between the kitchen and dining room.  </li>
            <li> I ordered it right away</li>
            <li> AT THE RIGHT TIMES EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> right now).&lt;br</li>
            <li> I returned it almost right away.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true many of the 31 boxes were extremely tight, but I learned right away to press in on the top of lid first</li>
            <li> 3/2/10 - Liked this so much for the dogs that I recently purchased a second one for my own use.</li>
            <li> - Liked this so much for the dogs that I recently purchased a second one for my own use.</li>
            <li> He has been doing great on the new system and his mental staus has returned to</li>
            <li> It is a very large product.</li>
            <li> I think the system is a great idea but the size of the compartments are too small.</li>
            <li> I would fork out a little more and get something better, or not buy at all and save yourself some money</li>
            <li> It is little tricky learning the best way to open</li>
            <li> Yeah, right at first I struggled with the lids too.</li>
            <li> seller was super fast with her delivery.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with it and definitely recommend it to anyone trying to keep control of lots (and lots) of pills and vitamins on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> This sits on the bathroom counter easily, takes up minimal space, easily releases each day&#x27;s container and is just the handiest gizmo ever.</li>
            <li> This sits on the bathroom counter easily, takes up minimal space, easily releases each day&#x27;s container and is just the handiest gizmo ever.</li>
            <li> It is very sturdy!</li>
            <li> Love it; except the covers sometimes sneak open and the pills sneak out</li>
            <li> Overall, I think the concept and setup is ingenious.</li>
            <li> Most have only 1 inch x 1-1/2 inch sized boxes.</li>
            <li> Pretty costly as it</li>
            <li> it does help that i can space them out more evenly so that i&#x27;m taking the same number of pills at each</li>
            <li> anyway that&#x27;s exactly what it reminds me of.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> You will probably be thinking surely there must be something in the UK similar</li>
            <li> Will definitely be purchasing one for my elderly father... :)</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I need since I take mediations 4 times a day.</li>
            <li> I like that it has a whole month&#x27;s worth of doses.  </li>
            <li> Exactly as described</li>
            <li> I can instantly see how many days I have to purchase products</li>
            <li> This monthly organizer really helps keep me on track!</li>
            <li> The only suggestion would be to have better quality control on the lids and boxes.  </li>
            <li> Its enough space for my many vitamins and meds.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom and dad since the are taking more vitamins ad regular pills.  </li>
            <li> so they are aware of what the have taken and not.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this medication organizer for my husband who takes several prescription medications as well as many over-the-counter supplements.</li>
            <li> I used these the first year:</li>
            <li> If you take a lot of supplements, especially large pills like fatty acid softgels, you&#x27;ll love this.</li>
            <li> The individual containers dont always fit securely into the main stand...</li>
            <li> I take 2 multivitamin gummies and 2 fiber gummies that are pretty large, on top of all my regular pills.</li>
            <li> I am very thankful we were able to solve a major problem with such an easy fix.</li>
            <li> can not find a large weekly pill sorter where you can remove each day&#x27;s pills as needed, to replace our old ones we got for free at a seminar years ago.  </li>
            <li> I find the red/green color coding handy as it is a quick visual reminder if I have not taken my daily meds.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it is very top heavy</li>
            <li> This item is pretty much as advertised.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a real relief to plan far ahead with such a nice organizer.      </li>
            <li> Once I started using this, I could fit both my meds and my supplements in the same container and only having to fill it once a month has made things so much better.  </li>
            <li> So this is not user friendly for people that arn&#x27;t very strong or are simply impatient like me and don&#x27;t feel like battling with a plastic latch.&lt;br /&gt;The pill slots are a normal size and don&#x27;t fit many larger pills or gummy type vitamins in the one slot, you would have to utilize a different slot.</li>
            <li> of the lids do come open easily</li>
            <li> Once I loaded up the initial set of meds, the boxes opened easily as I went to remove them.  </li>
            <li> Just in case anyone needs to know exactly how big the box filled measures for placement in a counter or on a shelf, at its max points</li>
            <li> It is supper easy for me to organize for him and he only has to remember to take the day he needs out of the system.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to keep track of the medication I&#x27;ve taken for the day by turning the pill box over to display a different color.</li>
            <li> It took me 25 minutes to set up the months supply, which is about 20 capsules per day, and now it takes seconds to open and swallow what I need - no fuss, no reluctance, just an easy way to take my vitamins.  </li>
            <li> Some of the doors open to easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s LARGE.  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly large, well-made container, holding four doses of pills per day for thirty-one days.</li>
            <li> We like the large compartments.</li>
            <li> so i know for sure that is where the loose pills came from.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an easy, convenient way to organize the many vitamins that I take daily and was told about the Med Center by a friend.  </li>
            <li> ; to the main stand (heat glue is where they used a hot knife like item to get the plastics to melt together).  </li>
            <li> Recommend this product and seller very highly.</li>
            <li> the bottom of the box is now pushed up against the wall and makes a handy little shelf for me to put my inhalers and the cat&#x27;s meds</li>
            <li> There was an error in the shipment and they fix the problem right away, very professional and fast service.  </li>
            <li> It has large compartments enough tot fit 7 plus pills in a meal.</li>
            <li> The compartments of each box are huge allowing enough space for each section to hold multiples of large multi-vitamin sized pills.  </li>
            <li> The daily trays fit neatly into the tower and it doesn&#x27;t take much space on the counter.</li>
            <li> The red/green box ends keep me secure that I actually took the whole day&#x27;s allotment, too, and didn&#x27;t forget the evening or afternoon selection.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You only have to replace the meds inside of them once a month, which is a huge time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> When I saw this behemoth of a pillbox, I was curious and had to explore it more and read about it.  </li>
            <li> this thing works very well and it makes it much easier to remember whether i&#x27;ve taken my meds or not.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m ready to go.  </li>
            <li> so i can don&#x27;t have to wait to the very end of the day to refill the box.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is so much easier for my mother to take all of her meds at the correct time.</li>
            <li> This pill organizer allows the whole month to be in one casing.</li>
            <li> Found this medication organizer very helpful for my elderly mother.  </li>
            <li> I bought the vitamin one instead of the med one because the compartments are larger, so all my meds fit into one compartment.  </li>
            <li> some compartments are more securely closed than others.</li>
            <li> Very speedy delivery.</li>
            <li> Setting up pills and supplements for a month at a time is very convenient and a time-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me organize my med/vitamin regimen.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten this for myself much sooner than I</li>
            <li> Should have gotten this for myself much sooner than I did.</li>
            <li> Very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I really like it for my father.</li>
            <li> So much easier to organize all the prescriptions and vitamin/supplements.</li>
            <li> a well designed product - very helpful for remembering meds.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH EASIER A MONTH AT A TIME.</li>
            <li> READY</li>
            <li> I take a lot of Meds every month and this makes my life so much easier, it eliminates the question of</li>
            <li> It so much easier than having all those pill bottles around.</li>
            <li> That is where it really benefited me.  </li>
            <li> Thus far the product is well worth its&#x27; price.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this system!</li>
            <li> I have had this for a while now and really like it.  </li>
            <li> Yes - it does have some issues with the opening and closing of the sections, but not so much that it has made into a raving lunatic.  </li>
            <li> Some work could be done on making them all stay closed better though.  </li>
            <li> His smaller pill case needed to be replaced and this fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Now, I fill all the individual containers for 25-31 days (depending on how many complete &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; of each one I have.</li>
            <li> Instead of using one 4-slot thing for 1 day, I use it for 4 days, which means I only need to refill only every 4 months -- handy.</li>
            <li> Having the ability to keep track of multiple medications/vitamins for a month&#x27;s span comes in very useful.</li>
            <li> I had an issue when my older, one week pill case was too small to fit all my calcium pills - what a pain!!  </li>
            <li> : Sometimes the lids can either be to loose or to strong.</li>
            <li> I have found this product meets my medication organizing needs very well, much better than previous types of medication organizers.   </li>
            <li> It also allowed me to set up the full month without having to search for all the individual containers</li>
            <li> If you can get all your meds refilled on the same day, then it really isawesome to do the whole month (plus, you can tell right off if you refill is over/short).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve already recommended this to family members, who were interested to witness such an easy way to organize a month&#x27;s vitamins in such a compact unit.  </li>
            <li> The red and green ends are good</li>
            <li> My vote would be just to get others that are better quality though than mess with it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all my spoonie friends or anyone else who takes a lot of medication or supplements.</li>
            <li> /&gt;to be that the plastic sides of the containers are&lt;br /&gt;relatively soft and since they are large, the walls&lt;br /&gt;tend</li>
            <li> Having the green on one end to indicate the column is full and red on the other end to indicate the column is empty is a great idea!  </li>
            <li> The footprint is pretty significant but it still takes up a lot less space than all the pill bottles would.  </li>
            <li> This is a HUGE time and mental health saver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks now, and every day when I put back an empty container and get out the next day&#x27;s full container, I say to myself, \\&quot;I LOVE this thing!\\&quot;     </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s normal state.  </li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t normally be a problem, but the piece of plastic they use, is bowed out and appears to be hastily &amp;#34;heat glued&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the compartments easily pop open on their own.</li>
            <li> It does take up a large amount of space on whatever surface you plan to set it on, but if you&#x27;re concerned about the possibility of missing an important medication, I highly recommend this organizer.</li>
            <li> Several containers had cracked lids right out of the box.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d love to hear from other buyers about its longevity - because if they don&#x27;t I really CANNOT afford to post it back or to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Other than that minor inconvenience, it really is a nice solution.</li>
            <li> Again, this is only if you take A LOT of pills or if your pills are very LARGE.</li>
            <li> Moreover, the ingenuity behind its design is worth rewarding by purchasing it, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Mine however came with to holders for the second of the month and none for first day, but easiy corrected with a label make.</li>
            <li> I think it would be helpful to give the exact inside measurement of each compartment so the buyer can determine weather it will meet their individual needs.</li>
            <li> The slant makes it easier for me to see the dogs&#x27; names I taped on the very top (for those days when I&#x27;m so tired</li>
            <li> The slant makes it easier for me to see the dogs&#x27; names I taped on the very top (for those days when I&#x27;m so tired</li>
            <li> The only thing is the original setup of the daily pills.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> x 12&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34;) would be much larger.</li>
            <li> It is big and bulky and exactly the size it should be to get the job</li>
            <li> When fully loaded, as in the image above, larger fingers may find it just a tad challenging to get to the inner day containers.</li>
            <li> Which makes a lot of sense, because that will keep the plastic from wearing down (which would eventually cause a not-so-tight fit).</li>
            <li> There is a bigger version of this organizer that the company offers, but it&#x27;s another $10-20 and after reading the reviews was not willing to pay even more for a product that needs some</li>
            <li> Good concept, but individual pill box lids was hard to open for older persons.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that with a little pressure on the side of the container the snaps work just fine.</li>
            <li> The boxes on this do not stay closed very well and we were constantly having to redo them since we travel with the full set of boxes on road trips.</li>
            <li> I recommend if you need to take numerous pills at once that a shot glass really helps to get them down smoothly.</li>
            <li> And, this one is big enough to fit all my daily vitamins and supplements that I normally take.  </li>
            <li> The containers are large enough to accommodate both.  </li>
            <li> And I can see from clear across the room whether or not I&#x27;ve taken my pills for the day.  </li>
            <li> -I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t have any mobility problems, but I can see how an elderly customer, or a customer with hand mobility issues, would have some issues opening and shutting the compartments.  </li>
            <li> &quot; (the pillbox is ready) and red means \\&quot;empty\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> i got this after much research since i take a rather extensive combination of vitamins, supplements, and prescription pills a day</li>
            <li> This has been very helpful with my Mom&#x27;s pills on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she really enjoys putting out her medicines only once every month!</li>
            <li> The whole setup is also totally stable, so no fear of knocking it over and spilling pill containers everywhere.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 88 year old father.</li>
            <li> Those that don&#x27;t close well can be partially remedied by pressing outside wall of the offending compartment and creating more resistance on the hinged cap for that individual compartment.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s getting the job done.</li>
            <li> I really could use larger storage capacity in the units.  </li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 83 year old mother.  </li>
            <li> Withouth this medication sorter, my life would be complete chaos.  </li>
            <li> I realize I won&#x27;t have 7 dogs forever, and some may require more than one cartridge at some time, but I still have an empty \\&quot;rabbit hole\\&quot; for the extra cartridges I removed at the end of each row that would handle this extra.</li>
            <li> I realize I won&#x27;t have 7 dogs forever, and some may require more than one cartridge at some time, but I still have an empty \\&quot;rabbit hole\\&quot; for the extra cartridges I removed at the end of each row that would handle this extra.</li>
            <li> It worked for my 87 year old father quite well.</li>
            <li> Given that considerable force has to be exerted to close the lids, I suspect that eventually the lids will have pieces breaking off along the cracks.</li>
            <li> and they are already ready to go when I get in to my hotel.&lt;br /&gt;Saves time for me taking all my pills out each day of their prescription bottles, because I spend 20min at the beginning of the month filling the entire organizer, so I can grab and</li>
            <li> The pill container is really the only thing on the market that allows you to do a month at a time (there is another option with a alarm clock).</li>
            <li> Finally, a monthly vitamin/medication system that really works.  </li>
            <li> They snap open and closed mostly without any extra effort.</li>
            <li> It offers 4 compartments per day for supplements, vitamins or prescriptions.  </li>
            <li> There are a few minor notes to be aware of, though not enough to take off a start for (more of just a heads-up):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> of the individual boxes are much more&lt;</li>
            <li> This unit holds more than 23 pills and allows you to keep track of days used by turning the containers to reveal red or green backgrounds under the number of days.</li>
            <li> The red and green facings are also nice and simple touch.    </li>
            <li> : So, most of the cases were not closing all the way anymore, and I have been forced to tape them shut.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and hate filling your pill packs weekly, then this is perfect!!  </li>
            <li> If you hate getting out bottles of pills each day or week, this is the best solution.</li>
            <li> Make one of the colors intense and the other color pale - that would work better.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the exorbitant ultimate cost I would like to say to all you American customers that you are lucky to buy such a useful and helpfulitem at such a low cost.</li>
            <li> The product is a good idea, but the quality of the doors are very poor.</li>
            <li> At first the compartments looked like they&#x27;d be too small, but I was pleasantly surprised that they&#x27;re roomier than they first appear.     </li>
            <li> No mess at all.</li>
            <li> No mess at all.</li>
            <li> Other lids are really right and need considerable effort to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> larger than most with four separate daily compartments -- top tabs are a little tight and tough to shut on some - but overall quality good and about what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Just in case anyone needs to know exactly how big the tubes are for carrying with them in a purse or something, the individual tubes measure at their max points</li>
            <li> I was quite sure that this medications holder would be too small  for ALL of our daily pills and supplements.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine an older person having to open these.</li>
            <li> I searched high and low</li>
            <li> Highly recommended to those who have several pills to take throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Easy to open and close for even shaky hands and very sturdy.</li>
            <li> and there are actually no better ones made that fit my ideological description.</li>
            <li> My guess is that these cracks appeared in the factory when the lids were being closed for the first time in the assembly lines for packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price, I would have expected a little better finish.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 32 and the doctor&#x27;s keep adding on new diagnosis and prescriptions.</li>
            <li> I take multiple medications, and it takes quite awhile to fill all of the pill boxes, but it&#x27;s well worth the time spent.</li>
            <li> Since the trays are stored on their sides, this is a major drawback to this product.</li>
            <li> The MedCenter keeps You on track in a way no other device can.</li>
            <li> , now i fill all the boxes and i am good for the month, or when a week is up i refill before i am totally out, i would give it 5 stars but sometimes the lids pop open and some are very tight, for the price the little carry case should come with the organizer instead of buying it seperate</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell from the pic, but once filled, this topples easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hubby has multiple medical problems and has to take a large number of pills each day at different times.  </li>
            <li> explanation may sound a bit confusing, but I tried a number of ways and this worked for me without writing on the cartridges, etc.</li>
            <li> My explanation may sound a bit confusing, but I tried a number of ways and this worked for me without writing on the cartridges, etc.</li>
            <li> so when i&#x27;m loading up for a month, i just transfer the last day&#x27;s pills to the clear cartridge</li>
            <li> I like the vitamin bin organizer and the boxes just barely hold each of my day&#x27;s supply of vitamins.</li>
            <li> Frequently, the compartments come open and all the pills fall out when you are getting pills out for another time of day.  </li>
            <li> I chose the vitamin organize due to the large compartments.</li>
            <li> Took me less than 10 minutes to fill up a month&#x27;s worth of &#x27;meds&#x27; once I got this second unit.</li>
            <li> Took me less than 10 minutes to fill up a month&#x27;s worth of &#x27;meds&#x27; once I got this second unit.</li>
            <li> I am so annoyed about the huge cost and even more annoyed when the box arrived saying \\&quot;Made in Vietnam\\&quot;, I may research the production company and ask them to consider a cost and offer me a posting charge as I really need the box to have a long life</li>
            <li> I recently purchased 2 (one for my wife) of the Med Center Monthly Vitamin Organizer with large pill boxes.  </li>
            <li> The container for each day is shorter than other organizers I have used, however they are much deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li> If you have any problems with your hands, you will not be able to use this unit because you have to press so hard on some of the containers just to get them to open, that occasionally the pills go flying across the room when the container finally decides to open.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for the reviews that complain about the occasional container lid that doesn&#x27;t close properly, here&#x27;s how I fixed the two problem lids on my organizer.  </li>
            <li> Still, if they were larger, the whole thing (roughly 12&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Most of the compartments are very hard to open, and some just pop open by themselves when you are getting an adjacent day&#x27;s pill container from the rack.  </li>
            <li> In the other, the&lt;br /&gt;holder is upright and the individual containers&lt;br /&gt;slide into straight up boxes.</li>
            <li> Had I not already spent so much time placing 31 days of pills in my 31 Day Vitamin Organizer, I definitely would have sent it back.  </li>
            <li> i have no excuse not to take my vits</li>
            <li> Green means filled, pills not yet taken, and red means empty, already taken for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as I haven&#x27;t found any other with large enough daily strips to hold all my supplements.</li>
            <li> Some I had to almost force closed, but I think that is because it is new.</li>
            <li> Some I had to almost force closed, but I think that is because it is new.</li>
            <li> The containers can be stiff at first.</li>
            <li> I proceed through the day, when a particular dog&#x27;s cartridge is empty, I place it back in its rabbit hole with the red side showing.</li>
            <li> The only major drawback of it is that each of the individual containers for each day is segmented into 4 different compartments (Morning, afternoon, evening, night).</li>
            <li> We had an issue with a few of the individual lids that fit either too loosely or could barely get them closed with all my might.</li>
            <li> http://www.amazon.com/Storage-Stackable-Containers-Crafts-Findings/dp/B001AS6OLK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1415659765&amp;sr&#x3D;8-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;craft+bead+jars , and just connected the 10-15 jars I needed for each day and marked them with a dry erase pen--again, this is just an fyi for anyone who&#x27;s going through the same thing</li>
            <li> It is a little large but the size is necessary for people with multiple daily medications and multiple times when they have to take them.  </li>
            <li> I actually hate filling this little baby, but it&#x27;s the one the facility likes best</li>
            <li> About half the daily strips have one or more snap lids that don&#x27;t stay closed or are hard to open.</li>
            <li> Before I started using it, I frequently found myself short one or two of my daily supplement when I sat down to fill my containers on a weekly basis.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long putting up with multiple prescriptions, vitamins and supplements taken at various times/day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long putting up with multiple prescriptions, vitamins and supplements taken at various times/day.</li>
            <li> I only checked back to see if the product has been updated because I&#x27;d had this for so long.</li>
            <li> The tubes can then be put back in the box with the red side up, or for someone with vision issues, maybe have a container by this one that they can just toss the empty tubes in until someone comes in to load the monthly med box again.  </li>
            <li> As I said before, when you are removing one of the daily containers some of the adjacent containers just pop open making quite a mess to get the pills back into the proper containers.  </li>
            <li> You need to take out each cassette separately and open four boxes for every single day.</li>
            <li> fix may sound like a lot of trouble, but it worked for me, and it&#x27;s a LOT LESS TROUBLE than repacking the organizer and returning it.  </li>
            <li> This pill organizer makes it far easier to set up my medication for a long period at a time, rather than having to sit down every single week to lay out all my pills.  </li>
            <li> The cap for each individual daily container (there are 4 hinged caps for each daily pill box) either stick and are hard to open or plop open from just handling the container itself (when reinserting into the loading station for example).</li>
            <li> the one reviewer who complained about the price, consider how much time it can save you.  </li>
            <li> -I&#x27;m not a naturally organized person, and I&#x27;ve lost a day.</li>
            <li> , my research was so wide it landed me into the American sites.  </li>
            <li> (red indicates that it is empty), so I know where I am in the month.</li>
            <li> Taking a month long trip two people supplements and prescriptions.</li>
            <li> 8 inches tall x 9 1/2 inches wide x 6 inches deep</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to expose all my supplements to the air for as long as a month.</li>
            <li> With a hair-dryer, I heated the plastic for 20 or 30 seconds, then closed the lid while pushing against it toward the back of the container.  </li>
            <li> (all red sides)&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges: 22-28 8th slot empty  </li>
            <li> will see how long it lasts.  </li>
            <li> a minor defect was promptly replaced.</li>
            <li> I see they also have a week long travel case in both sizes.</li>
            <li> Each pill container compartment is about 3/4&amp;#34; deep x  1 1/2&amp;#34; wide, x 3/4&amp;#34;, and each day container has 4 compartments.</li>
            <li> The fact that the piece bows out eliminates the option of laying the item down on the back for an alternate configuration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sadly, I take a lot of medication on a regular basis and my weekly holders were just becoming jammed, taking out one tablet meant all the others falling out!!!  </li>
            <li> The other side red.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;( the other is a definite 5 star).</li>
            <li> The containers are a little stiff to open when new, they seem to be loosening up some.</li>
            <li> Since there were only 2 bad compartments out of a hundred and something, I kept the product and am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I worked a few of them back and forth to loosen them up prior to leaving the system for my Dad to manage.</li>
            <li> By heating it thoroughly, then squeezing it closed, it keeps its shape and remains closed until you need to open it.</li>
            <li> If a single box breaks, can it be ordered as a stand alone item?</li>
            <li> The plastic warps slightly and about six of the lids either are very difficult to close properly or they open too easily.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, my Dad was put on a new medication which required him to take two pills on even number days and one pill on odd numbered days.</li>
            <li> would have given it 5-stars, but having to fix a couple of lids that don&#x27;t close properly brought my rating down to 4-stars.</li>
            <li> so if it does pop open the pills will stay in, although the number of the day is upside down.  </li>
            <li> The boxes are a bit awkward fitting into the slots and until they are broken in, they do not stay closed very well.</li>
            <li> Not only does it remind us when to reorder meds (only a few green numbers left), it reminds us what day it is (one of the downfalls to being retired...</li>
            <li> I have balanced individual &#x27;cups&#x27;, tried muffin cup liners, silicone muffin cups, old jar covers, and people pill cases lined up along the wall,  only to create the ultimate mess on my kitchen, tip them over, get them all confused and oftentimes wet and have to start counting,</li>
            <li> I also found putting a slight forward pressure on the back of the hinged area while opening eliminated the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the methods noted in the reviews to slightly push the lids in or out to open or shut the compartments.  </li>
            <li> But, several of the compartments do not close tightly.</li>
            <li> I have been looking a long time to find something like this!!!</li>
            <li> The only negative is that it is big</li>
            <li> I like the green and red ends</li>
            <li> This not only makes it more difficult to see the numbers, but makes it somewhat top-heavy and difficult to remove some of the daily containers.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of medicine and was having to drag them out on a week to week basis.</li>
            <li> -7&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges: 1-7  8th slot empty</li>
            <li> 8-14  8th slot empty  </li>
            <li> : 15-21 8th slot empty  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay closed, pills fall out</li>
            <li> like the switch from red to green as pills consumed with the numbers.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Several of the lids don&#x27;t stay closed.</li>
            <li> so im careful what I keep in here.</li>
            <li> Each of those 4 compartments are small, so if you have a lot of medication that requires being taken 4 times, bare that in mind before purchasing.</li>
            <li> But for the price of the item, I wouldn&#x27;t have expected the resulting finishing issues.</li>
            <li> Pressing in the center of the container compartment helps when closing since it bends the lid out just a</li>
            <li> I recently traveled for a few days, so I took four days with me in a zip lock bag...</li>
            <li> stay closed.</li>
            <li> it is snapped closed.</li>
            <li> When there is a problem snapping it closed it is resolved with very little extra effort.</li>
            <li> Some of the lids are hard to open, some are loose.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the partitions in the containers make space for each dose somewhat limited.</li>
            <li> My solution has been to slip small rubber bands over the offending lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideas for future design tweaks: The red-green color scheme will not work for color-blind people, like my husband.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I will keep using it because of the issues described above.  </li>
            <li> I was filling another organizer every other week before this darling -</li>
            <li> I would have put up with these aesthetics if not for the other problems</li>
            <li> I take my other gummies from the bedtime slot.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets</li>
            <li> every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried because of prior reviews that talked about the individual pill containers being either hard to close or hard to open.</li>
            <li> other reviewers said, the latches for the slots either get stuck and are hard to open OR they don&#x27;t truly click closed unless you put some effort into it.</li>
            <li> I only mention this for people who have arthritis in their fingers and who may have a little difficulty on just a few of the container lids.</li>
            <li> It seems like such a waste of time for me to sit down and organize my vitamins when they wind up falling out anyways!  </li>
            <li> I get tired of refilling organizers every week, and it&#x27;s difficult to organize if I&#x27;m traveling for more than a week at a time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The main container base has a very unrefined look, close up there are glue lines, (indeed some parts have been glued on) and rough plastic edges, like the plastic products of decades ago.</li>
            <li> Some were (at first) nearly impossible to open, in fact.  </li>
            <li> The lids stay on plenty tight when closed, too, I&#x27;ve yet to have a problem with one accidentally opening.</li>
            <li> He takes it very seriously and puts each container back at the end of the day with the red facing outward.  </li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this because of all the reviews complaining about the box caps being so hard to open.  </li>
            <li> they are hard to open and some do&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
            <li> Getting pills mixed up by them falling out could have negative consequences.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that I can be a bit clumsy when refilling</li>
            <li> If you just buy one of these, I suggest the smaller model, at least it&#x27;s upright and doesn&#x27;t have the top-heavy design of this model.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, even after looking at some of the negative reviews, so I knew what could potentially irritate me about this product.</li>
            <li> Not worth to buy.</li>
            <li> and I can fill a month at a time which weekly was getting to be a real drag.</li>
            <li> I got this item in a few days, and it works as expected.</li>
            <li> i can still get the pills in/out and tell which day to use, even if they are upside down.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not supposed to just mash it down to close it, you have to hold in the catch-button so that you don&#x27;t wear it out.</li>
            <li> The rack was designed upside down, with the largest indentions at the bottom.  </li>
            <li> I put the leftover three units upside down on the end of the &amp;#34;weeks.&amp;#34;  I find that organizing the medicines Sunday through Saturday by week helps me to keep track of what day of the week it is.</li>
            <li> JUST SIT DOWN AND FILL IT ONCE A MONTH</li>
            <li> She likes the product, her only complaint is that some of the compartments do not close tightly.</li>
            <li> Some issues: as mentioned in other reviews a few of my lids don&#x27;t stay shut.</li>
            <li> Another thing id didn&#x27;t think about is a lot of supplements are meant to be stored in the containers they&#x27;re sold in (dark, air tight etc)</li>
            <li> i would recommend this to anyone who has low vision and who takes ridiculous amounts of medication.</li>
            <li> Takes less space in suitcase.</li>
            <li> so there would be less returns.</li>
            <li> I already knew the benefits of using pill cases - sometimes I can&#x27;t even remember what shirt I&#x27;m wearing, much less remember whether I took my morning calcium - &amp;#34;I did, didn&#x27;t I?  </li>
            <li> it less stable and</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the base of the organizer has a small footprint, and it&#x27;s easy to accidently knock it over, however the pill boxes do stay closed if this happens.</li>
            <li> The red numbers mean we&#x27;ve taken the meds and the green numbered boxes are yet to be taken.</li>
            <li> Out of the 30 container boxes (which have four compartments each), about 7 of mine required a little effort to open (so, really, about 7/120, so that&#x27;s not too bad).</li>
            <li> As the containers are inserted into the box sideways, there&#x27;s no good way of preventing such lids from dumping the pills on the floor as you pull it out.</li>
            <li> : My main complaint is the poor quality of construction of the lids.  </li>
            <li> but like another reviewer said, if you press down firmly on the corners of the compartment, it will close tightly.  </li>
            <li> Some of the tabs dont close well or some close too tight.  </li>
            <li> So some compartments are not air tight.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need 34 different bottles of pills, meds, vitamins, supplements, wheat grass, barley, etc.,  cluttering up the counter all day long and have to go thru this tedious process sometimes 4 times/day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was concerned I would find little boxes all over my Dad&#x27;s apartment</li>
            <li> Be  prepared to spend a little time filling it each month.</li>
            <li> Every little bit helps in the morning and knowing the date is a plus.</li>
            <li> My only concern is the compartment hinges appear flimsy and weak.  </li>
            <li> would give the item 5 stars but two of the compartments in the daily containers will not stay closed and two are very difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> Yes it takes a little time ONE time per month</li>
            <li> This thing has made life a little easier.</li>
            <li> For me, the malfunctioning lids mean it&#x27;s not worth it even to try out the other design.</li>
            <li> Green means</li>
            <li> I had a missing part and returned this, but I probably would have returned it anyway.</li>
            <li> Today&#x27;s color is green (GO), no matter what time of day the pills are needed.</li>
            <li> That way, if a container is still green, I know someone still needs a medication TODAY.</li>
            <li> (today they are all green to begin the day)&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges:</li>
            <li> Then, I&#x27;ll turn row 2 to green</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working on and green is \\&quot;GO\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I also tried putting a grainy powder substance in one and flipping it around red/green etc., to see if it would &#x27;leak&#x27; in the narrow rabbit hole that holds it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m working on and green is \\&quot;GO\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I also tried putting a grainy powder substance in one and flipping it around red/green etc., to see if it would &#x27;leak&#x27; in the narrow rabbit hole that holds it.</li>
            <li> a bariatric patient, I have to take quite a few supplements a day.  </li>
            <li> One side green.  </li>
            <li> I take prescription medications and quite a few supplements throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of the &amp;#34;lucky&amp;#34; folks who have to take medication frequently.  </li>
            <li> This could lead to a problem if he takes out one of the boxes and one of his medications falls out unnoticed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;it does take up a lot of room on my night table but that is a small price to pay for not having to mess with pill bottles every saturday night.  </li>
            <li> Some of the container lids can be a little difficult to open.</li>
            <li> However, the expensive box (which we now treat like royalty) has arrived and it helps me enormously.  </li>
            <li> For the past 3 years, I have set his medicine out for him into weekely containers, two weeks at a time.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the fact that some of the compartments come open randomly while in my purse.  </li>
            <li> However, it is too small for the person seeking treatment with supplements.</li>
            <li> and sometimes i would get lazy and did not load up on vits for the week on time</li>
            <li> I also like that I can carry one small container in my purse if I&#x27;m going to be out and about</li>
            <li> The unit sits on my counter where it serves as a reminder, taking up a small space given the function it serves.  </li>
            <li> No more bottles cluttering up my counter and no more remembering</li>
            <li> No more filling up pill containers for just a week.  </li>
            <li> You can also buy a set of the larger containers and use them on the smaller base.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom since she has MS and a bad memory &amp; it made it easier for me to fill her medicines monthly since I live out of town rather than coming over weekly to fill them..</li>
            <li> Have been using for over a year, and none of the tabs for shutting them have broken either, which had been a problem with previous cases</li>
            <li> Some of the containers have hard to close lids.</li>
            <li> its size also makes it hard to miss and then forget.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just bought this 31-Day Vitamin Organizer, very poor quality, some snap lids cannot close, and some are very hard to open.</li>
            <li> I did ask Amazon.com whether they could transfer the item to Amazon.co.uk or vice versa to which I received a negative reply.  </li>
            <li> All the reviewers who complained about ill-fitting covers were spot-on.  </li>
            <li> Some have complained that they&#x27;re too small, or of the lids being either very difficult to open, or made of sub quality materials.  </li>
            <li> Always been inconsistent in taking my vitamins - but no more!  </li>
            <li> but once it&#x27;s done, no more worries!</li>
            <li> As you pull the container out of the holding base the door pops open and because the opening of the doors face down, the pills fall out and go rolling all over the place.</li>
            <li> Although the holder of all those little pack is a little awkwardly shaped, it keeps them together.</li>
            <li> Some of the lids are close to impossible to open for me.</li>
            <li> Also, I have some pretty awful memory issues so this helps ALOT.</li>
            <li> Even some of the pill containers in this unit are very difficult to open and some are difficult to keep shut.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my father who has a tough time remember to take his medication.</li>
            <li> If we continue to have issues I will have to send the organizer back, which I would really hate to do.</li>
            <li> I was getting tired of having to do the weekly pill exercise, and now it&#x27;s just once a month, and I just track when each Rx is about to run out with a calendar</li>
            <li> However, I found some of the boxes to be very difficult to open, so I was quite disappointed with that.</li>
            <li> To remedy that I put the containers in the base upside down</li>
            <li> I got one for each of my parents and then used a black Sharpie to put their initials on each box and on the base - just in</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda tedious to fill it up, but I did it while watching a movie</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my expensive and dangerous (to kids or pets) pills into 90 compartments that don&#x27;t close correctly.</li>
            <li> It keeps me from making any careless dangerous mistakes.</li>
            <li> I am afraid that her meds are going to get messed up.</li>
            <li> This is very difficult to find on the internet.</li>
            <li> It is very difficult to fill.</li>
            <li> They were also very difficult to&lt;br /&gt;close, until I discovered the trick of putting pressure&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update after some usage if things go badly.</li>
            <li> bad execution.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality of stand.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> This would save a lot of grief and hassle on both ends</li>
            <li> - an outrageous £66.10</li>
            <li> /&gt;The top-heavy so called foot-print saving design is terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.  </li>
            <li> But the worst part is, the manufacturer didn&#x27;t realize there are seven days in a week.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I take 30 pulls a day. It&#x27;s a daily chore to get them laid out for the day. This simplifies my life. I love it. It is very sturdy!</li>
            <li> Pros: Refilling it every month takes me about one-third the time compared to refilling weekly trays.  I also love that all the pills for one day are in a separate tray that can be taken with you on day trips or vacations.  The daily trays fit neatly into the tower and it doesn&#x27;t take much space on the counter. The green-red color allows you to keep track of what you have taken or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: My main complaint is the poor quality of construction of the lids.  The plastic warps slightly and about six of the lids either are very difficult to close properly or they open too easily.  More than once we have had pills spill out.  Since the trays are stored on their sides, this is a major drawback to this product. I wrote the company asking for replacement trays for the faulty ones that we had.  No response to my email.  This is not a wear-and-tear issue, since one of trays did it out of the box and others quickly started having problems within the first month. My solution has been to slip small rubber bands over the offending lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideas for future design tweaks: The red-green color scheme will not work for color-blind people, like my husband.  Make one of the colors intense and the other color pale - that would work better.  Also, the current box is a four by eight slot arrangement. Rearrange that to a five by seven slot arrangement -- it maps better to people&#x27;s concept of a monthly calendar.</li>
            <li> I have given several of these for gifts.  Everyone who has received it has loved it.  Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Some of the containers have hard to close lids. Wished they had better quality control other wise Everything works fine and it is the best system I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I take 36 pills per day, and this system keeps me organized!  I love it!  That said, there are two things that could be better:  -I&#x27;m young and don&#x27;t have any mobility problems, but I can see how an elderly customer, or a customer with hand mobility issues, would have some issues opening and shutting the compartments.  -I&#x27;m not a naturally organized person, and I&#x27;ve lost a day. I don&#x27;t want to buy a whole new system, so it would be great if we could get one-day-only cartridge replacements.  I would buy again!  I can&#x27;t find anything like it in my local drug or discount store.</li>
            <li> Love it; except the covers sometimes sneak open and the pills sneak out</li>
            <li> I take a lot of medications for multiple sclerosis at intervals of 4 times per day.  When I saw this behemoth of a pillbox, I was curious and had to explore it more and read about it.  I took the plunge and ordered one since I have problems with short term memory and sometimes forget if I have taken medications or not.  This box leaves no room for wondering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s LARGE.  But it&#x27;s worth every inch of the space.  Take the time once a month to fill it up (or fill it up weekly) and you will be all set.  If you have a partner to help you, all the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a great invention.  Green means \\&quot;go\\&quot; (the pillbox is ready) and red means \\&quot;empty\\&quot;.  Simple and ingenious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great for me.</li>
            <li> I really liked the concept of the system so I purchased it for my 80-year-old mother. However, I found some of the boxes to be very difficult to open, so I was quite disappointed with that. Overall, I think the concept and setup is ingenious. For a younger person who does not have dexterity challenges, this is a great system!</li>
            <li> This monthly organizer is great. It is easy to open, easy to use and eliminates have to fill pill boxes every week. I would highly recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> There was an error in the shipment and they fix the problem right away, very professional and fast service.  I will surely be referring them to fellow caregivers.</li>
            <li> Largest pill organizer I&#x27;ve seen. Most have only 1 inch x 1-1/2 inch sized boxes. This allows me to get all my medications and multiple supplements including those big chewable calcium tablets in them. The ability to prepare a month at a time is nice. The system to help keep track of when you take them (and whether you DID take them) is good. The only thing preventing me from giving it 5 stars is that the pill containers don&#x27;t seal easily, and the colors/dates are easily rubbed off. Could certainly be made better. Pretty costly as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/12/11 I have found another difficulty with this box (do note that I continue to use it!) My insurance company will not fill my meds a month at a time! This would work best for non-prescription things like vitamins and supplements.</li>
            <li> I take multiple meds 4 times a day &amp; was finding that I was forgetting some of them. I searched the internet to find something that would work for me &amp; the MEDCENTER MONTHLY VITAMIN ORGANIZER is the exact thing I have been searching for! Once a month I set my meds up and I&#x27;m done. Instead of having pill bottles scattered on counter top I take the day &amp; sit it on my kitchen table. It will also be a wonderful thing when I travel. All I need to do it take the days that I&#x27;m going to be gone &amp; stick them in my suitcase with no bottles needed. The green(full) red(empty) with dates of the month keep me organized so I KNOW when I&#x27;ve taken meds &amp; when its time to refill. This is a must for ANYONE who requires multiple medicines at different times during the day.  It would also make a great gift for parents/or grandparents who take medications.</li>
            <li> i got this after much research since i take a rather extensive combination of vitamins, supplements, and prescription pills a day and it&#x27;s a pain to fill a pill case every week.  this thing works very well and it makes it much easier to remember whether i&#x27;ve taken my meds or not.  i can take over 40 pills in a day and they are mostly horse pills.  they all still fit. it does help that i can space them out more evenly so that i&#x27;m taking the same number of pills at each dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it does take up a lot of room on my night table but that is a small price to pay for not having to mess with pill bottles every saturday night.  its size also makes it hard to miss and then forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is very top heavy but i found that if i lay it on it&#x27;s back i can still get the pills in/out and tell which day to use, even if they are upside down.  the bottom of the box is now pushed up against the wall and makes a handy little shelf for me to put my inhalers and the cat&#x27;s meds on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought one of the x-large daily pill holders to go along and the combination is great.  i can put the days&#x27; cartridge in the carrying case that i&#x27;ve attached to my keys and i&#x27;m ready to go.  the cartridge that came with the daily case, fits in the spare hole in the medcenter so when i&#x27;m loading up for a month, i just transfer the last day&#x27;s pills to the clear cartridge so i can don&#x27;t have to wait to the very end of the day to refill the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;some of the lids do come open easily but like another reviewer said, if you press down firmly on the corners of the compartment, it will close tightly.  i&#x27;ve also found the lids get easier to maneuver and open/close after a month or so of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll be adding a medcenter alarm to my medication station shortly.  i would recommend this to anyone who has low vision and who takes ridiculous amounts of medication.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to all my spoonie friends or anyone else who takes a lot of medication or supplements. The compartments are absolutely huge and I love this company and their products. I used to have the smaller 31 day organizer/Storage but I have since upgraded to this. It helps to be able to take my pills with me when I need to and to not miss a dose. I recommend if you need to take numerous pills at once that a shot glass really helps to get them down smoothly.</li>
            <li> The idea is great but the product is junk. Many of the pill compartments don&#x27;t close - what good is that! I can&#x27;t put my expensive and dangerous (to kids or pets) pills into 90 compartments that don&#x27;t close correctly. Junk. Junk. Junk. I&#x27;m demanding my money back.</li>
            <li> I like the vitamin bin organizer and the boxes just barely hold each of my day&#x27;s supply of vitamins. The boxes are a bit awkward fitting into the slots and until they are broken in, they do not stay closed very well. But overall, a very good product.</li>
            <li> This is that perfect item I&#x27;ve been looking for all my life and just didn&#x27;t know it. I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks now, and every day when I put back an empty container and get out the next day&#x27;s full container, I say to myself, \\&quot;I LOVE this thing!\\&quot;     Yeah, right at first I struggled with the lids too. But I quickly figured out that all you need to do is place both thumbs on the edge of the lid and very gently push in, when both opening and closing. Which makes a lot of sense, because that will keep the plastic from wearing down (which would eventually cause a not-so-tight fit). If you&#x27;ve ever handled a pocket watch before, same principle. You&#x27;re not supposed to just mash it down to close it, you have to hold in the catch-button so that you don&#x27;t wear it out. I know most people nowadays have probably never even seen a pocket watch, let alone handled one, but anyway that&#x27;s exactly what it reminds me of. So don&#x27;t be put off by the complaints about the lids!     The lids stay on plenty tight when closed, too, I&#x27;ve yet to have a problem with one accidentally opening. I haven&#x27;t tried carrying one around in my purse yet so I don&#x27;t know if they could stand up to that kind of abuse, so I&#x27;d proceed with caution there until you were confident.    I take a LOT of vitamins &amp; supplements, and they all fit. At first the compartments looked like they&#x27;d be too small, but I was pleasantly surprised that they&#x27;re roomier than they first appear.     I love, love, love this vitamin organizer! It&#x27;s kinda tedious to fill it up, but I did it while watching a movie and the time flew by. And man is it worth it, when you don&#x27;t have to think about it for the rest of the month. I take so many vitamins that I used to lose track sometimes and be wondering if I&#x27;d taken this or that supplement yet that day, or how many I&#x27;d taken. This takes all the guesswork out of the equation, because you can just look and see what&#x27;s left for that day.     Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> This has literally been a life-saver. It is so much easier for my mother to take all of her meds at the correct time. We also purchased the alarm system that goes with the medicine organizer. Using them both has allowed my mom to not over or under medicate.</li>
            <li> This has been very helpful with my Mom&#x27;s pills on a daily basis.  There was about 5 days that I have problems closing them so I have to use tape to keep it shut.  I am afraid that her meds are going to get messed up. I wish there was an easier way to fix that.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I take a lot of medication on a regular basis and my weekly holders were just becoming jammed, taking out one tablet meant all the others falling out!!!  So I searched and searched and searched but could simply not find anything that suited my needs in the UK.  I asked disability skilled sites if they could recommend anything or buy a supply but all to no avail.  Anyway, in the end, after discussing the matter with my partner we agreed to buy it - fortunately my family help prepare my month&#x27;s worth of medication so they know how tricky it is and how much such a box would help.  The problem is that the shipping cost double the amount of the item (only because I am a UK customer).  The item cost me £23.55 and the shipping £42.55!!!! - an outrageous £66.10 but then the kick in the teetch came when I had to pay an extra £17.00 for customs and excise, so this box has cost me £83.10 which equates $130.74!!!!  You will probably be thinking surely there must be something in the UK similar but there is not, I searched high and low, my research was so wide it landed me into the American sites.  I did ask Amazon.com whether they could transfer the item to Amazon.co.uk or vice versa to which I received a negative reply.  However, the expensive box (which we now treat like royalty) has arrived and it helps me enormously.  I have doubts about the plastic snaps lasting as well as they should and I&#x27;d love to hear from other buyers about its longevity - because if they don&#x27;t I really CANNOT afford to post it back or to buy a new one.  I am so annoyed about the huge cost and even more annoyed when the box arrived saying \\&quot;Made in Vietnam\\&quot;, I may research the production company and ask them to consider a cost and offer me a posting charge as I really need the box to have a long life otherwise I will understand their great annoyance.  Aside from the exorbitant ultimate cost I would like to say to all you American customers that you are lucky to buy such a useful and helpfulitem at such a low cost.</li>
            <li> I love this organizer.  Things were getting very overwhelming, but not any more!!</li>
            <li> This pill organizer allows the whole month to be in one casing. I use to have to use 8 different double sided (morning/night) pill organizers which took up a lot of space. Now allmof my medication is in one container for the month...this is AWESOME! Will definitely be purchasing one for my elderly father... :)</li>
            <li> I was looking for an easy, convenient way to organize the many vitamins that I take daily and was told about the Med Center by a friend.  I ordered it right away and so far, it has been great.  It took quite a while to load it, but now I won&#x27;t have to do it again for a month.  I like the green and red ends (red indicates that it is empty), so I know where I am in the month.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife and she really enjoys putting out her medicines only once every month!</li>
            <li> I would not recommend purchasing this item.  The basic idea is great, however the design flaws keep the product from being useful.  Most of the compartments are very hard to open, and some just pop open by themselves when you are getting an adjacent day&#x27;s pill container from the rack.  The rack was designed upside down, with the largest indentions at the bottom.  This not only makes it more difficult to see the numbers, but makes it somewhat top-heavy and difficult to remove some of the daily containers.  As I said before, when you are removing one of the daily containers some of the adjacent containers just pop open making quite a mess to get the pills back into the proper containers.  The MedCenter 31 Day Vitamin Organizer needs to be redesigned with the largest indentions towards the top--or better still make them all VERTICAL.  I also purchased a 31 Day pill container for my husband which had a different design where all of the pill boxes sit vertically and this makes the unit a lot more stable and a lot easier to use.  Even some of the pill containers in this unit are very difficult to open and some are difficult to keep shut.  I would have ordered this one for myself, but the containers are smaller and would not accommodate all of my medications plus vitamins.  There needs to be more quality control with this product.  Getting pills mixed up by them falling out could have negative consequences.  Had I not already spent so much time placing 31 days of pills in my 31 Day Vitamin Organizer, I definitely would have sent it back.  I&#x27;m not sure I will keep using it because of the issues described above.  If you have any problems with your hands, you will not be able to use this unit because you have to press so hard on some of the containers just to get them to open, that occasionally the pills go flying across the room when the container finally decides to open.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this because of all the reviews complaining about the box caps being so hard to open.  One even said the pills shot out all over the room when it finally popped.  But I took a chance and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It&#x27;s true many of the 31 boxes were extremely tight, but I learned right away to press in on the top of lid first and that would help.  Some were (at first) nearly impossible to open, in fact.  But my experience has been that this was a temporary condition.  Once I loaded up the initial set of meds, the boxes opened easily as I went to remove them.  Also, I selected this vitamin size container as I have a very large quantity of pills to take, many of them in elongated shapes.  This box easily accommodates them all.  Having a whole month of drugs laid out at once is amazingly convenient.  I get most drugs in 30 day quantities, and as a result I can see at a glance when I need to refill.  Also, filling pill boxes is always going to be boring, so getting it over with and not having to think about it again for a whole month is great.  The red/green box ends keep me secure that I actually took the whole day&#x27;s allotment, too, and didn&#x27;t forget the evening or afternoon selection.  This has so simplified my life!  It&#x27;s made of high quality materials, and is good looking enough to leave out on the pass-through counter between the kitchen and dining room.  The boxes are on a stand that holds them aloft so they&#x27;re easily seen and accessible The whole setup is also totally stable, so no fear of knocking it over and spilling pill containers everywhere.  This is well worth the money both for convenience and longevity of the product.  I can see this lasting for decades.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly what I need since I take mediations 4 times a day. Mine however came with to holders for the second of the month and none for first day, but easiy corrected with a label make. The container comes with 32 pockets ,so I am to use the extra pocket to provide extra separation. Just in  case I  return one to storage before removing the next days container. The vitamin organizer compactment are more spacious. It would be more complete system if the one-day pill holder was included. I purchased a four alarm watch with the option of hourly announcemnts. Those of us retired or permantly disable often lose track of time during the day. the hourly announcemnts helps with the time issue. The alarm system offered as an optional component is not what i would call transportable.</li>
            <li> Found this medication organizer very helpful for my elderly mother.  Only wish the containers were slightly larger to accomodate all her medications.  However, I found a way around that problem by switching the times of some of her over-the-counter medications.  I then went on to purchased a second organizer for my mother-in-law&#x27;s use.</li>
            <li> I take seventeen different medications a day, some of them several times a day.  I was forgetting to take my meds in the morning.  Now I can just throw the days meds into my bag, and go.  If I am doing something after work, I don&#x27;t have to worry about not having my meds.  This is a great product.  I bought the vitamin one instead of the med one because the compartments are larger, so all my meds fit into one compartment.  I used to have to put some of my larger pills into multiple containers, which I then had to carry around.  Now, just one container, and I&#x27;m good for the day.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 88 year old father. I chose the vitamin organize due to the large compartments. My father takes a lot of OTC supplements which tend to be larger. For the past 3 years, I have set his medicine out for him into weekely containers, two weeks at a time. A few months ago, my Dad was put on a new medication which required him to take two pills on even number days and one pill on odd numbered days. My Dad started having some mental status changes which were obviously a great concern to my siblings and me. I began to wonder if he was taking his medicine correctly, so I purchased this system to eliminate possible confusion. He has been doing great on the new system and his mental staus has returned to it&#x27;s normal state.  I was concerned I would find little boxes all over my Dad&#x27;s apartment, that is not the case. He takes it very seriously and puts each container back at the end of the day with the red facing outward.  The containers can be stiff at first. I worked a few of them back and forth to loosen them up prior to leaving the system for my Dad to manage. I also found putting a slight forward pressure on the back of the hinged area while opening eliminated the problem. Fortunately, my dad is able to use this technique.  I am very thankful we were able to solve a major problem with such an easy fix.</li>
            <li> I have been looking a long time to find something like this!!! Love it! I would not think twice about recommending this to others!</li>
            <li> It makes keeping track of my Dad&#x27;s medication very easy.</li>
            <li> Taking a month long trip two people supplements and prescriptions. Not taking the housing, just the 31 days. Takes less space in suitcase. We adapted for our needs.</li>
            <li> I finally found a pill container that my husband doesn&#x27;t complain about.  I like that it has a whole month&#x27;s worth of doses.  He takes a lot of supplements, so it takes me a while to refill it because  I have to take them all out and line them up with the lids open, etc.  Don&#x27;t know an easier way.  That said, I&#x27;ll probably also get one for myself.</li>
            <li> This a a good product for keeping medication seperated, especially if you take many pills or large pills.  I got it to make it easier for my mom to orginize my dad&#x27;s pills.  She likes the product, her only complaint is that some of the compartments do not close tightly.</li>
            <li> Awesome for us who take many pills throughout the day. All my pills fit in the separate compartments and I take a lot. Its nice to fill it and forget it until a month later. Thank you MedCenter!</li>
            <li> This pill organizer was perfect for helping my elderly parents stay on track for taking their medications.  It is a little large but the size is necessary for people with multiple daily medications and multiple times when they have to take them.  There is no lock so this wouldn&#x27;t be good for a person at-risk for over dose; but it&#x27;s great for a person who just needs help keeping the medications straight or has trouble getting in and out of multiple pill containers.  By putting all the pills in there for the month it helps us see which medications are running low and need re-ordered, too.  I got one for each of my parents and then used a black Sharpie to put their initials on each box and on the base - just in case they got them mixed up. Great system.</li>
            <li> I am not pleased with the fact that some of the compartments come open randomly while in my purse.  some compartments are more securely closed than others.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome idea and greatly organized. However, it is too small for the person seeking treatment with supplements. I think it would be helpful to give the exact inside measurement of each compartment so the buyer can determine weather it will meet their individual needs.This would save a lot of grief and hassle on both ends so there would be less returns. It would also save the expense of the buyer having to ship it back and pay for the return for something they didn&#x27;t get to use.</li>
            <li> About half the daily strips have one or more snap lids that don&#x27;t stay closed or are hard to open. Also it would be easier if this organizer had 5 rows of seven instead of 4 rows of so one could set up the numbered daily strips to match a calendar layout. I&#x27;ll continue to use this product as I haven&#x27;t found any other with large enough daily strips to hold all my supplements. I am considering purchasing another one to cut up so I can modify mine as well as hopefully swap some of the daily strips that are defective.</li>
            <li> This item is just what I needed.  This item would be good for anyone taking a lot of medications or vitamins.  It would be good for a younger person with, say, a transplant because the medications can be loaded into the &#x27;tubes&#x27; (they are really more square, but you get my meaning) and the tubes can be taken with you.  It would also be good for someone with memory issues (e.g. an older person living at home) or someone with vision issues because someone else can load up the whole box for the month and then the user can just take the tube out for the day and take the meds appropriately.  The tubes can then be put back in the box with the red side up, or for someone with vision issues, maybe have a container by this one that they can just toss the empty tubes in until someone comes in to load the monthly med box again.  Another option available for this med box is a large clock with timer.  This would be good for someone who is at home a lot, but I did not opt for that since I leave home for work.  Just in case anyone needs to know exactly how big the tubes are for carrying with them in a purse or something, the individual tubes measure at their max points 1 1/4 inch x 5 7/8 inch x 7/8 inch deep.  Just in case anyone needs to know exactly how big the box filled measures for placement in a counter or on a shelf, at its max points 8 inches tall x 9 1/2 inches wide x 6 inches deep (Without Timer)</li>
            <li> Design concept is very good. At a glance I see if I&#x27;ve taken my vitamins for the day. Build quality is uncertain. The cap for each individual daily container (there are 4 hinged caps for each daily pill box) either stick and are hard to open or plop open from just handling the container itself (when reinserting into the loading station for example). Concerned about those I have to muscle open...may break off at some point in time. Those that don&#x27;t close well can be partially remedied by pressing outside wall of the offending compartment and creating more resistance on the hinged cap for that individual compartment. Lastly, compartments definitely are not airtight so I wonder if vitamins will degrade since you are supposed to load 30 days worth at a time. I&#x27;m loading about two weeks worth since it takes a while (I use a lot of supplements) and I don&#x27;t want to expose all my supplements to the air for as long as a month. Would have preferred a more rigid thermoset type plastic even if it costs more. So far it&#x27;s getting the job done. I&#x27;ll update after some usage if things go badly.</li>
            <li> I have been telling my husband how I wished they made one of these, so I was so excited when I saw this one. We received it in expected time and it was in good shape. I have lots of medicine and was having to drag them out on a week to week basis. Now I do it once a month. PLUS I can easily see what I have taken and what I haven&#x27;t. It&#x27;s just a great item that I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my father who has a tough time remember to take his medication. It is supper easy for me to organize for him and he only has to remember to take the day he needs out of the system. Would love to see more compartments and perhaps a way to customize the labels (i.e. perhaps add times to the compartments).  Overall, very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> Fill it once a month when I get the refills and I am done for the month.  I like the larger size of the vitamin organizer over the medicine organzers that I looked at</li>
            <li> I really could use larger storage capacity in the units.  But otherwise I am happy so long as the units do not lose their ability to latch.  I like to make up four weeks of supplements and medicines at a time and line them up like the calendar.  I put the leftover three units upside down on the end of the &amp;#34;weeks.&amp;#34;  I find that organizing the medicines Sunday through Saturday by week helps me to keep track of what day of the week it is.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing pill scheduler.  I only worry about the lids someday breaking off but they are a flexible plastic.  This thing is a wonder for me.  My meds management is a struggle and I am able to do two weeks or a month at a time easily.  You turn the box around to make it red showing it is used already.  Pull the box out and set it in front...replace it.  If you need someone to sort your meds this makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> I have found this product meets my medication organizing needs very well, much better than previous types of medication organizers.   The only flaw that I have found is: for a 31 day month, in order to fill all thirty-one days for the second month (Dec., Jan) (Jul, Aug), there is no provision to allow setting aside evening and bedtime medications so that you can fill the 51 gday month; similarly, the probltm exists going from a shorter month to a 31 day month.  of course, if you get up at 5:00 am on the first to fill the organizer you avoid this problem, but I&#x27;m lazy. I give thr product 4.5 out of 6 stars</li>
            <li> This unit holds more than 23 pills and allows you to keep track of days used by turning the containers to reveal red or green backgrounds under the number of days. We have had it for over a month with no issues. Great product and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this vitamin organizer. As a gastric bypass patient, I take multiple vitamins a day in several doses. This organizer allows me to organize my vitamins a month at a time, and to carry them with me to work and on business travel. The price was perfect!</li>
            <li> i love that you can store all your vitamins for the month, had the ds (duodenal switch) and sometimes i would get lazy and did not load up on vits for the week on time, now i fill all the boxes and i am good for the month, or when a week is up i refill before i am totally out, i would give it 5 stars but sometimes the lids pop open and some are very tight, for the price the little carry case should come with the organizer instead of buying it seperate, i have the monthly, the daily and now i have to order the weekly just so i can have the case to carry in my purse!! wish i could get reimbursed by FSA for it! i have no excuse not to take my vits</li>
            <li> This is very difficult to find on the internet. This 31 day organizer  is the largest one I was able to find and is perfect for my needs. If I have to travel I can take only what I will need  for the length of my trip and will not miss any doses. Very speedy delivery. Exactly as described</li>
            <li> The MedCenter is so helpful for all of my monthly pills.  It keeps me from making any careless dangerous mistakes.</li>
            <li> I take multiple medications, and it takes quite awhile to fill all of the pill boxes, but it&#x27;s well worth the time spent. It&#x27;s easy to keep track of the medication I&#x27;ve taken for the day by turning the pill box over to display a different color. My only complaint is that the base of the organizer has a small footprint, and it&#x27;s easy to accidently knock it over, however the pill boxes do stay closed if this happens.</li>
            <li> Love it. Perfect size for lots of vitamins.</li>
            <li> Fill and forget for 31 days. What is not to love.</li>
            <li> We purchased this for our 83 year old mother.  She needed a tool for counting out her monthly prescriptions from the pharmacy and dividing out her daily dosage.  This does both efficiently and in an organized fashion.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that holds all my medicines and supplements in the slots. I love filling up so far in advance.</li>
            <li> Some of the tabs dont close well or some close too tight.  The individual containers dont always fit securely into the main stand... I would fork out a little more and get something better, or not buy at all and save yourself some money</li>
            <li> This worked perfect for my husband&#x27;s supplement schedule daily.  He has to take several vitamins &amp; minerals throughout the day-three times a day.  It has large compartments enough tot fit 7 plus pills in a meal. They pull out daily and I can refill them once a month instead weekly.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my mom since she has MS and a bad memory &amp; it made it easier for me to fill her medicines monthly since I live out of town rather than coming over weekly to fill them.. The days of the week not only help her identify which pack to grab, but also helps her with remember what day it is. I love the Green/Red system. My only complaint is the compartments easily pop open on their own.</li>
            <li> I had a missing part and returned this, but I probably would have returned it anyway. The concept is good but the execution leaves something to be desired.</li>
            <li> This \\&quot;vitamin organizer\\&quot; is well worth the price.  Setting up pills and supplements for a month at a time is very convenient and a time-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hint: The monthly refill goes much faster if you take out all the containers and group them side by side on your table top.  Then open all the lids so each compartment is easily reachable.  Place all the \\&quot;morning\\&quot; pills, from container for day 1 thru day 31.  Next, insert all the \\&quot;noon\\&quot; pills from day 1 thru 31.  Then the \\&quot;evening\\&quot; pills, and finally the \\&quot;night\\&quot; pills.  You&#x27;ll love how quickly the task goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the reviews that complain about the occasional container lid that doesn&#x27;t close properly, here&#x27;s how I fixed the two problem lids on my organizer.  With a hair-dryer, I heated the plastic for 20 or 30 seconds, then closed the lid while pushing against it toward the back of the container.  By heating it thoroughly, then squeezing it closed, it keeps its shape and remains closed until you need to open it. In my experience, it will continue to work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This fix may sound like a lot of trouble, but it worked for me, and it&#x27;s a LOT LESS TROUBLE than repacking the organizer and returning it.  Give this a try - you&#x27;ll appreciate the benefit of keeping and using the 31-day organizer as it was intended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the one reviewer who complained about the price, consider how much time it can save you.  Moreover, the ingenuity behind its design is worth rewarding by purchasing it, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5-stars, but having to fix a couple of lids that don&#x27;t close properly brought my rating down to 4-stars. (I would give it 4.7 stars if possible.) It&#x27;s still a great product.  I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I take 22 different medications several times a day.  Withouth this medication sorter, my life would be complete chaos.  I used to sort my meds once a week, then bought more units to sort them every 3 weeks.  Then I spotted this and &#x27;voila&#x27;  Once a month I sort my meds and don&#x27;t have to sort through dozens of bottles to fine the right ones.  Plus, if I have to be away for the day, I can take that day&#x27;s compartment with me.</li>
            <li> This product has really helped me organize my med/vitamin regimen. Before I started using it, I frequently found myself short one or two of my daily supplement when I sat down to fill my containers on a weekly basis. Now, I fill all the individual containers for 25-31 days (depending on how many complete &amp;#34;servings&amp;#34; of each one I have. I can instantly see how many days I have to purchase products I&#x27;m short on. It is so much easier to fill all or most of the containers once every three or four weeks rather than once a week, and it doesn&#x27;t take much longer to do so.I also like that I can carry one small container in my purse if I&#x27;m going to be out and about and I will always have my supps with me when it is time to take them.</li>
            <li> I have struggled (valiantly) for years with special needs rescued DOGS! Just like people, my &#x27;kids&#x27; need medications, vitamins, supplements, etc., at all times of the day/night. I have balanced individual &#x27;cups&#x27;, tried muffin cup liners, silicone muffin cups, old jar covers, and people pill cases lined up along the wall,  only to create the ultimate mess on my kitchen, tip them over, get them all confused and oftentimes wet and have to start counting, etc. all over again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took this unit and made it work for me for my 7 dogs. The rows now hold only 7 across with the extras being placed in the cabinet out of the way.&lt;br /&gt;I taped the name of each dog above each up/down column and then set out  distributing pills, etc., in each one. Filling 28 sections accurately for all 7 dogs took me exactly 4 minutes (yeah, I&#x27;ve done this a looongg time). Now I don&#x27;t need 34 different bottles of pills, meds, vitamins, supplements, wheat grass, barley, etc.,  cluttering up the counter all day long and have to go thru this tedious process sometimes 4 times/day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the red/green # colors: Today&#x27;s color is green (GO), no matter what time of day the pills are needed. That way, if a container is still green, I know someone still needs a medication TODAY. All the others are turned to the red (STOP) side so I don&#x27;t confuse any pills or double up on dose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Example:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dogs 1-7&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges: 1-7  8th slot empty (today they are all green to begin the day)&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges: 8-14  8th slot empty  (all red sides)&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges: 15-21 8th slot empty  (all red sides)&lt;br /&gt;Cartridges: 22-28 8th slot empty  (all red sides)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I proceed through the day, when a particular dog&#x27;s cartridge is empty, I place it back in its rabbit hole with the red side showing. That way, I know that particular dog doesn&#x27;t require any more meds today. When I give the last of the meds before bedtime tonight I&#x27;ll ensure all of today&#x27;s cartridges are showing the red (STOP) side in row 1. Then, I&#x27;ll turn row 2 to green so I know tomorrow morning which row I&#x27;m working on and green is \\&quot;GO\\&quot;.  Just repeat for 4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My explanation may sound a bit confusing, but I tried a number of ways and this worked for me without writing on the cartridges, etc. I realize I won&#x27;t have 7 dogs forever, and some may require more than one cartridge at some time, but I still have an empty \\&quot;rabbit hole\\&quot; for the extra cartridges I removed at the end of each row that would handle this extra. This unit is so versatile, I know I&#x27;ll come up with something that works in those situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is made well and each cartridge has 4 good-sized sections with very secure snapping lids. Some I had to almost force closed, but I think that is because it is new. I also tried putting a grainy powder substance in one and flipping it around red/green etc., to see if it would &#x27;leak&#x27; in the narrow rabbit hole that holds it. No mess at all. Nothing escaped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy to have found this. The slant makes it easier for me to see the dogs&#x27; names I taped on the very top (for those days when I&#x27;m so tired I can&#x27;t remember their age sequence!!!). I don&#x27;t regret this purchase at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: 3/2/10 - Liked this so much for the dogs that I recently purchased a second one for my own use. Don&#x27;t know why I waited so long putting up with multiple prescriptions, vitamins and supplements taken at various times/day. So much time wasted opening/closing individual bottles for 27 pills/day. Took me less than 10 minutes to fill up a month&#x27;s worth of &#x27;meds&#x27; once I got this second unit. One of the inserts (day #6) is cracked a bit on a corner, but not enough to return the product. This sits on the bathroom counter easily, takes up minimal space, easily releases each day&#x27;s container and is just the handiest gizmo ever. Should have gotten this for myself much sooner than I did.so I know tomorrow morning which row I&#x27;m working on and green is \\&quot;GO\\&quot;.  Just repeat for 4 days.

            <li> Great medication organizer</li>
            <li> This pill organizer is wonderful.  I bought it for my mother who takes lots of pills.  I was filling another organizer every other week before this darling - now it&#x27;s just once a month and I love it!!  I&#x27;m ordering one today for my father to add to the joy :)    The visiting nurses who come in to my parents home once a week have asked about it and think it&#x27;s a great system too!  That&#x27;s an endorsement!</li>
            <li> If this one won&#x27;t hold ALL your pills, I don&#x27;t know what else would.  I take 13 medications just in the morning and it holds them all with room to spare. Be  prepared to spend a little time filling it each month.</li>
            <li> convenient for anyone using multiple medicatins. My user has no difficulty keeping their medications updated and organized.Fairly affordable and sturdy.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay closed, pills fall out</li>
            <li> Very handy -- I don&#x27;t use it the way it was intended, though (knew that before I bought it). Instead of using one 4-slot thing for 1 day, I use it for 4 days, which means I only need to refill only every 4 months -- handy. The only problem is that I can be a bit clumsy when refilling</li>
            <li> This item is pretty much as advertised. It worked for my 87 year old father quite well. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> The boxes on this do not stay closed very well and we were constantly having to redo them since we travel with the full set of boxes on road trips. We finally gave up and purchased different medication holders. If you never take these anywhere, then it works. My vote would be just to get others that are better quality though than mess with it.</li>
            <li> larger than most with four separate daily compartments -- top tabs are a little tight and tough to shut on some - but overall quality good and about what I expected.  like the switch from red to green as pills consumed with the numbers.  Every little bit helps in the morning and knowing the date is a plus.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased 2 (one for my wife) of the Med Center Monthly Vitamin Organizer with large pill boxes.  The individual boxes held all of our daily pills with no problem. The monthly storage is great.  The only thing is the original setup of the daily pills. However, once set up its great because you don&#x27;t have to organize your pills by the day or week any more. Very convenient.  Recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of supplement and this helps me keeps everything organized with my meals. And Im always have that days pills with me.</li>
            <li> great product! i take tons of meds daily so i wanted to get the vitamin organizer as it is xl. wasn&#x27;t neccessary at all. tons of room! only 4 stars because when you pull out each daily case the 3rd comparrtment for evening/supper meds is ALWAYS open. thankfully i only have 4 meds then and it&#x27;s the only conpartment open each ti.es so i know for sure that is where the loose pills came from.</li>
            <li> I have a number of medications that I need to organize!  This monthly organizer really helps keep me on track!</li>
            <li> This a as wonderful for my mother&lt;br /&gt; Now her medications are all there for her and no mistakes.</li>
            <li> I really like it for my father. He knows if he took his meds for the day. and I only have to pour the meds once a month. For any one who has elderly parents its great</li>
            <li> Unlike most people I have to take around 40 pills a day. Around 16 prescriptions and 9 vitamins and supplements. I&#x27;m only 32 and the doctor&#x27;s keep adding on new diagnosis and prescriptions. It was like Christmas when I got this. So much easier to organize all the prescriptions and vitamin/supplements.</li>
            <li> This is a near perfect pill organizer and fits all my needs of organizing the 20+ pills I take daily. With all the medications I take it&#x27;s a real relief to plan far ahead with such a nice organizer.      Design:  The compartments of each box are huge allowing enough space for each section to hold multiples of large multi-vitamin sized pills.  The red and green facings are also nice and simple touch.    Quality: and the plastic itself is sturdy and can take beating.  My only concern is the compartment hinges appear flimsy and weak.  I&#x27;m hoping none will break off with continued use.</li>
            <li> Always been inconsistent in taking my vitamins - but no more!  This design works.  Instead of opening and closing a gaggle of bottles when I remember to take my vitamins several times a day, which I&#x27;m reluctant to do - I now do it once a month.  It took me 25 minutes to set up the months supply, which is about 20 capsules per day, and now it takes seconds to open and swallow what I need - no fuss, no reluctance, just an easy way to take my vitamins.  The unit sits on my counter where it serves as a reminder, taking up a small space given the function it serves.  Its easy to stay on track both for the day, and the allotment for the time of day.  I&#x27;ve already recommended this to family members, who were interested to witness such an easy way to organize a month&#x27;s vitamins in such a compact unit.  Highly recommended to those who have several pills to take throughout the day.</li>
            <li> pill boxes could have been bigger</li>
            <li> This is a great tool to use especially for the elderly.  Fill it once a month, date on both sides, and the green/red concept work great.  The only suggestion would be to have better quality control on the lids and boxes.  Some of the lids are hard to open, some are loose.  We have had this since mid Jan 2014, will see how long it lasts.  If a single box breaks, can it be ordered as a stand alone item?</li>
            <li> Perfect for managing my elderly Mother&#x27;s medications!!! Easy to use. Helps remind us to refill!</li>
            <li> I was quite sure that this medications holder would be too small  for ALL of our daily pills and supplements.  I was pleasantly surprised!  There&#x27;s even room to spare!</li>
            <li> Several containers had cracked lids right out of the box. Given that considerable force has to be exerted to close the lids, I suspect that eventually the lids will have pieces breaking off along the cracks. My guess is that these cracks appeared in the factory when the lids were being closed for the first time in the assembly lines for packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top-heavy so called foot-print saving design is terrible. What&#x27;s the point of saving foot print when the top is protruding out, it&#x27;s not like you can use that space for anything else. Might as well make it stable by making the foot print as large as the top. It&#x27;s hard to tell from the pic, but once filled, this topples easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several of the lids don&#x27;t stay closed. As the containers are inserted into the box sideways, there&#x27;s no good way of preventing such lids from dumping the pills on the floor as you pull it out. Other lids are really right and need considerable effort to open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main container base has a very unrefined look, close up there are glue lines, (indeed some parts have been glued on) and rough plastic edges, like the plastic products of decades ago. I would have put up with these aesthetics if not for the other problems above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great idea, but needs a lot more refining and perfecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sent mine back. If you just buy one of these, I suggest the smaller model, at least it&#x27;s upright and doesn&#x27;t have the top-heavy design of this model. You can also buy a set of the larger containers and use them on the smaller base. For me, the malfunctioning lids mean it&#x27;s not worth it even to try out the other design.</li>
            <li> a well designed product - very helpful for remembering meds. also, customer service is excellent.  a minor defect was promptly replaced.</li>
            <li> This organizer has GREATLY improved my ability to follow my vitamin supplement routine! No doubt about it. It is wonderful to be able to go an entire month and not really have to think about what supplements I have already taken  and am I doubling up? What did I miss? And then, of course, the missed doses altogether.  I am actually considering another one so I can go two months straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give the item 5 stars but two of the compartments in the daily containers will not stay closed and two are very difficult to open.  Still, I am super pleased with the product and the positive difference it has made in my routine.</li>
            <li> It was an ok product but very top heavy and bulky. Not something easy for the elderly to have to work with.   I returned with no problem at all. Thank you</li>
            <li> This is a fairly large, well-made container, holding four doses of pills per day for thirty-one days. The only complaint I have is that the partitions in the containers make space for each dose somewhat limited. Still, if they were larger, the whole thing (roughly 12&amp;#34; x 12&amp;#34; x 8&amp;#34;) would be much larger.</li>
            <li> This is BRILLIANT! If you take a lot of supplements, especially large pills like fatty acid softgels, you&#x27;ll love this. With four compartments for each day, there is plenty of room for organize your regimen. For those who take prescriptions or smaller pills, there is a smaller version of this same organizer. I see they also have a week long travel case in both sizes. Perfection. This is a HUGE time and mental health saver. No more bottles cluttering up my counter and no more remembering if I took my lunch time supplements or if that was the morning dose.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a great idea as I take several vitamins and suppliments (a couple of medications also). The compartments were fine if I just wanted to use it for my medications, but it does not come close to holding my vitamins. I gave it to my husban for his medications and it he likes it. I think the system is a great idea but the size of the compartments are too small.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT MAKES LIFE SO MUCH EASIER A MONTH AT A TIME. JUST SIT DOWN AND FILL IT ONCE A MONTH AND YOU ALWAYS HAVE YOUR MEDS OR VITAMINS, HERBS ETC READY AT THE RIGHT TIMES EVERY DAY.</li>
            <li> Some issues: as mentioned in other reviews a few of my lids don&#x27;t stay shut. Another thing id didn&#x27;t think about is a lot of supplements are meant to be stored in the containers they&#x27;re sold in (dark, air tight etc) so im careful what I keep in here. Overall its nice to have supplements organized this way. In the morning I just take that days container with me in my purse and am able to take my supplements at the adequate time.</li>
            <li> This is a huge pain to fill up, but once its filled, I am good for a month, so its worth the pain. I like that it has 4 spacious spots. Its enough space for my many vitamins and meds.</li>
            <li> This is a must-have for everyone who takes pill medications. Not taking blood pressure meds on time can kill you. The MedCenter keeps You on track in a way no other device can.</li>
            <li> I take a lot of Meds every month and this makes my life so much easier, it eliminates the question of did I take my Meds or not because I can see if the pill container is full or not. It so much easier than having all those pill bottles around. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.  You won&#x27;t find a better deal then this. I give it my highest recommendation</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful item!  No more filling up pill containers for just a week.  This organizer is filled once a month and you forget about it!  Or you can fill it up every week,  If that is still your preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller was super fast with her delivery.  Recommend this product and seller very highly.</li>
            <li> Bought two - one each for my wife and myself as the care giver.  After she died it was not so necessry for me and I no longer use such a device.  But you never know.</li>
            <li> I already knew the benefits of using pill cases - sometimes I can&#x27;t even remember what shirt I&#x27;m wearing, much less remember whether I took my morning calcium - &amp;#34;I did, didn&#x27;t I?  I remember... no wait, or was that yesterday?&amp;#34;  Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bariatric patient, I have to take quite a few supplements a day.  I had an issue when my older, one week pill case was too small to fit all my calcium pills - what a pain!!  These are great - large enough to hold all my pills, and it&#x27;s WONDERFUL only needing to fill cases once a month.  Have been using for over a year, and none of the tabs for shutting them have broken either, which had been a problem with previous cases I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this to anyone with lots of Rx&#x27;s they need to manage or who need to take supplements daily.</li>
            <li> Having the ability to keep track of multiple medications/vitamins for a month&#x27;s span comes in very useful. This product does a good job with its basic needs. It is a very large product. The only major drawback of it is that each of the individual containers for each day is segmented into 4 different compartments (Morning, afternoon, evening, night). Each of those 4 compartments are small, so if you have a lot of medication that requires being taken 4 times, bare that in mind before purchasing.</li>
            <li> Love this medcenter. It is a 31 day organizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I am constantly going to the gym/work/school. It is really easy to take one with you and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only have to replace the meds inside of them once a month, which is a huge time saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I place about 9 pills in each slot which each organizer has 4 in this order - Morning \\&quot;Breakfast\\&quot; / Noon \\&quot;Lunch\\&quot; / Evening \\&quot;Supper\\&quot; / Night \\&quot;Bedtime\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Which is great because most multivitamins or supplements in general require you to take them about 3 times during the day. And you have a slot at night so you could place a sleep aid of your choice inside. Mine is melatonin and zinc magnesium aspartate (which helps build muscles while you slumber!). There is plenty of room inside each slot for easy storage, so you get the most bang for your buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So very good for gym enthusiasts or someone who just needs his medication threw out the month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Sometimes the lids can either be to loose or to strong. People with frail hands would have issues opening some of them, or they will open and spill your pills in your backpack/purse or what ever your carrying bag may be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: So, most of the cases were not closing all the way anymore, and I have been forced to tape them shut. Which is a huge inconvenience. Now it lays unused in my closet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this, even after looking at some of the negative reviews, so I knew what could potentially irritate me about this product. It gets the job done. The pill slots for each time of day are the same as anything you would buy in a pharmacy. I like the fact that it has &amp;#34;Morning, Noon, Night AND Bedtime&amp;#34;  That is where it really benefited me.  I take 2 multivitamin gummies and 2 fiber gummies that are pretty large, on top of all my regular pills. I use to take my multivitamin gummy and fiber gummy in the morning with my first set of meds, BUT they dont all fit in the Morning slot. It&#x27;s ok because they offer a Night AND Bedtime slot. So I take my regular meds at dinner (Night)  and then before I go to bed I take my other gummies from the bedtime slot.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Gets the job done, stores all my pills&lt;br /&gt;Convienant that I can grab and go the individual days. This works great for me because I travel. So I will just pull out the days I need for that week and they are already ready to go when I get in to my hotel.&lt;br /&gt;Saves time for me taking all my pills out each day of their prescription bottles, because I spend 20min at the beginning of the month filling the entire organizer, so I can grab and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;As other reviewers said, the latches for the slots either get stuck and are hard to open OR they don&#x27;t truly click closed unless you put some effort into it. So this is not user friendly for people that arn&#x27;t very strong or are simply impatient like me and don&#x27;t feel like battling with a plastic latch.&lt;br /&gt;The pill slots are a normal size and don&#x27;t fit many larger pills or gummy type vitamins in the one slot, you would have to utilize a different slot. There is a bigger version of this organizer that the company offers, but it&#x27;s another $10-20 and after reading the reviews was not willing to pay even more for a product that needs some work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps!  Again..it saves me time overall and is convienant since I travel and can grab what I need so it serves its basic purpose, but definetly needs improvement in the quality...especially for what they are charging.</li>
            <li> The pill container is really the only thing on the market that allows you to do a month at a time (there is another option with a alarm clock). Design is good, but the quality is sub-par. Most of the compartments don&#x27;t close and secure that well.</li>
            <li> Thus far the product is well worth its&#x27; price. It works just fine! I&#x27;m am very satisfied and would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a larger pill case and this fits the bill.  It is little tricky learning the best way to open/close each container but once you get the nack it is fairly easy.  the pill boxes close securely and I&#x27;ve had no problem with pills falling out.  The footprint is pretty significant but it still takes up a lot less space than all the pill bottles would.  I find the red/green color coding handy as it is a quick visual reminder if I have not taken my daily meds.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these (one for hubby &amp; one for me) and it&#x27;s working great! Kind of a pain to fill them at the beginning of the month but once it&#x27;s done, no more worries! Not only does it remind us when to reorder meds (only a few green numbers left), it reminds us what day it is (one of the downfalls to being retired...the days just run into one another). The red numbers mean we&#x27;ve taken the meds and the green numbered boxes are yet to be taken. Also, each of the four boxes (Morning, Noon, Evening, Night) are big enough to hold the biggest pill or vitamin known to man! Lots of room and room to spare. Would highly recommend this system!</li>
            <li> Everything about this product satisfies my organizational spirit.  Finally, a monthly vitamin/medication system that really works.  Each four compartment pill box has a date (1 through 31) stamped on each end.  One side green.  The other side red.  Green means filled, pills not yet taken, and red means empty, already taken for that particular day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pill boxes themselves are more than adequate size in width, height, and depth.  I take about 12 vitamins daily, ranging in size from tiny to &amp;#34;choke a horse&amp;#34;.  They all fit nicely inside the cubby holes with plenty of room to spare.  Some have complained that they&#x27;re too small, or of the lids being either very difficult to open, or made of sub quality materials.  I couldn&#x27;t disagree more.  They&#x27;re perfect.  And I can see from clear across the room whether or not I&#x27;ve taken my pills for the day.  It is big and bulky and exactly the size it should be to get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m planning to buy another for my mother.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom and dad since the are taking more vitamins ad regular pills.  The compartments are big enough for all of them.  The red and green ends are good so they are aware of what the have taken and not.  So nice my husband got one too.</li>
            <li> After recent surgery I found myself with a multitude of medications and vitamins that I needed to take through the day. This organizer allowed me to separate them into 4 batches for the day. It also allowed me to set up the full month without having to search for all the individual containers every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little worried because of prior reviews that talked about the individual pill containers being either hard to close or hard to open. I&#x27;ve found that with a little pressure on the side of the container the snaps work just fine. This was not a problem for me. They snap open and closed mostly without any extra effort. When there is a problem snapping it closed it is resolved with very little extra effort.</li>
            <li> I take prescription medications and quite a few supplements throughout the day.  I was using the weekly boxes but I was having to fill 2 per week and I wasn&#x27;t staying on top of it.  So I would miss a lot of my supplements.  Once I started using this, I could fit both my meds and my supplements in the same container and only having to fill it once a month has made things so much better.  Yes it takes a little time ONE time per month but it is definitely worth both the time and the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this item about 3 or 4 years ago. I am still using the very same one. I only checked back to see if the product has been updated because I&#x27;d had this for so long. It&#x27;s great and still very useful. I use it daily and the writing still has not worn off and the numbers are intact. And, filling it monthly helps me keep track of when I need refills. Also, if you have to take meds at different times of teh day, this is ideal.</li>
            <li> I get tired of refilling organizers every week, and it&#x27;s difficult to organize if I&#x27;m traveling for more than a week at a time.  This product gives me the ability to organize once a month, and take out however many days as needed for trips, placing them in a plastic bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned the compartments would not be big enough to hold all my supplements. There are four compartments, and I can comfortably fit four supplements in each. The container for each day is shorter than other organizers I have used, however they are much deeper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  like this design because it makes it easy to stash in my purse for the day and easy for travel.  Anything to make my life easier!</li>
            <li> Before I ordered this pill organizer, I read the reviews and should have relied on the complaints some people have.  Frequently, the compartments come open and all the pills fall out when you are getting pills out for another time of day.  I&#x27;ve tried the methods noted in the reviews to slightly push the lids in or out to open or shut the compartments.  But that does not work well on most days.  I double check the compartments when I fill them to try and ensure this does not happen.  But the slightest motion seems to unhinge some of the lids.  I would not recommend this pill organizer unless you are ok with hunting on the floor for spilled pills.  My window for return expired around May 20th, so I&#x27;m stuck with this one, and just may go back to the weekly organizers.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a while now and really like it.  Yes - it does have some issues with the opening and closing of the sections, but not so much that it has made into a raving lunatic.  On the contrary, I love being able to keep all my pills organized for the whole month.  Having the green on one end to indicate the column is full and red on the other end to indicate the column is empty is a great idea!  And, this one is big enough to fit all my daily vitamins and supplements that I normally take.  I am extremely happy with it and definitely recommend it to anyone trying to keep control of lots (and lots) of pills and vitamins on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;m one of the &amp;#34;lucky&amp;#34; folks who have to take medication frequently.  In fact, I take medication 6 times per day.  This pill organizer makes it far easier to set up my medication for a long period at a time, rather than having to sit down every single week to lay out all my pills.  Since I take pills four times daily and a liquid twice daily, this is just perfect.  It does take up a large amount of space on whatever surface you plan to set it on, but if you&#x27;re concerned about the possibility of missing an important medication, I highly recommend this organizer.</li>
            <li> This item is great for those who take the same pills day after day.  One time and you are done for the month.  Looks great and holds all the pills you would want.  My husband and I each have our own.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> love this dispenser.  i take a lot of supplements and this is the first container that all of them fit and keep organized.</li>
            <li> saves time and i like that</li>
            <li> This is the perfect solution for those of us taking medications and vitamins.  The containers are large enough to accommodate both.  Filling it up only once a month is a plus!!!!  I just purchased another one for my Mom.  We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this organizer!</li>
            <li> I ordered this medication organizer for my husband who takes several prescription medications as well as many over-the-counter supplements. The compartments are nice and big and can hold his pills just fine. But, several of the compartments do not close tightly. This could lead to a problem if he takes out one of the boxes and one of his medications falls out unnoticed. If we continue to have issues I will have to send the organizer back, which I would really hate to do.</li>
            <li> This thing has made life a little easier. i like being able to put a months worth of medicine in at once.</li>
            <li> Good concept, but individual pill box lids was hard to open for older persons.  Plenty of pill cavity room for time of day dosing.  Pill case should have on-the-wall mounting design to save table top space.</li>
            <li> Purchased this pill organizer while caring for my mother.  It made the dispensing of her medications very easy for all involved.&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
            <li> If you are like me and hate filling your pill packs weekly, then this is perfect!!  Makes it easy to see what day you are on and the red and green sides are great!  Some work could be done on making them all stay closed better though.  I like that I can fill them once a month and be done with it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed in the quality of stand.  For the price, I would have expected a little better finish.  It&#x27;s just plastic after all.  The back portion of the stand, is a separate piece, instead of being one, molded piece.  This wouldn&#x27;t normally be a problem, but the piece of plastic they use, is bowed out and appears to be hastily &amp;#34;heat glued&amp;#34; to the main stand (heat glue is where they used a hot knife like item to get the plastics to melt together).  The fact that the piece bows out eliminates the option of laying the item down on the back for an alternate configuration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this item work, yes.  It offers 4 compartments per day for supplements, vitamins or prescriptions.  But for the price of the item, I wouldn&#x27;t have expected the resulting finishing issues.</li>
            <li> The product is a good idea, but the quality of the doors are very poor. Some of the doors open to easily. As you pull the container out of the holding base the door pops open and because the opening of the doors face down, the pills fall out and go rolling all over the place. Most were the Evening compartment door that open to easily. To remedy that I put the containers in the base upside down so if it does pop open the pills will stay in, although the number of the day is upside down.  Some of the compartments doors do not seat properly. You can see space gaps. So some compartments are not air tight. Ants could crawl in easily.&lt;br /&gt;I can not find a large weekly pill sorter where you can remove each day&#x27;s pills as needed, to replace our old ones we got for free at a seminar years ago.  Some doors no longer stay close. I was hoping this new sorter was it, and it could be if the company has better quality control.</li>
            <li> If you have to take a lot of meds, this is the way to go. Also, I have some pretty awful memory issues so this helps ALOT. Easy to open and close for even shaky hands and very sturdy. I would order again although with the great quality of this, I don&#x27;t think I would ever have to.</li>
            <li> Each numbered compartment has four (Morning, Noon, Evening, Night) each one is 1 3/8&amp;#34; x 1&amp;#34; x 3/4&amp;#34;. I was using a 7 day morning/evening unit before and I now have 2 extra slots if I need them and I can fill a month at a time which weekly was getting to be a real drag. If you have a lot of pills this will probably do you fine and there are some extra things you can purchase to carry like a week of containers at a time. The containers are a little stiff to open when new, they seem to be loosening up some.</li>
            <li> Ok I really like how this product organized my vitamins.  The only drawback was that around 2 of the compartments wouldnt close fully or kept snapping back open.  They werent overfull so I think it was a chink in the manufacturer&#x27;s armor.  Since there were only 2 bad compartments out of a hundred and something, I kept the product and am satisfied.</li>
            <li> My hubby has multiple medical problems and has to take a large number of pills each day at different times.  His smaller pill case needed to be replaced and this fit the bill.  We like the large compartments. What is also helpful is that the color coding on the compartments. He sometimes forget to take his pill but the color coding will help.The only negative is that it is big and you need to find a place for it, LOL. I would it again.  Made well. .</li>
            <li> I had weight loss surgery and because of that I need to supplement with many vitamins. This works great to handle my 20-30 pills a day, and splits them into 4 time slots. Each slot can hold a great many vitamins, and I&#x27;m not talking just little pills. When I carry a day container with me I do wrap a rubber band around it, as some of the lids will pop open occasionally.</li>
            <li> If you hate getting out bottles of pills each day or week, this is the best solution. Do it just once a month. It is much more convenient to do that and be done for a while. Although the holder of all those little pack is a little awkwardly shaped, it keeps them together. We had an issue with a few of the individual lids that fit either too loosely or could barely get them closed with all my might. Other than that minor inconvenience, it really is a nice solution.</li>
            <li> I got this item in a few days, and it works as expected. There are a few minor notes to be aware of, though not enough to take off a start for (more of just a heads-up):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Some of the container lids can be a little difficult to open. Out of the 30 container boxes (which have four compartments each), about 7 of mine required a little effort to open (so, really, about 7/120, so that&#x27;s not too bad). I only mention this for people who have arthritis in their fingers and who may have a little difficulty on just a few of the container lids. Pressing in the center of the container compartment helps when closing since it bends the lid out just a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When fully loaded, as in the image above, larger fingers may find it just a tad challenging to get to the inner day containers. The containers fit snugly into the slots (though, not overly so, they&#x27;re just well-fitting).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Each pill container compartment is about 3/4&amp;#34; deep x  1 1/2&amp;#34; wide, x 3/4&amp;#34;, and each day container has 4 compartments. If you take A LOT of pills, or if the pills are horse pills, and if you don&#x27;t need the NOON and EVENING compartments, this might still work well, otherwise you might have problems getting all your pills into one container. Again, this is only if you take A LOT of pills or if your pills are very LARGE. [ As an aside, for people who take lots of pills many times per day, as I once did the first year after an organ transplant, you might want to look at crafting bead jars. I used these the first year: http://www.amazon.com/Storage-Stackable-Containers-Crafts-Findings/dp/B001AS6OLK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_7?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1415659765&amp;sr&#x3D;8-7&amp;keywords&#x3D;craft+bead+jars , and just connected the 10-15 jars I needed for each day and marked them with a dry erase pen--again, this is just an fyi for anyone who&#x27;s going through the same thing right now).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I&#x27;m loving this MedCenter, though. If you can get all your meds refilled on the same day, then it really isawesome to do the whole month (plus, you can tell right off if you refill is over/short). I was getting tired of having to do the weekly pill exercise, and now it&#x27;s just once a month, and I just track when each Rx is about to run out with a calendar (I can&#x27;t get my pills all on the same schedule).</li>
            <li> Just bought this 31-Day Vitamin Organizer, very poor quality, some snap lids cannot close, and some are very hard to open. Had to return it. Not worth to buy.</li>
            <li> I feel like maybe I got a dud?  I don&#x27;t know.  I suppose if you don&#x27;t want to take a container with you when you are going anywhere, and these will sit calmly on your counter, then they are fine.  Mine, I put in my purse to go with me during the day and invariably they just pop open and the pills/vitamins go everywhere.  I recently traveled for a few days, so I took four days with me in a zip lock bag... a good thing since yep, they opened and spilled everywhere.  It seems like such a waste of time for me to sit down and organize my vitamins when they wind up falling out anyways!  I am going to try something else.  This is a great concept;  bad execution.</li>
            <li> we have two of these and this one was for my father .it was perfect for him,easy to load and easy to handle.he was 90.</li>
            <li> I returned it almost right away.  Terrible quality.  All the reviewers who complained about ill-fitting covers were spot-on.  Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I bought this to fill for my mother who lives in an assisted living facility. Pros: It holds all her pills. Cons: It is very difficult to fill. You need to take out each cassette separately and open four boxes for every single day. Some of the lids are close to impossible to open for me. I can&#x27;t imagine an older person having to open these. But the worst part is, the manufacturer didn&#x27;t realize there are seven days in a week. There are eight cassettes across, so you don&#x27;t know what day you&#x27;re filling unless you keep it in your head. If the manufacturer had added one more row to the bottom and made seven columns with the days of the week across the top, like a write-on calendar, it would have been so much easier to use. I actually hate filling this little baby, but it&#x27;s the one the facility likes best and there are actually no better ones made that fit my ideological description.</li>
            <li> I have owned the regular day pill organizer for a&lt;br /&gt;long time and had to upgrade because I added&lt;br /&gt;some larger pills and vitamins to my daily routine&lt;br /&gt;and the boxes of the organizer were too small&lt;br /&gt;to hold everything without squishing. This has&lt;br /&gt;much bigger boxes and everything fits, with room&lt;br /&gt;to spare. However, it has some features that I do&lt;br /&gt;not like and that is the reason for the three stars&lt;br /&gt;( the other is a definite 5 star). In the other, the&lt;br /&gt;holder is upright and the individual containers&lt;br /&gt;slide into straight up boxes. In this one, the area&lt;br /&gt;that holds the containers is sloped forward at 45&#x27;,&lt;br /&gt;making it less stable and the containers more&lt;br /&gt;difficult to slide in and out. Also, the snap closer&lt;br /&gt;covers of the individual boxes are much more&lt;br /&gt;difficult to use- they are hard to open and some do&lt;br /&gt;not stay closed. They were also very difficult to&lt;br /&gt;close, until I discovered the trick of putting pressure&lt;br /&gt;on the front edge of the cover, to bend it slightly&lt;br /&gt;as it is snapped closed. Part of the problem seems&lt;br /&gt;to be that the plastic sides of the containers are&lt;br /&gt;relatively soft and since they are large, the walls&lt;br /&gt;tend to bend inwards when you are trying to close&lt;br /&gt;the lids. I will continue to use this because I need&lt;br /&gt;the space but I like the design of the Monthly Pill&lt;br /&gt;Holder much better.</li>
