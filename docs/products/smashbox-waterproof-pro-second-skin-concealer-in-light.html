            <li>Personally I find that the liquid or cream concealers come off way too easy and that the stick kind are the best if you don&#x27;t wear foundation.</li>

            <li>I APPLIED THIS PRODUCT TO THE TOP OF MY HAND</li>
            <li>love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Very nice just make sure you shake very well before using.</li>
            <li>super awesome, it works great on my pale skin</li>
            <li>I was worried I&#x27;d run out very quickly</li>
            <li>Super product and super service!!</li>
            <li>The color is fine.</li>
            <li>I really feel that this is amazing</li>
            <li>I then put my arm under the sink and then allowed the water to LIGHTLY run over it.</li>
            <li>the light shade is a bit too tan</li>
            <li>Generally I have good self esteem</li>
            <li>A lot more watery than I expected, but still manages to conceal fairly well.  </li>
            <li>However, I am very fair, even in summer, and this was very dark on me.</li>
            <li>I did use it again however when I didn&#x27;t feel like using foundation for a full face of make up in the morning before work</li>
            <li>It does how ever from a distance have good coverage though this tube might last me a month tops.</li>
            <li>I returned it for a full and quick refund.</li>
            <li>Will not order again due to size of tube and not so great out come.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>-it needs to be put in place quickly</li>
            <li>It is creamy and highly pigmented and easy to blend.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this for lightening under eyes and for high lighting.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t wear foundation so this is great for covering up little blemishes or redness.</li>
            <li>It is waterproof, which I love, especially in the summer.</li>
            <li>once I used for the first time and felt texture.</li>
            <li>I love this concealer- especially for the price!</li>
            <li>and this covers up my blemishes very well and does not irritate my skin at all!</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the way it blended into my skin (not directly under eyes</li>
            <li>however, as long as you shake it before using, it&#x27;s a fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li>I really wish Smashbox hadn&#x27;t discontinued it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to place over a scar and be able to wet it and not have the makeup come off&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I cant really wear it becauase its too dark, but it gives full coverage and its super creamy, I really reccomend it!</li>
            <li>It is&lt;br /&gt;quite difficult to find, but glad I was able to purchase this throught Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not light enough for my fair skin.</li>
            <li>I am pretty fair and this color, although the lightest can still be a little dark for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my hand due to vitiligo, and while I still haven&#x27;t found anything that is a perfect color match (very hard to do with vitiligo) and that covers completely</li>
            <li>I put a tester amount of the top of my arm, then allowed it to dry for several minutes.</li>
            <li>It washed almost entirely off right away</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been looking around for some new concealers to cover it.</li>
            <li>I have very light Asian skin, so concealers are always too dark and orangey or too light and pink toned.</li>
            <li>, I also believe that this product is also very old and is or almost is near</li>
            <li>This product smelled old.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Only thing I would recommend is that you be sure to get a dark enough color to account for your summer tan.</li>
            <li>I have clear, blemish free skin and small pores.</li>
            <li>Came early which was great, only problem was when I opened the package, wtf teeny tiny lil tube.</li>
            <li>This product has a very peculiar smell, like it has been sitting in the shelf for a long period of time</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just the right amount of yellow, and when you first put it on it looks too dark, but after blending, the color lightens up a little</li>
            <li>my only complaint is that it&#x27;s not that light....</li>
            <li>this is my skin color which is light but not fair ....</li>

            <li> this is my skin color which is light but not fair ....</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really have to use a lot, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This product is creamy, spreads easily, a small amount dabbed gently will cover skin discoloration.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> It went on with a gritty feel and seemed to have pooled up in all of my pores, not a smooth natural look.</li>
            <li> I thought my skin was just dry</li>
            <li> My grandma got this tiny bottle three years ago, wears it every day, and still has half a tube.</li>
            <li> but so little goes such a long way!</li>
            <li> Tube was way smaller than I expected, and honestly a little runny at 1st.....</li>
            <li> I know with red you&#x27;re supposed to have green concealer</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very drying in a thin way.</li>
            <li> , I SMELLED THAT IT HAD AGED OUT OF ITS SHELF LIFE AND WAS ROTTEN; I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY....</li>
            <li> It blends well, isn&#x27;t too shiny or matte and the small tube will last a long time as a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I tried it immediately, upon opening the tube, a very strong oil base almost lacquer thinner smell came out.</li>
            <li> Little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a small red birthmark on my face</li>
            <li> Not sure how this happened cause I exfoliate and moisturize regularly.</li>
            <li> It is small and a little pricey, but you only need a drop or 2!  </li>
            <li> but was too dark for my skin.</li>
            <li> I personally like that it is not super thick.</li>
            <li> Seriously, who says that and thinks that&#x27;s totally acceptable?</li>
            <li> it is subject to repeated hand washing during the day.</li>
            <li> I can just use this on a few areas then pat some powder and add bronzer and am out the door.</li>
            <li> Not sure why...</li>
            <li> and it does not feel thick at all.</li>
            <li> Product was no good.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed with the size , A little watery for me .</li>
            <li> after using this product a little bit longer, I realized it gave me very bad dry spots</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very thick</li>
            <li> This concealer is insanely watery, it leaks out of the container when I open it.</li>
            <li> I just applied it on a faint scar on my forehead, and it did not cover it at all.</li>
            <li> Also, texture is very thin and sort of watery.</li>
            <li> It is too bad that Smashbox does not make this product anymore.  </li>
            <li> Too bad</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Awesome product,lasts all day,covers redness ,blemishes and discoloration. I am hooked.</li>
            <li> Thinner than used to be, but still quite usable!</li>
            <li> This product smelled old. I returned it for a full and quick refund.</li>
            <li> Super product and super service!!</li>
            <li> super awesome, it works great on my pale skin</li>
            <li> Product was no good. It separated and was to runny to even use. Sending it back.</li>
            <li> This concealer is literally amazing. I have very light Asian skin, so concealers are always too dark and orangey or too light and pink toned. This stuff is perfect! There&#x27;s just the right amount of yellow, and when you first put it on it looks too dark, but after blending, the color lightens up a little bit.it is definitely waterproof and goes on like a dream. It is creamy and highly pigmented and easy to blend. Love it! Shipping was fast too.</li>
            <li> This is a really amazing product! You can use the smallest amount for the biggest area! My grandma got this tiny bottle three years ago, wears it every day, and still has half a tube. I cant really wear it becauase its too dark, but it gives full coverage and its super creamy, I really reccomend it!</li>
            <li> My favorite concealer.  Truly like a second skin with great coverage!</li>
            <li> Amazing coverage and it does not feel thick at all. It dries very quick and I am so happy I purchased this. This concealer has become a staple in my makeup collection. I really feel that this is amazing and I hope I can always purchase this. Great concealer, I&#x27;m very pleased with the light shade and I am between an nc25-nc30. It&#x27;s perfect and covers blemishes and undereye area like a dream. Definitely recommend...</li>
            <li> This product is creamy, spreads easily, a small amount dabbed gently will cover skin discoloration.  I love it under the eyes to give the face a lift.  The color blends into skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product has a very peculiar smell, like it has been sitting in the shelf for a long period of time</li>
            <li> This concealer is insanely watery, it leaks out of the container when I open it. I think it has been opened and used before, as when I received it, the container appears to be squished (like you would have used it) and the product was all over the insides and the lid.  The product doesn&#x27;t cover at all my skin. I just applied it on a faint scar on my forehead, and it did not cover it at all. I planned on buying this concealer for school, but I will have to end up buying another concealer.</li>
            <li> Was a little disappointed with the size , A little watery for me . But it works .Wish i order more colours</li>
            <li> I bought this to cover a scar. The color is fine. But it is misleading to call this product waterproof. I put a tester amount of the top of my arm, then allowed it to dry for several minutes. I then put my arm under the sink and then allowed the water to LIGHTLY run over it. It washed almost entirely off right away</li>
            <li> This was such a great product for swimming this summer! Only thing I would recommend is that you be sure to get a dark enough color to account for your summer tan.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this concealer!  I really wish Smashbox hadn&#x27;t discontinued it.  It&#x27;s the best waterproof concealer that I&#x27;ve found and it covers so well!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST concealer.  It is too bad that Smashbox does not make this product anymore.  It is&lt;br /&gt;quite difficult to find, but glad I was able to purchase this throught Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is the best concealer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> llove love love it. totally unavailable at sephora. or the one on the lv strip by the venetian. it is waterproof to an extent . sets on its own but stays better if use a setting powder</li>
            <li> A lot more watery than I expected, but still manages to conceal fairly well.  If you need a lot of coverage, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Love it! I just keep buying more.</li>
            <li> It went on great, and it feels amazing. I normally don&#x27;t wear foundation so this is great for covering up little blemishes or redness. It is waterproof, which I love, especially in the summer. However, I am very fair, even in summer, and this was very dark on me. I mixed it with some lotion and then set it with powder that was in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I love this concealer.  It blends well, isn&#x27;t too shiny or matte and the small tube will last a long time as a little goes a long way.  Too bad I believe this has been continued by Smashbox.  Not sure why...it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Nice product but was too dark for my skin. Quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this for lightening under eyes and for high lighting. This product is not for that at all so I was kind of upset once I used for the first time and felt texture. I didn&#x27;t use it again for about a week or 2. I did use it again however when I didn&#x27;t feel like using foundation for a full face of make up in the morning before work and I fell in love with the way it blended into my skin (not directly under eyes but you def can use it there). This product is perfect for covering up your redness around the nose and cheek area and not having to do a full face foundation routine. I can just use this on a few areas then pat some powder and add bronzer and am out the door. Truly am happy I found something like this. If on fence about color I am olive skin toned. Also, texture is very thin and sort of watery. You can build it up though if wanted. I personally like that it is not super thick.</li>
            <li> Tube was way smaller than I expected, and honestly a little runny at 1st.....however, as long as you shake it before using, it&#x27;s a fantastic product!  It is small and a little pricey, but you only need a drop or 2!  I&#x27;ll def be buying again!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a small red birthmark on my face and I&#x27;ve been looking around for some new concealers to cover it. I know with red you&#x27;re supposed to have green concealer but whenever I do that it looks like I have a bruise on my face and then some thoughtless person makes a comment. Generally I have good self esteem but I cringe every time I get a &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that on your face?&amp;#34; comment. Seriously, who says that and thinks that&#x27;s totally acceptable? If you&#x27;re like me or you have issues with breakouts and want to avoid those kinds of comments then don&#x27;t get this product. It doesn&#x27;t have the best coverage. The only reason I gave this two stars is because it did stay on all day. Personally I find that the liquid or cream concealers come off way too easy and that the stick kind are the best if you don&#x27;t wear foundation.The search continues....</li>
            <li> This stuff rocks. Love it. Long lasting. Great coverage.  Little goes a long way</li>
            <li> This concealer went on very smooth and is great coverage for under eye area. But I wanted more coverage for pregancy mask of freckles on my forehead.</li>
            <li> This is a great concealer from smashbox. Brought the color in light and it matches perfect. You don&#x27;t really have to use a lot, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The shade works but it&#x27;s very drying in a thin way. It does have good staying power though.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hand due to vitiligo, and while I still haven&#x27;t found anything that is a perfect color match (very hard to do with vitiligo) and that covers completely this one is one of the best. Of course because the makeup goes on the back of my hand it is subject to repeated hand washing during the day. I try to avoid getting soap and water on that spot but of course it happens to some degree. But the makeup stays put! I have tried this on my face-the light shade is a bit too tan and it&#x27;s very thick-it needs to be put in place quickly or it dries. But it does what it claims. It conceals. Smashbox makes excellent products, I am a fan!</li>
            <li> love smashbox makeup and this is a great concealer.</li>
            <li> I bought this to place over a scar and be able to wet it and not have the makeup come off&lt;br /&gt;I can truly say that it worked and the coverage was great!!!</li>
            <li> I love this concealer- especially for the price! I was worried I&#x27;d run out very quickly but so little goes such a long way! I have really sensitive skin and this covers up my blemishes very well and does not irritate my skin at all!</li>
            <li> Came early which was great, only problem was when I opened the package, wtf teeny tiny lil tube. I tried it immediately, upon opening the tube, a very strong oil base almost lacquer thinner smell came out. It went on with a gritty feel and seemed to have pooled up in all of my pores, not a smooth natural look. I have clear, blemish free skin and small pores. Not sure how this happened cause I exfoliate and moisturize regularly. It does how ever from a distance have good coverage though this tube might last me a month tops. Will not order again due to size of tube and not so great out come.</li>
            <li> I AM A MAKE-UP ARTIST, THE MOMENT I APPLIED THIS PRODUCT TO THE TOP OF MY HAND, I SMELLED THAT IT HAD AGED OUT OF ITS SHELF LIFE AND WAS ROTTEN; I HAD TO THROW IT AWAY....AMAZON DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT FROM SMASHBOX ANYMORE; THEY ARE SELLING YOU ROTTEN PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Oily thicker texture. Stays on all day regardless of weather and if swimming.</li>
            <li> Very nice just make sure you shake very well before using.</li>
            <li> Not light enough for my fair skin. Very yellow too.</li>
            <li> The formula is pretty good and has good coverage my only complaint is that it&#x27;s not that light....I like getting the lightest shade in concealer  sand this is my skin color which is light but not fair ....so if ur fair idk how well this would be fore u unless u like ur concealer to be a bit darker...it was the lightest shade I saw for this so just for a reference but otherwise I&#x27;m happy. [UPDATE] after using this product a little bit longer, I realized it gave me very bad dry spots, I didn&#x27;t realize it was even this concealer until I stopped and started using it again. I thought my skin was just dry In those places but it was definitely this concealer, I also believe that this product is also very old and is or almost is near it&#x27;s expiration date.</li>
            <li> This concealer is my savior.  It lasts over a year I&#x27;d say and sometimes I do my makeup twice a day.  I am pretty fair and this color, although the lightest can still be a little dark for my skin.  I make it work though with a lighter powder or mixing it with my paler foundation.  It covers blemishes so well I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;d be without it!</li>
            <li> Best concealer ever!!!  love love love this product.</li>
            <li> works well on red spots.</li>
