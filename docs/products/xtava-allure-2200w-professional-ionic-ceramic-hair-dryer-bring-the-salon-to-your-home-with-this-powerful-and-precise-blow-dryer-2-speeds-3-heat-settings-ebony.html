            <li>but so far so good - have had it about a week or so.</li>
            <li>It has 3 choices of speed and 3 heat settings, cool, warm and hot.  </li>
            <li>Very strong power, dries hair fast and easily.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it&#x27;s an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made..</li>
            <li>super cool , I love it</li>
            <li>It gets hot quick and comes with its own attachments already.</li>
            <li>I loved the flat iron so much that I decided to look at the hair dryers from Xtava and this one has really good reviews.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of it and the weight is just right.</li>
            <li>The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does what it says -- it effectively smoothes hair and significantly helps reduce frizz.</li>
            <li>Very powerful.</li>
            <li>A very powerful dryer.</li>
            <li>VERY powerful, and with 3 heat settings, and two speed settings, this has everything the pro&#x27;s want ....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight, and super easy to handle.</li>
            <li>i then proceeded to use my round brush to blow out my hair and it worked out very nicely!</li>
            <li>Light weight and powerful!</li>
            <li>Air drying is fine, but when you are in a hurry, or are looking to style your hair a special way, sometimes you need a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>love the tourmaline Ionic Ceramic blow dryer, it is very gentle on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great Hairdryer, affordable price, delivery was quick, like the packaging and the extra hair drying tips you get by email.</li>
            <li>And I love how hot it gets-</li>
            <li>but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  </li>
            <li>After using this dryer for about a month I am very pleased with its performance thus far.</li>
            <li>the price this is a budget friendly dryer that has done the job.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>It dries the hair quickly and precisely.  </li>
            <li>Makes me hair smooth and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful hair dryer it isn&#x27;t the most powerful hair dryer I have ever seen</li>
            <li>My hair comes out super smooth.  </li>
            <li>When I used the dryer I was even more pleased because my hair felt sooooo soft and was so shiny.</li>
            <li>In a word, wow!  I&#x27;ve been using the Allure for 2 weeks now, and I&#x27;m thrilled that I bought it.  </li>
            <li>So excited to finally have found something that actually is a good as it claims to be.</li>
            <li>that does the job right!</li>
            <li>So I went looking on my beloved Amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews, and ended up ordering this for about the same price I paid for the Revlon one.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new hair dryer!!</li>
            <li>I love my new hair dryer!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Conclusion: Great product and I would recommend it to every single one person in this planet!</li>
            <li>Very good, not too heavy hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s beautifully designed - slick and stylish, and very sleek!!</li>
            <li>This is a great blow dryer and not very noisy at all.</li>
            <li>I wish the hot air would come out a bit faster but overall great hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Great quality and dried my whole head of hair in minutes which is wonderful after I allow myself a few more minutes of sleep in the morning.</li>
            <li>I never realized that a good blow dryer could make such a difference on the out come of my hair.</li>
            <li>It has 2 heat settings as well as the option for a cool blast here and there.</li>
            <li>Powerful, light weight, multi-heating options.</li>
            <li>Styling hair is an art and a Stylist is only as good as her tools.</li>
            <li>Powerful and light weight..</li>
            <li>I find that reassuring, since most men that I know don&#x27;t really use one,  therefore,  how could they know what we need.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-It has the options I use: two speeds, three temperature ranges, cool air shot, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It just depends really on what you prefer, if you would rather have a dryer that has a more concentrated shot of air or one that has a wider range...    </li>
            <li>Cool Shot:</li>
            <li>Both feature the Cool Shot, however the button on the Rimini sticks out and seems to be an easier press than the Allure button, which is just a button that presses in...    </li>
            <li>Although there are others out there that have the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; air and cost true</li>
            <li>The blast of cool air made my hair shiny.</li>
            <li>I loved having a hair dryer that was quiet.</li>
            <li>It can make your hair more straight</li>
            <li>This Allure 2200W came very well packaged in a lovely box &amp; the hairdryer upon arrival</li>
            <li>This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I love this Allure professional Ionic ceramic hair dryer by Xtava!!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am impressed and would highly recommend this hair dryer, as well as other Xtava items.</li>
            <li>While powerful, there are some less than ideal qualities.</li>
            <li>The black Orchid diffuser I also bought for this is HUGE but does a great job</li>
            <li>and it definitely does a good quick job.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong.</li>
            <li>I have bought 2 more hairdryers in the past 3 years and this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li>However, the &#x27;warm&#x27; is too hot for my liking and the hot, way too hot.</li>
            <li>Does a great job on my hair which has become dryer due to aging.  </li>
            <li>This blow dryer dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>Xtava was super helpful in getting the issue resolved with Amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall i am really impressed with this hair dryer and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>Cuts drying time tremendously and for the price I paid</li>
            <li>I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I&#x27;m guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  </li>
            <li>The length is nice, too, you are free to move around the bathroom more than with a typical dryer.  </li>
            <li>and it was drying my hair fairly quickly.</li>
            <li>Looks like it&#x27;s worth a lot more than what it really cost.</li>
            <li>and this dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>The cool setting is just right for keeping my hair from becoming super static and having major flyaway issues.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li>And hot is very hot!</li>
            <li>The chord is nice and long, the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way.  </li>
            <li>very fast drying experience!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the most powerful dryer I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li>After and during use, the dryer, itself, does not get very hot.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a long cord, this may be a good option for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very powerful and hot blow dryer.</li>
            <li>The heat does not change, it is very consistent throughout the whole use – it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li>very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li>So powerful that she rarely uses it on full power (2 wiggles)</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is super powerful, lightweight and sleek.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful and very hot dryer if that&#x27;s what your looking for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After trying this the first time, I now want to use it every time I wash my hair!</li>
            <li>That is a first!</li>
            <li>I have to use on lowest heat setting because the heat is so hot!</li>
            <li>The handle size is perfect for my small hands, and the weight makes sure that I don&#x27;t get hand fatigue constantly styling my volume in.</li>
            <li>only used twice, but am glad that i bought it!</li>
            <li>I am not even talking about the fact that drying my hair time is cut in half, but what is really amazing that my hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li>The cord is thick and sturdy which is great because it will not break as easily.</li>
            <li>arrival it was packaged in a nice black matte box, with stylish decoration and writing.</li>
            <li>The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn’t bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles.</li>
            <li>Some curly hair, some straight, some frizzy, some fine, a lot gray, all highlighted/colored.</li>
            <li>Too much air for my fine hair as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-This dryer has the power and is a little more compact and more attractive than my other name brand full sized hair</li>
            <li>Love this hairdryer, it&#x27;s quiet and dries my hair quickly!</li>
            <li>You cannot beat this blow-dryer even at full price (which is still very reasonable).  </li>
            <li>i also love the settings as well, hot high heat down to low cool air, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the high heat on this one because it&#x27;s very hot and my fine hair wouldn&#x27;t like that,  </li>
            <li>So fast and light.</li>
            <li>I have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and I&#x27;ve been using texturing product which also isn&#x27;t conducive to smooth or shiny hair.</li>
            <li>Works great, beefy cord, not as loud as my old dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got 3 of these hair dryers and they&#x27;re priced so cheap with so much POWER.</li>
            <li>The controls are positioned comfortably and it drys fast.</li>
            <li>The settings are great and it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>I actually have never owned a hair dryer with a nozzle before, so this was quite nice.</li>
            <li>Many of the reviews for this product were left by people who received it for free for the review.</li>
            <li>This one has been better than any I have used so far from a retail store.</li>
            <li>My hair was dried faster and more effectively with this dryer.</li>
            <li>I cannot believe I was given the opportunity to test this product out complimentary, and share my experiences.</li>
            <li>but i rarely use a blow dryer and need to store it away when not in use.  </li>
            <li>I knew this was going to be a powerful dryer as soon as I took it out of the</li>
            <li>my hair seems more voluminous than when I use my old one.</li>
            <li>really powerful...</li>
            <li>Too many reviews with so many pictures attached, made me suspicious that these are not real reviews.</li>
            <li>I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a powerful hairdryer.  </li>
            <li>Add the smaller nozzle for more direct heat, which is nice for styling purposes.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s worth it as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased a total of 2 since my daughter and I loved the 1st one so much.  </li>
            <li>Well worth buying.</li>
            <li>I like the powerful air distribution and the feel of the dryer in your hand.</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>The extra attachment that came with it is also nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has three heat settings – hot, medium, and cool.</li>
            <li>I did receive this complimentary for review purposes</li>
            <li>favorite by far</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s powerful and does a nice job.</li>
            <li>The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li>It’s powerful at 2200 watts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and efficient at drying my hair.</li>
            <li>This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li>While it did dry my very straight, fine hair quickly, the air flow was so strong that when I put my hair in velcro curlers, the Revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair!  </li>
            <li>It also leaves my hair notably silkier and more manageable than other dryers.</li>
            <li>For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I&#x27;ve used at between 7-10.</li>
            <li>super fast hair drying time without the frizz!  </li>
            <li>So as much as this is more pricey than a normal blow dryer it is worth it.</li>
            <li>, I know I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>the 2200W&#x27;s plug just pops right out.  </li>
            <li>Right out of the shower</li>
            <li>The control buttons are right where I would wrap my fingers around the handle.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super quiet and has multiple heat levels which is great.</li>
            <li>The weight is also decent, but I would not say it is extremely light or anything.</li>
            <li>It is like standing outside in a windstorm – except it can be directed very easily with the add-on that comes with the dryer.</li>
            <li>The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft after using it and it makes it really easy to style my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair still seems a bit frizzy on top, but that could just be my hair or that fact that I live in a very humid climate.  </li>
            <li>handle is comfortable for my hand and the position of the buttons is of easy reach for my tiny</li>
            <li>The hot setting is super hot</li>
            <li>This blow dryer is hot and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 heat settings, and  2 fan settings, as well as a cool burst</li>
            <li>This might sound silly but it came in nice packaging and with a nice card that gave you a coupon code to recieve up to 50% off during their monthly sales.</li>
            <li>It has a nice long cord too.</li>
            <li>They taper of the nozzle makes the air come out in a more concise way instead of coming out in large amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer</li>
            <li>that was more productive than my normal hair dryer, when I put it on high</li>
            <li>I love the long cord - my mirror is a good three feet from the electrical outlet, the extra cord is much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>For my straight thick hear the dryer works very good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more powerful than similarly priced blow dryers.  </li>
            <li>goodbye to frizz with the Allure because it&#x27;s designed to emit powerful negative ions to seal and smooth the hair&#x27;s outer layer while it increases my hair&#x27;s own natural shine while providing me with healthy and hydrated hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipment.</li>
            <li>Love it much lighter then my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>And it was super fast.</li>
            <li>It dries your hair super fast</li>
            <li>It works very well and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>They also include an attachment, which I haven&#x27;t really used, but it&#x27;s pretty nice that it came with, especially on such a reasonably-priced hair dryer.</li>
            <li>so the hot setting is WAY too hot for me, but the medium is just right.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair super fast, like 2 minutes fast!  </li>
            <li>and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I like the hairdryer itself very much</li>
            <li>/&gt;The blow dryer works very fast.</li>
            <li>Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  </li>
            <li>I am able to dry my hair quickly</li>
            <li>absolutely in love with my new XTAVA professional ionic ceramic hair dryer!</li>
            <li>Strong fan and gets very hot, even on the low setting.</li>
            <li>pretty quiet but powerful, good control settings, and cheaper than I would expect for such a quality dryer.  </li>
            <li>Fast drying hair dryer!  </li>
            <li>When I was offered the Xtava, Allure 2200W hair dryer to review for an unbiased opinion I was pretty excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>One of my favorite parts was that the back vent didn&#x27;t try to eat my hair!</li>
            <li>Well First of all, everytime I turn it on Hi</li>
            <li>The features alone in this hair dryer, along with it&#x27;s sexy sleek look, will make your decision definite.</li>
            <li>lets me know its really working!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>not&amp;#34;.It is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li>And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con.</li>
            <li>The hottest setting is really hot</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have tried a product from this brand</li>
            <li>I love that this has 3 different heat settings.</li>
            <li>It most definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li>Just got it, first use.  </li>
            <li>The highest heat setting is HOT.</li>
            <li>It is powerful and dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li>Upon first use by my gf</li>
            <li>Smell did finally go away and am glad I kept it.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer the diffuser more than concentrator nozzle.</li>
            <li>But, after using this hair dryer today for the first time.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Ok, so this is my second Xtava Hair Dryer</li>
            <li>While, I can&#x27;t say what the exact weigh of the Allure dryer is, it does feel a TINSY bit heavier than the Rimini dryer.</li>
            <li>Its pretty light it weight compared to my old dryer with</li>
            <li>Works really well!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;ll check xtava first.</li>
            <li>which is great since I also have thick hair.</li>
            <li>It has the safety switch on the plug if it gets to hot</li>
            <li>Ps, I just placed a second order for 2 more.</li>
            <li>but it was no big deal considering how much more volume I gained.  </li>
            <li>I have borrowed many friends’ hair dryers during different conferences, get-togethers, and road trips.</li>
            <li>The problem I have always had with hair dryers is that the heat settings are too hot, lack of air flow, inconsistent heat, and weight.</li>
            <li>I have to say though, this hair dryer absolutely blows the others away!</li>
            <li>I love the multiple heat settings and blow settings.</li>
            <li>is kind of different to the picture one, but the stylish on my hair it was as expected</li>
            <li>Hot.</li>
            <li>The one I had been using now seems very bulky compared to this!</li>
            <li>It dries fast!</li>
            <li>It looks sleek and pretty too.</li>
            <li>Dries my hair great for thick hair.</li>
            <li>I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>Delivery was a day early!!!!</li>
            <li>By far, best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, and at a fraction of price I&#x27;ve paid in past for professional ones!</li>
            <li>The high heat setting is VERY HOT.</li>
            <li>This one comes in black and looks very stylish.</li>
            <li>only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press.</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is super nice classic black.</li>
            <li>I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do.</li>
            <li>My hair dried sleek and static free.</li>
            <li>It is quiet, it has a permanent cool setting as well as a cool shot, and the settings buttons are in a place that works for me, a left-hander.</li>
            <li>I love how lightweight, fast and VERY quiet this hairdryer is.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed my strands being shiny or silky,  but the dryer dries quickly and isn&#x27;t very loud.  </li>
            <li>Decided to buy this hairdryer based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &amp;#34;blew up&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks better than it has in a long time...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely pretty - doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li>Great hairdryer so far, particularly vs. previous Conair models.</li>
            <li>When given the chance to test this product during a promotion, I really was not sold on the idea at first.</li>
            <li>Plenty of heat on different levels and the cool setting is truly cool air which really does set my hair style.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
            <li>i love my new gadget it usually takes me about 20minutes to blow dry my hair and with this beauty it took me about 7 to 8 minutes ,,,,,love love it.</li>
            <li>I love the heavy-duty, long cord it has too!  </li>
            <li>(a quick check to Xtava&#x27;s site shows they are completely out of stock of</li>
            <li>I was able to blow dry my hair while retaining shine and softness .</li>
            <li>(mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  </li>
            <li>I have alot of hair and love how my hair is dry faster with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The power it delivers is perfect and it seems to dry my hair in half the time of my old one.</li>
            <li>It comes with one attachment that makes it easy to run a brush through your hair while blow drying it at the same time to the shape you want it in.</li>
            <li>I was able to dry my hair without any frizz.</li>
            <li>Light, hot, quiet.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will be buying products from Xtava in the future.</li>
            <li>I have spent hundreds on hair dryers and my most recent purchase, prior to this one, was a feather light that I spend $180 on, it did, okay on my hair, but exploded after 8 months.  </li>
            <li>However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying I only write reviews when I feel strongly about a product and this one is NOT a winner.</li>
            <li>The air flow is strong but there is a low setting for the air power too.</li>
            <li>IT seems to be a cord you would see on beauty salon&#x27;s equipment and seem that it is really strong and not likely to fray it</li>
            <li>and it looks large, yet</li>
            <li>Temp is perfect Hot is hot warm is warm and cold is cold.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer.</li>
            <li>so I had to stop and buy a new one!!</li>
            <li>I need to be able to have a dryer that light enough to hold for a long time.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very easy while drying to slip your finger and go from warm to hot and not mean to.</li>
            <li>Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well.</li>
            <li>Other than this small issue, which I am already getting used to dealing with, I think this is probably the best dryer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>Quiet and quick!</li>
            <li>I recommend this one very highly.</li>
            <li>I also really like the concentrator nozzle to use to focus on certain areas.</li>
            <li>The reason I dropped it to four stars is because it has a tendency to tangle my fine (not thin) hair, but the pros definitely outweigh the one con.</li>
            <li>the high setting is HOT.</li>
            <li>I have been needing a really good hairdryer because in a family of five it is hard to keep one in one room of the house.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Dries fast, low noise, and light weight.</li>
            <li>just gets the job done, much faster than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>this seemed to seal the deal without having to use so much product my hair felt crunchy.  </li>
            <li>my hair is coming out very frizzy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s powerful and my hair dries faster and smoother compared to my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li>It really has the blowing power.  </li>
            <li>As soon as it was delivered I could tell immediately it was much lighter than my conair.</li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t have a problem with the weight.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that light and not that quiet.</li>
            <li>Important when you are drying hair  for several children and may have lotion on your hands</li>
            <li>the allure seemed to work very well.  </li>
            <li>Is light weight and quiet.</li>
            <li>, I have received two very service minded emails from the company.</li>
            <li>and I am very dissapointed in it.</li>
            <li>Dries fast...</li>
            <li>Very fprceful and dries my hair in 5 minutes-just like the professionals do it.</li>
            <li>It works well but doesn&#x27;t stay plugged into my outlet very well.</li>
            <li>It looks sleek and it gets my hair very sleek and straight.</li>
            <li>My daughter has thinner, straight hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I have been wasting time drying my hair when there have been products on the market like THIS that will get it done so much faster.</li>
            <li>I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference</li>
            <li>It performs better than expected.</li>
            <li>I have perfectly straight, non-frizzing hair</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair &amp; this dryer works very well with my diffuser.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It was really lightweight and has a very sleek design.</li>
            <li>It comes with a removeable nozzle that centralizes  the heat that I really like.</li>
            <li>Not by much though.  </li>
            <li>However, the width of the Rimini is much wider and casts a wider shot of heat than the Allure.  </li>
            <li>also seems much longer than the Rimini Cord.    </li>
            <li>It does work much quicker, as the listing claims.</li>
            <li>The Allure hair dryer makes this task so much easier.</li>
            <li>it really gave my hair some body.  </li>
            <li>However, if I had shorter hair or I did run a brush through my hair as I guided the blowdrier, it wouldn&#x27;t cause so much havoc.  </li>
            <li>i really got the results i was looking for.</li>
            <li>My arm is not tired after blow drying my hair anymore.</li>
            <li>and It really wasn&#x27;t doing much ,</li>
            <li>It blow drys your hair fast and where it doesn&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li>Fast drying.</li>
            <li>This thing is much easier on the ears.</li>
            <li>There is plenty of power and it is very lightweight.</li>
            <li>In moms world that is something I really like.  </li>
            <li>There is really nothing I do not like about this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>so it doesn&#x27;t get very tangled during use</li>
            <li>Very quiet and extremely light weight.  </li>
            <li>The style is very sleak.  </li>
            <li>It dries my hair incredibly fast but also gives it body that lasts for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>so it dont really matter for me.</li>
            <li>so you can control how much heat you need.</li>
            <li>and it arrived lightening fast.</li>
            <li>It is balanced very well</li>
            <li>I expected it to be a bit better from reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>I also really like that the dryer is salon quality without the salon price</li>
            <li>and i would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>I like it, thank u for the fast shipping</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>4.9 stars on 330 review is very suspicious.</li>
            <li>though, I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>and i love that it offers different speeds and heat settings.</li>
            <li>It is a powerful 2200 watt hair dryer with a modern sleek design that is completely lightweight.</li>
            <li>but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been several years since I&#x27;ve purchased a blow dryer, and quite honestly thought they were all basically the same.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend for anyone who is looking to achieve ultra stylish do&#x27;s to those just looking to dry their hair in the morning.</li>
            <li>Was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair.</li>
            <li>Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li>I could direct the air flow right to the area needed.</li>
            <li>This is so powerful, it really does dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>On the other hand, if you have both left- and right-handed family members, this might be a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Im pleased that I bought this product to replace my old hairdryer which took 20mins to dry my hair, happy to say it has cut the timing of drying my long hair down to 8minutes and leaves my hair smooth enough not to use the GHD hair irons.</li>
            <li>My only criticism is in the design of the buttons not he neck - the buttons are very &#x27;soft&#x27; - easy to push and change the setting while in use.  </li>
            <li>There are as many temperature and and fan-speed settings as on any other dryer, and they all work quite well.  </li>
            <li>It is better than expected!  </li>
            <li>I use the dryer with a flat brush, and have noticed my hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz</li>
            <li>The barrel is longer than most other dryers I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>So, one doesn&#x27;t stick out as being better than the other in regards to comfort or ease of use.    </li>
            <li>i really like just how well built it is, looks and feels very durable and high quality.</li>
            <li>hairdryer is a decent size, yet very lightweight.</li>
            <li>The concentrator nozzle allowed me to dry one section of my hair at a time very quickly.</li>
            <li>The speed and heat buttons are &#x27;user friendly&#x27; and the heavy cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li>so she doesn&#x27;t need a high setting, or much heat*...</li>
            <li>I have long hair and have never been able to dry my hair as quickly as I can with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li>She loves it and spends less time getting ready for the day which she loves even more.</li>
            <li>I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future.</li>
            <li>hair dryer is super quiet and performs very well.</li>
            <li>Which with the magic of the blow dryer helps me to get my hair dry in 10 minutes, not 20-30minutes like my old blow dryer</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair (spiral curls in the back and looser curls up top) and the air director thingy (that is a technical term!)</li>
            <li>am a licensed cosmetologist and I can tell you from experience that this hair dryer is professional quality and is exactly what I would use in my home salon.</li>
            <li>and I have been able to drastically cut down on the amount of flat-ironing I do.  </li>
            <li>I knew that I would be using this the first night I received it for a quick dry to prepare for a date.</li>
            <li>I got a new one!  </li>
            <li>I suggest it to anyone who needs a new dryer, or just wants one that does the job right!ng wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest it to anyone who needs a new dryer, or just wants one</li>
            <li>Yes the blow dryer works well to dry my  hair , but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth without frizz .</li>
            <li>if you are looking for something with no frills, that will get the main job done of drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if you are looking for something with no frills, that will get the main job done of drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially like the nozzle that comes with this hair dryer, as my hair is beyond super frizzy.</li>
            <li>are my salons main ingredient</li>
            <li>Wishing it had a little bit more power in the cool blast but no big deal.</li>
            <li>It definitely lives up to the quiet part for sure even when on the high setting.</li>
            <li>It is a high powered machine that works efficiently to dry the hair precisely with the attachable nozzle.</li>
            <li>First i would like to say that alot of hair tools claim to be professional but aren&#x27;t really, but this hair dryer gives the look, feel and performance of a professional tool.</li>
            <li>, though my hair isn&#x27;t particularly picky so it might not actually mean anything to you.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li>The high heat was too high for me as I have a</li>
            <li>and I needed a dryer with high heat and high volume of air.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>My pompadour would not be as high if it weren&#x27;t for this hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It has two airflow settings - high and medium.</li>
            <li>A burning smell on the high setting -</li>
            <li>I work a very long week, so I&#x27;m delighted to have found a blow-dryer that cuts down on my drying time.  </li>
            <li>I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  </li>
            <li>just be careful if you have fine hair like me.</li>
            <li>It dries nicely and very quiet compared to any other dryers I have had.  </li>
            <li>Silent, hot, and lightweight!</li>
            <li>I have to keep it on the middle setting because it&#x27;s so hot!</li>
            <li>My hair dries very quickly and comes out smooth (little to zero frizz!!!).</li>
            <li>I had an Elchim 2001 previous to this for 7 years, never ever blew breaker.. and my hair always came out great in less then 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Very fast drying and my hair is much smoother than with my last one (which was not Xtava).</li>
            <li>This hair dryer is also made of high quality materials which is a plus for me as It needs to be able to last a long time.</li>
            <li>and it dries it twice as fast as my old one.  </li>
            <li>In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn’t as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair</li>
            <li>I do think the cool shot button is a bit strange</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li>Powerful dryer with various heat settings.</li>
            <li>The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet.</li>
            <li>I really really wanted to like this hair dryer, even ordered again after sending back the first one that arrived without the concentrator nozzle.</li>
            <li>major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands.</li>
            <li>So I tested my new Allure 2200w hair dryer and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get as many tangles in my VERY long hair, as I would have with just any regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Within less than four months, I noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire.  </li>
            <li>I get my hair dried in half the time with this dryer, and am completely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like super clear but enough to k ow</li>
            <li>but I needed something powerful to dry my hair fast without damaging it.</li>
            <li>I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I&#x27;m not kidding.  </li>
            <li>It is so much more powerful than the one I have been using and gets my hair dry in half the time (the box says 80% of the time</li>
            <li>Drys my hair quickly and the cord is long.</li>
            <li>so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way.</li>
            <li>I already had a decent hair dryer, but was interested in getting a second non-travel sized dryer.</li>
            <li>My hair is kind of long, not quite to the middle of my back</li>
            <li>Now I need a new camera</li>
            <li>My new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li>Needed a new dryer and have been shopping around for a while.  </li>
            <li>so I never have to live without it.  </li>
            <li>Also, i live what the company stands for.</li>
            <li>I have to purchase a new hair dryer...</li>
            <li>Just received my new blow dryer in the mail.  </li>
            <li>It is less bulky than the Chi, lightweight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>If you want your own salon style blow out look no further girl get yourself a round brush you can handle this.</li>
            <li>It allows me to dry my hair quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Also the cord is long which is great for me because I sit down to blow dry my daughters hair</li>
            <li>Gets very hot, not horribly loud!</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a professional blow dryer I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>I recently became aware of Xtava products while looking for a new hairdryer.</li>
            <li>but the nozzle is so long that I can&#x27;t style the back of my hair easily.  </li>
            <li>So for the past 2 years or more I have not touched a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>Professional results without the price!</li>
            <li>My old one would suck it in if you got it within an inch of that vent, I am tendered headed, IT HURT!  </li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>One problem is not mentioned by other reviewers, so it may be unique to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m throwing the old one out for this!</li>
            <li>and then I put it on the second higher heat setting until I finished the process.</li>
            <li>it is a bit too hot for the total drying process</li>
            <li>Also even though the hottest setting is quite hot the hair dryer itself only heats up at the end.  </li>
            <li>Not dis&#x27;ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair.  </li>
            <li>It is certainly very powerful — I&#x27;d say the middle heat setting is equal to my old blow dryer and</li>
            <li>Finally it donned on me that perhaps I needed to push in the red button on the plug since it was kind of sticking out further than the yellow button (the reset and test buttons).</li>
            <li>The company was nice enough to refund my money once I could finally get hold of someone (note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website), however I do not recommend due to safety issues.</li>
            <li>My old blow dryer broke so on a whim i decided to search for a new one.</li>
            <li>Shipment came early, and product was brand new.</li>
            <li>EVERYTHING - strange, right?).</li>
            <li>I do like that the cord is long and allows you to move around and not be right by your outlet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too heavy and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>so i needed something that was powerful and cut my dry time in 1/2 and seal my cuticles.</li>
            <li>When I received this hair dryer in the mail I was so excited to test it out as my old hair dryer just crapped out the other day</li>
            <li>I went on the website to register my product and will be trying their flat irons and other items they sell, however, getting amazon is so much of a better deal!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has all the features that I need, like multiple heat settings, multiple air flow settings and even a cool blast to set the style.</li>
            <li>My favorite thing is that you push down the on/off button and heat controls, you don&#x27;t SLIDE it as with my last dryer.</li>
            <li>It is a little heavier than I felt the description indicated, but otherwise it is fine.  </li>
            <li>:) I would definitely buy other products by Xtava!</li>
            <li>The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful.</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and not super noisy.</li>
            <li>It has cut my drying time down significantly.</li>
            <li>The only thing I wish was different was that the Cool air button were a switch (you have to hold it down) and that the air was actually cool.</li>
            <li>Works great to dry my thick hair in a short time.</li>
            <li>Very powerful, sturdy, leaves hair soft, dries quickly, not too loud, and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li>It looks nice but be very careful because (correct me if I am wrong)  it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break.</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s pretty lightweight and has a long cord.  </li>
            <li>My hairdryer is so old</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I knew it was a professional version</li>
            <li>I purchased this hair dryer after my old Conair bit the dust.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far.</li>
            <li>Like don&#x27;t leave it in one place for too long, hot.</li>
            <li>I also realized I&#x27;m going to miss the retracting cord of my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had a professional grade one, and always wondered what the difference would be in my hair once I was finished.</li>
            <li>My old dryer was dying</li>
            <li>I like this one so far.</li>
            <li>Tripped the breaker in our old house.</li>
            <li>I understood why it was a professional quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li>The Allure features two speeds and three heat settings to offer control and professional styling versatility for all hair types.</li>
            <li>This is also very lightweight and sleek, not to mention the fact that it is quiet.</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer than with my old conair hair dryer.</li>
            <li>but this one is extra gentle</li>
            <li>so I needed a professional grade dryer.</li>
            <li>This is by far the nicest blow dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>Consequently, I ended up having to endure the life of no hair dryer for nearly 3 months.</li>
            <li>Same quality blow dryer they use in the salon for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Allure professional hairdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>when I used my old blow</li>
            <li>The dryer is not heavy and has substantial amount of heat.</li>
            <li>It suddenly has some shine, including the ends that use to look very frizzy.</li>
            <li>Quiet for something with so much power.</li>
            <li>The air flow is very focused and dries my hair in 5 minutes (on medium temperature + low power setting).</li>
            <li>A very well made product that is built to last ...</li>
            <li>I could not buy that one, but i started searching for professional hair dryers.  </li>
            <li>I am at the end of my keratin treatment and had to fight with my old dryer, but this one makes my hair look like i just got a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The power was unexpected.  </li>
            <li>I have a really sensitive scalp</li>
            <li>The dryer isn’t completely soundless but it isn’t obnoxiously loud compared to others I’ve owned.</li>
            <li>This was to replace an old Conair.  </li>
            <li>It seems like a very sturdy product, not like some of the low end products out there.</li>
            <li>but I am sure works well with thick hair.  </li>
            <li>In a good, no, a great way!</li>
            <li>The only dryer I have ever owned that made me excited to blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li>finally, the Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Technology apparently works because I noticed much much less static and frizz than before</li>
            <li>After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I&#x27;m sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer,</li>
            <li>about 5-7 minutes flat, maybe 10 if I start with sopping wet hair) and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>When I use it with the Goody Quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that I only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron.</li>
            <li>If I hold it in the usual way, it is extremely easy to accidentally push the buttons with your hand and inadvertently change the settings.  </li>
            <li>The cord is fantastic because it doesn&#x27;t curl and not easily.</li>
            <li>It has enough heat settings in my opinion and also includes a cool setting, similar to a hooded dryer, which I like, my last dryer did not have this.</li>
            <li>I love the sleek black design!!!</li>
            <li>One thing I would seriously advise, make sure that the bathroom plug can handle the wattage.</li>
            <li>If I was to be technical with my star rating, it would get 4.5 stars from me, simply because of the problems I had upon first use.</li>
            <li>If I was to be technical with my star rating, it would get 4.5 stars from me, simply because of the problems I had upon first use.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful , well designed dryer that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li>It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say more other than I hope it last me a long time.</li>
            <li>The low setting is too low and the high setting is TOO high.</li>
            <li>Two speed settings, high and low.</li>
            <li>It also has two speeds, low and high.</li>
            <li>Would purchase another, but will be surprised if it will need to be replaced in the new future.  </li>
            <li>It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz.</li>
            <li>The problem might be that the Allure&#x27;s safety plug is designed in such a way that makes it strangely incompatible with my specific outlet but in the interest of full disclosure I have to point out my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  </li>
            <li>As for weight, it is not bad, but if you are looking for a &amp;#34;light weight&amp;#34; dryer for an elderly person this might be too heavy.  </li>
            <li>Between that and the fact that you get such a high end, quality made product  for such a reasonable price,  I  am totally sold on this company.  </li>
            <li>Between that and the fact that you get such a high end, quality made product  for such a reasonable price,  I  am totally sold on this company.  </li>
            <li>I usually let my hair dry naturally which takes more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is light weight and cuts dry time.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  </li>
            <li>I simply moved to a new area of the house, and the rest of the test went</li>
            <li>I live in the Deep South.</li>
            <li>I think a good deal of the weight comes from the cord, which is thick and heavy.</li>
            <li>cord is very long and heavy duty, which makes it nice to not be limited in cord</li>
            <li>so I sat right down to do it.  </li>
            <li>Have had no other issues with it.  </li>
            <li>Wish the low temperature was a big stronger as the second is just a tad too hot for puppy</li>
            <li>I will go back to my old hair dryer !</li>
            <li>Straightens thick, curly, frizzy hair quickly!</li>
            <li>but if I have to get ready to go somewhere and don&#x27;t have time to let it air dry, or if it&#x27;s still wet when I get ready to go to bed I will finish drying it as it is really damaging to go to bed with wet hair.  </li>
            <li>The con for me (someone that has long, thin, fine hair) is that it tends to be hot even on the lower settings.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice hair dryer, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that its a little heavy for me.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely surprise by all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I need less than half the time to dry my hair now and the result looks amazing.</li>
            <li>A hair dryer is not something I generally replace until I need it.  </li>
            <li>As someone with thick hair that is used to spending tons of time just drying my hair, this is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I have long hair, not extremely thick but with the winter weather here in Indiana, the frizzies have set in.  </li>
            <li>And I really like that the cord is extra long to reach an outlet in another room.  </li>
            <li>Prior to using this Xtava Allure hair dryer, I was using a old hair dryer that worked well in its prime, but was loosing its finesse.</li>
            <li>It dried my thick, fine hair quickly and left it without frizz and with shine!  </li>
            <li>Also it runs very quiet compared to  her old one.</li>
            <li>The Allure Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer by XTAVA has totally exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  </li>
            <li>This attachment is said to direct maximized condensed air flow to the area you are targeting, adding precision and focus while controlling frizz and style outcome which it definitely does!!</li>
            <li>This hairdryer is a definite upgrade from my old Conair one.  </li>
            <li>If Allure is blowing harder, I cannot really tell.</li>
            <li>My old (Revlon) hair dryer went kaput, and I went to a local store and bought another Revlon to replace it.  </li>
            <li>We both tired it out and love</li>
            <li>I was amazed at how I could grab the blowing end of the dryer just behind the actual air outlet and not burn my hand, even when running on full hot for 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don&#x27;t pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product</li>
            <li>The heat settings are very similar in regards to the low is not hot enough and the high is almost too hot.</li>
            <li>The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all.</li>
            <li>You can tell right away this is a heavy duty hair dryer.</li>
            <li>It normally takes me 20 - 30 minutes to get it completely dry.</li>
            <li>Then I need to use the flat iron to calm it all down.</li>
            <li>The small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is, I never use the cool air function anyway</li>
            <li>but my hair is much healthier now as opposed to when using other dryers.  </li>
            <li>Much happier with the other purchase.</li>
            <li>the design is very sleek and sharp looking.</li>
            <li>The description says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;ultra lightweight&amp;#34; but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer.</li>
            <li>If i had to have one complaint, the dryer itself is a little heavy, other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li>Long thick cord feels like it will last many years of abuse (repeated wrappings around dryer).</li>
            <li>I have thick long hair and it leaves my hair soft and gets it dry super fast.</li>
            <li>It took me about 5 minutes to dry my hair once I was situated in the new part of the house.</li>
            <li>This allows my hair to dry much faster since all the air is going directly where the hair is still wet.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t all that quiet, and though it&#x27;s not really heavy, it is bigger than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li>and all it offers for such an extremely low price!!  </li>
            <li>Based on our experience and our different hair styles, we both love this dryer and stand behind it based on its quality and construction.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only major downside is that it is quite noisy.</li>
            <li>The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li>It blows just enough air, at the right temperature to cut my drying time in half!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works any differently than my last Ionic hair dryer, in terms of controlling frizz on my naturally curly hair, but it works equally well at a minimum.</li>
            <li>Pretty heavy as well.</li>
            <li>This blow dryer was heavy and too hot.  </li>
            <li>It stays cool and does not warm up at all.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not quite as light as I&#x27;d imagined and maybe even a little bigger than my old one, I wouldn&#x27;t consider it to be heavy or bulky</li>
            <li>My old hair dryer would take me 20 mins to dry my hair</li>
            <li>Cuts drying time in half without using too much heat.</li>
            <li>It took me 15 minutes to dry my hair and it was soft shinny and no frizz.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is black, not a silver color as in the picture; very sleek in design.</li>
            <li>This dryer comes with attachment to help dry your hear directly on the spot that you need and not making the rest of your hair frizzy.</li>
            <li>Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before.</li>
            <li>(I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  </li>
            <li>I was concerned that it would not dry my hair enough because blow dryers and my hair don’t get along too well.</li>
            <li>but it makes blow drying long wet hair so much faster.</li>
            <li>I thought is might be to strong for my thin hair but</li>
            <li>Chose this particular hair dryer after comparing the features with other similar products.</li>
            <li>I have very thick but fine hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little heavier than my old dryer, but I&#x27;ll deal with it if it doesn&#x27;t catch on fire while I&#x27;m using it like the old one did!</li>
            <li>I usually have to flat iron my hair after drying to get the frizz out, but this dried my hair super fast</li>
            <li>It only takes about 4 minutes to completely dry my hair as opposed to 8-10 with my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know much about ionic dryers because I previously had the same hair dryer for over 15 years.</li>
            <li>The nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when I tried to use one on my previous dryers, it would always fall off.  </li>
            <li>Most of the time she never dries it totally dry because she gets tired of holding the hair dryer.</li>
            <li>This is a very powerful appliance - so powerful, in fact, that my long hair gets blown around like crazy, which leaves it tangled as hell when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>ALL of my hair was dry, no slightly damp spots at all within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>I only owned an old one which I only used to dry off my cats after a bath.</li>
            <li>Frankly my old and less expensive Conair was much sturdier and not as cheaply made as this Allure Model  </li>
            <li>So, I guess I now own a high powered air blower, as it still works but does not produce heat. :(</li>
            <li>I usually dread having to blow dry my hair as it is very long and pretty thick, so it would often take an hour or more to get it ALMOST all the way dry.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is by far the best hair dryer i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The packinaging is beautiful which should be your first clue</li>
            <li> The Allure 2200W Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer is awesome.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s really nice about this is all it&#x27;s power, and it&#x27;s light as it says!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s even more Amazing, is its design and ease of use and storage.</li>

            <li> Love this dryer the best that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m happy with the dryer, but communication from xtava has been really great - the next time I&#x27;m in the market to buy something like this</li>
            <li> It is really pretty, which means it would make a great gift for someone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very light and manageable.</li>
            <li> The handle is very comfortable to hold and buttons are intuitive.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with a hair dryer that cuts 10 - 20 minutes off the time I have to spend blowing more hot air</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is awesome and powerful, and the highest temp setting is HOT</li>
            <li> The temperature gets very hot which I guess can be a good thing</li>
            <li> This dryer was easy to hold, had amazing heat, and the cool shot was quick to cool and worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> It did come with its own attachment, but Im loyal to my Devacurl diffuser;however, loving the combination of the two.</li>
            <li> This dryer is almost too good and too hot!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s my favorite one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this blow dryer in February of 2015 and have enjoyed it up until today.</li>
            <li> I love the variety of heat settings + power combinations.</li>
            <li> I think that they could improve the function buttons to better label</li>
            <li> really like this hair dryer, and I am happy to have it.</li>
            <li> really like this hair dryer, and I am happy to have it.</li>

            <li> However it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air.</li>
            <li> With that said, the medium heat setting is fine for me and the air flow is strong.</li>

            <li> I was able to get it for a great discount from the original list price, and would only recommend and provide my unbiased experience.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and dries my hair quickly which is awesome since I have really long hair.</li>
            <li> Drys really fast and its very hot!!!</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair, that is on the thicker side, and collar bone length.</li>
            <li> I love the precision the concentrator nozzle provides; allowing me to focus the heat exactly where I need it the most.</li>
            <li> The buttons are easy to use, the concentrator nozzle keeps my hair smooth</li>
            <li> and I love the attachment that it comes with to be able to focus all the hot air on one section of hair at a time as I am brushing it out.</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair in a chin length</li>

            <li> Dries hair quickly without burning my hair!</li>
            <li> The Allure is a great hair dryer and if you need a stronger cord, one that isn&#x27;t going to tear easily, that&#x27;s a definite bonus point for this dryer.  </li>
            <li> and then I was putting it away and noticed a HUGE gash on the power cord.</li>
            <li> Light weight.  </li>
            <li> The item shows it&#x27;s no longer available</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty awesome dryer.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and comfortable to hold.</li>

            <li> This blowdryer works great, especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> The product page shows this product is no longer available.</li>
            <li> A fabulous hair dryer for a fabulous price.  </li>

            <li> The air intake area is a metal mesh to keep debris from going inside, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> as i am reviewing for free, after washing and conditioning</li>
            <li> i am so happy to have had this opportunity to present my review to you out there,</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer and can&#x27;t believe the price for such a great quality dryer.  </li>
            <li> It is fast, and seems to leave my hair nice and shiny.</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic housing.</li>
            <li> Smooth finish.</li>
            <li> So when I was given the opportunity to review this product for free</li>
            <li> It is also surprisingly light for a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s cheap plastic throughout.  </li>
            <li> This dryer is light, does NOT have an ear-piercing sound and is light-weight.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe what a fantastic job this does on my hair</li>
            <li> The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling..</li>
            <li> But overall, I&#x27;m happy with this hair drier.</li>
            <li> I was leery to purchase this hair dryer since a lot of the reviews seemed to be from someone who received the item free to try</li>
            <li> For the price, this is a fabulous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> All statements made are solely my own and are based on my own personal experience while using this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but so far so good - have had it about a week or so.</li>
            <li> It has 3 choices of speed and 3 heat settings, cool, warm and hot.  </li>
            <li> Very strong power, dries hair fast and easily.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it&#x27;s an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made..</li>
            <li> super cool , I love it</li>
            <li> It gets hot quick and comes with its own attachments already.</li>
            <li> I loved the flat iron so much that I decided to look at the hair dryers from Xtava and this one has really good reviews.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of it and the weight is just right.</li>
            <li> The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does what it says -- it effectively smoothes hair and significantly helps reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> Very powerful.</li>
            <li> A very powerful dryer.</li>
            <li> VERY powerful, and with 3 heat settings, and two speed settings, this has everything the pro&#x27;s want ....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight, and super easy to handle.</li>
            <li> i then proceeded to use my round brush to blow out my hair and it worked out very nicely!</li>
            <li> Light weight and powerful!</li>
            <li> Air drying is fine, but when you are in a hurry, or are looking to style your hair a special way, sometimes you need a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> love the tourmaline Ionic Ceramic blow dryer, it is very gentle on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great Hairdryer, affordable price, delivery was quick, like the packaging and the extra hair drying tips you get by email.</li>
            <li> And I love how hot it gets-</li>
            <li> but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  </li>
            <li> After using this dryer for about a month I am very pleased with its performance thus far.</li>
            <li> the price this is a budget friendly dryer that has done the job.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> It dries the hair quickly and precisely.  </li>
            <li> Makes me hair smooth and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful hair dryer it isn&#x27;t the most powerful hair dryer I have ever seen</li>
            <li> My hair comes out super smooth.  </li>
            <li> When I used the dryer I was even more pleased because my hair felt sooooo soft and was so shiny.</li>
            <li> In a word, wow!  I&#x27;ve been using the Allure for 2 weeks now, and I&#x27;m thrilled that I bought it.  </li>
            <li> So excited to finally have found something that actually is a good as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> that does the job right!</li>
            <li> So I went looking on my beloved Amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews, and ended up ordering this for about the same price I paid for the Revlon one.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new hair dryer!!</li>
            <li> I love my new hair dryer!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Conclusion: Great product and I would recommend it to every single one person in this planet!</li>
            <li> Very good, not too heavy hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautifully designed - slick and stylish, and very sleek!!</li>
            <li> This is a great blow dryer and not very noisy at all.</li>
            <li> I wish the hot air would come out a bit faster but overall great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Great quality and dried my whole head of hair in minutes which is wonderful after I allow myself a few more minutes of sleep in the morning.</li>
            <li> I never realized that a good blow dryer could make such a difference on the out come of my hair.</li>
            <li> It has 2 heat settings as well as the option for a cool blast here and there.</li>
            <li> Powerful, light weight, multi-heating options.</li>
            <li> Styling hair is an art and a Stylist is only as good as her tools.</li>
            <li> Powerful and light weight..</li>
            <li> I find that reassuring, since most men that I know don&#x27;t really use one,  therefore,  how could they know what we need.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It has the options I use: two speeds, three temperature ranges, cool air shot, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just depends really on what you prefer, if you would rather have a dryer that has a more concentrated shot of air or one that has a wider range...    </li>
            <li> Cool Shot:</li>
            <li> Both feature the Cool Shot, however the button on the Rimini sticks out and seems to be an easier press than the Allure button, which is just a button that presses in...    </li>
            <li> Although there are others out there that have the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; air and cost true</li>
            <li> The blast of cool air made my hair shiny.</li>
            <li> I loved having a hair dryer that was quiet.</li>
            <li> It can make your hair more straight</li>
            <li> This Allure 2200W came very well packaged in a lovely box &amp; the hairdryer upon arrival</li>
            <li> This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I love this Allure professional Ionic ceramic hair dryer by Xtava!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am impressed and would highly recommend this hair dryer, as well as other Xtava items.</li>
            <li> While powerful, there are some less than ideal qualities.</li>
            <li> The black Orchid diffuser I also bought for this is HUGE but does a great job</li>
            <li> and it definitely does a good quick job.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong.</li>
            <li> I have bought 2 more hairdryers in the past 3 years and this product is by far the best.</li>
            <li> However, the &#x27;warm&#x27; is too hot for my liking and the hot, way too hot.</li>
            <li> Does a great job on my hair which has become dryer due to aging.  </li>
            <li> This blow dryer dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> Xtava was super helpful in getting the issue resolved with Amazon.</li>
            <li> Overall i am really impressed with this hair dryer and would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Cuts drying time tremendously and for the price I paid</li>
            <li> I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I&#x27;m guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  </li>
            <li> The length is nice, too, you are free to move around the bathroom more than with a typical dryer.  </li>
            <li> and it was drying my hair fairly quickly.</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;s worth a lot more than what it really cost.</li>
            <li> and this dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> The cool setting is just right for keeping my hair from becoming super static and having major flyaway issues.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> And hot is very hot!</li>
            <li> The chord is nice and long, the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way.  </li>
            <li> very fast drying experience!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s by far the most powerful dryer I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> After and during use, the dryer, itself, does not get very hot.</li>
            <li> If you prefer a long cord, this may be a good option for you.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very powerful and hot blow dryer.</li>
            <li> The heat does not change, it is very consistent throughout the whole use – it heats up very quickly.</li>
            <li> very sturdy and strong.</li>
            <li> So powerful that she rarely uses it on full power (2 wiggles)</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is super powerful, lightweight and sleek.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful and very hot dryer if that&#x27;s what your looking for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this the first time, I now want to use it every time I wash my hair!</li>
            <li> That is a first!</li>
            <li> I have to use on lowest heat setting because the heat is so hot!</li>
            <li> The handle size is perfect for my small hands, and the weight makes sure that I don&#x27;t get hand fatigue constantly styling my volume in.</li>
            <li> only used twice, but am glad that i bought it!</li>
            <li> I am not even talking about the fact that drying my hair time is cut in half, but what is really amazing that my hair looks so much better.</li>
            <li> The cord is thick and sturdy which is great because it will not break as easily.</li>
            <li> arrival it was packaged in a nice black matte box, with stylish decoration and writing.</li>
            <li> The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn’t bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles.</li>
            <li> Some curly hair, some straight, some frizzy, some fine, a lot gray, all highlighted/colored.</li>
            <li> Too much air for my fine hair as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-This dryer has the power and is a little more compact and more attractive than my other name brand full sized hair</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer, it&#x27;s quiet and dries my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> You cannot beat this blow-dryer even at full price (which is still very reasonable).  </li>
            <li> i also love the settings as well, hot high heat down to low cool air, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the high heat on this one because it&#x27;s very hot and my fine hair wouldn&#x27;t like that,  </li>
            <li> So fast and light.</li>
            <li> I have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and I&#x27;ve been using texturing product which also isn&#x27;t conducive to smooth or shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, beefy cord, not as loud as my old dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 3 of these hair dryers and they&#x27;re priced so cheap with so much POWER.</li>
            <li> The controls are positioned comfortably and it drys fast.</li>
            <li> The settings are great and it&#x27;s not too heavy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I actually have never owned a hair dryer with a nozzle before, so this was quite nice.</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews for this product were left by people who received it for free for the review.</li>
            <li> This one has been better than any I have used so far from a retail store.</li>
            <li> My hair was dried faster and more effectively with this dryer.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I was given the opportunity to test this product out complimentary, and share my experiences.</li>
            <li> but i rarely use a blow dryer and need to store it away when not in use.  </li>
            <li> I knew this was going to be a powerful dryer as soon as I took it out of the</li>
            <li> my hair seems more voluminous than when I use my old one.</li>
            <li> really powerful...</li>
            <li> Too many reviews with so many pictures attached, made me suspicious that these are not real reviews.</li>
            <li> I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a powerful hairdryer.  </li>
            <li> Add the smaller nozzle for more direct heat, which is nice for styling purposes.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s worth it as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a total of 2 since my daughter and I loved the 1st one so much.  </li>
            <li> Well worth buying.</li>
            <li> I like the powerful air distribution and the feel of the dryer in your hand.</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> The extra attachment that came with it is also nice.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has three heat settings – hot, medium, and cool.</li>
            <li> I did receive this complimentary for review purposes</li>
            <li> favorite by far</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s powerful and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product.</li>
            <li> It’s powerful at 2200 watts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and efficient at drying my hair.</li>
            <li> This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> While it did dry my very straight, fine hair quickly, the air flow was so strong that when I put my hair in velcro curlers, the Revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair!  </li>
            <li> It also leaves my hair notably silkier and more manageable than other dryers.</li>
            <li> For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I&#x27;ve used at between 7-10.</li>
            <li> super fast hair drying time without the frizz!  </li>
            <li> So as much as this is more pricey than a normal blow dryer it is worth it.</li>
            <li> , I know I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> the 2200W&#x27;s plug just pops right out.  </li>
            <li> Right out of the shower</li>
            <li> The control buttons are right where I would wrap my fingers around the handle.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super quiet and has multiple heat levels which is great.</li>
            <li> The weight is also decent, but I would not say it is extremely light or anything.</li>
            <li> It is like standing outside in a windstorm – except it can be directed very easily with the add-on that comes with the dryer.</li>
            <li> The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft after using it and it makes it really easy to style my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair still seems a bit frizzy on top, but that could just be my hair or that fact that I live in a very humid climate.  </li>
            <li> handle is comfortable for my hand and the position of the buttons is of easy reach for my tiny</li>
            <li> The hot setting is super hot</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is hot and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 heat settings, and  2 fan settings, as well as a cool burst</li>
            <li> This might sound silly but it came in nice packaging and with a nice card that gave you a coupon code to recieve up to 50% off during their monthly sales.</li>
            <li> It has a nice long cord too.</li>
            <li> They taper of the nozzle makes the air come out in a more concise way instead of coming out in large amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer</li>
            <li> that was more productive than my normal hair dryer, when I put it on high</li>
            <li> I love the long cord - my mirror is a good three feet from the electrical outlet, the extra cord is much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> For my straight thick hear the dryer works very good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more powerful than similarly priced blow dryers.  </li>
            <li> goodbye to frizz with the Allure because it&#x27;s designed to emit powerful negative ions to seal and smooth the hair&#x27;s outer layer while it increases my hair&#x27;s own natural shine while providing me with healthy and hydrated hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Love it much lighter then my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> And it was super fast.</li>
            <li> It dries your hair super fast</li>
            <li> It works very well and dries my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> They also include an attachment, which I haven&#x27;t really used, but it&#x27;s pretty nice that it came with, especially on such a reasonably-priced hair dryer.</li>
            <li> so the hot setting is WAY too hot for me, but the medium is just right.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair super fast, like 2 minutes fast!  </li>
            <li> and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I like the hairdryer itself very much</li>
            <li> /&gt;The blow dryer works very fast.</li>
            <li> Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  </li>
            <li> I am able to dry my hair quickly</li>
            <li> absolutely in love with my new XTAVA professional ionic ceramic hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Strong fan and gets very hot, even on the low setting.</li>
            <li> pretty quiet but powerful, good control settings, and cheaper than I would expect for such a quality dryer.  </li>
            <li> Fast drying hair dryer!  </li>
            <li> When I was offered the Xtava, Allure 2200W hair dryer to review for an unbiased opinion I was pretty excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> One of my favorite parts was that the back vent didn&#x27;t try to eat my hair!</li>
            <li> Well First of all, everytime I turn it on Hi</li>
            <li> The features alone in this hair dryer, along with it&#x27;s sexy sleek look, will make your decision definite.</li>
            <li> lets me know its really working!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> not&amp;#34;.It is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
            <li> And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con.</li>
            <li> The hottest setting is really hot</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have tried a product from this brand</li>
            <li> I love that this has 3 different heat settings.</li>
            <li> It most definitely exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  </li>
            <li> Just got it, first use.  </li>
            <li> The highest heat setting is HOT.</li>
            <li> It is powerful and dries my hair fast.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> Upon first use by my gf</li>
            <li> Smell did finally go away and am glad I kept it.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer the diffuser more than concentrator nozzle.</li>
            <li> But, after using this hair dryer today for the first time.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my second Xtava Hair Dryer</li>
            <li> While, I can&#x27;t say what the exact weigh of the Allure dryer is, it does feel a TINSY bit heavier than the Rimini dryer.</li>
            <li> Its pretty light it weight compared to my old dryer with</li>
            <li> Works really well!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;ll check xtava first.</li>
            <li> which is great since I also have thick hair.</li>
            <li> It has the safety switch on the plug if it gets to hot</li>
            <li> Ps, I just placed a second order for 2 more.</li>
            <li> but it was no big deal considering how much more volume I gained.  </li>
            <li> I have borrowed many friends’ hair dryers during different conferences, get-togethers, and road trips.</li>
            <li> The problem I have always had with hair dryers is that the heat settings are too hot, lack of air flow, inconsistent heat, and weight.</li>
            <li> I have to say though, this hair dryer absolutely blows the others away!</li>
            <li> I love the multiple heat settings and blow settings.</li>
            <li> is kind of different to the picture one, but the stylish on my hair it was as expected</li>
            <li> Hot.</li>
            <li> The one I had been using now seems very bulky compared to this!</li>
            <li> It dries fast!</li>
            <li> It looks sleek and pretty too.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair great for thick hair.</li>
            <li> I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> Delivery was a day early!!!!</li>
            <li> By far, best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, and at a fraction of price I&#x27;ve paid in past for professional ones!</li>
            <li> The high heat setting is VERY HOT.</li>
            <li> This one comes in black and looks very stylish.</li>
            <li> only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is super nice classic black.</li>
            <li> I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do.</li>
            <li> My hair dried sleek and static free.</li>
            <li> It is quiet, it has a permanent cool setting as well as a cool shot, and the settings buttons are in a place that works for me, a left-hander.</li>
            <li> I love how lightweight, fast and VERY quiet this hairdryer is.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed my strands being shiny or silky,  but the dryer dries quickly and isn&#x27;t very loud.  </li>
            <li> Decided to buy this hairdryer based on all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &amp;#34;blew up&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks better than it has in a long time...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely pretty - doesn&#x27;t take up too much space.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer so far, particularly vs. previous Conair models.</li>
            <li> When given the chance to test this product during a promotion, I really was not sold on the idea at first.</li>
            <li> Plenty of heat on different levels and the cool setting is truly cool air which really does set my hair style.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I recieved this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
            <li> i love my new gadget it usually takes me about 20minutes to blow dry my hair and with this beauty it took me about 7 to 8 minutes ,,,,,love love it.</li>
            <li> I love the heavy-duty, long cord it has too!  </li>
            <li> (a quick check to Xtava&#x27;s site shows they are completely out of stock of</li>
            <li> I was able to blow dry my hair while retaining shine and softness .</li>
            <li> (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  </li>
            <li> I have alot of hair and love how my hair is dry faster with this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The power it delivers is perfect and it seems to dry my hair in half the time of my old one.</li>
            <li> It comes with one attachment that makes it easy to run a brush through your hair while blow drying it at the same time to the shape you want it in.</li>
            <li> I was able to dry my hair without any frizz.</li>
            <li> Light, hot, quiet.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will be buying products from Xtava in the future.</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds on hair dryers and my most recent purchase, prior to this one, was a feather light that I spend $180 on, it did, okay on my hair, but exploded after 8 months.  </li>
            <li> However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I only write reviews when I feel strongly about a product and this one is NOT a winner.</li>
            <li> The air flow is strong but there is a low setting for the air power too.</li>
            <li> IT seems to be a cord you would see on beauty salon&#x27;s equipment and seem that it is really strong and not likely to fray it</li>
            <li> and it looks large, yet</li>
            <li> Temp is perfect Hot is hot warm is warm and cold is cold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer.</li>
            <li> so I had to stop and buy a new one!!</li>
            <li> I need to be able to have a dryer that light enough to hold for a long time.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very easy while drying to slip your finger and go from warm to hot and not mean to.</li>
            <li> Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well.</li>
            <li> Other than this small issue, which I am already getting used to dealing with, I think this is probably the best dryer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Quiet and quick!</li>
            <li> I recommend this one very highly.</li>
            <li> I also really like the concentrator nozzle to use to focus on certain areas.</li>
            <li> The reason I dropped it to four stars is because it has a tendency to tangle my fine (not thin) hair, but the pros definitely outweigh the one con.</li>
            <li> the high setting is HOT.</li>
            <li> I have been needing a really good hairdryer because in a family of five it is hard to keep one in one room of the house.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Dries fast, low noise, and light weight.</li>
            <li> just gets the job done, much faster than others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> this seemed to seal the deal without having to use so much product my hair felt crunchy.  </li>
            <li> my hair is coming out very frizzy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s powerful and my hair dries faster and smoother compared to my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li> It really has the blowing power.  </li>
            <li> As soon as it was delivered I could tell immediately it was much lighter than my conair.</li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t have a problem with the weight.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that light and not that quiet.</li>
            <li> Important when you are drying hair  for several children and may have lotion on your hands</li>
            <li> the allure seemed to work very well.  </li>
            <li> Is light weight and quiet.</li>
            <li> , I have received two very service minded emails from the company.</li>
            <li> and I am very dissapointed in it.</li>
            <li> Dries fast...</li>
            <li> Very fprceful and dries my hair in 5 minutes-just like the professionals do it.</li>
            <li> It works well but doesn&#x27;t stay plugged into my outlet very well.</li>
            <li> It looks sleek and it gets my hair very sleek and straight.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thinner, straight hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I have been wasting time drying my hair when there have been products on the market like THIS that will get it done so much faster.</li>
            <li> I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference</li>
            <li> It performs better than expected.</li>
            <li> I have perfectly straight, non-frizzing hair</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair &amp; this dryer works very well with my diffuser.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It was really lightweight and has a very sleek design.</li>
            <li> It comes with a removeable nozzle that centralizes  the heat that I really like.</li>
            <li> Not by much though.  </li>
            <li> However, the width of the Rimini is much wider and casts a wider shot of heat than the Allure.  </li>
            <li> also seems much longer than the Rimini Cord.    </li>
            <li> It does work much quicker, as the listing claims.</li>
            <li> The Allure hair dryer makes this task so much easier.</li>
            <li> it really gave my hair some body.  </li>
            <li> However, if I had shorter hair or I did run a brush through my hair as I guided the blowdrier, it wouldn&#x27;t cause so much havoc.  </li>
            <li> i really got the results i was looking for.</li>
            <li> My arm is not tired after blow drying my hair anymore.</li>
            <li> and It really wasn&#x27;t doing much ,</li>
            <li> It blow drys your hair fast and where it doesn&#x27;t frizz.</li>
            <li> Fast drying.</li>
            <li> This thing is much easier on the ears.</li>
            <li> There is plenty of power and it is very lightweight.</li>
            <li> In moms world that is something I really like.  </li>
            <li> There is really nothing I do not like about this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> so it doesn&#x27;t get very tangled during use</li>
            <li> Very quiet and extremely light weight.  </li>
            <li> The style is very sleak.  </li>
            <li> It dries my hair incredibly fast but also gives it body that lasts for a couple of days.</li>
            <li> so it dont really matter for me.</li>
            <li> so you can control how much heat you need.</li>
            <li> and it arrived lightening fast.</li>
            <li> It is balanced very well</li>
            <li> I expected it to be a bit better from reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> I also really like that the dryer is salon quality without the salon price</li>
            <li> and i would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I like it, thank u for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> 4.9 stars on 330 review is very suspicious.</li>
            <li> though, I really like this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> and i love that it offers different speeds and heat settings.</li>
            <li> It is a powerful 2200 watt hair dryer with a modern sleek design that is completely lightweight.</li>
            <li> but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been several years since I&#x27;ve purchased a blow dryer, and quite honestly thought they were all basically the same.</li>
            <li> i highly recommend for anyone who is looking to achieve ultra stylish do&#x27;s to those just looking to dry their hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> Was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank.</li>
            <li> I could direct the air flow right to the area needed.</li>
            <li> This is so powerful, it really does dry my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> On the other hand, if you have both left- and right-handed family members, this might be a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Im pleased that I bought this product to replace my old hairdryer which took 20mins to dry my hair, happy to say it has cut the timing of drying my long hair down to 8minutes and leaves my hair smooth enough not to use the GHD hair irons.</li>
            <li> My only criticism is in the design of the buttons not he neck - the buttons are very &#x27;soft&#x27; - easy to push and change the setting while in use.  </li>
            <li> There are as many temperature and and fan-speed settings as on any other dryer, and they all work quite well.  </li>
            <li> It is better than expected!  </li>
            <li> I use the dryer with a flat brush, and have noticed my hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz</li>
            <li> The barrel is longer than most other dryers I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> So, one doesn&#x27;t stick out as being better than the other in regards to comfort or ease of use.    </li>
            <li> i really like just how well built it is, looks and feels very durable and high quality.</li>
            <li> hairdryer is a decent size, yet very lightweight.</li>
            <li> The concentrator nozzle allowed me to dry one section of my hair at a time very quickly.</li>
            <li> The speed and heat buttons are &#x27;user friendly&#x27; and the heavy cord is nice and long.</li>
            <li> so she doesn&#x27;t need a high setting, or much heat*...</li>
            <li> I have long hair and have never been able to dry my hair as quickly as I can with this hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> She loves it and spends less time getting ready for the day which she loves even more.</li>
            <li> I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future.</li>
            <li> hair dryer is super quiet and performs very well.</li>
            <li> Which with the magic of the blow dryer helps me to get my hair dry in 10 minutes, not 20-30minutes like my old blow dryer</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair (spiral curls in the back and looser curls up top) and the air director thingy (that is a technical term!)</li>
            <li> am a licensed cosmetologist and I can tell you from experience that this hair dryer is professional quality and is exactly what I would use in my home salon.</li>
            <li> and I have been able to drastically cut down on the amount of flat-ironing I do.  </li>
            <li> I knew that I would be using this the first night I received it for a quick dry to prepare for a date.</li>
            <li> I got a new one!  </li>
            <li> I suggest it to anyone who needs a new dryer, or just wants one that does the job right!ng wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest it to anyone who needs a new dryer, or just wants one</li>
            <li> Yes the blow dryer works well to dry my  hair , but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth without frizz .</li>
            <li> if you are looking for something with no frills, that will get the main job done of drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if you are looking for something with no frills, that will get the main job done of drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially like the nozzle that comes with this hair dryer, as my hair is beyond super frizzy.</li>
            <li> are my salons main ingredient</li>
            <li> Wishing it had a little bit more power in the cool blast but no big deal.</li>
            <li> It definitely lives up to the quiet part for sure even when on the high setting.</li>
            <li> It is a high powered machine that works efficiently to dry the hair precisely with the attachable nozzle.</li>
            <li> First i would like to say that alot of hair tools claim to be professional but aren&#x27;t really, but this hair dryer gives the look, feel and performance of a professional tool.</li>
            <li> , though my hair isn&#x27;t particularly picky so it might not actually mean anything to you.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> The high heat was too high for me as I have a</li>
            <li> and I needed a dryer with high heat and high volume of air.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this blow dryer.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> My pompadour would not be as high if it weren&#x27;t for this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It has two airflow settings - high and medium.</li>
            <li> A burning smell on the high setting -</li>
            <li> I work a very long week, so I&#x27;m delighted to have found a blow-dryer that cuts down on my drying time.  </li>
            <li> I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  </li>
            <li> just be careful if you have fine hair like me.</li>
            <li> It dries nicely and very quiet compared to any other dryers I have had.  </li>
            <li> Silent, hot, and lightweight!</li>
            <li> I have to keep it on the middle setting because it&#x27;s so hot!</li>
            <li> My hair dries very quickly and comes out smooth (little to zero frizz!!!).</li>
            <li> I had an Elchim 2001 previous to this for 7 years, never ever blew breaker.. and my hair always came out great in less then 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> Very fast drying and my hair is much smoother than with my last one (which was not Xtava).</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is also made of high quality materials which is a plus for me as It needs to be able to last a long time.</li>
            <li> and it dries it twice as fast as my old one.  </li>
            <li> In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn’t as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair</li>
            <li> I do think the cool shot button is a bit strange</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still quiet and powerful.  </li>
            <li> Powerful dryer with various heat settings.</li>
            <li> The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet.</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this hair dryer, even ordered again after sending back the first one that arrived without the concentrator nozzle.</li>
            <li> major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands.</li>
            <li> So I tested my new Allure 2200w hair dryer and so far I really like it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get as many tangles in my VERY long hair, as I would have with just any regular hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Within less than four months, I noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire.  </li>
            <li> I get my hair dried in half the time with this dryer, and am completely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like super clear but enough to k ow</li>
            <li> but I needed something powerful to dry my hair fast without damaging it.</li>
            <li> I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I&#x27;m not kidding.  </li>
            <li> It is so much more powerful than the one I have been using and gets my hair dry in half the time (the box says 80% of the time</li>
            <li> Drys my hair quickly and the cord is long.</li>
            <li> so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way.</li>
            <li> I already had a decent hair dryer, but was interested in getting a second non-travel sized dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair is kind of long, not quite to the middle of my back</li>
            <li> Now I need a new camera</li>
            <li> My new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  </li>
            <li> Needed a new dryer and have been shopping around for a while.  </li>
            <li> so I never have to live without it.  </li>
            <li> Also, i live what the company stands for.</li>
            <li> I have to purchase a new hair dryer...</li>
            <li> Just received my new blow dryer in the mail.  </li>
            <li> It is less bulky than the Chi, lightweight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> If you want your own salon style blow out look no further girl get yourself a round brush you can handle this.</li>
            <li> It allows me to dry my hair quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Also the cord is long which is great for me because I sit down to blow dry my daughters hair</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, not horribly loud!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a professional blow dryer I would highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I recently became aware of Xtava products while looking for a new hairdryer.</li>
            <li> but the nozzle is so long that I can&#x27;t style the back of my hair easily.  </li>
            <li> So for the past 2 years or more I have not touched a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Professional results without the price!</li>
            <li> My old one would suck it in if you got it within an inch of that vent, I am tendered headed, IT HURT!  </li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> One problem is not mentioned by other reviewers, so it may be unique to me.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m throwing the old one out for this!</li>
            <li> and then I put it on the second higher heat setting until I finished the process.</li>
            <li> it is a bit too hot for the total drying process</li>
            <li> Also even though the hottest setting is quite hot the hair dryer itself only heats up at the end.  </li>
            <li> Not dis&#x27;ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair.  </li>
            <li> It is certainly very powerful — I&#x27;d say the middle heat setting is equal to my old blow dryer and</li>
            <li> Finally it donned on me that perhaps I needed to push in the red button on the plug since it was kind of sticking out further than the yellow button (the reset and test buttons).</li>
            <li> The company was nice enough to refund my money once I could finally get hold of someone (note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website), however I do not recommend due to safety issues.</li>
            <li> My old blow dryer broke so on a whim i decided to search for a new one.</li>
            <li> Shipment came early, and product was brand new.</li>
            <li> EVERYTHING - strange, right?).</li>
            <li> I do like that the cord is long and allows you to move around and not be right by your outlet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> so i needed something that was powerful and cut my dry time in 1/2 and seal my cuticles.</li>
            <li> When I received this hair dryer in the mail I was so excited to test it out as my old hair dryer just crapped out the other day</li>
            <li> I went on the website to register my product and will be trying their flat irons and other items they sell, however, getting amazon is so much of a better deal!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has all the features that I need, like multiple heat settings, multiple air flow settings and even a cool blast to set the style.</li>
            <li> My favorite thing is that you push down the on/off button and heat controls, you don&#x27;t SLIDE it as with my last dryer.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than I felt the description indicated, but otherwise it is fine.  </li>
            <li> :) I would definitely buy other products by Xtava!</li>
            <li> The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful.</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and not super noisy.</li>
            <li> It has cut my drying time down significantly.</li>
            <li> The only thing I wish was different was that the Cool air button were a switch (you have to hold it down) and that the air was actually cool.</li>
            <li> Works great to dry my thick hair in a short time.</li>
            <li> Very powerful, sturdy, leaves hair soft, dries quickly, not too loud, and aesthetically pleasing.</li>
            <li> It looks nice but be very careful because (correct me if I am wrong)  it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s pretty lightweight and has a long cord.  </li>
            <li> My hairdryer is so old</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I knew it was a professional version</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after my old Conair bit the dust.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far.</li>
            <li> Like don&#x27;t leave it in one place for too long, hot.</li>
            <li> I also realized I&#x27;m going to miss the retracting cord of my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a professional grade one, and always wondered what the difference would be in my hair once I was finished.</li>
            <li> My old dryer was dying</li>
            <li> I like this one so far.</li>
            <li> Tripped the breaker in our old house.</li>
            <li> I understood why it was a professional quality hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The Allure features two speeds and three heat settings to offer control and professional styling versatility for all hair types.</li>
            <li> This is also very lightweight and sleek, not to mention the fact that it is quiet.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer than with my old conair hair dryer.</li>
            <li> but this one is extra gentle</li>
            <li> so I needed a professional grade dryer.</li>
            <li> This is by far the nicest blow dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Consequently, I ended up having to endure the life of no hair dryer for nearly 3 months.</li>
            <li> Same quality blow dryer they use in the salon for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Allure professional hairdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> when I used my old blow</li>
            <li> The dryer is not heavy and has substantial amount of heat.</li>
            <li> It suddenly has some shine, including the ends that use to look very frizzy.</li>
            <li> Quiet for something with so much power.</li>
            <li> The air flow is very focused and dries my hair in 5 minutes (on medium temperature + low power setting).</li>
            <li> A very well made product that is built to last ...</li>
            <li> I could not buy that one, but i started searching for professional hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> I am at the end of my keratin treatment and had to fight with my old dryer, but this one makes my hair look like i just got a keratin treatment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The power was unexpected.  </li>
            <li> I have a really sensitive scalp</li>
            <li> The dryer isn’t completely soundless but it isn’t obnoxiously loud compared to others I’ve owned.</li>
            <li> This was to replace an old Conair.  </li>
            <li> It seems like a very sturdy product, not like some of the low end products out there.</li>
            <li> but I am sure works well with thick hair.  </li>
            <li> In a good, no, a great way!</li>
            <li> The only dryer I have ever owned that made me excited to blow dry my hair!</li>
            <li> finally, the Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Technology apparently works because I noticed much much less static and frizz than before</li>
            <li> After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I&#x27;m sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer,</li>
            <li> about 5-7 minutes flat, maybe 10 if I start with sopping wet hair) and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> When I use it with the Goody Quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that I only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron.</li>
            <li> If I hold it in the usual way, it is extremely easy to accidentally push the buttons with your hand and inadvertently change the settings.  </li>
            <li> The cord is fantastic because it doesn&#x27;t curl and not easily.</li>
            <li> It has enough heat settings in my opinion and also includes a cool setting, similar to a hooded dryer, which I like, my last dryer did not have this.</li>
            <li> I love the sleek black design!!!</li>
            <li> One thing I would seriously advise, make sure that the bathroom plug can handle the wattage.</li>
            <li> If I was to be technical with my star rating, it would get 4.5 stars from me, simply because of the problems I had upon first use.</li>
            <li> If I was to be technical with my star rating, it would get 4.5 stars from me, simply because of the problems I had upon first use.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful , well designed dryer that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say more other than I hope it last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The low setting is too low and the high setting is TOO high.</li>
            <li> Two speed settings, high and low.</li>
            <li> It also has two speeds, low and high.</li>
            <li> Would purchase another, but will be surprised if it will need to be replaced in the new future.  </li>
            <li> It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> The problem might be that the Allure&#x27;s safety plug is designed in such a way that makes it strangely incompatible with my specific outlet but in the interest of full disclosure I have to point out my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  </li>
            <li> As for weight, it is not bad, but if you are looking for a &amp;#34;light weight&amp;#34; dryer for an elderly person this might be too heavy.  </li>
            <li> Between that and the fact that you get such a high end, quality made product  for such a reasonable price,  I  am totally sold on this company.  </li>
            <li> Between that and the fact that you get such a high end, quality made product  for such a reasonable price,  I  am totally sold on this company.  </li>
            <li> I usually let my hair dry naturally which takes more than 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is light weight and cuts dry time.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  </li>
            <li> I simply moved to a new area of the house, and the rest of the test went</li>
            <li> I live in the Deep South.</li>
            <li> I think a good deal of the weight comes from the cord, which is thick and heavy.</li>
            <li> cord is very long and heavy duty, which makes it nice to not be limited in cord</li>
            <li> so I sat right down to do it.  </li>
            <li> Have had no other issues with it.  </li>
            <li> Wish the low temperature was a big stronger as the second is just a tad too hot for puppy</li>
            <li> I will go back to my old hair dryer !</li>
            <li> Straightens thick, curly, frizzy hair quickly!</li>
            <li> but if I have to get ready to go somewhere and don&#x27;t have time to let it air dry, or if it&#x27;s still wet when I get ready to go to bed I will finish drying it as it is really damaging to go to bed with wet hair.  </li>
            <li> The con for me (someone that has long, thin, fine hair) is that it tends to be hot even on the lower settings.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice hair dryer, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that its a little heavy for me.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely surprise by all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I need less than half the time to dry my hair now and the result looks amazing.</li>
            <li> A hair dryer is not something I generally replace until I need it.  </li>
            <li> As someone with thick hair that is used to spending tons of time just drying my hair, this is a huge plus.</li>
            <li> I have long hair, not extremely thick but with the winter weather here in Indiana, the frizzies have set in.  </li>
            <li> And I really like that the cord is extra long to reach an outlet in another room.  </li>
            <li> Prior to using this Xtava Allure hair dryer, I was using a old hair dryer that worked well in its prime, but was loosing its finesse.</li>
            <li> It dried my thick, fine hair quickly and left it without frizz and with shine!  </li>
            <li> Also it runs very quiet compared to  her old one.</li>
            <li> The Allure Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer by XTAVA has totally exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  </li>
            <li> This attachment is said to direct maximized condensed air flow to the area you are targeting, adding precision and focus while controlling frizz and style outcome which it definitely does!!</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is a definite upgrade from my old Conair one.  </li>
            <li> If Allure is blowing harder, I cannot really tell.</li>
            <li> My old (Revlon) hair dryer went kaput, and I went to a local store and bought another Revlon to replace it.  </li>
            <li> We both tired it out and love</li>
            <li> I was amazed at how I could grab the blowing end of the dryer just behind the actual air outlet and not burn my hand, even when running on full hot for 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don&#x27;t pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product</li>
            <li> The heat settings are very similar in regards to the low is not hot enough and the high is almost too hot.</li>
            <li> The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all.</li>
            <li> You can tell right away this is a heavy duty hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It normally takes me 20 - 30 minutes to get it completely dry.</li>
            <li> Then I need to use the flat iron to calm it all down.</li>
            <li> The small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is, I never use the cool air function anyway</li>
            <li> but my hair is much healthier now as opposed to when using other dryers.  </li>
            <li> Much happier with the other purchase.</li>
            <li> the design is very sleek and sharp looking.</li>
            <li> The description says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;ultra lightweight&amp;#34; but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer.</li>
            <li> If i had to have one complaint, the dryer itself is a little heavy, other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> Long thick cord feels like it will last many years of abuse (repeated wrappings around dryer).</li>
            <li> I have thick long hair and it leaves my hair soft and gets it dry super fast.</li>
            <li> It took me about 5 minutes to dry my hair once I was situated in the new part of the house.</li>
            <li> This allows my hair to dry much faster since all the air is going directly where the hair is still wet.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t all that quiet, and though it&#x27;s not really heavy, it is bigger than I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> and all it offers for such an extremely low price!!  </li>
            <li> Based on our experience and our different hair styles, we both love this dryer and stand behind it based on its quality and construction.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only major downside is that it is quite noisy.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly.</li>
            <li> It blows just enough air, at the right temperature to cut my drying time in half!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it works any differently than my last Ionic hair dryer, in terms of controlling frizz on my naturally curly hair, but it works equally well at a minimum.</li>
            <li> Pretty heavy as well.</li>
            <li> This blow dryer was heavy and too hot.  </li>
            <li> It stays cool and does not warm up at all.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not quite as light as I&#x27;d imagined and maybe even a little bigger than my old one, I wouldn&#x27;t consider it to be heavy or bulky</li>
            <li> My old hair dryer would take me 20 mins to dry my hair</li>
            <li> Cuts drying time in half without using too much heat.</li>
            <li> It took me 15 minutes to dry my hair and it was soft shinny and no frizz.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is black, not a silver color as in the picture; very sleek in design.</li>
            <li> This dryer comes with attachment to help dry your hear directly on the spot that you need and not making the rest of your hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before.</li>
            <li> (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  </li>
            <li> I was concerned that it would not dry my hair enough because blow dryers and my hair don’t get along too well.</li>
            <li> but it makes blow drying long wet hair so much faster.</li>
            <li> I thought is might be to strong for my thin hair but</li>
            <li> Chose this particular hair dryer after comparing the features with other similar products.</li>
            <li> I have very thick but fine hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little heavier than my old dryer, but I&#x27;ll deal with it if it doesn&#x27;t catch on fire while I&#x27;m using it like the old one did!</li>
            <li> I usually have to flat iron my hair after drying to get the frizz out, but this dried my hair super fast</li>
            <li> It only takes about 4 minutes to completely dry my hair as opposed to 8-10 with my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about ionic dryers because I previously had the same hair dryer for over 15 years.</li>
            <li> The nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when I tried to use one on my previous dryers, it would always fall off.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time she never dries it totally dry because she gets tired of holding the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful appliance - so powerful, in fact, that my long hair gets blown around like crazy, which leaves it tangled as hell when I&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> ALL of my hair was dry, no slightly damp spots at all within 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> I only owned an old one which I only used to dry off my cats after a bath.</li>
            <li> Frankly my old and less expensive Conair was much sturdier and not as cheaply made as this Allure Model  </li>
            <li> So, I guess I now own a high powered air blower, as it still works but does not produce heat. :(</li>
            <li> I usually dread having to blow dry my hair as it is very long and pretty thick, so it would often take an hour or more to get it ALMOST all the way dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been around for a &amp;#34;while&amp;#34; and no other hair dry</li>
            <li> The cord is super long and thick</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this particular hair dryer for those with long thick like hair.</li>
            <li> It really does tame your frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to learn what settings to have it on for your particular hair type</li>
            <li> Having thick hair that is prone to frizz and takes forever to dry, I&#x27;m super picky about my hairdryer, and after using this one about a month</li>
            <li> It is considerably longer than my other dryer.</li>
            <li> My thick, curly, frizzy hair was left looking shiny, soft, and brand new.</li>
            <li> When round brushing my hair is slick and freeze free.</li>
            <li> This entire thing won&#x27;t last too long.  </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s heavy, really long with the concentrator on it, AND LOUD!!!</li>
            <li> The chrome looking lint trap at the back can be twisted easily and pulled out for cleaning.</li>
            <li> This one is great--so much more substantial and quality feeling and noticeably quieter and less shrill sounding than the Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also seems to dry my hair a lot faster then my old dry with saves me time!!  </li>
            <li> It dries hair so much faster than what i have used in the past</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t describe as being quiet, but it is not loud either.  </li>
            <li> Extra long cord.</li>
            <li> my hair will never be flat again.</li>
            <li> Even after brushing my hair it isn&#x27;t flat.  </li>
            <li> and I need it to be long enough.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a small dryer,  but it&#x27;s not at all heavy ,  especially considering the power</li>
            <li> The dryer itself isn&#x27;t heavy and sounds quieter than a normal hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was looking to replace my old red conair 1875 watt small quiet hairdryer that finally died.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer from Xtava after purchasing the Professional Infrared Flat Iron With Tourmaline Ceramic Plates - (Silk Edition Black).</li>
            <li> I can dry my hair on low.</li>
            <li> Not only does it dry my hair faster,  </li>
            <li> Jump out of the shower, blow dry my hair for a very short time, and I&#x27;m on my way!</li>
            <li> Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use.</li>
            <li> I like that the cord is a long round cord rather than the normal cords that twist over time.  </li>
            <li> When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  </li>
            <li> I no longer use the flat iron since I no longer need it!!</li>
            <li> I only hope that this dryer last longer then any other I have had.</li>
            <li> Because of the time it takes to blow dry, and the fact I am semi lazy, I have had the same motel type dryer for about 15 years (YIKES) and been hesitant to buy a new one figuring they would ALL take forever to dry the mop on my head.</li>
            <li> Most disappointing product yet in Amazon</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they are no longer available -</li>
            <li> most hair dryers this one has three (3) heat settings and two (2) speed settings, including the cold shot button.</li>
            <li> Has many adjustments for speed and heat plus cold blast.</li>
            <li> Since it is so long, dryers with shorter barrels don&#x27;t allow me to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The weight and noise are minor detractions.</li>
            <li> If you have long thich hair do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is softer, the blow out lasts longer, and it dried faster then my old dryer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I like the long cord.</li>
            <li> Not as quiet as I expected</li>
            <li> My daughter and I have long hair (mine is to my waist and</li>
            <li> The cord is long and allows for lots of movement.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several over the years and spent lots of money on them.</li>
            <li> Which in the world of a teenager that is a long time.  </li>
            <li> , has a long cord, is sleek and not bulky, and comes with a concentration too.</li>
            <li> It dries my long hair in no time and and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy.</li>
            <li> I actually had to figure out where I had wet hair because I&#x27;m used to having still damp hair.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not a professional at blow drying.  </li>
            <li> Its not a light weight as a lot of people are describing but its not terribly heavy either just longer</li>
            <li> Works fast for my wife&#x27;s thick long hair.</li>
            <li> Negatives: cool shot button is a flawed design (a tiny plastic lever you press into the handle housing)</li>
            <li> but once I got that-well, I have absolutely no complaints and would recommend it to anybody with short or long hair.</li>
            <li> Actually, the first use for this hairdryer was to replace the broken glass on a Galaxy S4.</li>
            <li> With myself and two thick haired daughters using it a fast dryer is a must.</li>
            <li> It finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight.</li>
            <li> and takes long to dry .i</li>
            <li> It has a long, sturdy power cord, which makes the dryer easier to maneuver around to dry and style your hair.  </li>
            <li> For anyone out there with think hair you know how long it takes to blow dry your hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the dryer is a little too long for my short arms, but I can still use it.  </li>
            <li> Definitely a salon-style dryer; so much faster on my thick hair than conventional dryers.</li>
            <li> When I originally purchased the dryer, Amazon fulfilled the order and shipped the wrong one.</li>
            <li> I have had to get used to holding this dryer in a different way than I&#x27;ve always held all other hairdryers.  </li>
            <li> As for how quiet it is, I would say it&#x27;s as quiet as the other &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; dryers I&#x27;ve owned made by other companies.</li>
            <li> The mirrored outlet cover is totally flush with the electrical outlet&#x27;s face and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems with other appliances&#x27; plugs but</li>
            <li> My daughter uses the high heat for her long thick hair.  </li>
            <li> I have never used a hair dryer that could dry my long hair in under 30 minutes until I tried this one !</li>
            <li> There is also a detachable piece to put on it for when you want to dry your hair section by section to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now I blow dry my hair every time it&#x27;s washed.  </li>
            <li> I can usually dry my hair in about 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> The shape of the dryer has a longer barrel which allowed me to dry my hair from underneath.  </li>
            <li> and now I can dry my hair in 5 mins.</li>
            <li> With this hair dryer I had it completely dry in 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> It took us minutes to dry her hair on a medium heat setting.</li>
            <li> I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  </li>
            <li> She now dries her hair completely dry instead of letting it go damp.  </li>
            <li> I used a vented paddle brush to blow dry</li>
            <li> With this dryer, I can dry my hair in 10 minutes</li>
            <li> The Allure would seem to offer the benefits of an expensive professional tool at a surprisingly reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t blow dry every single time</li>
            <li> /&gt;After trying this ionic, ceramic hair dryer, I will never go back to using a conventional one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely do not regret the long wait.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair, but it dryers my hair faster than my previous dryer and my hair looks so much healthier.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s from dripping just out of the shower wet to nearly bone dry in less than half the time.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:e5ff7a1f6cf2306e1ed10662c3a2720f]]My hair is so thick it used to take me almost 30 minutes to dry it even with the use of a hair dryer, until I used this professional ionic hair dryer!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I have used a LOT of different hair dryers throughout the last few years, but due to</li>
            <li> The power levels are stronger than any other dryer I&#x27;ve purchased and the noise volumn is no different than other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> so it won&#x27;t made my wrist tired since I have long hair that normally takes a long time to dry</li>
            <li> The other minor things does not hindrance the funtionality of this hair dryer</li>
            <li> The heat level is hot enough to tackle my course hair and my drying time has decreased by a few minutes.</li>
            <li> It is not super heavy, even though it has a really large heavy duty cord.</li>
            <li> It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I&#x27;m only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day</li>
            <li> In at least half the time that it previously took my hair is not only dry but styled when I am through with this new tool.</li>
            <li> My old blowdryer was awkward to work with and weak, and I would only blow dry my hair for special occasions.  </li>
            <li> I love the cold shot button, I use a big round brush to give a little curl on my bangs..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long it is going to last however.</li>
            <li> Heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I had wet hair, and decided to give this try.</li>
            <li> A few minutes on medium heat and a low air setting</li>
            <li> I use round brush  while drying my hair and now that is enough to lift the roots of my hair!.</li>
            <li> This dryer is not much heavier than the one it replaced.  </li>
            <li> and I washed it, put a repair cream on ,then toweled dried it and put the dryer on low speed</li>
            <li> It is somewhat heavy, but this is to be expected with the extra power that it provides</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the xtava diffuser accessory (I only dry my hair with the diffuser as I have long, curly, thick hair).</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it&#x27;s cut my time in half.</li>
            <li> Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....</li>
            <li> My hair is dry in less than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile</li>
            <li> Its long and thick and my arms are hurting because it takes so long to get everything dry.</li>
            <li> With long thick hair I&#x27;d gotten used to spending 15-20 minutes just drying my hair enough to allow me to style it.</li>
            <li> and it usually takes a long time to blow dry.</li>
            <li> and it was only about 4 minutes for my thick hair to be completely dry and cooled.  </li>
            <li> When it is on high, yes it dries my hair fast but it also tangles it into a rats nest and damages it very bad and the low setting would take hours to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> So I tried 2 other outlets...</li>
            <li> but I have never had this problem with other hair dryers.  </li>
            <li> The cord on the dryer is longer than other</li>
            <li> so be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
            <li> you check out the pictures in other&#x27;s reviews</li>
            <li> My hair is coming out smoother than it did with my other dryer.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t use any other tools on my hair.</li>
            <li> I plan to look at other products made by them as well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to buy any other hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Not at all quiet, I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would include that in a description of this dryer.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time and I am obsessed with it.</li>
            <li> After that I pressed the cool shot button and it came out cold.</li>
            <li> (so be careful!)</li>
            <li> but I think it is easier to handle than my other Xtava.  </li>
            <li> , I do not have to keep adjusting it in my hand due to the weight being wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  </li>
            <li> In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It usually takes about 20 minutes to dry her hair completely  dry.  </li>
            <li> Fine-haired women just need to be careful about pointing the dryer down the hair shaft to keep the tangles at bay.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the dryer is a little heavy.</li>
            <li> My hair dried in no time at all (and I have very long hair), and it has tons of shine to it.</li>
            <li> I was using round brush to dry it</li>
            <li> but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  </li>
            <li> Anywhere I pointed it for a few seconds resulted in dry sections of hair.  </li>
            <li> The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think)</li>
            <li> My hair is smoother than usual as if I had flat ironed it.  </li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair,usually take me over and hour to dry my hair</li>
            <li> It looks like they might sale makeup and other products but that part of the side says it&#x27;s down.</li>
            <li> and so still a bit unwieldy in my unpracticed hands, but it dries my thick, coarse, shoulder-length hair faster than any other device I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair and its naturally curly</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair usually takes about 8-10 mins to dry and that dry time has been cut in half!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the extension does not clip on.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the website doesn&#x27;t seem to be fullyup and running.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the weight, could be lighter.</li>
            <li> It dries my short hair, thick hair in no time at all.</li>
            <li> We did not use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the cord is really thick</li>
            <li> She claims it took less than half the time of her other dryer.</li>
            <li> She states that it has cut her hair drying time down about 10 minutes.  </li>
            <li> My hairdresser usually uses two blowers at once to dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I did not find this product heavy like other review state, the design and weight</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel bulky or heavy as other blow dryer&#x27;s</li>
            <li> so there is a LOT of it, but each individual strand is very small in size.</li>
            <li> but it is very sharp looking.</li>
            <li> but its kinda heavy compared to other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and when I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair, I don&#x27;t need to flat iron it.</li>
            <li> This dryer cut the drying time down to less than half the time.</li>
            <li> It dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned (can dry and style my thick, shoulder length layered hair in</li>
            <li> This was previously a 5-star rating.</li>
            <li> Looks sharp, cut my hair drying time in half!</li>
            <li> My blow-dry time has been cut in half with this blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> Cut styling time in half</li>
            <li> Oddly packaged.</li>
            <li> I like this since I move around a bit while drying and have accidentally unplugged my previous hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I received it in less than 48hrs.</li>
            <li> However, there are slight differences between the two</li>
            <li> Hair dryer was wrapped in a plastic covering, and has a black shiny finish and matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It also is high-powered and dries my hair is less time than the dryer I was previously using.</li>
            <li> The black color of the dryer is also sleek, and I like that it comes with the concentrator attachment.</li>
            <li> Less frizz, faster drying time</li>
            <li> This dryer has made blow drying my hair less of a chore.</li>
            <li> My hair did tangle slightly</li>
            <li> But have to say it&#x27;s not noticeably lighter than the previous unit we had</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s also black</li>
            <li> and I am obsessed with hanging stuff on cabinet doors to avoid clutter in main compartments.</li>
            <li> Only complaint would be the burnt plastic smell that probably lasted for the first 3-4 weeks, was annoying enough I almost returned it.  </li>
            <li> The hot is hot and the cold is cold as if you had air conditioning for your head.  </li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair and this dryer</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> It has a thick long cord.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and thick.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace one that my daughter burned up while drying her long, thick hair.  </li>
            <li> and it usually takes me at least 15 to 20 mins to dry my hair (even with living in a very dry climate)</li>
            <li> My hair dried in about half the time as with my previous hair dryer.  </li>
            <li> Purchased it for myself, but, used it to dry my daughter&#x27;s very thick, long hair ~ dried in half the time of other blowers used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It drops out at least once every time I blow dry.</li>
            <li> single complaint is that the toggle switches on the handle that control</li>
            <li> , I have had to use argon oil on it just to tame it down to a manageable level.  </li>
            <li> It has cut the drying time for my 4c long thick hair in half!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick  hair, and I use a hair dryer a few times a week with a round ceramic brush to straighten it.</li>
            <li> They include a little card explaining that their products are made by women.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than I thought</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;cold blast&amp;#34; button is a neat little feature.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is a little hefty compared to others</li>
            <li> The cold shot button must be held down but it shoots out a nice cold blast of air to help set your hair.  </li>
            <li> Had a little trouble attaching the diffuser to the hair dryer, just turn on the dryer and it attaches with the heat.</li>
            <li> My wife complains that it&#x27;s a little heavy</li>
            <li> It also has the cold shot feature I really like.</li>
            <li> With this dryer it dried in no time</li>
            <li> The smoke alarm in that area in the house is a few feet away from the bathroom door.</li>
            <li> I bought this dryer because my old one was wearing out and a piece of the nozzle came off - making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I dried my hair within 15 minutes</li>
            <li> It is sturdy, but I don&#x27;t consider it heavy.</li>
            <li> I have 3c/4a hair and it dried and straightened my hair in mins</li>
            <li> After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked at this one online a few times but couldn&#x27;t justify the price.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> This dryer is so heavy</li>
            <li> i towel dried my hair and combed out.</li>
            <li> I am using it a few times before deciding if I&#x27;m going to keep it just based on temperature.</li>
            <li> Cord too heavy and keeps pulling out of the outlet.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty chord.</li>
            <li> hair dryer is heavy but it packs a lot of heat and did not make my hair frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> dried about 3/4 times faster.</li>
            <li> Weight is on the heavy side: 2 lbs (not the 1.6 lbs described)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cord is a little stiff and I wish it had a diffuser.</li>
            <li> I can now blow dry my hair in half the time it used to take me, which is a plus because I tend to run late!</li>
            <li> It seriously cut the time it takes to dry my hair in half!</li>
            <li> less clutter on my bathroom sink!</li>
            <li> and it dries in half the time!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer has cut my time in half!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight and has cut my drying time in HALF!</li>
            <li> The shape on the dryer directs the air and heat to the spot it is needed in, other dryers blow air everywhere and can be hard to style with.</li>
            <li> I read on at least one of the other reviews that the power cord was just a regualr plug, but mine was one of those safety kinds.  </li>
            <li> I get disappointed whenever I use any other hair dryer because it&#x27;s simply not the same!</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely long and VERY thick hair.</li>
            <li> daughter has very thick and long hair.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight to handle with a thick black cord.</li>
            <li> I have longer thick hair and this dryer cuts my hair styling time in half.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item in late Feb, and it blew up in early May - past the return point for Amazon, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s quieter than others I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li> I used the nozzle and a round brush and straightened my hair with the dryer!</li>
            <li> A waste of money!</li>
            <li> If it works on my difficult to straighten hair, it will definitely work on anyones!</li>
            <li> NOT OK.</li>
            <li> so I usually can&#x27;t tell the difference between a $10 dryer and a $100 dryer</li>
            <li> Fits well in small hand.</li>
            <li> I am the flip-your-head-over-for-more-body type of styler, and I don&#x27;t usually brush-and-blow, so</li>
            <li> my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works well, dries my hair quicker than others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is one that I have heard from other viewers - the control buttons are somewhat awkward.  </li>
            <li> Very frustrating and going back to a Remington hair</li>
            <li> Works well, but very heavy to hold with one hand.</li>
            <li> This one does it itself in half the time!!</li>
            <li> Kept turning off or changing the settings due to the button location on the handle -  Frustrating.</li>
            <li> but it isn&#x27;t hard to grip or control.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to style my hair.</li>
            <li> but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I now blows only cold air.  </li>
            <li> My one complaint is that the concentrator nozzle keeps falling off of mine.</li>
            <li> The nozzle was designed to eliminate or at least decrease the amount of frizz that you have, while giving your hair the volume and sass that you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> at least 2000W.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have is the cold shot button.</li>
            <li> I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not loving it.</li>
            <li> It no longer works and actually heats up at a dangerous level.</li>
            <li> This was delivered well within the promised window even though we were in the middle of one of the worst weather weeks this winter so far.  </li>
            <li> I’ve owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change.</li>
            <li> I have medium length, thick, wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair</li>
            <li> I have naturally thick and curly hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair</li>
            <li> It was also awkward to handle , the nozzle is long .</li>
            <li> Seriously.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my girlfriend&#x27;s stupid loud blow dryer that woke me up every morning.</li>
            <li> they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have to use the past tense because it blew up.</li>
            <li> I like how it has a cold burst button like my other dryer.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s freezing cold here, so leaving hair wet is an uncomfortable option even when indoors...but</li>
            <li> she has really thin hair</li>
            <li> the seams are somewhat poorly made-</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use..</li>
            <li> It is extremely frustrating.  </li>
            <li> I took a star away because this is very heavy in hand and awkwardly balanced (and that is without adding the removable tip).</li>
            <li> I actually live in Florida and humidity is awful.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s awkward and hard to use.  </li>
            <li> I never really liked her going out in the cold with damp</li>
            <li> I hold the brush in place; use the heat to give a shine and volume to my bangs and then I do a cold shot for a minute to lock in the look, sometimes adding a little hair spray before I use the cold shot..</li>
            <li> I checked immediately for smoke, or any sign of anything being wrong, but there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Convinced my wife to buy this vs a $150 expensive one from the reviews.</li>
            <li> unfortunately it won&#x27;t be this one again.</li>
            <li> lengthy drying times often makes blow drying tedious.</li>
            <li> The attachment is the worst as it doesn&#x27;t stay on and falls off constantly chipping off the inside.  </li>
            <li> and I go through blow dryers like crazy.</li>
            <li> Plus another button for cold air.</li>
            <li> As it is, though, I have to hold my hair in ponytail groups to brush it afterwards to keep it from breaking like crazy.  </li>
            <li> Has 2 heat settings including the cold shot trigger,The seller shipped to me immediately</li>
            <li> Cold.</li>
            <li> but it always feels cold to me.)</li>
            <li> However, the design of the buttons drives me crazy.  </li>
            <li> well, XTAVA has proved me wrong!</li>
            <li> It has been so bad</li>
            <li> how badly they damaged my hair</li>
            <li> I was somewhat disappointed with it..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use  a lot of product in my hair but hate frizz-</li>
            <li> Holy crap</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I used to hate drying my hair</li>
            <li> I hate blow drying my hair.</li>
            <li> and I hated because that product was smelly</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, it was damaged, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Terrible.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, lasted 6 weeks than started sparking flames!&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased this over two months ago and it is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used!! I get disappointed whenever I use any other hair dryer because it&#x27;s simply not the same! Very strong power, dries hair fast and easily. Perfect temperature for me as well. Very happy with my purchase! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is the best blow dryer I ever purchased. I have very thick long hair. With this dryer it dried in no time</li>
            <li> Works fast for my wife&#x27;s thick long hair. She loves it and spends less time getting ready for the day which she loves even more.</li>
            <li> Having thick hair that is prone to frizz and takes forever to dry, I&#x27;m super picky about my hairdryer, and after using this one about a month I think it&#x27;s my favorite one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It dries my hair faster than any other dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned (can dry and style my thick, shoulder length layered hair in about 5-7 minutes flat, maybe 10 if I start with sopping wet hair) and leaves it feeling soft and smooth.  I also like that it&#x27;s pretty lightweight and has a long cord.  Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer after it was recommended by a friend.  I absolutely love it!  I have long hair and have never been able to dry my hair as quickly as I can with this hair dryer.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it and highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! This was previously a 5-star rating. I purchased this blow dryer in February of 2015 and have enjoyed it up until today. While using it on the medium setting, it caught on fire and started barfing out smoke from the barrel! It did not trip my breaker nor its safety feature and continued to try to run until I took the plug out of the wall and threw it into the sink! I haven&#x27;t been scared like this in quite some time!</li>
            <li> Terrible.  Hair dryer was delivered on Feb. 27, 2015 and it has already become unusable.  I now blows only cold air.  Hope Amazon will discontinue this piece of junk.  Would give it no stars if I could!!!</li>
            <li> Heavier than I expected.</li>
            <li> I never realized that a good blow dryer could make such a difference on the out come of my hair. Works great in curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great value!  pretty quiet but powerful, good control settings, and cheaper than I would expect for such a quality dryer.  My one complaint is that the concentrator nozzle keeps falling off of mine.</li>
            <li> very fast drying experience!</li>
            <li> This is so powerful, it really does dry my hair quickly. I have long thick wavy hair and this dryer just gets the job done, much faster than others I&#x27;ve used. I love the variety of heat settings + power combinations. The only thing I wish was different was that the Cool air button were a switch (you have to hold it down) and that the air was actually cool.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer the best that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Dryer does not work at all. Does not turn on!!  Pretty heavy as well. Being returned.</li>
            <li> It is good and I am satisfied</li>
            <li> Prior to using this Xtava Allure hair dryer, I was using a old hair dryer that worked well in its prime, but was loosing its finesse. So for the past 2 years or more I have not touched a hair dryer. Air drying is fine, but when you are in a hurry, or are looking to style your hair a special way, sometimes you need a hair dryer. I was happy when this arrived on more doorstep, and excited to try it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to the next day after arrival of the unit. I had wet hair, and decided to give this try. I plugged it into my outlet, turned on the power switch and nothing. So I tried 2 other outlets... still nothing. Finally it donned on me that perhaps I needed to push in the red button on the plug since it was kind of sticking out further than the yellow button (the reset and test buttons). I did that and it started working. So problem solved with that. I began drying my hair, and the next thing I know my smoke detector is going off. I turn off the unit, and I reset the smoke alarm. The smoke alarm in that area in the house is a few feet away from the bathroom door. I checked immediately for smoke, or any sign of anything being wrong, but there wasn&#x27;t. I have used tools that heat up in the past, and upon first use they can create a funky smell that smoke alarms pick up on. No biggie. I simply moved to a new area of the house, and the rest of the test went smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it both as is, and with the nozzle. I actually have never owned a hair dryer with a nozzle before, so this was quite nice. I could direct the air flow right to the area needed. I have baby fine hair, that is on the thicker side, and collar bone length. It took me about 5 minutes to dry my hair once I was situated in the new part of the house. My hair didn&#x27;t feel fried after use which is of course great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All functions on this unit worked great, however I did have to keep referring to the user guide to remember what buttons did what. I think that they could improve the function buttons to better label what each is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this hair dryer, and I am happy to have it. If I was to be technical with my star rating, it would get 4.5 stars from me, simply because of the problems I had upon first use. But after all that it seems to be doing fine, and I am pleased. This is a good dryer if you are looking for something with no frills, that will get the main job done of drying your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.function buttons to better label what each is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this hair dryer, and I am happy to have it.

            <li> My hairdryer is so old I think it has lost all its power so I stopped using it.  I saw a great promotion for this item and figured it was high time I got a new one!  As soon as it arrived this morning I jumped in the shower to wash my hair and used it and oh.em.geeeee it is great!  I have really curly hair (spiral curls in the back and looser curls up top) and the air director thingy (that is a technical term!) is so great!  I don&#x27;t like to use  a lot of product in my hair but hate frizz- this seemed to seal the deal without having to use so much product my hair felt crunchy.  Today I have soft, bouncy, frizz free curls!!!  Now I need a new camera so I can show them off!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:e5ff7a1f6cf2306e1ed10662c3a2720f]]My hair is so thick it used to take me almost 30 minutes to dry it even with the use of a hair dryer, until I used this professional ionic hair dryer! I love the precision the concentrator nozzle provides; allowing me to focus the heat exactly where I need it the most. This allows my hair to dry much faster since all the air is going directly where the hair is still wet. The nozzle is easy to attach just by pushing it on the hair dryer when it is powered OFF.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hair dryer has (2) speed settings and (3) heat settings, so if my niece wanted to use this she could *she has really thin hair so she doesn&#x27;t need a high setting, or much heat*...I love the cold shot button, I use a big round brush to give a little curl on my bangs..I hold the brush in place; use the heat to give a shine and volume to my bangs and then I do a cold shot for a minute to lock in the look, sometimes adding a little hair spray before I use the cold shot..it works perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the hook being attached to the hair dryer so I can hang it up when I am not using it..less clutter on my bathroom sink! This hair dryer is well made and absolutely my favorite one I have ever used. The cord is thick and sturdy which is great because it will not break as easily. I was provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> Fast drying hair dryer!  Light weight.  Wouldn&#x27;t describe as being quiet, but it is not loud either.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer. Professional results without the price!</li>
            <li> This is a powerful and very hot dryer if that&#x27;s what your looking for. But it&#x27;s heavy, really long with the concentrator on it, AND LOUD!!! Holy crap I&#x27;m going def</li>
            <li> In a word, wow!  I&#x27;ve been using the Allure for 2 weeks now, and I&#x27;m thrilled that I bought it.  Not only that, but because I&#x27;d purchased an Xtava curling iron several weeks earlier, I received a coupon for 20% on my next Xtava purchase.  You cannot beat this blow-dryer even at full price (which is still very reasonable).  There are as many temperature and and fan-speed settings as on any other dryer, and they all work quite well.  I work a very long week, so I&#x27;m delighted to have found a blow-dryer that cuts down on my drying time.  I recommend this one very highly.</li>
            <li> wonderful. light and strong!!! Hope it works well more than 5 years.</li>
            <li> I LOVED this dryer. Unfortunately, I have to use the past tense because it blew up. The heating element literally exploded - sparks flying out of the dryer and everything!!  This dryer was easy to hold, had amazing heat, and the cool shot was quick to cool and worked perfectly. It dried my thick, fine hair quickly and left it without frizz and with shine!  I would love to have replaced it, but that is not an option. I purchased this item in late Feb, and it blew up in early May - past the return point for Amazon, unfortunately. The item shows it&#x27;s no longer available (a quick check to Xtava&#x27;s site shows they are completely out of stock of EVERYTHING - strange, right?). So, I guess I now own a high powered air blower, as it still works but does not produce heat. :(</li>
            <li> I usually dread having to blow dry my hair as it is very long and pretty thick, so it would often take an hour or more to get it ALMOST all the way dry. Because of the time it takes to blow dry, and the fact I am semi lazy, I have had the same motel type dryer for about 15 years (YIKES) and been hesitant to buy a new one figuring they would ALL take forever to dry the mop on my head. When I was offered the Xtava, Allure 2200W hair dryer to review for an unbiased opinion I was pretty excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hairdryer is a decent size, yet very lightweight. It has 2 heat settings as well as the option for a cool blast here and there. There is also a detachable piece to put on it for when you want to dry your hair section by section to straighten it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this the first time, I now want to use it every time I wash my hair! It is super easy to handle, which is awesome if you&#x27;re all over the place flipping your hair around like I do. One of my favorite parts was that the back vent didn&#x27;t try to eat my hair! My old one would suck it in if you got it within an inch of that vent, I am tendered headed, IT HURT!  ALL of my hair was dry, no slightly damp spots at all within 20 minutes. I highly recommend this particular hair dryer for those with long thick like hair. Yes ladies and Gents, it IS possible to have lots of hair and not hog up the bathroom for hours on end!</li>
            <li> Amazing dryer! I have long and thick hair, but it dryers my hair faster than my previous dryer and my hair looks so much healthier. Totally recommended!!!</li>
            <li> You can tell right away this is a heavy duty hair dryer. I wanted something that had some power to it and couldn&#x27;t find it at my local Target.  This is a great product. I have been practicing blow outs and its prefect for this.  So as much as this is more pricey than a normal blow dryer it is worth it.</li>
            <li> Well First of all, everytime I turn it on Hi heat Hi air setting it blows the breaker in my bathroom.. my hair is coming out very frizzy. and takes long to dry .i don&#x27;t think Ionic is working on this unit. And today with it on Hi heat Med airflow..it burnt the ends of my bangs I was using round brush to dry it I have only had this dryer for 30 days.  I had an Elchim 2001 previous to this for 7 years, never ever blew breaker.. and my hair always came out great in less then 10 minutes. I am going to return this Xtava dryer.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a salon quality blow dryer! I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! Looks sharp, cut my hair drying time in half!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with this product.  My old blowdryer was awkward to work with and weak, and I would only blow dry my hair for special occasions.  Now I blow dry my hair every time it&#x27;s washed.  My blow-dry time has been cut in half with this blow dryer.  It&#x27;s much more powerful than similarly priced blow dryers.  It has a long, sturdy power cord, which makes the dryer easier to maneuver around to dry and style your hair.  It comes with a nozzle but not a diffuser, so if you use a diffuser you&#x27;ll need to purchase one separately.</li>
            <li> Love this item. The heat is perfect for my hair and did i mention tht delivery was great. Came right on time!!!</li>
            <li> Negatives: cool shot button is a flawed design (a tiny plastic lever you press into the handle housing) so it&#x27;s awkward and hard to use.  It&#x27;s heavier than I expected (compared to my old hairdyer) and it&#x27;s loud.  Positives: it&#x27;s powerful and my hair dries faster and smoother compared to my old hairdryer.</li>
            <li> Until this purchase I have only owned low-end (low-cost) hair dryers - I&#x27;m glad I took the chance on this one!  I don&#x27;t know how it works but my hair is much healthier now as opposed to when using other dryers.  I would get split ends very quickly after a haircut but I&#x27;ve gotten none since I started using this dryer.  I love the long cord - my mirror is a good three feet from the electrical outlet, the extra cord is much appreciated.  As for weight, it is not bad, but if you are looking for a &amp;#34;light weight&amp;#34; dryer for an elderly person this might be too heavy.  Sound-wise it&#x27;s quieter than others I&#x27;ve had in the past but not whisper quiet - it is a hair dryer after all.  My only criticism is in the design of the buttons not he neck - the buttons are very &#x27;soft&#x27; - easy to push and change the setting while in use.  I&#x27;ve adjusted my grip to hold it by the back of the neck but still hit those buttons periodically.  The manufacturers might want to update in the next model.  That being said, I would still recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter.  She loves it, except there is no diffuser but she has managed.</li>
            <li> It is better than expected!  Have had many brands of hair dryers and this is the very best.  Would purchase another, but will be surprised if it will need to be replaced in the new future.  Glad to have found this product....and the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer.  I have very thick hair and it dries it twice as fast as my old one.  It really has the blowing power.  The only reason I didnt give it five stars is that the buttons are in a position on the handle where my hand bumps them constantly and changes the setting.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is wonderful. very sturdy and strong. I have another hair dryer from xtava that I love, but I prefer this one. The diffuser that comes with it is a wonderful touch. The sleek design is not to be outdone! The 8 foot swivel cord is great, so you aren&#x27;t getting tangled up in your cord while blow drying. The three heat settings are perfect, and the cool shot of air makes blow drying fast, and easy. It blows just enough air, at the right temperature to cut my drying time in half!  Product received for review.</li>
            <li> The xtava Allure hairdryer is a wonderful product! As soon as it was delivered I could tell immediately it was much lighter than my conair. It has a very nice design, very sleek and light. All settings worked as they should, and it heats up instantly. I can now blow dry my hair in half the time it used to take me, which is a plus because I tend to run late! The plug has the GFCI end which is great for outlets that are not GFCI protected. Over all this is a wonderful product that I would recommend to anyone. Thank you to review loop for the product to test at no cost for review!</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and I go through blow dryers like crazy. This blow dryer dries my hair quickly. It&#x27;s not too heavy and is easy to hold. Love it!</li>
            <li> I recently became aware of Xtava products while looking for a new hairdryer. I wanted the ceramic ionic technology as I have baby fine hair which tends to break and attract static way too easily. This hair dryer has been amazing. It&#x27;s super quiet and has multiple heat levels which is great. I can usually dry my hair in about 4 to 5 minutes. I use the dryer with a flat brush, and have noticed my hair is smooth, shiny, and frizz free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have to say that Xtava has excellent customer service. When I originally purchased the dryer, Amazon fulfilled the order and shipped the wrong one. Xtava was super helpful in getting the issue resolved with Amazon. I now own two Xtava dryers and love them both. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchases, and the quality of the Xtava products. I highly recommend this dryer.</li>
            <li> The best hair dyer ever for the price.</li>
            <li> Heavy Duty awesome dryer. The cord alone lends itself to the words &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34;. Powerful, light weight, multi-heating options. The best dryer I&#x27;ve ever purchased in my 50+ years, that is when hand held dryers began. I have long hair and it&#x27;s cut my time in half. I can&#x27;t say more other than I hope it last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The dryer seems to be of good quality and would be easy to use if the nozzle were shorter.  I like the hairdryer itself very much but the nozzle is so long that I can&#x27;t style the back of my hair easily.  I have shorter arms but I have never had this problem with other hair dryers.  Do you have a shorter nozzle to fit this dryer?  I bought this dryer because my old one was wearing out and a piece of the nozzle came off - making it difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I have never used an Ionic Ceramic hair dryer so when I was given the chance to test this one for quality, I couldn&#x27;t pass it up.  I have long hair, not extremely thick but with the winter weather here in Indiana, the frizzies have set in.  It has been so bad, I have had to use argon oil on it just to tame it down to a manageable level.  I was so impressed with this hair dryer and here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  My hair dried in about half the time as with my previous hair dryer.  And that was only on the medium heat setting.  The high heat was too high for me as I have a sensitive scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The cord on the dryer is longer than other I have owned.  I was able to move around without pulling the cord from the wall.  It is lightweight and powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  The shape of the dryer has a longer barrel which allowed me to dry my hair from underneath.  Since it is so long, dryers with shorter barrels don&#x27;t allow me to do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  No frizzies!  My hair dried sleek and static free. The concentrator nozzle allowed me to dry one section of my hair at a time very quickly. I did not have to use argon oil on it after blow drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After trying this ionic, ceramic hair dryer, I will never go back to using a conventional one.</li>
            <li> Very good exactly what I was looking for....</li>
            <li> I love this dryer!  It is so much more powerful than the one that it replaced.  It doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to frizz and I have been able to drastically cut down on the amount of flat-ironing I do.  It is somewhat heavy, but this is to be expected with the extra power that it provides and I really don&#x27;t have a problem with the weight.  I love the heavy-duty, long cord it has too!  My only complaint is one that I have heard from other viewers - the control buttons are somewhat awkward.  I have had to get used to holding this dryer in a different way than I&#x27;ve always held all other hairdryers.  If I hold it in the usual way, it is extremely easy to accidentally push the buttons with your hand and inadvertently change the settings.  Other than this small issue, which I am already getting used to dealing with, I think this is probably the best dryer that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> Love it! I knew it was a professional version and it looks large, yet it is so perfectly balanced that it does not feel like more than one could handle. It is a high powered machine that works efficiently to dry the hair precisely with the attachable nozzle. I am in total admiration of the various settings and speeds with which I can customize the dryer. In at least half the time that it previously took my hair is not only dry but styled when I am through with this new tool. I was able to get it for a great discount from the original list price, and would only recommend and provide my unbiased experience. I could not be happier with this find though and feel I truly hit the jackpot!</li>
            <li> Many of the reviews for this product were left by people who received it for free for the review. I purchased this hair dryer after my old Conair bit the dust. I&#x27;ve used it once so far. It is certainly very powerful — I&#x27;d say the middle heat setting is equal to my old blow dryer and the high setting is HOT. Like don&#x27;t leave it in one place for too long, hot. While powerful, there are some less than ideal qualities. I read multiple reviews that said it was lightweight and quiet. It&#x27;s not that light and not that quiet. I think a good deal of the weight comes from the cord, which is thick and heavy. I also realized I&#x27;m going to miss the retracting cord of my old hair dryer. So based on power alone, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s good and the price was nice. The weight and noise are minor detractions.</li>
            <li> Very nice hair dryer. My favorite thing is that you push down the on/off button and heat controls, you don&#x27;t SLIDE it as with my last dryer. Important when you are drying hair  for several children and may have lotion on your hands etc....works well, looks good, nice controls. I am happy with it. I don&#x27;t think it works any differently than my last Ionic hair dryer, in terms of controlling frizz on my naturally curly hair, but it works equally well at a minimum.</li>
            <li> Very good quality product for good price</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer! So fast and light. Cut styling time in half</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy another hair dryer besides this one.  I love the power, speeds, cord...  The dryer flows so nicely.  I thought is might be to strong for my thin hair but its not.  I&#x27;ve waited for this dryer forever.  The only thing is that the dryer is a little too long for my short arms, but I can still use it.  It would be the very best if it was a folding dryer so it&#x27;s easier to store.</li>
            <li> I don’t always use a blow dryer but when I do I use an Xtava ceramic hair dryer! When I received this I thought to myself, “Hello beautiful!” It is really pretty, which means it would make a great gift for someone. I knew that I would be using this the first night I received it for a quick dry to prepare for a date. I was concerned that it would not dry my hair enough because blow dryers and my hair don’t get along too well. Being the incredible company that Xtava is, they thought of everything when creating the Allure 2200W. I dried my hair within 15 minutes and I didn’t look like a poodle afterwards! That is a first! I used the nozzle and a round brush and straightened my hair with the dryer! My thick, curly, frizzy hair was left looking shiny, soft, and brand new. It really does tame your frizz!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed and would highly recommend this hair dryer, as well as other Xtava items. I did receive this product complimentary, but my testing experience was that of my own. I was asked to give my full and honest opinion and I did.</li>
            <li> Love the dryer.  It dries the hair quickly and precisely.  I would recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and hot blow dryer. This one has been better than any I have used so far from a retail store. It gets hot quick and comes with its own attachments already. It has a beautiful, sleek design. My new favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> quit working after 2 months!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best blow dryers I&#x27;ve used in a long time! I was able to blow dry my hair while retaining shine and softness .</li>
            <li> Makes me hair smooth and dries my hair quickly. Love it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have gotten a better hair dryer. I&#x27;ve never had a professional grade one, and always wondered what the difference would be in my hair once I was finished. This hair dryer has given me amazing results! My hair was dried faster and more effectively with this dryer. I didn&#x27;t get as many tangles in my VERY long hair, as I would have with just any regular hair dryer. I liked the controls on this dryer, and that &amp;#34;cool air&amp;#34; button definitely comes in handy! It&#x27;s light weight, and super easy to handle. The hair dryer that this one replaced was just big and bulky. I especially like the nozzle that comes with this hair dryer, as my hair is beyond super frizzy. The nozzle was designed to eliminate or at least decrease the amount of frizz that you have, while giving your hair the volume and sass that you&#x27;re looking for. Amazing feature, and I no longer look like I have stuck my finger in a wall socket after drying my hair! I cannot believe I was given the opportunity to test this product out complimentary, and share my experiences. I&#x27;ll never use another hair dryer again! The features alone in this hair dryer, along with it&#x27;s sexy sleek look, will make your decision definite.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. I not only use it on my hair but I use it with my crafting! This dryer is AMAZING. Multiple heat options as well as blowing speed. Plus another button for cold air. Great dryer! Very powerful.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. My old hair dryer would take me 20 mins to dry my hair and now I can dry my hair in 5 mins.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  This is one of the best hair dryer i have ever own.  Highly recommended :-)</li>
            <li> Decided to buy this hairdryer based on all the positive reviews.  I am very pleased with my purchase. The reviews are accurate and the price is great too.</li>
            <li> This is clearly the best hair dryer I have ever had. It arrived on time in great condition. Price is great compared to crappy hair dryers. The shape on the dryer directs the air and heat to the spot it is needed in, other dryers blow air everywhere and can be hard to style with. The air power that is delivered from this dryer is beyond what I was expecting and is awesome I can dry my hair on low. Temp is perfect Hot is hot warm is warm and cold is cold. I only hope that this dryer last longer then any other I have had.</li>
            <li> is what i expect to be. its great, its fast.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer ever...you can feel the quality as soon as you pick it up...performance&#x3D;none better...worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this dryer! The buttons are easy to use, the concentrator nozzle keeps my hair smooth and it dries in half the time! I would buy this again!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer and is a lot lighter than the clunky old one I used to have. It looks great and helps my morning routine go a lot faster. I am able to dry my hair quickly and I love the attachment that it comes with to be able to focus all the hot air on one section of hair at a time as I am brushing it out. When I use the attachment it makes my hair look a lot better as well than without using it. This is a powerful hair dryer it isn&#x27;t the most powerful hair dryer I have ever seen but definitely a very good one. It is very powerful and dries my hair quickly which is awesome since I have really long hair. It is a nice sleek hair dryer so it fits nicely into my hair dryer holder and looks really nice as well. I received this as a gift to share my experiences while using this product.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer! This is by far the best hair dryer i have ever used. First i would like to say that alot of hair tools claim to be professional but aren&#x27;t really, but this hair dryer gives the look, feel and performance of a professional tool. It comes nicely packaged in a sturdy box and the dryer itself has a great looking sleek design. It has a thick long cord. It dries hair so much faster than what i have used in the past and i love that it offers different speeds and heat settings.I also really like the concentrator nozzle to use to focus on certain areas. Overall i am really impressed with this hair dryer and would definitely recommend it. I am so glad I was given the opportunity to try out this product at no charge and share my opinions about it.</li>
            <li> Convinced my wife to buy this vs a $150 expensive one from the reviews. She loves it. Also it runs very quiet compared to  her old one.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new hair dryer!! Cuts drying time tremendously and for the price I paid, I know I made the right choice. Thank you</li>
            <li> I know there have been a lot of positive reviews on this hairdryer but the one that I purchased just &amp;#34;blew up&amp;#34;.  Purchased in February of 2015 and can no longer use it in the end of May 2015 (three months).  My girlfriend and myself were using it daily for the three months but I would think it would last longer than that.  Trying to reach out to the manufacturer now to get replaced but this is a hassle that I don&#x27;t want to deal with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we get it replaced, I&#x27;ll change my rating</li>
            <li> Love!! I use to loathe drying my hair because it took forever!! This dryer cut the drying time down to less than half the time.</li>
            <li> This product had great reviews, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Turns out it&#x27;s the BEST blowdryer! It&#x27;s lightweight and dries in a very short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Works great and for a great price</li>
            <li> Love it,  this works awesome with my deva curl diffuser! I needed an updated dryer and this one is sleek looking,  plus I like the different heat setting. It did come with its own attachment, but Im loyal to my Devacurl diffuser;however, loving the combination of the two.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever had. It&#x27;s very light and manageable. I have thick wavy hair and when I&#x27;m done blow drying my hair, I don&#x27;t need to flat iron it. Absolutely amazing.</li>
            <li> Best blow dryer I have ever owned! Gets very hot, not horribly loud! Straightens thick, curly, frizzy hair quickly!</li>
            <li> the allure seemed to work very well.  but i rarely use a blow dryer and need to store it away when not in use.  the allure turned out to be much longer than i thought, and it would not fit in the drawer in my bathroom, so had to return.  also, it was quite a bit heavier than the description suggested.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Its nice to have all the control and heat options. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Just what I was looking for. I have medium length, thick, wavy hair. It smooths as it dries. Is light weight and quiet. And I love how hot it gets- lets me know its really working!</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer. It is exactly what I wanted. I have very thick hair and I needed a dryer with high heat and high volume of air. I have tried several different hair dryers and they have come up short.I read the reviews on this one and thought &amp;#34;why not&amp;#34;.It is exactly what I have been looking for.Works great. Arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> Highly satisfied with the hair dryer and the company. My hair is long and thick. It is every texture in the book. Some curly hair, some straight, some frizzy, some fine, a lot gray, all highlighted/colored. It normally takes me 20 - 30 minutes to get it completely dry. Then I need to use the flat iron to calm it all down. With this hair dryer I had it completely dry in 10 minutes. When I use it with the Goody Quikstyle brush my hair is smooth enough that I only have to touch up a couple places with the flat iron. I live in the Deep South. Heat and humidity are a way of life. I can&#x27;t tell you how happy I am with a hair dryer that cuts 10 - 20 minutes off the time I have to spend blowing more hot air my way.&lt;br /&gt;Also, I have received two very service minded emails from the company. It is because of these that I was prompted to write a review.  A quality product and a customer service driven company deserve a shout out.</li>
            <li> Best Blow Dryer EVER. Plenty of heat on different levels and the cool setting is truly cool air which really does set my hair style. The handle is very comfortable to hold and buttons are intuitive. The power levels are stronger than any other dryer I&#x27;ve purchased and the noise volumn is no different than other blow dryers.</li>
            <li> Light weight and powerful!</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer from Xtava after purchasing the Professional Infrared Flat Iron With Tourmaline Ceramic Plates - (Silk Edition Black). I loved the flat iron so much that I decided to look at the hair dryers from Xtava and this one has really good reviews. It&#x27;s light weight and comfortable to hold. My hair is kind of long, not quite to the middle of my back and I don&#x27;t blow dry every single time but if I have to get ready to go somewhere and don&#x27;t have time to let it air dry, or if it&#x27;s still wet when I get ready to go to bed I will finish drying it as it is really damaging to go to bed with wet hair.  One of the things I love the most is, I don&#x27;t have to turn this on the hottest setting. I keep it at the middle setting, which I would guess to be considered medium heat. It also has the cold shot feature I really like. I would purchase this product again and would also recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality, affordable hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I shopped around for a blow dryer and was about to buy one for well over 100 dollars when I came across this one... so I thought I would give it a chance.  I am happy to say that I love it.  The chord is nice and long, the buttons are easy to set and do not sit in an area where they are in the way.  The cold shot button must be held down but it shoots out a nice cold blast of air to help set your hair.  The hot setting is super hot but I am sure works well with thick hair.  I mostly use the medium heat without any damage.</li>
            <li> I usually have to flat iron my hair after drying to get the frizz out, but this dried my hair super fast and it was smooth!</li>
            <li> It really does what it says -- it effectively smoothes hair and significantly helps reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I only write reviews when I feel strongly about a product and this one is NOT a winner. I did not find this product heavy like other review state, the design and weight it nice with the exception of the cord. The cord itself is heavy and does not stay plugged in very well. There are two speed settings on this product. The low setting is too low and the high setting is TOO high. When it is on high, yes it dries my hair fast but it also tangles it into a rats nest and damages it very bad and the low setting would take hours to dry my hair. The heat settings are very similar in regards to the low is not hot enough and the high is almost too hot. I bought this product because it had the most and best review and I am very dissapointed in it. If you have long thich hair do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this hair dryer. I have extremely long and VERY thick hair. My old dryer was dying so I wanted to invest in a more powerful hair dryer - something at least 2000W. This baby was a great price and does a phenomenal job! For anyone out there with think hair you know how long it takes to blow dry your hair. This hair dryer has cut my time in half! It only takes about 4 minutes to completely dry my hair as opposed to 8-10 with my old hair dryer. As a bonus it has 3 settings each for temperature and speed, so you have lots of flexibility.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know much about ionic dryers because I previously had the same hair dryer for over 15 years. I like this one so far. It is sturdy, but I don&#x27;t consider it heavy. It has enough heat settings in my opinion and also includes a cool setting, similar to a hooded dryer, which I like, my last dryer did not have this.</li>
            <li> In a good, no, a great way! It is a *little* heavier than some models, but I&#x27;m only using it for a max of 15 minutes a day so that doesn&#x27;t bother me. And I only mention it here because many of the reviewers I read listed that as a con. As for how quiet it is, I would say it&#x27;s as quiet as the other &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; dryers I&#x27;ve owned made by other companies. It&#x27;s not a whisper, but it&#x27;s not a scream. My hair looks better than it has in a long time... It&#x27;s certainly shinier and looks thicker when I use this dryer. The dryer is also a very sexy looking piece, so if you&#x27;re going buy based on looks, go for this machine! The only negative I have is the cold shot button. I foresee this button breaking easily and in the near future. I try to avoid using the shot button in favor of the cold setting switch to prolong the inevitable, though.  I truly do love this dryer. I was not compensated for my review. I bought the dryer after researching. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Great power and gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li> Great dryer! Dries fast... The hottest setting is really hot so be careful not to burn yourself!</li>
            <li> Very fprceful and dries my hair in 5 minutes-just like the professionals do it.</li>
            <li> works great ! love it!</li>
            <li> This blowdryer works great, especially considering the price. You would expect to pay double this for a comparable  My favorite aspect is that you can adjust the air flow and the temperature separately. They also include an attachment, which I haven&#x27;t really used, but it&#x27;s pretty nice that it came with, especially on such a reasonably-priced hair dryer.</li>
            <li> It works well but doesn&#x27;t stay plugged into my outlet very well. It drops out at least once every time I blow dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I&#x27;ve owned. Quiet and quick!</li>
            <li> Silent, hot, and lightweight! So far so good. Very pleased at the price top!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer was heavy and too hot.  At the time of purchase this product there were plenty in stock. As soon as I got mine delivered. The product page shows this product is no longer available. Anyway, I returned it and got the Babyliss one. Much happier with the other purchase.</li>
            <li> No complaints. She loves it. &amp;#34;I used to hate drying my hair but now I actually enjoys it&amp;#34;. &amp;#60;-----Actual girlfriend quote&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Draws A LOT of power. Tripped the breaker in our old house. Not so anymore.</li>
            <li> It worked good until today. I have had it for 3 months and it won&#x27;t turn on anymore. A waste of money!</li>
            <li> Great Hairdryer, affordable price, delivery was quick, like the packaging and the extra hair drying tips you get by email. Wishing it had a little bit more power in the cool blast but no big deal. Im pleased that I bought this product to replace my old hairdryer which took 20mins to dry my hair, happy to say it has cut the timing of drying my long hair down to 8minutes and leaves my hair smooth enough not to use the GHD hair irons. Only major downside is that it is quite noisy.</li>
            <li> A fabulous hair dryer for a fabulous price.  It takes a little while to learn what settings to have it on for your particular hair type but once I got that-well, I have absolutely no complaints and would recommend it to anybody with short or long hair.</li>
            <li> I have been needing a hair dryer so I was very excited to test this product out. This is the first time I have tried a product from this brand and I was very impressed from the start. It comes packaged in a very nice box. When I plugged it in and started using it I understood why it was a professional quality hair dryer. I will be using it to style my hair every morning</li>
            <li> I love that this has 3 different heat settings. Cuts drying time in half without using too much heat. If i had to have one complaint, the dryer itself is a little heavy, other than that it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
            <li> I have to say, this dryer is amazing! I have long, thick  hair, and I use a hair dryer a few times a week with a round ceramic brush to straighten it. My hair is softer, the blow out lasts longer, and it dried faster then my old dryer. Must buy! If it works on my difficult to straighten hair, it will definitely work on anyones! The Allure features two speeds and three heat settings to offer control and professional styling versatility for all hair types. it allows you to pick the speed and heat you want without damaging your hair. Very powerful, sturdy, leaves hair soft, dries quickly, not too loud, and aesthetically pleasing. No breakage. Satisfied with the results. Attachments work well. i received a free sample in exchange of my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> CONS: I took a star away because this is very heavy in hand and awkwardly balanced (and that is without adding the removable tip). The PROS: It came impressively/beautifully packaged, it looks beautiful, feels well made, it has a lot of drying power, and is not too loud.</li>
            <li> This is a great dryer for the price. I haven&#x27;t noticed my strands being shiny or silky,  but the dryer dries quickly and isn&#x27;t very loud.  I appreciate the different heat and speed settings. The barrel is longer than most other dryers I&#x27;ve used but it isn&#x27;t hard to grip or control. It is boxed nicely and comes with a diffuser attachment. I would recommend this productIf you check out the pictures in other&#x27;s reviews you&#x27;ll see they have had luck with smooth, shiny hair. I have not gotten a chance to use it that much to see results and I&#x27;ve been using texturing product which also isn&#x27;t conducive to smooth or shiny hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible, lasted 6 weeks than started sparking flames!&lt;br /&gt;Would NOT recommend</li>
            <li> This blowdryer caused outages each time I used it so I had to stop and buy a new one!!</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer with loads of power.  It feels like a salon dryer.</li>
            <li> i love my new gadget it usually takes me about 20minutes to blow dry my hair and with this beauty it took me about 7 to 8 minutes ,,,,,love love it.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. It looks sleek and it gets my hair very sleek and straight. It has cut the drying time for my 4c long thick hair in half!</li>
            <li> love this hair dryer. It dries my short hair, thick hair in no time at all. I love the feel of it and the weight is just right. I am so very happy I chose  this hair dryer over the others I was looking at. My old blow dryer broke so on a whim i decided to search for a new one. There were so many to choose from, but i have a lot of curly unruley hair so i needed something that was powerful and cut my dry time in 1/2 and seal my cuticles. This product is perfect. It took me 15 minutes to dry my hair and it was soft shinny and no frizz. I would recommend this product to everyone. The nozzle is perfect it&#x27;s lightweight and quite. Love this and I am glad I was able to review it. . The air flow is strong but there is a low setting for the air power too. The heat level is hot enough to tackle my course hair and my drying time has decreased by a few minutes. My hair is coming out smoother than it did with my other dryer.  So happy with this blow dryer! Blow dries my hair in 1/2 the time.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I are fighting over this hairdryer! We both tired it out and love it.&lt;br /&gt;It is black, not a silver color as in the picture; very sleek in design. It is lightweight to handle with a thick black cord. I knew this was going to be a powerful dryer as soon as I took it out of the box.&lt;br /&gt;It is listed as 2200W and it does not disappoint. My daughter has thinner, straight hair. It took us minutes to dry her hair on a medium heat setting. The high heat setting is VERY HOT. We did not use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, coarse, curly hair. A few minutes on medium heat and a low air setting and I was good to go.&lt;br /&gt;We were given the opportunity to test and try this dryer. Based on our experience and our different hair styles, we both love this dryer and stand behind it based on its quality and construction.&lt;br /&gt;We love the design and the heat/ air flow settings. This is a powerful , well designed dryer that will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. It is so much more powerful than the one I have been using and gets my hair dry in half the time (the box says 80% of the time but I swear it seems faster than that). I can&#x27;t believe I have been wasting time drying my hair when there have been products on the market like THIS that will get it done so much faster. Until now I didn&#x27;t realize there was a difference but I swear there is. When I use this blow dryer my hair seems more voluminous than when I use my old one. This is also very lightweight and sleek, not to mention the fact that it is quiet. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quiet it was! If you are looking for a professional blow dryer I would highly recommend this one. This product was provided to me for testing and quality evaluation.</li>
            <li> This Allure 2200W hair dryer totally blew me away! It is a powerful 2200 watt hair dryer with a modern sleek design that is completely lightweight. It has a concentrator nozzle which makes it superb for achieving the absolute perfect desired look.&lt;br /&gt;I am a licensed cosmetologist and I can tell you from experience that this hair dryer is professional quality and is exactly what I would use in my home salon. In my world quality matters and this dryer definitely delivers with 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I love having the ability to customize the settings to fit my own unique style.&lt;br /&gt; Styling hair is an art and a Stylist is only as good as her tools. This dryer is a top of the line styling tool with tourmaline ionic ceramic technology, which means it saves me time and energy while I am styling and I get the desired look almost instantly.&lt;br /&gt;Say goodbye to frizz with the Allure because it&#x27;s designed to emit powerful negative ions to seal and smooth the hair&#x27;s outer layer while it increases my hair&#x27;s own natural shine while providing me with healthy and hydrated hair. The Allure Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer by XTAVA has totally exceeded my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer:  I received the Allure Hair Dryer during a promotion in exchange I would tell you what I thought about the Allure in this review. All statements made are solely my own and are based on my own personal experience while using this hair dryer. That being said, I would absolutely recommend this hair dryer to persons of all ages, it works better than great!</li>
            <li> This dryer is amazing I have 3c/4a hair and it dried and straightened my hair in mins wow! Love it!</li>
            <li> Edited post march 2016: after one year of use this product does not heat. It stays cool and does not warm up at all. Very frustrating and going back to a Remington hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feb, 2015 Shipping was so quick! This hair dryer is absolutely wonderful! It most definitely exceeded my expectations. I do think the cool shot button is a bit strange and I worry that it may not hold up, but we will see. Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Powerful and light weight..I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome dryer, I have been looking for something like this for quite sometime!</li>
            <li> A hair dryer is not something I generally replace until I need it.  Mine is still working,  but I had been saying for a while that I needed a new one.  I&#x27;ve always just looked at it as something that blows air and that they are all pretty much the same.  After using this one a few times,  I will never say that again.  This hair dryer is awesome.  I had already switched my curling irons to ionic ceramic and could tell a big difference,  but I didn&#x27;t realize that it would also make a difference in a hair dryer.  Not only does it dry my hair faster,  but it leaves it looking much more healthy.  I have very long hair and even though I take good care of it,  I had noticed that it was looking dull and dry.  The first time I used this dryer,  I could tell a difference.  I don&#x27;t know all the &amp;#34;how&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;why&amp;#34; reasons,  but I do know that my hair didn&#x27;t look or feel like all the moisture had been stripped from it.  I had even started to air dry my hair because I could see what was happening to it,  but that takes a long time with thick , long hair.  I will still air dry when I have the time,  but now I feel like I can dry my hair quickly (and this dryer does it VERY quick),  and not be damaging it.  I don&#x27;t use the high heat on this one because it&#x27;s very hot and my fine hair wouldn&#x27;t like that,  but I like knowing that the option is there if needed.  The air flow with this is massive.....really powerful... When on high,  I can dry my hair in a few minutes,  but that&#x27;s only when I&#x27;m just drying it to put in a ponytail.  Medium is more than enough airflow to dry and style it, and I love the cool setting.  When I used a round brush to curl,  I finished with the cool setting and it made all the difference.  It&#x27;s not a small dryer,  but it&#x27;s not at all heavy ,  especially considering the power that it contains.&lt;br /&gt;  They include a little card explaining that their products are made by women.  I find that reassuring, since most men that I know don&#x27;t really use one,  therefore,  how could they know what we need.  They also donate a portion of their profits to charities that benefit women.  Between that and the fact that you get such a high end, quality made product  for such a reasonable price,  I  am totally sold on this company.  You can tell that they care about their products.  I highly recommend it.  I can&#x27;t imagine anyone not loving it.&lt;br /&gt;I did receive this product free for the purpose of testing and reviewing with my honest opinion,  and I couldn&#x27;t be happier to tell you how wonderful this dryer is.efore,  how could they know what we need.

            <li> Needed a new dryer and have been shopping around for a while.  I&#x27;ve looked at this one online a few times but couldn&#x27;t justify the price.  Then it  went on sale and I jumped on it.  Just got it, first use.  It&#x27;s not silver, like the one pictured, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for color so I don&#x27;t care (mine is kind of a gunmetal black).  Beautifully packaged, easy to understand directions/ switches (and they should be- I&#x27;m drying my hair, not launching a rocket into space).  A bit heavier than my last dryer, but not uncomfortable.  I did notice a really mild chemical odor, but I was using the dryer on its highest setting and I&#x27;m guessing it had to do with the casing heating up.  The odor did go away and it was never overpowering and didn&#x27;t make me think the dryer was going to explode in my hand or anything.  The dryer did NOT dry my thick, mid-back length hair in 5 minutes (as was claimed by another reviewer, I think) but it did SIGNIFICANTLY decrease my drying time.  Took about 22 minutes down from 40-50 (and would still have damp spots), and that was with a little extra time fiddling around styling because.....MY HAIR LOOKS AWESOME.  Seriously.  I could be in a hair products commercial right now, I&#x27;m not kidding.  I feel like my gorgeous hair is going to waste just sitting inside writing an Amazon review, but this baby deserves it so I sat right down to do it.  I would have NEVER believed a dryer would make so much difference (otherwise I&#x27;d have bought this ages ago), but truly, I look like I just walked out of the salon.  I want to stockpile these so I never have to live without it.  This was a phenomenal deal on sale, but I would pay full price (and then some) knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> A good piece of kit. I chose it for my wife she loves it. So powerful that she rarely uses it on full power (2 wiggles)</li>
            <li> This is by far the best blow dryer I have ever owned.  I have longer thick hair and this dryer cuts my hair styling time in half. Light weight and easy to use. The only thing I would change is maybe the location of the switches. I find myself hitting the switches to easily when styling my hair.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the extension does not clip on. Whenever I put the dryer away, the piece falls off and I have to go fishing for it. Other than that, it is light weight and cuts dry time. The highest heat setting is HOT.</li>
            <li> Great hairdryer!  Extra long cord.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month or so now and it is great. The hot heat setting is perfect and I love that it is hot even at the lower blow levels. It&#x27;s also nice and light. I have fine hair in a chin length bob. I use this with a roller brush every day. Works perfectly.  Update!!!! I&#x27;ve had this for 3 months. It no longer works and actually heats up at a dangerous level. I&#x27;ve missed the return window. Very disappointed. Don&#x27;t waste your money. My hair lady actually mentioned my hair has severe heat damage and I don&#x27;t use any other tools on my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this! Dries hair quickly without burning my hair!</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this blow dryer. Even my mother-in-law said it is awesome. It is powerful and dries my hair fast. I plan to look at other products made by them as well.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hair dryer! Was searching for a new hair dryer as my hot tools dryer was giving off a burning smell and really drying out my hair. I decided on xtava because of the good reviews and so glad I purchased it.  The nozzle for the dryer stays firmly in place which is fantastic since when I tried to use one on my previous dryers, it would always fall off.  My hair comes out super smooth.  It is very powerful and not super noisy. Another great feature is the removable back to clean out lint! I was also really impressed with the welcome letter from the company I received via email after I received the dryers with tips on blow drying my hair. Would definitely recommend this dryer to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. So glad i got it. Also, i live what the company stands for.</li>
            <li> Oddly packaged. It came in a nice box, but inside it was tied up in a plastic bag (almost as if it had been returned). Turned it on and it worked fine and then I was putting it away and noticed a HUGE gash on the power cord. It was so big that you could see the inner cords poking through. NOT OK. This one&#x27;s a return.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my maine coon cat. He likes this dryer.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer than with my old conair hair dryer. I have alot of hair and love how my hair is dry faster with this hair dryer. Saves me time before heading to work.</li>
            <li> This was a great purchase. I have bought 2 more hairdryers in the past 3 years and this product is by far the best. The 2200W make a significant difference! I need less than half the time to dry my hair now and the result looks amazing. I no longer use the flat iron since I no longer need it!! :) I am very happy with this product and I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was delivered well within the promised window even though we were in the middle of one of the worst weather weeks this winter so far.  When I used the dryer I was even more pleased because my hair felt sooooo soft and was so shiny. Even my hubby thought my hair felt softer.  You ladies are doing great work and I thank Amazon for carrying your line of products.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair dryer. With long thick hair I&#x27;d gotten used to spending 15-20 minutes just drying my hair enough to allow me to style it. This dryer is not only lightweight and quieter than any dryer I&#x27;ve ever had but it also dries my hair in 5-6 min. That&#x27;s from dripping just out of the shower wet to nearly bone dry in less than half the time. I don&#x27;t even need to use the highest heat settings so my frizz is much more contained. With myself and two thick haired daughters using it a fast dryer is a must. So excited to finally have found something that actually is a good as it claims to be.</li>
            <li> One problem is not mentioned by other reviewers, so it may be unique to me.  I have a mirror plated electrical outlet in my bathroom and the hairdryer will not stay plugged in to it. I have measured the Allure 2200W&#x27;s safety plug&#x27;s prongs and they are the same length as standard electrical plug prongs. The mirrored outlet cover is totally flush with the electrical outlet&#x27;s face and doesn&#x27;t cause any problems with other appliances&#x27; plugs but the 2200W&#x27;s plug just pops right out.  The problem might be that the Allure&#x27;s safety plug is designed in such a way that makes it strangely incompatible with my specific outlet but in the interest of full disclosure I have to point out my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to a friend with no reservations. The other reviews cover perfectly all the pros and cons of this wonderful hairdryer.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!!!! Highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> By far, best blow dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned, and at a fraction of price I&#x27;ve paid in past for professional ones!</li>
            <li> She loves it. It performs better than expected. Congrats on selling a GREAT product and thanks for asking.</li>
            <li> Loved!!! My hair is dry in less than 5 minutes. The best.</li>
            <li> My wife tried several hair blower and all I hear now that she got the allure 2200w is OMG I LOVE THIS</li>
            <li> I like this dryer. Drys my hair quickly and the cord is long.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Definitely a salon-style dryer; so much faster on my thick hair than conventional dryers.</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer I have ever used. It isn&#x27;t all that quiet, and though it&#x27;s not really heavy, it is bigger than I&#x27;m used to and so still a bit unwieldy in my unpracticed hands, but it dries my thick, coarse, shoulder-length hair faster than any other device I have ever used. It also leaves my hair notably silkier and more manageable than other dryers. The Allure would seem to offer the benefits of an expensive professional tool at a surprisingly reasonable price. Hoping it holds up over time, and planning to purchase another to keep at my summer cottage.</li>
            <li> The best blow dryer I&#x27;ve owned yet.  Thanks for the quick shipment.</li>
            <li> I love this blow dryer. I have perfectly straight, non-frizzing hair so I usually can&#x27;t tell the difference between a $10 dryer and a $100 dryer but this one is extra gentle and I love it.</li>
            <li> Works well, but very heavy to hold with one hand.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter. Upon first use by my gf she said she needed one also. She claims it took less than half the time of her other dryer. The black Orchid diffuser I also bought for this is HUGE but does a great job</li>
            <li> Very good, not too heavy hair dryer.  Like the various speed and heat options.  Only complaint would be the burnt plastic smell that probably lasted for the first 3-4 weeks, was annoying enough I almost returned it.  Smell did finally go away and am glad I kept it. Have had no other issues with it.  Fits well in small hand.</li>
            <li> Amazing dryer!! It has cut my drying time down significantly. I have really curly hair &amp; this dryer works very well with my diffuser. I think it is a great value for the money and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have really thick hair so I needed a professional grade dryer. It drugs my hair very quickly.</li>
            <li> I have long and thick hair,usually take me over and hour to dry my hair but with this hairdryer it only take me 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> Great product as advertised</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is super nice classic black. I received it to review and all opinions expressed are my honest opinion. I already had a decent hair dryer, but was interested in getting a second non-travel sized dryer. I think this may replace my existing hairdryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;-It has the options I use: two speeds, three temperature ranges, cool air shot, etc.&lt;br /&gt;-This dryer has the power and is a little more compact and more attractive than my other name brand full sized hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;-I like the long cord. It is considerably longer than my other dryer. I like this since I move around a bit while drying and have accidentally unplugged my previous hair dryer. If you prefer a long cord, this may be a good option for you.&lt;br /&gt;- I find this hair dryer effective for drying and styling my hair. And it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it is very attractive and has a long cord.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I personally prefer the diffuser more than concentrator nozzle. It comes with just concentrator nozzle, so this is something I wish it had!</li>
            <li> This is the best.... Oh my god ~I&#x27;m so very very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I needed a dryer asap for work and this company was on point! I received it in less than 48hrs. It is a great looking dryer and the hot gets really hot, saves me time. The price was perfect as I tend to burn through dryers. It is a little heavier than I thought but I love it!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Works perfectly and is extremely powerful. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This blow dryer is hot and powerful.  Dries my hair super fast, like 2 minutes fast!  This is by far the nicest blow dryer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Got it quickly and it works great~</li>
            <li> Love it much lighter then my old hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Too many reviews with so many pictures attached, made me suspicious that these are not real reviews.I am not going to take the risk, a good product does not need to pay for reviews.</li>
            <li> The only dryer I have ever owned that made me excited to blow dry my hair! You will feel like you just left the salon when you use it. High quality, great price.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer was out of stock for more than 2 months. I even tried xtava.com to buy this hair dryer but to no avail. I contacted their customer service but they just asked me to wait so I waited and waited. I didn&#x27;t want to buy any other hair dryer. I just had to have this hair dryer because of its 2200W power and nice design. Consequently, I ended up having to endure the life of no hair dryer for nearly 3 months. But, after using this hair dryer today for the first time. I absolutely do not regret the long wait.</li>
            <li> great blowdryer !! i looked up for reviews before i purchased and i could not be happier! Drys really fast and its very hot!!!</li>
            <li> Was a great dryer. Loved it. However it burned out within 2 months.</li>
            <li> Until you use it you don&#x27;t really understand how this dryer is superior over others. Not as quiet as I expected but how can you expect a blower to be silent? Wish the low temperature was a big stronger as the second is just a tad too hot for puppy and that was the reason for my purchase. For my HAIR it works great.</li>
            <li> Works great, beefy cord, not as loud as my old dryer. It&#x27;s a little heavier than my old dryer, but I&#x27;ll deal with it if it doesn&#x27;t catch on fire while I&#x27;m using it like the old one did!</li>
            <li> Within less than four months, I noticed a fiery red glow within the barrel and had to stop using for fear of my hair catching on fire.  The company was nice enough to refund my money once I could finally get hold of someone (note there are no phone numbers provided with the dryer or on their website), however I do not recommend due to safety issues.</li>
            <li> Not at all quiet, I&#x27;m not sure why anyone would include that in a description of this dryer.</li>
            <li> This was for 3 months the Best investment yet for my hair. I have used a cheaper hair dryer forever, but this was worth every penny. However it broke and will not shoot out and warm it hot air. Most disappointing product yet in Amazon I have bought because it worked for awhile so well. I have to purchase a new hair dryer...unfortunately it won&#x27;t be this one again. As a woman who takes pride in her hair I need something more reliable and safe.</li>
            <li> I love this blower. Definitely recommend this. Same quality blow dryer they use in the salon for a much cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Malfunctioned!  Ordered this blowdryer in March 2015 for occasional use at home (I am a guy with short hair - so I barely use it daily).  It malfunctioned only THREE months later in June 2015.  I was drying my hair one morning and flames shot from the dryer at my head - I did not get burned (nor did my hair) but it was pretty surreal to see the dryer nearly on fire.  Unfortunately, they are no longer available - I have no way to contact the seller and so I am stuck buying another dryer. I have included a picture to show the extent of the glowing fire at the end of this dyer.  Buy this Allure hair dryer at your own risk!  If the seller reads this review - I would appreciate being contacted for replacement.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> Have always purchased Chi dryers but based on reviews and price I bought this.  The packinaging is beautiful which should be your first clue this is a first-class product.  Love the strong cord that does not twist up and the dryer performs in every area.  BTW I had no problem with the controls on the handle.  It is less bulky than the Chi, lightweight and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This dryer is so heavy it&#x27;s hard to style my hair. Too much air for my fine hair as well.</li>
            <li> This is a really wonderful blow dryer! It seriously cut the time it takes to dry my hair in half! It was really lightweight and has a very sleek design. It comes with a removeable nozzle that centralizes  the heat that I really like. I am happy to recieve xtava&#x27;s awesome blow dryer to review. I&#x27;m throwing the old one out for this!</li>
            <li> Ok, so this is my second Xtava Hair Dryer and I am thoroughly impressed with it.  It&#x27;s a powerful hairdryer.  I recently tried the Rimini 1500 and so I will be kinda doing a side by side comparison of the two hair dryers so that someone searching can have a side by side comparison done.    Lightweight:  Both dryers claim to be lightweight.  While, I can&#x27;t say what the exact weigh of the Allure dryer is, it does feel a TINSY bit heavier than the Rimini dryer. Not by much though.  They basically feel the same in your hands.  So, one doesn&#x27;t stick out as being better than the other in regards to comfort or ease of use.    Speed:  The Allure boasts 2200 Watts versus the Rimini 1500.  However, the width of the Rimini is much wider and casts a wider shot of heat than the Allure.  The Allure is slimmer and so it has a slimmer width of heat coming out...  It just depends really on what you prefer, if you would rather have a dryer that has a more concentrated shot of air or one that has a wider range...    Cords:  The cord on the Allure is much more sturdy than the Rimini cord.  IT seems to be a cord you would see on beauty salon&#x27;s equipment and seem that it is really strong and not likely to fray it also seems much longer than the Rimini Cord.    Cool Shot: Both feature the Cool Shot, however the button on the Rimini sticks out and seems to be an easier press than the Allure button, which is just a button that presses in...    Heat Settings: Both have the 3 heat settings and two speeds.  SO, they are virually the same in that feature.    Extras:  The Rimini comes with a hair diffuser as well.  The Allure does not.  The picture on the listing shows a slim diffuser attached and I did not receive this diffuser, so if you are looking to purchase because of the attachment, be sure to know it&#x27;s not included!!    Both are definitely great dryers.  I am pleased with them both.  However, there are slight differences between the two and so I just wanted to highlight the differences.The Allure is a great hair dryer and if you need a stronger cord, one that isn&#x27;t going to tear easily, that&#x27;s a definite bonus point for this dryer.  It&#x27;s like industrial strength!!    Overall I&#x27;m really impressed with the quality of both hair dryers.  I&#x27;ve had the Rimini now for two weeks and we&#x27;ve been using it daily.  Now I&#x27;m happy that my kids can have their own dryer and one can be ALL FOR ME!!!    *** EDIT: I mentioned that this didn&#x27;t come with the attachments, however it has come to my knowledge that it DOES however my hairdryer did not include the attachments and after communicating this I wasn&#x27;t offered the attachment. ***    ** Review Sample Received</li>
            <li> I have never used a hair dryer that could dry my long hair in under 30 minutes until I tried this one !(: this works amazingly and I love the way this hair dryer looks , so sleek looking . I would recommend this item to anyone who is looking For an affordable, well working hair dryer !!</li>
            <li> LOVE it!!! It&#x27;s been several years since I&#x27;ve purchased a blow dryer, and quite honestly thought they were all basically the same. well, XTAVA has proved me wrong! The Allure 2200W Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer is awesome. It does work much quicker, as the listing claims. My daughter and I have long hair (mine is to my waist and her&#x27;s is to her bottom) and anything to dry our hair more quickly, is great! It&#x27;s freezing cold here, so leaving hair wet is an uncomfortable option even when indoors...but lengthy drying times often makes blow drying tedious. The Allure hair dryer makes this task so much easier. Add the smaller nozzle for more direct heat, which is nice for styling purposes. XTAVA also makes a collapsible diffuser, which is excellent to use with this as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I chose to review the Allure 2200W by XTAVA, it&#x27;s an excellent product!</li>
            <li> Surprising power from such a stylish hair dryer!  I really am in love with this dryer.  It is very sleek and attractive.  I like that the cord is a long round cord rather than the normal cords that twist over time.  The length is nice, too, you are free to move around the bathroom more than with a typical dryer.  There is a surge protector built into the plug unit and you can reset it if the fuse blows which is a nice feature.  I like that there is a hook so that I can hang it from a hook inside my cabinet for storage.  When I used it I started with the lowest setting and felt like that was more productive than my normal hair dryer, when I put it on high it really gave my hair some body.  The air intake area is a metal mesh to keep debris from going inside, easy to clean.  The &amp;#34;cold blast&amp;#34; button is a neat little feature. It is lightweight too, easy on the arms.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend as a birthday gift.  She seems to like it and it definitely does a good quick job.  She hasn&#x27;t had issues and she likes the weight to power ratio.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this Allure professional hairdryer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon arrival it was packaged in a nice black matte box, with stylish decoration and writing. Hair dryer was wrapped in a plastic covering, and has a black shiny finish and matte finish.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is super quiet and performs very well. Very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;There are 3 heat settings, and  2 fan settings, as well as a cool burst button.&lt;br /&gt;The cord is very long and heavy duty, which makes it nice to not be limited in cord length.&lt;br /&gt;It has an angled end for air that fits over the end of the blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blow dryer works very fast. My daughter&#x27;s hair usually takes about 8-10 mins to dry and that dry time has been cut in half! She is very impressed with this hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I love the tourmaline Ionic Ceramic blow dryer, it is very gentle on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very glad I was chosen to test and review this hairdryer from Xtava.</li>
            <li> This is a very powerful appliance - so powerful, in fact, that my long hair gets blown around like crazy, which leaves it tangled as hell when I&#x27;m done.  I am the flip-your-head-over-for-more-body type of styler, and I don&#x27;t usually brush-and-blow, so this machine on the highest setting is overkill.  However, if I had shorter hair or I did run a brush through my hair as I guided the blowdrier, it wouldn&#x27;t cause so much havoc.  As it is, though, I have to hold my hair in ponytail groups to brush it afterwards to keep it from breaking like crazy.  Use with caution.</li>
            <li> I Love this hair dryer!!!  It&#x27;s by far the most powerful dryer I&#x27;ve had! It dries my hair in 1/2 the time and my hair has volume!!  What&#x27;s really nice about this is all it&#x27;s power, and it&#x27;s light as it says! Doesn&#x27;t feel bulky or heavy as other blow dryer&#x27;s I&#x27;ve had.  It&#x27;s beautifully designed - slick and stylish, and very sleek!! What&#x27;s even more Amazing, is its design and ease of use and storage. The cord is long and allows for lots of movement.  Finally, I like that it has concentrator nozzle that focuses the air on specific areas (the nozzle comes off for storage as well). It also has different speeds and heat settings. I have to use on lowest heat setting because the heat is so hot! It also has a cool setting which is nice. This blow drier is awesome!  **I received the product to test and review and this review is 100% my own opinion!!</li>
            <li> This is the best hair dryer I have used in a long time. It&#x27;s lightweight, easy to handle, and not bulky at all. It also is high-powered and dries my hair is less time than the dryer I was previously using. As someone with thick hair that is used to spending tons of time just drying my hair, this is a huge plus. The black color of the dryer is also sleek, and I like that it comes with the concentrator attachment. Product provided to facilitate this review, but all opinions are honest and my own.</li>
            <li> I love this Allure professional Ionic ceramic hair dryer by Xtava!!! When I received this hair dryer in the mail I was so excited to test it out as my old hair dryer just crapped out the other day and I&#x27;ve been without a hair dryer. I&#x27;m in love with the design &amp; quality of this hair dryer I love the sleek black design!!! This hair dryer is also made of high quality materials which is a plus for me as It needs to be able to last a long time. Its pretty light it weight compared to my old dryer with I love so it won&#x27;t made my wrist tired since I have long hair that normally takes a long time to dry I need to be able to have a dryer that light enough to hold for a long time. This dryer includes a Concentrator Nozzle with I love and works amazingly!! This attachment is said to direct maximized condensed air flow to the area you are targeting, adding precision and focus while controlling frizz and style outcome which it definitely does!! It also seems to dry my hair a lot faster then my old dry with saves me time!!  It also has a 2 speed settings and 3 heat setting which  work wonders and are a great feature to have!!  I am really impressed with this dryer &amp; I definitely would recommend this Hair Dryer by Xtava &amp; brand to everyone !! I was so excited to receive this hair dryer from the company to test and share my opinion!!</li>
            <li> absolutely in love with my new XTAVA professional ionic ceramic hair dryer! i really got the results i was looking for. as i am reviewing for free, after washing and conditioning i towel dried my hair and combed out. i then proceeded to use my round brush to blow out my hair and it worked out very nicely! i really like just how well built it is, looks and feels very durable and high quality. i also love the settings as well, hot high heat down to low cool air, it&#x27;s perfect! i highly recommend for anyone who is looking to achieve ultra stylish do&#x27;s to those just looking to dry their hair in the morning. this XTAVA hair dryer will not disappoint! i am so happy to have had this opportunity to present my review to you out there,</li>
            <li> Love love love this dryer!!!! Worth every penny. Never again will I be buying $15 dryers.</li>
            <li> Firs of all holy lightweight batman! This is the lightest blow dryer I have ever had and I absolutely love it! My arm is not tired after blow drying my hair anymore. Which with the magic of the blow dryer helps me to get my hair dry in 10 minutes, not 20-30minutes like my old blow dryer (WIN WIN)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most hair dryers this one has three (3) heat settings and two (2) speed settings, including the cold shot button. It also comes with a concentration nozzle which is my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that I really love about this hair dryer is the hanging loop. I love to have things organized and I am obsessed with hanging stuff on cabinet doors to avoid clutter in main compartments. So that was a plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle is comfortable for my hand and the position of the buttons is of easy reach for my tiny hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, the Tourmaline Ionic Ceramic Technology apparently works because I noticed much much less static and frizz than before when I used my old blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great product and I would recommend it to every single one person in this planet! Love it!</li>
            <li> The hair dryer works fine and arrived as described. The temperature gets very hot which I guess can be a good thing just be careful if you have fine hair like me. With that said, the medium heat setting is fine for me and the air flow is strong. I am using it a few times before deciding if I&#x27;m going to keep it just based on temperature.</li>
            <li> Works really well! Only thing is control switches are where your fingers go so fingers push switches and changes settings while blow drying.</li>
            <li> I just used this for the first time and I am obsessed with it. I would recommend this to everyone. For the price it&#x27;s worth it as well.</li>
            <li> Just received my new blow dryer in the mail.  When I opened it, it was damaged, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer!  The power it delivers is perfect and it seems to dry my hair in half the time of my old one. The speed and heat buttons are &#x27;user friendly&#x27; and the heavy cord is nice and long. Altho it&#x27;s not quite as light as I&#x27;d imagined and maybe even a little bigger than my old one, I wouldn&#x27;t consider it to be heavy or bulky and it&#x27;s still quiet and powerful.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> After using this dryer for about a month I am very pleased with its performance thus far. The dryer is not heavy and has substantial amount of heat. Although there are others out there that have the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; air and cost true the price this is a budget friendly dryer that has done the job.</li>
            <li> Best bloodshed I&#x27;ve ever owned!  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have long thick hair and it usually takes a long time to blow dry. Not with this dryer! It is the best one I ever had. I could not believe the price was so good. Love It!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this hair dryer and can&#x27;t believe the price for such a great quality dryer.  Highly recommend.  Way better than anything at Walmart or Target.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is a definite upgrade from my old Conair one.  It is fast, and seems to leave my hair nice and shiny. My hair still seems a bit frizzy on top, but that could just be my hair or that fact that I live in a very humid climate.  The volume is pretty good.  I don&#x27;t know if I would necessarily call it &amp;#34;quiet&amp;#34; though. The weight is also decent, but I would not say it is extremely light or anything. I read on at least one of the other reviews that the power cord was just a regualr plug, but mine was one of those safety kinds.  Overall, it is a great hairdryer for the price!</li>
            <li> Chose this particular hair dryer after comparing the features with other similar products. I am so glad that I went with this one because it is the best hair dryer I have ever had!! Ever!! I am not even talking about the fact that drying my hair time is cut in half, but what is really amazing that my hair looks so much better. It suddenly has some shine, including the ends that use to look very frizzy. And that is not all. I use round brush  while drying my hair and now that is enough to lift the roots of my hair!. I use to use a product that suppose to help lift the roots and I hated because that product was smelly and It really wasn&#x27;t doing much , but now this amazing hair dryer makes my hair look healthy and even fuller because of the lift.&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE IT!.</li>
            <li> Went off- brand based on the reviews and to save money. BL - U get what you pay for. It has great air flow &amp; power. However, the &#x27;warm&#x27; is too hot for my liking and the hot, way too hot. Kept turning off or changing the settings due to the button location on the handle -  Frustrating. Cord too heavy and keeps pulling out of the outlet. Cheap plastic housing.</li>
            <li> I have been needing a really good hairdryer because in a family of five it is hard to keep one in one room of the house.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved the Allure 2200W xtava hairdryer and I love it!!! It comes with one attachment that makes it easy to run a brush through your hair while blow drying it at the same time to the shape you want it in. It blow drys your hair fast and where it doesn&#x27;t frizz. I love it!! I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and I&#x27;m so glad I have it :)&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this at little to no cost to me to provide my honest and unbiased opinion and that is exactly what I have done.</li>
            <li> Ok, I received the blow dryer yesterday, I&#x27;m already in LOVE!!!! Best blow dryer I have ever owed. My hair dried in no time at all (and I have very long hair), and it has tons of shine to it. I went on the website to register my product and will be trying their flat irons and other items they sell, however, getting amazon is so much of a better deal!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.... Paula Squadrito</li>
            <li> I could not find the diffuser inside the box!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a total of 2 since my daughter and I loved the 1st one so much.  Definitely a no regret pamper item.</li>
            <li> Love this dryer! Heavy duty chord. I actually live in Florida and humidity is awful. I was able to dry my hair without any frizz. YES! And it was super fast.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair dryer - it seems to be designed well. It&#x27;s definitely pretty - doesn&#x27;t take up too much space. It has all the features that I need, like multiple heat settings, multiple air flow settings and even a cool blast to set the style. It fits standard hair dryer attachments too -  like a diffuser. It also comes with the attachment that focuses the air blast - I think it&#x27;s called the nozzle, but it&#x27;s key to minimizing damage on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last hair dryer (from a different brand) was closer to $65 and although it worked great, it started to breakdown within a couple of months. It finally cracked it half in my checked bag during a recent flight. The price was right for this dryer - and I love the customer-centric focus of the company, xtava.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the follow up communication I received after buying this - tips for how to use it well, contact info if I have any problems. So, I&#x27;m happy with the dryer, but communication from xtava has been really great - the next time I&#x27;m in the market to buy something like this, I&#x27;ll check xtava first.</li>
            <li> Great blow dryer. I have purchased several over the years and spent lots of money on them. This is a great blow dryer and not very noisy at all. Works great to dry my thick hair in a short time. Great deal for the price. Well worth buying. You can spend more if you like, but this will do the trick.</li>
            <li> Smooth finish. Fast drying. Seems to best blow dryer that i&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> I purchased this along with the xtava diffuser accessory (I only dry my hair with the diffuser as I have long, curly, thick hair). The dryer is fabulous, and I really love the diffuser&#x27;s unique design. I get my hair dried in half the time with this dryer, and am completely happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent noise levels--very low. Heat control very good as well. Great hairdryer so far, particularly vs. previous Conair models.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this dryer!</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer! Very fast drying and my hair is much smoother than with my last one (which was not Xtava).</li>
            <li> Light, hot, quiet. I love this hair dryer. I purchased it with the diffuser. Had a little trouble attaching the diffuser to the hair dryer, just turn on the dryer and it attaches with the heat. When round brushing my hair is slick and freeze free. Highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Absolutely THE best hair blower I have ever used! Purchased it for myself, but, used it to dry my daughter&#x27;s very thick, long hair ~ dried in half the time of other blowers used in the past.  I recommend this product for all hair types.  Shipment came early, and product was brand new. Would purchase from this vendor again,</li>
            <li> Love it!!!! I&#x27;ve had it for couple of months now. Definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got 3 of these hair dryers and they&#x27;re priced so cheap with so much POWER. My wife complains that it&#x27;s a little heavy but it makes blow drying long wet hair so much faster. My pompadour would not be as high if it weren&#x27;t for this hair dryer.</li>
            <li> The reviews don&#x27;t lie. I love reading reviews on here before buying anything. Less frizz, faster drying time and you can feel the power!</li>
            <li> Powerful dryer with various heat settings. Dries your hair in about 7 minutes. I like the powerful air distribution and the feel of the dryer in your hand. It&#x27;s sleek.</li>
            <li> Quiet for something with so much power. Lightweight. Long thick cord feels like it will last many years of abuse (repeated wrappings around dryer). My hair dries very quickly and comes out smooth (little to zero frizz!!!). Best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a very long time!</li>
            <li> i love this dryer, love the cool blowing option</li>
            <li> Blew out coils after 2 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> super cool , I love it</li>
            <li> Best hair dryer I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> A very powerful dryer. Amazing price for the purchase. One thing I would seriously advise, make sure that the bathroom plug can handle the wattage. This item requires a separate and dedicated 20AMP receptacle. 2200 watts divided by 120 volts &#x3D; 18+ AMPs</li>
            <li> The cord is very sturdy and the temperature/power settings are the perfect amount. The air flow is very focused and dries my hair in 5 minutes (on medium temperature + low power setting). The only downside is that the dryer is a little heavy. However the design is chic, just like the picture.</li>
            <li> Fantastic hair dryer!</li>
            <li> I bought this hair dryer to replace one that my daughter burned up while drying her long, thick hair.  This dryer is not much heavier than the one it replaced.  It dries your hair super fast which is great since I also have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Very quiet. Bought this to replace my girlfriend&#x27;s stupid loud blow dryer that woke me up every morning. This thing is much easier on the ears.</li>
            <li> super fast hair drying time without the frizz!  So much better than the dept store options for the same price or even more...very happy</li>
            <li> I wish the hot air would come out a bit faster but overall great hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I use this dryer several times daily and I like it a lot. It is quiet, it has a permanent cool setting as well as a cool shot, and the settings buttons are in a place that works for me, a left-hander. There is plenty of power and it is very lightweight. The only thing I would change is the fact that the screen on the intake is not removable.</li>
            <li> The Allure 2200W Professional Ionic Ceramic Hair Dryer is wonderful.  I was so impressed with the sleek look of the hair dryer.  It comes in a very nice box which would be great if I was giving it as a gift.  When I was given the chance to try this hair dryer in order to given my honest opinion I jumped at the chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter has very thick and long hair.  It usually takes about 20 minutes to dry her hair completely  dry.  Most of the time she never dries it totally dry because she gets tired of holding the hair dryer. The dryer is very light weight and easy to hold.  They taper of the nozzle makes the air come out in a more concise way instead of coming out in large amounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dryer has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings.  My daughter uses the high heat for her long thick hair.  She states that it has cut her hair drying time down about 10 minutes.  Which in the world of a teenager that is a long time.  She now dries her hair completely dry instead of letting it go damp.  In moms world that is something I really like.  I never really liked her going out in the cold with damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to store, it even has a hook on the bottom for hanging.  One more thing I like about it is the safety feature.  It has the safety switch on the plug if it gets to hot it shuts itself off.  There is really nothing I do not like about this hair dryer.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a nice easy to hold powerful hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I hate blow drying my hair. Its long and thick and my arms are hurting because it takes so long to get everything dry. I can&#x27;t ever get a style to hold. I tried a blow out once. Once. So when I was given the opportunity to review this product for free I thought &amp;#34;what do I have to lose?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats when I realized ive always just had a crappy blowdryer. The cord is super long and thick so it doesn&#x27;t get very tangled during use and I have freedom of movement. The power is really amazing. It only took about 10 minutes give or take. I appreciate the warm setting because heat dries my scalp out. The blast of cool air made my hair shiny. The nozzle was great for taming frizz. This dryer has made blow drying my hair less of a chore. I can&#x27;t wait to try my next blow out!</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer for review and testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer is heavy but it packs a lot of heat and did not make my hair frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair and I washed it, put a repair cream on ,then toweled dried it and put the dryer on low speed and it was drying my hair fairly quickly. I used a vented paddle brush to blow dry and then I put it on the second higher heat setting until I finished the process. After that I pressed the cool shot button and it came out cold. I felt like I was a holding a salon quality dryer at home. I give this product 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Actually, the first use for this hairdryer was to replace the broken glass on a Galaxy S4. Well, it worked! Drys hair nicely as well, though my hair isn&#x27;t particularly picky so it might not actually mean anything to you. It is also surprisingly light for a hair dryer. Using a IR thermometer it reaches temperatures of 165 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li> VERY powerful, and with 3 heat settings, and two speed settings, this has everything the pro&#x27;s want .... A very well made product that is built to last ... I give it the highest rating.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice hair dryer, the only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that its a little heavy for me.  It dries nicely and very quiet compared to any other dryers I have had.  I will definitely keep it, I can use the workout.</li>
            <li> wooooooooooow !!!!!  This baby dries hair in a blink of an eye.  I am a cosmetologist and Blowouts / Blowdries are my salons main ingredient this thing save me 10-15 minutes, (in a salon, this means more clients and more money).  I told a colleague of mine and now we are ordering more.  Hopefully this product can be as good as the first day for a while.    Ps, I just placed a second order for 2 more.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair dryer.  I was on a business trip and the hair dryer in my hotel was very powerful and did a great job on my hair.  I could not buy that one, but i started searching for professional hair dryers.  My hair dresser told me to look for a hair dryer over 1,800 kw and the ionic element.  This one came up.  Read the reviews and they were very good.  This hair dryer is awesome and very reasonably priced.  Very quiet and extremely light weight.  It does a great job on your hair and dries it in no time.  The style is very sleak.  I am at the end of my keratin treatment and had to fight with my old dryer, but this one makes my hair look like i just got a keratin treatment.  Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I received this hair dryer as a sample for review and evaluation and I have found it to be working well. It comes in a nice box that is very suitable for gifting.  The pros on this dryer for me are that it is lightweight, has a long cord, is sleek and not bulky, and comes with a concentration too. The con for me (someone that has long, thin, fine hair) is that it tends to be hot even on the lower settings. Sometimes this is a pro but overall for my hair type it is a bit too hot for the total drying process so my hair tends to be more tangled at the end. All things considered I still think it&#x27;s a great dryer and I realize not everyone has my hair type.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is awesome and powerful, and the highest temp setting is HOT (so be careful!) but so far so good - have had it about a week or so. Worth the money.</li>
            <li> It is a little heavier than I felt the description indicated, but otherwise it is fine.  Delivery was a day early!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent! I am so glad I bought this. Great quality and dried my whole head of hair in minutes which is wonderful after I allow myself a few more minutes of sleep in the morning. A really good and worthwhile purchase! Just want to say I am still thrilled with this purchase of about 6 months ago! It dries my hair incredibly fast but also gives it body that lasts for a couple of days. I could not be happier with this product. I&#x27;ve been around for a &amp;#34;while&amp;#34; and no other hair dry has ever come close. Jump out of the shower, blow dry my hair for a very short time, and I&#x27;m on my way! Love it!!!</li>
            <li> So I tested my new Allure 2200w hair dryer and so far I really like it. It dries my long hair in no time and and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair frizzy. It is lightweigth and it looks nice. The chrome looking lint trap at the back can be twisted easily and pulled out for cleaning. It looks nice but be very careful because (correct me if I am wrong)  it is made out of a plastic material that seems like it will easily break. I am going to use and keep this hair dryer in the bedroom vanity just incase I drop it, it will fall on the carpet floor. The extra attachment that came with it is also nice. I also have a 1875w Conair infinity that I have been using for years. I love it but I compared the two today and they seem to blow about the same amount of air. If Allure is blowing harder, I cannot really tell. The small button to press cool air is a bit hard to press but truth is, I never use the cool air function anyway so it dont really matter for me. Over all, I will start using this Allure from now on and will give him hubby the Conair one. The other minor things does not hindrance the funtionality of this hair dryer so if you are planning to buy this, go ahead, give it a try. I think you will like it too.</li>
            <li> I like the xtava hair dryer. It work good and I don&#x27;t have any problem with it.  This hair dryer has two speeds and 3 heat settings that is good so you can control how much heat you need. This dryer comes with attachment to help dry your hear directly on the spot that you need and not making the rest of your hair frizzy. For my straight thick hear the dryer works very good and I was sent this for review, however it does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this blow dryer. This hair dryer is super powerful, lightweight and sleek. I love the gun metal color. The instructions are very simple to follow. If you want your own salon style blow out look no further girl get yourself a round brush you can handle this. The handle size is perfect for my small hands, and the weight makes sure that I don&#x27;t get hand fatigue constantly styling my volume in. Has 2 heat settings including the cold shot trigger,The seller shipped to me immediately and it arrived lightening fast. so thankful to have this Allue 2200w Ionic Ceramic Hair dryer my hair will never be flat again.</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is just what I was looking for. I have naturally thick and curly hair and it dries it perfectly. The dryer itself isn&#x27;t heavy and sounds quieter than a normal hair dryer. I do like that the cord is long and allows you to move around and not be right by your outlet. Overall I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase and will be buying products from Xtava in the future.</li>
            <li> This is my second Xtava hair dryer.  I have to say this one makes even that one look wimpy.  I cannot believe how fast it dried my hair.  Right out of the shower and it was only about 4 minutes for my thick hair to be completely dry and cooled.  This hair dryer is a little hefty compared to others but I think it is easier to handle than my other Xtava.  Also even though the hottest setting is quite hot the hair dryer itself only heats up at the end.  You can hold the barrel if you need to maneuver it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power was unexpected.  My hair did tangle slightly but it was no big deal considering how much more volume I gained.  Even after brushing my hair it isn&#x27;t flat.  My hair is smoother than usual as if I had flat ironed it.  The hot is hot and the cold is cold as if you had air conditioning for your head.  So, you don&#x27;t have to spend extra time cooling after drying.  It was a matter of seconds after drying to having perfect cool hair.  The extra power of this dryer may have a learning curve.  I actually had to figure out where I had wet hair because I&#x27;m used to having still damp hair.  Anywhere I pointed it for a few seconds resulted in dry sections of hair.  That&#x27;s how good this dryer is.</li>
            <li> Love this hairdryer, it&#x27;s quiet and dries my hair quickly!</li>
            <li> I am thoroughly in awe of this hair dryer. Let me start by saying that I have used a LOT of different hair dryers throughout the last few years, but due to how badly they damaged my hair I only owned an old one which I only used to dry off my cats after a bath. I have borrowed many friends’ hair dryers during different conferences, get-togethers, and road trips. The problem I have always had with hair dryers is that the heat settings are too hot, lack of air flow, inconsistent heat, and weight. When given the chance to test this product during a promotion, I really was not sold on the idea at first. I have to say though, this hair dryer absolutely blows the others away! (Pun intended)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has three heat settings – hot, medium, and cool. I have a really sensitive scalp so the hot setting is WAY too hot for me, but the medium is just right. The cool setting is just right for keeping my hair from becoming super static and having major flyaway issues. I have very thick but fine hair so there is a LOT of it, but each individual strand is very small in size. I usually let my hair dry naturally which takes more than 8 hours. With this dryer, I can dry my hair in 10 minutes flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the amount of airflow this dryer has! It has two airflow settings - high and medium. It is like standing outside in a windstorm – except it can be directed very easily with the add-on that comes with the dryer. The heat does not change, it is very consistent throughout the whole use – it heats up very quickly. After and during use, the dryer, itself, does not get very hot. I was amazed at how I could grab the blowing end of the dryer just behind the actual air outlet and not burn my hand, even when running on full hot for 10 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the weight of this dryer as well. It is not super heavy, even though it has a really large heavy duty cord. It is balanced very well, I do not have to keep adjusting it in my hand due to the weight being wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is an awesome product. I suggest it to anyone who needs a new dryer, or just wants one that does the job right!ng wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really is an awesome product. I suggest it to anyone who needs a new dryer, or just wants one that does the job right!</li>
            <li> This hair dryer is top quality and I love it. Dries my hair quickly, is light weight and works great. Has many adjustments for speed and heat plus cold blast. Best dryer I have ever owned so far.</li>
            <li> Works well took away all the weather induced static in my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for the wife. But have to say it&#x27;s not noticeably lighter than the previous unit we had but it is very sharp looking. The controls are all conveniently placed with a plenty of speed and heat settings. The cord is of very good quality and pretty lengthy. I feel for the price it&#x27;s a very good buy and would really recommend it.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about the hair dryer was the sturdy sleek cord which felt well made and strong. The cord is long enough to plug into the wall and be able to use it 6ft away from the outlet. The hair dryer comes with the concentrator nozzle which I would have died without but it doesn’t bring the diffuser nozzle which I found kind of odd since most companies include both nozzles. Anyway, so I plugged in the hair dryer and started to blow dry my hair using the same brush I always use. I tested out the different heat settings and was impressed with how quickly the temperatures change. If you switch from hot to cold it happens instantly meanwhile I’ve owned hair dryers that take at least 20-30 seconds just to make the temperature change. The two different speed settings are your standard low and high, yet, at the high speed the noise the drier makes is not loud at all. The dryer isn’t completely soundless but it isn’t obnoxiously loud compared to others I’ve owned. I found that when I used this hair dryer my styling time was 20-30 minutes quicker than usual. In addition, my hair felt really smooth afterwards and the end result wasn’t as frizzy as I expected considering I have curly hair and I&#x27;m not a professional at blow drying.  UPDATE: After using the hairdryer for a few months, I noticed that whenever I would use this dryer my scalp would become very oily right after blow drying. Whenever I use my old Revlon hair dryer my scalp remains dry and I have never had this issue before. I haven&#x27;t changed any other hair care or hair tool besides this dryer so this must be the culprit.  I did receive this complimentary for review purposes but this does not influence my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am extremely surprise by all the positive reviews.  This was to replace an old Conair.  Frankly my old and less expensive Conair was much sturdier and not as cheaply made as this Allure Model  There&#x27;s cheap plastic throughout.  The attachment is the worst as it doesn&#x27;t stay on and falls off constantly chipping off the inside.  This entire thing won&#x27;t last too long.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way , I really like this.&lt;br /&gt;My favorite by far</li>
            <li> Great dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has cut her hair drying time by 40% with better results!</li>
            <li> it is good drying tool. I expected it to be a bit better from reading reviews.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job as drying hair and it is good quality and well made hair dryer.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend.</li>
            <li> Great buy for great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this dryer for a week but like it. It is powerful and does a nice job. I&#x27;m not sure how long it is going to last however. But for the price, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> My old (Revlon) hair dryer went kaput, and I went to a local store and bought another Revlon to replace it.  Yikes!  While it did dry my very straight, fine hair quickly, the air flow was so strong that when I put my hair in velcro curlers, the Revlon hair dryer blew the curlers out of my hair!  So I went looking on my beloved Amazon to find a better hair dryer with lots of positive reviews, and ended up ordering this for about the same price I paid for the Revlon one.  This one is great--so much more substantial and quality feeling and noticeably quieter and less shrill sounding than the Revlon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My single complaint is that the toggle switches on the handle that control the air flow and heat settings are a little too easy to accidentally change when drying your hair.  But I still like this hair dryer a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always a challenge to find a great hair dryer  that is also at a great price! However, after reading all the reviews on Amazon about the Allure 2200w hair dryer, I decided to give it a try. I must say I am very pleased with my purchase! Not only did it arrive on time but it really is an awesome hair dryer! It dries my long hair quickly and without any frizz-which of course is a great plus! I also really like that the dryer is salon quality without the salon price :) I would definitely buy other products by Xtava!</li>
            <li> really love it! my hair looked better than ever. dried about 3/4 times faster. drier is lighter and easier to work with when styling.&lt;br /&gt;dropped it accidentally and nothing was broken!&lt;br /&gt;drying seems enjoyable !&lt;br /&gt;have only used twice, but am glad that i bought it!</li>
            <li> Works well, I wish this could be much smaller</li>
            <li> Love this hair drier. I have thick long hair and it leaves my hair soft and gets it dry super fast.</li>
            <li> I love how lightweight, fast and VERY quiet this hairdryer is. The reason I dropped it to four stars is because it has a tendency to tangle my fine (not thin) hair, but the pros definitely outweigh the one con. Fine-haired women just need to be careful about pointing the dryer down the hair shaft to keep the tangles at bay.</li>
            <li> I love this hair dryer.  It is so easy to use.  And I really like that the cord is extra long to reach an outlet in another room.  Does a great job on my hair which has become dryer due to aging.  Great for all seniors!!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice, professional looking hairdryer. Nice color and the design is very sleek and sharp looking. Looks like it&#x27;s worth a lot more than what it really cost. It comes in a nice box, so it&#x27;s very suitable for gifting.The description says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;ultra lightweight&amp;#34; but, for me, it felt like it weighed just as much as any other hairdryer. I like that it has 2 speeds and 3 heat settings. I have very fine hair, so how much heat I use on my hair makes a big difference. The hottest setting does seem to get very hot, so be careful. Also with my fine hair, the higher settings had a tendency to tangle my fine hair, so I had to usually use the medium heat setting, which worked well. The hairdryer itself was not loud and dried my hair quickly. It has a long cord and comes with a concentrator nozzle which really help to reduce frizz. The concentrator nozzle is very easy to remove and put back on when needed. I also like that this hairdryer had a removable filter, it was easy to twist off for cleaning. Overall, it&#x27;s powerful and does a nice job. I loved the look and it&#x27;s easy to hold and use. Hoping it will last awhile. Would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was not financially compensated for this post. The opinions are my own and based on my personal experience with the product. I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This dryer is almost too good and too hot! I have to keep it on the middle setting because it&#x27;s so hot! Lol my daughters hate having their hair dryed but it&#x27;s winter in Coloraro so I have to. What&#x27;s great is that it&#x27;s light weight. The controls are positioned comfortably and it drys fast. It&#x27;s relatively quiet. Before I could never hear my music playing but with this dryer I can hear my pandora playing. It&#x27;s not like super clear but enough to k ow what song is playing. Also the cord is long which is great for me because I sit down to blow dry my daughters hair and I need it to be long enough. This might sound silly but it came in nice packaging and with a nice card that gave you a coupon code to recieve up to 50% off during their monthly sales. It was resonably priced and it seems like the rest of there on line products are priced well too. My only complaint is that the website doesn&#x27;t seem to be fullyup and running. It looks like they might sale makeup and other products but that part of the side says it&#x27;s down. I would like to see what else they provide. Over all I love it and so do my kids!</li>
            <li> Dries fast, low noise, and light weight. All the things I look for in a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> Better than any hair dryer I have had. Great product.</li>
            <li> This hairdryer is great!  It has 3 choices of speed and 3 heat settings, cool, warm and hot.  This is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever had!!</li>
            <li> The wife is happy with this heater</li>
            <li> Excellent dryer,,,,,almost as good as my supersalano that broke after many years.</li>
            <li> This dryer is light, does NOT have an ear-piercing sound and is light-weight.  The flow and temperature controls are effective.  And best of all...it does NOT pull my long hair into the fan!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this hair dryer! I was looking to replace my old red conair 1875 watt small quiet hairdryer that finally died. I loved having a hair dryer that was quiet. So when i found this one and read all the great reviews and even thought i had never heard of the company i thought i&#x27;d give it a shot, and boy am i glad i did! Its not a light weight as a lot of people are describing but its not terribly heavy either just longer than i am use to so i guess that makes it feel a bit heavier when waving it around. It definitely lives up to the quiet part for sure even when on the high setting. I have very thick hair and its naturally curly but i straighten it a lot and it usually takes me at least 15 to 20 mins to dry my hair (even with living in a very dry climate) but with this dryer it takes max 6 mins its awesome! I love the multiple heat settings and blow settings. This is an all around great product and i would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I looooove looooove this hair dryer.  It&#x27;s lightweight and has cut my drying time in HALF!</li>
            <li> Very fast and effective.</li>
            <li> is kind of different to the picture one, but the stylish on my hair it was as expected</li>
            <li> The vulcano of hair dryers</li>
            <li> Love this hair dryer. Dries my hair in no time</li>
            <li> I like it, thank u for the fast shipping</li>
            <li> This hair dryer works well, dries my hair quicker than others I&#x27;ve used in the past. My only complaint is the weight, could be lighter.</li>
            <li> Love this blow dryer!</li>
            <li> This is the best dryer I have ever owned!!</li>
            <li> LOVE it. Finally a hairdryer that has powerful air, just the right heat settings, and doesn&#x27;t break the bank. Three heat settings that feel like they should. Cold. Warm. Hot. Two speed settings, high and low. Very happy with the ease of selecting what I want, plus (again) the great air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A major plus is not having the high-pitch screeching whine of a Conair or so many other brands. For such power, the Allure 2200W is a relatively quiet dryer. On a noise scale of 10, I would venture to say between &amp;#34;4&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;6,&amp;#34; depending on the settings. For comparison, I would rate most Conairs and probably most other blow dryers I&#x27;ve used at between 7-10. Not dis&#x27;ing Conair, just mostly been using that brand for the past decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that the Allure buttons were on the right side (as opposed to facing inside toward your head), as I find the buttons a tad easy to inadvertently press. But that&#x27;s a personal preference. Maybe you&#x27;ll like it just the way it is. On the other hand, if you have both left- and right-handed family members, this might be a good solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, I personally love this dryer. Five stars.</li>
            <li> Good hair dryer. It can make your hair more straight but its kinda heavy compared to other hair dryers.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the best hair dryer I have ever hair! My hair feels very soft after using it and it makes it really easy to style my hair. Great buy!</li>
            <li> Yes the blow dryer works well to dry my  hair , but it didn&#x27;t leave my hair smooth without frizz . It was also awkward to handle , the nozzle is long . I will go back to my old hair dryer !</li>
            <li> Dries my hair in half the time. My hairdresser usually uses two blowers at once to dry my hair. This one does it itself in half the time!! It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use. The cord is fantastic because it doesn&#x27;t curl and not easily. My only complaint is that it&#x27;s very easy while drying to slip your finger and go from warm to hot and not mean to. And hot is very hot!</li>
            <li> This is THE BEST hair dryer that I have ever used! It feels like I am using a salon dryer! I&#x27;m so glad I got to try this out for an honest unbiased opinion. This Allure 2200W came very well packaged in a lovely box &amp; the hairdryer upon arrival was just as sleek as it appears in pics. The one I had been using now seems very bulky compared to this! I also love the attachment that came with it that focuses the heat to where you need it most. I love my new hair dryer!! It arrived in a nice looking box and is lightweight when removed. It has two speeds and three heat settings. I like how it has a cold burst button like my other dryer. It allows me to dry my hair quickly and efficiently. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have spent hundreds on hair dryers and my most recent purchase, prior to this one, was a feather light that I spend $180 on, it did, okay on my hair, but exploded after 8 months.  I was hesitant to buy this, only because of the price.  SERIOUSLY IN LOVE!!!  My hair is full, shiny and I am able to style it like my hair stylist!!  I think I will order a second so I have a back up!  I can&#x27;t believe what a fantastic job this does on my hair and all it offers for such an extremely low price!!  I&#x27;m a happy girl!!!</li>
            <li> I really really wanted to like this hair dryer, even ordered again after sending back the first one that arrived without the concentrator nozzle. After reading all the great reviews raving about the quality of the hair dryer I was somewhat disappointed with it.. It&#x27;s really powerful, I think even to the extent that it can over-dry and damage certain type of hair if one is not careful, so I&#x27;m sure it will dry hair in a shorter period of time, but I still have doubts about it being ceramic and using ionic diffuse technology which makes hair less frizzy and damages less, as I found no mention of it on the hair dryer, the box itself or the paper insert that comes with it.  The hair dryer has somewhat cheap and plastic feeling.. the seams are somewhat poorly made- they scratch your hand when you touch them, and the cold shot button is not a real button per se, it&#x27;s a piece of plastic hanging there, which I think can get stuck in or broken after some use.. Anyway, it&#x27;s an OK hair dryer for the price, very powerful, deserving the title Professional, but somewhat cheaply made.. I guess it makes it easier to write raving reviews about a product if you don&#x27;t pay for it, but for the price you can get a little less powerful but higher quality product</li>
            <li> 4.9 stars on 330 review is very suspicious. Search reviews for the word &amp;#34;exchange&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll see that 100 of these reviews were bought. And these are just the people admitting to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My UNBOUGHT review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Noise is average at best - louder than the blow dryer it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Weight is on the heavy side: 2 lbs (not the 1.6 lbs described)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Lots of power. Strong fan and gets very hot, even on the low setting. A burning smell on the high setting - I&#x27;m concerned that keeping it there might cause it to burn out</li>
            <li> This is a very sleek and stylish hair dryer. It looks very nice! It’s powerful at 2200 watts. This hair dryer comes with a concentrator nozzle but no diffuser. However, a previous diffuser that I owned fit on this just fine. It has a nice long cord too. The only thing is the cord is really thick so it easily knocks stuff down if anything gets in its way. I was very excited to get an opportunity to receive this for testing and inspection purposes. It works very well and dries my hair quickly. I like the more powerful hair blowers because they dry hair much faster than lower wattage dryers do. This one comes in black and looks very stylish. The concentrator works well too but you do need to push hard to get it on the hair dryer. It has three temperatures, hot, warm, and cold (or room temperature but it always feels cold to me.) It also has two speeds, low and high. In addition, it comes with a cool shot button, which gives you a blast of cold air when you push the button. The button is easy to push but it&#x27;s also black so it blends into the hair dryer. I would have liked it if the cool shot button was a different color. Other than that though, I really like this hair dryer. It&#x27;s powerful and efficient at drying my hair. This review is a reflection of my own personal experience with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got thick hair and this dries my hair quickly. It&#x27;s easy to hold and use. The cord is a little stiff and I wish it had a diffuser. But overall, I&#x27;m happy with this hair drier.</li>
            <li> The hairdryer works fine.  However, the design of the buttons drives me crazy.  The control buttons are right where I would wrap my fingers around the handle.  I constantly push the buttons and set the heat or the fan to another setting unintentionally while I am drying my hair.  It is extremely frustrating.  I am returning it.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It dries fast! It seems like a very sturdy product, not like some of the low end products out there. This is salon quality!!</li>
            <li> I was leery to purchase this hair dryer since a lot of the reviews seemed to be from someone who received the item free to try but I have been very pleased with my purchase! For the price, this is a fabulous hair dryer. I didn&#x27;t have a fancy one that I was replacing and I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money but I needed something powerful to dry my hair fast without damaging it. This does just what I need! The settings are great and it&#x27;s not too heavy. It looks sleek and pretty too. The only issue I&#x27;ve had is trying to keep the diffuser piece on, it keeps wanting to fall off but since I don&#x27;t use that often it&#x27;s not a deal breaker for me. I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Great hair dryer. Dries my hair great for thick hair.</li>
