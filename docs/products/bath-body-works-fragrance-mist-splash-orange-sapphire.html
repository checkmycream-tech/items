            <li>The shipment arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>If you want something that&#x27;s not too strong but attracts attention, get this scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light scent</li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>last a good while</li>
            <li>Just like a sweet, ripe orange.</li>
            <li>Bright, easy &amp; slightly citrusy with the tiniest breeze of vanilla.</li>
            <li>It smells so fresh.</li>

            <li>Can be used as general perfume or a body spray.</li>
            <li>(I prefer plain orange essential oil, I guess) but light enough to spray without being cloying.</li>

            <li> I love this spray. It smells so fresh. Glad I was able to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is my favorite bath and body sent.  such a bummer that the store doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore</li>
            <li> Nice scent. Bought quite a few of these.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this scent! Can&#x27;t believe that Bath and Bodyworks are discontinuing it. &amp;lt;3 Came fast and no problems. That I can still find it on Amazon makes me happy. Thank you.</li>
            <li> If you like citrus smells then this is perfect. It&#x27;s not flowery at all. I bought it for myself and my mother. The shipment arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li> Received fast, Love that i get some here, its my fav!!!</li>
            <li> I love the fragrance of the Orange Sapphire mist by Bath and Body, it is not heavy and over powering; I have gotten several compliments. It is on my wish list and I do recommend it to anyone who wants a mild scent (that last all day).</li>

            <li> Sadly it&#x27;s no longer being made.  Has been my favorite.  Can be used as general perfume or a body spray.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and clean! Just like a sweet, ripe orange. I wish it was still sold in stores but I am glad I can stillget it!</li>
            <li> Bath and Body works of course no longer carries this. So when I ran out of my 1st bottle I had to order from here. It has a nice clean scent and I love to spray it in my hair to refresh it. Working around food all of the time makes ones hair smell kind of icky and washing it daily is drying and time consuming. So I use this and it works well!</li>
            <li> Not orangey at all (I prefer plain orange essential oil, I guess) but light enough to spray without being cloying. I&#x27;ll probably use it as time goes on.</li>
            <li> IT SMEELS REALLY GOOD, LIKE AN ACTUAL ORANGE, I USE IT TO KEEP MY DADS CIGARETTE SMOKE OFF OF MY CLOTHING. Works perfect!!</li>
            <li> I thought I would like it, but after a while, I have grown tired of the scent.  Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have ordered so many :(</li>
