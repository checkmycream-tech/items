            <li>I also love that the ingredients are so natural.</li>
            <li>It competes right up there with the rose water I ordered at the same time thinking to mix them.  </li>
            <li>I think the fragrance dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It smells incredible, removes eye make up without irritating my eyes, and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li>Also good for other stuff, according to my wife who uses it for who knows what.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way, and the scent stays perfect even after 6 months.</li>

            <li> This is the best toner I have ever used in my life!  After washing my face this product still removed dirt that my old soap left behind.</li>
            <li> This is the best to use daily/nightly after washing and before using moisterizer. Leaves skin extra clean and soft and prepares the skin for deep moisterization with the ingredient \\&quot;hyaluronic acid\\&quot;, which helps skin retain moisture and plumps up fine lines. Doesn&#x27;t irritate or clog skin, is made from all natural ingredients, and leaves my skin very supple. Very light natural scent. I like to use this with Humphreys oil-free moisterizer [[ASIN:B002LMHZVM Organic Botanicals Oil-Controlling Daily Moisturizer, Witch Hazel &amp; Jasmine 2 oz by Humphreys Pharma ( Multi-Pack)]] for day use and Avalon&#x27;s Lavender Ultimate Moisterizer for night.[[ASIN:B001ET72WK Avalon Organics Ultimate Moisture Cream, Lavender Renewal &amp; Vitality, for Sensitive Skin, 2-Ounces (Pack of 2)]]</li>
            <li> I purchased this based off a recommendation from a friend. She writes a blog and was ranting and raving about how wonderful it was... so I had to try it! I am so glad I did...  I loved how smooth it made my skin feel! I also love that the ingredients are so natural. This should definitely be added as a part of every woman (or man)&#x27;s daily face regime. You only have one body/face forever. Take care of it while you can!</li>
            <li> We use this on my patient&#x27;s face after shaving. VERY SOOTHING and it smells nice. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smell of lilacs and this toner has the benefits of witch hazel with the wonderful after scent of lilacs that makes me feel refreshed and pretty!</li>
            <li> I use this product twice a day and simply love it.  It&#x27;s gentle on my sensitive skin while helping to exfoliate.</li>
            <li> Love it my skin is soft and smells amazing will keep buying this product</li>
            <li> I though this would be good for my skin; however, caused a horrible rash. Red blotchy skin and burns. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Love witch hazel. I use it to minimize pores, refreshen my skin during the day and as a hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It smells incredible, removes eye make up without irritating my eyes, and leaves my skin feeling clean.</li>
            <li> Great for removing make-up--does not irritate your eyes! Leave your skin feeling fresh and smooth.  I really like the smell.</li>
            <li> Gentle on my combination skin and smells great. This is my third bottle. A little goes a long way, and the scent stays perfect even after 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for several years. I love the smell, and the fact that this is non-drying AND gluten free.&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the morning after cleaning and again at night after cleaning. It&#x27;s refreshing and removes the last little bits of makeup.</li>
            <li> I AM generally a fan of Witch Hazel to begin with because it&#x27;s gentle, relatively natural and thorough as a toner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this time around I&#x27;ve gotten very ill, disablingly so, so have gone deeper into natural health care whenever possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve added judicious use of essential oils for example.  And this lovely Lilac Witch Hazel has added a gentle and exciting blend of EOs to this toner and I absolutely LOVE it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It works very well at both toning AND getting the rest of the dirt my cleanser misses, leaving my skin a lovely, smooth and firm canvas for my serum and moisturiser!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of lilacs and that was my only fleeting disappointment with this is that is doesn&#x27;t smell very much like lilacs, just a top note whiff before the scent of plain Witch Hazel almost prevails completely.  But the EO combination is really great for troubled skin, or skin you want to KEEP untroubled! :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE this stuff!  It competes right up there with the rose water I ordered at the same time thinking to mix them.  But they are both so lovely separately that I simply alternate!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t see anyone going wrong this carefully mixed natural product whether you&#x27;re dealing with acne or aging skin like me!  Enjoy! :-D</li>
            <li> This product was delivered quickly. I love the product itself</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of skin care products over the years, and I challenge anyone to find another toner that has as many outstanding ingredients at this price. The list of ingredients reads like a $100 serum.  It leaves my skin so soft, hydrated and glowing that sometimes I don&#x27;t even use a moisturizer after. Only a curmudgeon would find fault here.</li>
            <li> What a rush of cleanliness and purity you feel with Humphrey&#x27;s a must for all girls including girlie girls. But from this seller she rocks !</li>
            <li> Love the way makes my face feels after and around the eyes. (This one is the none alcohol version) I put this bottle in the fridge and before I go to bed and after I remove my make up, I apply all over my face or wipe my face with cotton pads. It is heaven in a bottle. I also clean my dogs outside of the eyes before bed and I can tell she loves it.</li>
            <li> This is an okay toner. I wanted to buy something that I can use at night and morning to soak up extra oil on my skin. I wanted to try toner to help with my acne prone skin. Though I still get pimples, I feel it does nothing for my acne but my skin does feel more smoother. It also has a wonderful lilac smell that doesn&#x27;t bother me too much.</li>
            <li> Smells lovely, my favorite facial toner.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff so much that I had to order it on Amazon when I discovered it was discontinued at the store. I use it as eye makeup remover and its fantastic with really impressive ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Really cools your face when used as an aftershave after a wet shave with a DE razor. Also good for other stuff, according to my wife who uses it for who knows what.</li>
            <li> It actually does soften my skin, and doesn&#x27;t aggravate my occasional acne. Nice for face and legs after shaving. The scent is sweet and floral, and my BF did comment that it was kind of strong when I first used it, but he hasn&#x27;t said anything since, so I think the fragrance dissipates pretty quickly.</li>
