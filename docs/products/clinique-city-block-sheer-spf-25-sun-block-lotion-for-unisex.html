    <ol>
            <li>Shame on you Amazon for leading people to think that they are getting a great deal!!  </li>
            <li>The city block is great under foundation or alone.  </li>
            <li>Great product at a great price - what on earth is there not to love about this?  </li>
            <li>I have combination, fair skin with freckles.  </li>
            <li>It provides good protection, though.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I do not like it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kinda ticked that Amazon has this originally listed as $30!!  </li>
            <li>Most importantly, it has not made me break out!  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is somewhat tinted...</li>
            <li>I really love this product - it does everything it says it will.  </li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure I would.</li>
            <li>It goes on well and protects much better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it both in winter and in summer, have to say it is more a winter sunblock, because in summer it melts and makes you look super shiny!  </li>
            <li>So you must reapply very often to get good sun protection.  </li>
            <li>i just wanna buy a nice non colorful sun protector cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and sheer and goes on beautifully.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product since it came out, and it&#x27;s fantastic.  </li>
            <li>year-round as a light foundation and sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>it feels comfortable and protect ur skin .</li>
            <li>It offers good sun protection for me.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m normally a no-makeup kind of gal unless I&#x27;m getting dressed</li>
            <li>and i clean it a lot.</li>
            <li>this is like after all of those cleaning stuff i am putting some s***y stuff on my face just to clean it again.</li>
            <li>Great for limited sun exposure.  </li>
            <li>Good size that is not too small or big so perfect for travel.</li>
            <li>i use it only twoce but feel good</li>
            <li>Their Super City Block SPF 40 contains chemical sunscreens, which irritated my face.  </li>
            <li>so i can finish it quickly.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to odors and chemical components of most sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>As far as protection goes, this 25 SPF is just OK.  </li>
            <li>it doesnt give me any fresh feeling.</li>
            <li>It dries nicely on my face, but I can definitely feel I have something on my face if I touch it</li>
            <li>, I squeezed it and a bunch of water came out, then very very clumpy product.  </li>
            <li>I have very fair oily/sensitive skin, and it has never been irritated or broken out from City Block 25.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sorry to waste $25 on a product that I know is great, but this particular one isn&#x27;t the best.  </li>
            <li>It is the only Clinique product I use;  I&#x27;ve been able to find cheaper substitutes for their soap, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten a sunburn while wearing City Block 25, but under a searing summer sun I mix a higher SPF sunscreen with it like [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years, but this is the first time I have purchased it off Amazon from this vender (MagicBox).  </li>
            <li>The instruction should tell us to shake first.</li>
            <li>I love the real City Sheer.</li>
            <li>It dries to a nice soft, sheer finish.  </li>
            <li>little bit lite in color but great to use this sunblock instead of white greasy creams on face</li>
            <li>I have the real thing from Clinique and this is nothing like it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t judge the real Clinique product based on this stuff.</li>
            <li>It is read oil free,but when I squeeze, too much out.</li>
            <li>i really did not like this product.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other products and none of them have keep the shine away like this one has for my oily skin.</li>
            <li>Not great or amazing!  </li>
            <li>It has a decent rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Safety Database (3), so I don&#x27;t worry about using it every day.</li>
            <li>+, 5-Ounce]], which comes in an oil-free sensitive-skin formula specifically for faces, does not contain chemical sunscreen, and my skin tolerates well (I highly recommend).  </li>
            <li>and so far, I really like it.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily and sometimes sensitive skin</li>
            <li>In winter it kind of hangs in there a little better, it is heavier than I would like, though it says sheer, lotion has a little tint about it, which I indeed liked because, it subtly conceals any slight imperfections you might have, would work better for drier skins I think.</li>
            <li>Nice daily sun block that has a slight tint to it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not mixed right or something.  </li>
            <li>I have normal to dry skin (live in high altitude desert with intense sun).</li>
            <li>I have tried every \\&quot;for faces\\&quot; sun protection product on the market and they all irritate my extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is definitely not the real product from Clinique.  </li>
            <li>However the most recent tube I got was weird - the consistency isn&#x27;t right</li>
            <li>It evens out tone a little bit and hides small imperfections, kind of like a tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I especially like that it&#x27;s appropriate for the eye area because I&#x27;ve found it very hard to find a sunscreen approved for the eye area except an Avon product, which I believe they discontinued.  </li>
            <li>it is heavy, does not smooth easily and covers everything in its path.</li>

            <li> I spend a long time agitating before I use it to recombine.</li>
            <li> I expect it&#x27;s either not being stored properly or is older (not a good thing).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy on the skin in terms of color so do not apply a big portion</li>
            <li> I started using other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> So while I would buy this sunscreen again, I&#x27;ll go to a department store or other vendor.</li>

            <li> It was not right when I opened it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I bought it several months before I ran out of my older supply and it is too late to return it.  </li>
            <li> I like the little tint it leaves, as I do not wear makeup (can&#x27;t tolerate any makeup on my face).</li>
            <li> Product works well with my skin type and not to greasy or heavy on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have used the clinique city block 25 SPF for a few years now and it is odorless.  </li>
            <li> I cannot use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Most other sunscreens that I have tried over the years are either too thick...too goopy...or smells horrible.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t burn, even a little, and it stayed put, even though it was 90 degrees out!  </li>
            <li> or I will be in trouble!</li>
            <li> Has a small opening so sunblock doesn&#x27;t come out all at once.</li>
            <li> luckly box is too small.</li>
            <li> unbelievable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> or you will look white and scary.</li>
            <li> This stuff is very pasty and thick and has a weird unpleasant odor.  </li>
            <li> I got sunburned this weekend from being in the sun for approximately 3 hours after applying 2 coats before going out.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, despite it being so expensive.</li>
            <li> my face looks dirty after I using it.</li>
            <li> so it works well as a base for make up.</li>
            <li> i also hate its color.</li>
            <li> I normally hate wearing sunscreen.</li>
            <li> also it smells horrible.</li>
            <li> this is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have the real thing from Clinique and this is nothing like it. The tubes are even slightly different in size and markings. Don&#x27;t judge the real Clinique product based on this stuff. I love the real City Sheer. I feel ripped off.</li>
            <li> I have combination, fair skin with freckles.  I have been using this for about a week and so far, I really like it.  I didn&#x27;t think that I would like the tint, but I do.  It evens out tone a little bit and hides small imperfections, kind of like a tinted moisturizer.  It dries to a nice soft, sheer finish.  It offers good sun protection for me.  I had a big outdoor party yesterday, applied it once, and it lasted all day.  I didn&#x27;t burn, even a little, and it stayed put, even though it was 90 degrees out!  Most importantly, it has not made me break out!  So i will continue to use it.  So five stars for now.  If it makes me break out, I will revise....</li>
            <li> I use this product as a makeup primer. I put it om after my moisturizer, before my foundation. It makes everything last throughout the day. I have tried many other products and none of them have keep the shine away like this one has for my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since it came out, and it&#x27;s fantastic.  I wear it daily, even in the winter.  It proects as well as any sunscreen, and I use it instead of foundation.</li>
            <li> Product works well with my skin type and not to greasy or heavy on my skin. That is all I have to say</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, despite it being so expensive. I have tried every \\&quot;for faces\\&quot; sun protection product on the market and they all irritate my extremely sensitive skin. Not this one!  I use it year-round except for winter, applying it after my red-reducing moisturizer. I like the little tint it leaves, as I do not wear makeup (can&#x27;t tolerate any makeup on my face). It is the only Clinique product I use;  I&#x27;ve been able to find cheaper substitutes for their soap, etc. but no sun-protection substitute.  As someone else said, I hope they do not discontinue this or I will be in trouble!</li>
            <li> I have used the clinique city block 25 SPF for a few years now and it is odorless.  It is the only sunscreen that I have found that I can tolerate on my face.  It does not make my eyes water.  I am very sensitive to odors and chemical components of most sunscreens.  As far as protection goes, this 25 SPF is just OK.  I got sunburned this weekend from being in the sun for approximately 3 hours after applying 2 coats before going out.  So you must reapply very often to get good sun protection.  The city block is great under foundation or alone.  I use the city block and then cover with pressed powder.  Great for limited sun exposure.  Be careful because the next step up with clinique is city block 40 SPF which DOES have a sunscreen odor and causes eye irritation, for me at least.</li>
            <li> This does double-duty for me year-round as a light foundation and sunscreen.  I use Clinique&#x27;s City Block SPF 25 because it does not have chemical sunscreen.  The sunscreens in 25 are titanium oxide and zinc oxide.  Their Super City Block SPF 40 contains chemical sunscreens, which irritated my face.  I have very fair oily/sensitive skin, and it has never been irritated or broken out from City Block 25.  I especially like that it&#x27;s appropriate for the eye area because I&#x27;ve found it very hard to find a sunscreen approved for the eye area except an Avon product, which I believe they discontinued.  I&#x27;ve never gotten a sunburn while wearing City Block 25, but under a searing summer sun I mix a higher SPF sunscreen with it like [[ASIN:B000I5KCIW Blue Lizard Australian Suncreen, Face SPF 30+, 5-Ounce]], which comes in an oil-free sensitive-skin formula specifically for faces, does not contain chemical sunscreen, and my skin tolerates well (I highly recommend).  By mixing it in this way, City Block still serves as my lightweight \\&quot;foundation.\\&quot;  My skin had an adverse reaction to Clinique&#x27;s similar product, Almost Make-up, so I hope they don&#x27;t ever discontinue City Block.  Also, Clinique will give you samples, so you could try out both 25 and 40 City Block formulas if you like before buying. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and pray that Clinique NEVER discontinues it!!  I have very oily and sometimes sensitive skin and this does not cause me to breakout.  It&#x27;s light and sheer and goes on beautifully.  Most other sunscreens that I have tried over the years are either too thick...too goopy...or smells horrible.  I love the fact that it is somewhat tinted...kinda hides some of my imperfections.  There is no odor.  In fact, I use it even if I&#x27;m going out in the evening.  Everyone is different when it comes to things like this but if you haven&#x27;t tried this, give it a shot.  You may like it!!  And though this has nothing to do with the product I&#x27;m kinda ticked that Amazon has this originally listed as $30!!  I have no clue where they get off doing that when the retail suggested price is the $18 that they claim is the sale price!!  Shame on you Amazon for leading people to think that they are getting a great deal!!  I get this all the time at the Bon Ton...which is $18.  Just a FYI!!</li>
            <li> I have used this sunblock for years.</li>
            <li> I really love this product - it does everything it says it will.  However the most recent tube I got was weird - the consistency isn&#x27;t right, I squeezed it and a bunch of water came out, then very very clumpy product.  It&#x27;s not mixed right or something.  I&#x27;m shaking and squeezing the tube to try to get it to mix correctly.  I&#x27;m sorry to waste $25 on a product that I know is great, but this particular one isn&#x27;t the best.  Maybe it&#x27;s the heat while it&#x27;s being transported.</li>
            <li> It is read oil free,but when I squeeze, too much out. To be honest, I do not like it. I will never buy it online.</li>
            <li> It was not right when I opened it. I couldn&#x27;t use it, it was off color &amp; texture. I&#x27;ve used this for years was I know what it should have been like. I won&#x27;t purchase again. I started using other sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Nice daily sun block that has a slight tint to it so it works well as a base for make up. Good size that is not too small or big so perfect for travel. Has a small opening so sunblock doesn&#x27;t come out all at once.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, but this is the first time I have purchased it off Amazon from this vender (MagicBox).  This stuff is very pasty and thick and has a weird unpleasant odor.  It is definitely not the real product from Clinique.  Unfortunately I bought it several months before I ran out of my older supply and it is too late to return it.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> i really did not like this product. i also hate its color. luckly box is too small. so i can finish it quickly. my face looks dirty after I using it. it doesnt give me any fresh feeling. when i finish it i will purchase something else. also it smells horrible. i just wanna buy a nice non colorful sun protector cream.  i did not order foundation guys. this is horrible. i care about my face a lot and i clean it a lot. this is like after all of those cleaning stuff i am putting some s***y stuff on my face just to clean it again. unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Not great or amazing!  I&#x27;ve used it both in winter and in summer, have to say it is more a winter sunblock, because in summer it melts and makes you look super shiny!  In winter it kind of hangs in there a little better, it is heavier than I would like, though it says sheer, lotion has a little tint about it, which I indeed liked because, it subtly conceals any slight imperfections you might have, would work better for drier skins I think.</li>
            <li> I WILL NOT be without this!  It is a mineral SPF and it moisturizes to boot.  Great product at a great price - what on earth is there not to love about this?  Nothing, that&#x27;s what!</li>
            <li> I like the tinting. Wasn&#x27;t sure I would. I&#x27;m not sure yet how well the sunscreen aspect works since it&#x27;s winter, but I will update the review as the seasons change. I have normal to dry skin (live in high altitude desert with intense sun). I normally hate wearing sunscreen. This sunscreen hasn&#x27;t made my face breakout or irritated. It dries nicely on my face, but I can definitely feel I have something on my face if I touch it (I&#x27;m normally a no-makeup kind of gal unless I&#x27;m getting dressed up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one caveat is that the sunscreen came unmixed: runny/watery alternating with clumpy. I spend a long time agitating before I use it to recombine. I expect it&#x27;s either not being stored properly or is older (not a good thing). So while I would buy this sunscreen again, I&#x27;ll go to a department store or other vendor.</li>
            <li> The oil is separated from the cream, yet there is no explanation about this. The instruction should tell us to shake first. Besides, it blocks the pores on my face. I cannot use it everyday.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavy on the skin in terms of color so do not apply a big portion or you will look white and scary. It provides good protection, though.</li>
            <li> i use it only twoce but feel good n i like it. it feels comfortable and protect ur skin .</li>
            <li> little bit lite in color but great to use this sunblock instead of white greasy creams on face</li>
            <li> OMG, this is like rubbing paste on your face....it is heavy, does not smooth easily and covers everything in its path. If you wear pancake makeup, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this forever. It goes on well and protects much better than anything else I&#x27;ve ever used. It has a decent rating on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s Skin Safety Database (3), so I don&#x27;t worry about using it every day.</li>
