    <ol>
            <li>It stays on and looks beautiful all day!</li>
            <li>I like no transfer lipsticks, and I like the plum shade provided by this line, it matches my NC35 comaplexion perfectly ..staying power is quite good .</li>
            <li>Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Came really quickly, great price and great product.</li>

            <li>and good coverage.</li>
            <li>It arrived at my home quickly, and I&#x27;m very happy with the order.</li>
            <li>This lip color has been discontinued and it is my very favorite.</li>
            <li>My favorite color!  </li>
            <li>I love this shade!</li>
            <li>Kachesvo mineral lipstick excellent rests gently on the lips.</li>
            <li>Nice lip color.</li>
            <li>My favorite color from the infallible series.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>It stays on &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; unless I happen to have some coconut oil on my lips when I put it on.  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 and this is my favorite lipstick to date.  </li>
            <li>Glad to have a stash of this stuff.</li>
            <li>When I am finished with my eye liner I put on the chap stick like top coat.  </li>
            <li>Love the staying power of this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years with no issues (and loved it!)</li>
            <li>Lipgloss unstable, skayvaetsya pelleted very quickly.</li>
            <li>You can layer it for more intense color, but the coverage is perfect with one tiny layer.</li>
            <li>Love the quick service and the lipstick.</li>
            <li>, I went to see if it is filled of chemicals.</li>
            <li>Also the clear part of the lip color system smells really good.  </li>
            <li>Great product, long wear.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly</li>
            <li>so if you make a mistake wipe it off right away.  </li>
            <li>I also use this as blush right after moisturizing, I dot some on and wipe it in.  </li>
            <li>But make sure you wear the gloss after or your lips will feel dry.  </li>
            <li>; if I&#x27;m not wearing a wine or red color, I think it&#x27;s fine.  </li>
            <li>The color looks much darker online but much lighter when  the lipcolur arrived; I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li>They should read ingredients first, there is NOTHING natural abt it.</li>
            <li>and I appear less professional than my more domesticated peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  </li>
            <li>they can be cheap if you look enough like at vitamin store or something such as Honey Gardens .</li>
            <li>Color was as expected, not a bad idea to match in person</li>
            <li>and my most recent order of this product caused my lips to get irritated and develop dark spots.  </li>
            <li>The color really lasts but make sure you mean it!</li>
            <li>Color as the photo, soft kstochka.</li>
            <li>she needs a much darker shade and it was discontinued last year</li>
            <li>Very pretty dark berry color.</li>
            <li>Through process of elimination, I determined that this product caused these problems and after discontinuing use, my lips went back to normal in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>I reapply this after lunch when I remember, but generally it&#x27;s sufficient for my work day.  </li>
            <li>Does not dry out lips.  </li>
            <li>At first its a little sticky but when it dries the sticky goes away.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I wear it in the summer and winter - one of the few colors I have that seems to work in any season because it&#x27;s just a darker shade of my natural lip color.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t make your lips flaky as long as you reapply lip conditioner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are bunch of lip gloss that are long wearing w/o chemicals.</li>

            <li> I bet lipbalm has lead hidden.</li>
            <li> I even bought few from FRED&#x27;s store</li>
            <li> HATE trying to keep makeup on and in the right places.  </li>
            <li> started using this lipstick as part of my morning routine, putting the lip color on after I wash and dry my face, before anything else (usually just eye liner and maybe some loose powder, mascara in desperate moments!).  </li>
            <li> It aint that hard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to remove.</li>

            <li> You would think I&#x27;m a guy by the way I hate using makeup.  </li>
            <li> It must be sticky and tasting nasty.</li>

            <li> My favorite color from the infallible series.  Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do when there are no more left in existence!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It will last the entire day, including eating and drinking.  Color was dark so I purchased a lighter color and mix them together.  Also the clear part of the lip color system smells really good.  At first its a little sticky but when it dries the sticky goes away.</li>
            <li> Color as the photo, soft kstochka. Kachesvo mineral lipstick excellent rests gently on the lips. Lipgloss unstable, skayvaetsya pelleted very quickly.</li>
            <li> My favorite color!  Why did they discontinue this shade?</li>
            <li> It stays on &amp;#34;forever&amp;#34; unless I happen to have some coconut oil on my lips when I put it on.  :)</li>
            <li> Lasts about 12 hours.  Does not dry out lips.  Dries quickly so if you make a mistake wipe it off right away.  I also use this as blush right after moisturizing, I dot some on and wipe it in.  I&#x27;m 58 and this is my favorite lipstick to date.  You can layer it for more intense color, but the coverage is perfect with one tiny layer.</li>
            <li> Lasts forever. Even with scrubbing, It took forever to get the color off my lips. I eventually had to use a lip exfoliant to get it off.</li>
            <li> The color looks much darker online but much lighter when  the lipcolur arrived; I won&#x27;t be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> Glad to have a stash of this stuff. So sad L&#x27;Oreal once again discontinues a favorite color.  Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this color through Amazon online before, and it is much less expensive than what I can find in the stores...and actually since this color is no longer commercially available this is the only way to get it. It arrived at my home quickly, and I&#x27;m very happy with the order.</li>
            <li> I HATE HATE HATE trying to keep makeup on and in the right places.  You would think I&#x27;m a guy by the way I hate using makeup.  I have a job where I&#x27;m the odd woman out if I don&#x27;t and I appear less professional than my more domesticated peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  started using this lipstick as part of my morning routine, putting the lip color on after I wash and dry my face, before anything else (usually just eye liner and maybe some loose powder, mascara in desperate moments!).  When I am finished with my eye liner I put on the chap stick like top coat.  I reapply this after lunch when I remember, but generally it&#x27;s sufficient for my work day.  I purchased three of the same color, one I have in my purse, one in my bathroom with the other morning makeup items, and one in my desk drawer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review is for Kate&#x27;s plum- my coworker thinks it&#x27;s too &amp;#34;brown&amp;#34; if I&#x27;m not wearing a wine or red color, I think it&#x27;s fine.  I wear it in the summer and winter - one of the few colors I have that seems to work in any season because it&#x27;s just a darker shade of my natural lip color.</li>
            <li> I love this shade! But make sure you wear the gloss after or your lips will feel dry.  The color really lasts but make sure you mean it! It&#x27;s tough to remove.</li>
            <li> Nice lip color. Very pretty dark berry color. Love the staying power of this product. This doesn&#x27;t make your lips flaky as long as you reapply lip conditioner.</li>
            <li> Came really quickly, great price and great product. Will order thru this seller again! Color was as expected, not a bad idea to match in person then order online if you need an.exact color</li>
            <li> bought it for my daugher.  she loves it. she needs a much darker shade and it was discontinued last year</li>
            <li> I like no transfer lipsticks, and I like the plum shade provided by this line, it matches my NC35 comaplexion perfectly ..staying power is quite good .</li>
            <li> Loreal had discontinued the Stars Collection several years back so beware that the product may be expired if you order it.  I have been using this product for several years with no issues (and loved it!) and my most recent order of this product caused my lips to get irritated and develop dark spots.  Through process of elimination, I determined that this product caused these problems and after discontinuing use, my lips went back to normal in a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give this enough Stars!!!! I absolutely love this lip stick!! I have looked for something that would stay on after drinking my coffee, eating and so on. Let me just say i took a shower and slept all night in lip stick and it was still on in the morning!! I have recommend to a ton of friends!!!</li>
            <li> Great product, long wear.  No drying or flaking.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why ladies buy in hypers and buy simply because it is long wear lip gloss. They should read ingredients first, there is NOTHING natural abt it. I was going buy it but notice that it has a lot of cones, alummin, and chemicals. It must be sticky and tasting nasty. I bet lipbalm has lead hidden. I can&#x27;t say for sure. But I remember L&#x27;oreal was off peta list this year or last because they say they might re-test animals, I went to see if it is filled of chemicals. I am just writing review to help health-concision women relaize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are bunch of lip gloss that are long wearing w/o chemicals. they can be cheap if you look enough like at vitamin store or something such as Honey Gardens . I even bought few from FRED&#x27;s store they have a lot of castor oil, shea butter, cocount oil, etc. and good coverage. Try dollar tree store too ..just look at ingredients. It aint that hard.</li>
            <li> This lip color has been discontinued and it is my very favorite. Don&#x27;t know the shelf life of the product but what was received appeared to be newer product so I am storing under refrigeration to increase shelf life. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Love the quick service and the lipstick. Only one that I know that does what is meant to do. It stays on and looks beautiful all day! Will continue to buy and have recommended to others...Amazon is the only way to buy!!</li>
