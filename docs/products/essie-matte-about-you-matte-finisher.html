            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it on all my favorite nail polishes.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear the Matte top coat.</li>
            <li>I did notice that because the nails don&#x27;t have a reflective top coat I could see more dents and wear and tear.</li>
            <li>To clarify the description when applied as the top coat of any nail polish</li>
            <li>This is a MUST HAVE!! :)</li>
            <li>It not only turns a beautiful mani into a nice matte finish</li>
            <li>Because every time I use this it looks good at first</li>
            <li>It dries fast and does it&#x27;s job quite nicely!</li>
            <li>This product arrived on time and works perfectly, the description could be more clear about what exactly it does, but it does everything I hopped it would do.  </li>
            <li>It does what it says but I wish it puts on more smoothly.</li>
            <li>They look so cool!</li>
            <li>but it chips soooooo easily.</li>
            <li>love the look - - too cool</li>
            <li>Also, the top coat goes on smooth and easy, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived last night and let me tell you, amazing!</li>
            <li>I love it so much!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fun surprise!</li>
            <li>cool stuff for non-fru fru girls too</li>
            <li>Looks so cool.</li>
            <li>It works, but it wears off really quickly.</li>
            <li>It dries incredibly quick and you can see it working.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the option of having matte nails!</li>
            <li>The matte finish gives your nails a really fun look.</li>
            <li>I like this better than using an actual matte polish because they seem to not go on smooth.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is suppose to do, could not be happier</li>
            <li>Essie is also a very dependable brand!</li>
            <li>Makes my nails pretty and without the shine.</li>
            <li>but it actually removes the color polish on your nail if you take more than 1 brush stroke</li>
            <li>It takes a little while to dry but its still works perfectly.</li>
            <li>amazing top coat finish, addicted to this polish</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a fun new touch to nails.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that the coat underneath is completely dry before you start the matte finish!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, fast drying, and a great way to mix up a mani you&#x27;ve had for a couple days and are feeling a bit bored with!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I really like matte and did not want to pay an arm and a leg for one bottle of nail polish</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>Very fierce nails.</li>
            <li>If you add to much it looks lumpy...</li>
            <li>I wore this over my Chanel Peridot nail polish -very</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This opens up a whole new world for me!</li>
            <li>I must admit that I didn&#x27;t use an Essie nail polish beneath, but I did use a long lasting nail polish that can last almost ten days when used by itself -- putting this top coat over my nail polish gave it the matte effect I wanted very nicely, but then my nail polish beneath chipped only after two days.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>So instead I use a normal polish then apply this</li>
            <li>It works well over all other types and colors/textures of polish, and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I use this polish so much, this is the second time I&#x27;m buying it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty hard to get a smooth matte look since my nails are naturally not smooth.</li>

            <li> I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for a flat or matte nail polish look!</li>
            <li> which is not very professional in color or shine, would never wear in front of clients-</li>

            <li> It works, but it wears off really quickly.</li>
            <li> love this top coat, great matte effect and i can use it with all my regular polish.</li>
            <li> It worked perfect! I love it so much! I would definitely recommend this to someone who is looking for a flat or matte nail polish look! Essie is also a very dependable brand! It actually came in a lot sooner than I thought it was. It came way before the estimated date which I was very happy and I was super happy with the result!</li>
            <li> This product was great. I didn&#x27;t know if I really like matte and did not want to pay an arm and a leg for one bottle of nail polish I didn&#x27;t even know if I liked. It was great and I love it. It takes a little while to dry but its still works perfectly. It got here very quickly without any problems!</li>
            <li> Makes my nails pretty and without the shine. Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> The matte finish gives your nails a really fun look. I chose to leave one nail with the regular polish so you could compare. After a week or so the matte finish seemed to wear off but by then my nails needed to be repainted anyway. I think it&#x27;s a fun new touch to nails.</li>
            <li> I loved this polish. It works well over all other types and colors/textures of polish, and dries quickly. I would recommend to anyone. Very fierce nails.</li>
            <li> love the look - - too cool</li>
            <li> i didnt think it would work , but it did. the matter finish is actually matte, not like others that still look shiny</li>
            <li> mattes well, goes on nicely, but dents/defects easily.</li>
            <li> giving it a 4 star bc it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do, give you that matte look but i feel like it&#x27;s not the matte i wanted, maybe im applying it wrong ?</li>
            <li> I must admit that I didn&#x27;t use an Essie nail polish beneath, but I did use a long lasting nail polish that can last almost ten days when used by itself -- putting this top coat over my nail polish gave it the matte effect I wanted very nicely, but then my nail polish beneath chipped only after two days.  To sum up: works great as a matte finisher, but does not add to the life of the nail polish underneath like a good top coat.</li>
            <li> Love it. Would have given it 5 but it actually removes the color polish on your nail if you take more than 1 brush stroke</li>
            <li> I love this top coat. I use it all the time now.</li>
            <li> As always Essie has great products.</li>
            <li> I use this polish so much, this is the second time I&#x27;m buying it. I even used it to mattify my glasses. They look so cool! Love this product. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> The nail polish was exactly as I expected. I love it and it was a great price. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on all my favorite nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Love it !! Everything is perfect !</li>
            <li> Because every time I use this it looks good at first but it chips soooooo easily. It was a waste of my money</li>
            <li> My friend who is always doing nails recommended this product for me. It arrived last night and let me tell you, amazing! It not only turns a beautiful mani into a nice matte finish but it dries within minutes! I would easily recommend this product to anyone looking to make their nails matte! :)</li>
            <li> Will continue ordering it for a very long time!!</li>
            <li> Matte is working well!</li>
            <li> Have only used it on a black nail polish, but it worked like a charm! Love Essie products! Can&#x27;t go wrong with them</li>
            <li> If you add to much it looks lumpy...</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, fast drying, and a great way to mix up a mani you&#x27;ve had for a couple days and are feeling a bit bored with!  I especially love it over stamping and glitter!</li>
            <li> I like this better than using an actual matte polish because they seem to not go on smooth. So instead I use a normal polish then apply this and I have the matte look without any streaking. Perfect and reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear the Matte top coat. It dries incredibly quick and you can see it working. I need to keep my nails &amp;#34;professional&amp;#34; (which turns out is actually in my employee handbook!... Seriously...). I wore this over my Chanel Peridot nail polish -very shimmery which is not very professional in color or shine, would never wear in front of clients- and my boss complimented me on my nails. I did notice that because the nails don&#x27;t have a reflective top coat I could see more dents and wear and tear. Overall I love the option of having matte nails! Using over burgundy polish looks amazing for fall!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s intended to do. Gives my nails a nice, matte finish. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This is so great its the best Top coat i have ever bought. I was not sure first because i have no idea about Nail stuff. Either way i bought it and im supper happy with the purchase. this coat makes all my nail polishes into Matt Collors. I love it its amazing. supper happy with my purchase and the seller. thank you.</li>
            <li> This opens up a whole new world for me! The matte finish makes every polish color seem completely different. It&#x27;s a fun surprise! Also, the top coat goes on smooth and easy, and dries quickly. Just make sure that the coat underneath is completely dry before you start the matte finish!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My matte top coat kept a cheap nail polish looking great for 5-6 days.</li>
            <li> It does what it says but I wish it puts on more smoothly. It&#x27;s pretty hard to get a smooth matte look since my nails are naturally not smooth. But it does its job.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and works perfectly, the description could be more clear about what exactly it does, but it does everything I hopped it would do.  To clarify the description when applied as the top coat of any nail polish and it dries, it makes the polish matte instead of shiny.</li>
            <li> I love this! It dries fast and does it&#x27;s job quite nicely! This is a MUST HAVE!! :)</li>
            <li> AMAZING. Obsessed. Looks so cool. Highly recommend.</li>
