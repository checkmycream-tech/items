            <li>I like how it is easily reactivated by just adding water.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair that tends to frizz</li>
            <li>As soon as I applied it my hair felt fantastic.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair out and my hair gets straight, but with nice ringlet curl going on at the ends.  </li>
            <li>This is the best product to make my hair smooth and full without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many many other products, and this one by far is the best.  </li>
            <li>and this works great to apply then blow dry.</li>
            <li>Its true it seems to melt in your hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 29-year-old lady with long wavy hair and have always loved the volume I get when I blow-dry and style after a shower.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is very baby fine</li>
            <li>This product works great to give your hair moisturizier and style sass without being heavy, greasy in your hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a fresh smell in my opinion.</li>
            <li>It does have more of a masculine scent</li>
            <li>this, its worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>This product gives great voulme without the greasy or stiff feeling some products leave in your hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and need a nice balance between something that holds yet doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li>it makes my hair so silky smooth and soft!!</li>
            <li>It beefs up straight hair to be full, but not bushy.  </li>
            <li>My hair is hard to work with and this product does a great job.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel like velvet, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>Really adds volume to my hair!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I first heard of this product at my beauty shop.</li>
            <li>so soft and smooth on my hair.</li>
            <li>It feels like it &#x27;magically&#x27; disappears in your hair - so light, yet heavy on the volume that it gives your hair.</li>
            <li>Really helps hold a hot roller set without crunch and stickiness.</li>
            <li>Blow Dry Gel is ok.  </li>
            <li>But the smell is WAAAAY too strong and smells like men&#x27;s cologne even into the second day.</li>
            <li>Good basic blow dry product.</li>
            <li>Gives my fine hair extra body!</li>
            <li>This gel smells fantastic, its addictive, and not a girly smell</li>
            <li>Very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight, it just contains the frizz which is all I wanted.  </li>
            <li>I found this gel to be very sticky feeling</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between my hair when I have used it and when I have forgotten to use it....</li>
            <li>really couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything at all.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this gel!</li>
            <li>There are other Redkin projects that work much better for my problem hair</li>
            <li>I am not a first time user, I love this stuff</li>
            <li>This product works great and styles my hair without heavy , greasy or weighing my hair down and this product smells fresh.</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have super straight hair and want volume to last all day.</li>
            <li>Not super shiny, but definitely healthy looking.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that can get a little frizzy/wavy at times.</li>
            <li>It is not really a strong hold gel, more of a medium hold but just gives a polished finish.</li>
            <li>I got this to use with my new hair Elchim dryer.  </li>
            <li>Hair is still very soft and touchable.</li>
            <li>Purchasing in the US the color on the bottle is silver as pictured but it is the exact same thing.</li>
            <li>It was so easy to dry my hair, then I did a little flat iron, so easy.</li>
            <li>I bought it directly from the retailer at the event and since it comes from Paris the container looks exactly the same except instead of silver color lettering</li>
            <li>It felt soft manageble and shiny.</li>
            <li>Makes it feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>I like a soft moveable look to my hair which this product does not lend itself to.</li>
            <li>I mean some people cant get over the smell, but I love it.</li>
            <li>I have fine thin straight hair and this product works for me.  </li>
            <li>Recently had a hard time finding it and was so glad to see I could get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I based my purchase on other people&#x27;s promising reviews and the fact that it had been in a &amp;#34;Best Hair Products&amp;#34; category from an old Allure magazine.</li>
            <li>This product is a little pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I frequently dry my hair with the blower and then run my wet fingers back through it to give it a more wild wet look.  </li>
            <li>I do not like heavy conditioners and am fussy about how my hair looks, this product gives me just enough finish for a easy blow dry of my hair</li>
            <li>I use this before I blow dry, like the smell, and it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super thick and sticky out of the tube, but makes your hair smell yummy and keeps it from drying out or frizzing when styling.</li>
            <li>you might wanna smell it first, its a little strange until you get used to it.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight, it just contains the frizz which is all I wanted.  </li>
            <li> I found this gel to be very sticky feeling</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between my hair when I have used it and when I have forgotten to use it....</li>
            <li> really couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything at all.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this gel!</li>
            <li> There are other Redkin projects that work much better for my problem hair</li>
            <li> I am not a first time user, I love this stuff</li>
            <li> This product works great and styles my hair without heavy , greasy or weighing my hair down and this product smells fresh.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair and want volume to last all day.</li>
            <li> Not super shiny, but definitely healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that can get a little frizzy/wavy at times.</li>
            <li> It is not really a strong hold gel, more of a medium hold but just gives a polished finish.</li>
            <li> I got this to use with my new hair Elchim dryer.  </li>
            <li> Hair is still very soft and touchable.</li>
            <li> Purchasing in the US the color on the bottle is silver as pictured but it is the exact same thing.</li>
            <li> It was so easy to dry my hair, then I did a little flat iron, so easy.</li>
            <li> I bought it directly from the retailer at the event and since it comes from Paris the container looks exactly the same except instead of silver color lettering</li>
            <li> It felt soft manageble and shiny.</li>
            <li> Makes it feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> I like a soft moveable look to my hair which this product does not lend itself to.</li>
            <li> I mean some people cant get over the smell, but I love it.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin straight hair and this product works for me.  </li>
            <li> Recently had a hard time finding it and was so glad to see I could get it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I based my purchase on other people&#x27;s promising reviews and the fact that it had been in a &amp;#34;Best Hair Products&amp;#34; category from an old Allure magazine.</li>
            <li> This product is a little pricey but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I frequently dry my hair with the blower and then run my wet fingers back through it to give it a more wild wet look.  </li>
            <li> I do not like heavy conditioners and am fussy about how my hair looks, this product gives me just enough finish for a easy blow dry of my hair</li>
            <li> I use this before I blow dry, like the smell, and it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super thick and sticky out of the tube, but makes your hair smell yummy and keeps it from drying out or frizzing when styling.</li>
            <li> you might wanna smell it first, its a little strange until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> It is worth paying the extra dollars to get this, and even though the container is small it lasts a long while.</li>
            <li> I often mix it with an extreme hold gel if I want to enhance my natural wave.</li>
            <li> It feels a little heavy going on, but the weight just disappears, and it leaves your hair super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She has straight hair with the tiniest bit of wave, and if used wet and blow dried, her hair comes out looking like a hair commercial.</li>
            <li> so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> My hair is short and I don&#x27;t need to blow dry it with this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I let it air dry</li>
            <li> This also works on my daughter&#x27;s dry hair for de-tangling, I just use like a dot or two on my palms and run it through her hair before brushing it in the morning.</li>
            <li> Not a problem for me as I typically shower every day and wash the product out but might be a problem for people who don&#x27;t shampoo daily.</li>
            <li> and they seem to do nothing but weigh hair down and make it flat within an hour.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I have a philosophy that If I want to wear fragrance, it should be of my choosing and not something that imposes itself from some product I am using  for other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You only need a small dab</li>
            <li> Yet it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all weighted down.  </li>
            <li> I mix this with argon oil and put in my hair while damp and then blow dry and style as usual.</li>
            <li> As a woman, it is pretty disappointing to receive comments that you smell like a man wearing cologne...</li>
            <li> My hair was maybe a little bit less \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The trick is just a little product on damp hair.</li>
            <li> its purple, so it gives all the blondes out there just a little bit of freshness to their color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tone it down Redken!</li>
            <li> I also disliked the smell that lingered on my hair for about 2 days.  </li>
            <li> and I must wash it everyday to style it.</li>
            <li> The next day, however, it always looked limp, flat, and depressing.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair too stiff for what I like.  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product after washing my hair I use very little product</li>
            <li> :)  If you hate frizzy hair, this product is for you!</li>
            <li> , unfortunately they have stopped making several of them.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive but doesn&#x27;t take but a dab for short hair to give you fully body.  </li>
            <li> I have bought it at least 5 times over the past few years.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I was disappointed, considering how much this product costs.</li>
            <li> It seems like it is going to be like a thick gel</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of less expensive volumizing products from the drug store</li>
            <li> It does not smell bad, it smells a little minty.</li>
            <li> I like this product but his tube arrived sticky and I assume dirty.  </li>
            <li> Does not leave your hair smelling bad, as a matter a fact</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Makes hair manageable without buildup.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite product, easy to use and great result for fine hair!</li>
            <li> This product works great to give your hair moisturizier and style sass without being heavy, greasy in your hair.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years and love it!</li>
            <li> Really helps hold a hot roller set without crunch and stickiness. Hair is still very soft and touchable. But the smell is WAAAAY too strong and smells like men&#x27;s cologne even into the second day. Tone it down Redken!</li>
            <li> This gel smells fantastic, its addictive, and not a girly smell it would be good for guys also. It makes my hair feel like velvet, soft and smooth. It is not really a strong hold gel, more of a medium hold but just gives a polished finish. It probably suits some hair types and not others.</li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy hair. This gel provides wonderful hold for styling without buildup or flaking. I often mix it with an extreme hold gel if I want to enhance my natural wave.</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this by my hairdresser and LOVE the smell - it&#x27;s definitly not a stinky, girly smell if that&#x27;s what you are after. It&#x27;s got a fresh smell in my opinion. I have fine hair and need a nice balance between something that holds yet doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. This works great and is my gel of choice!</li>
            <li> I like this product but his tube arrived sticky and I assume dirty.  Won&#x27;t be using this vendor any more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It feels like it &#x27;magically&#x27; disappears in your hair - so light, yet heavy on the volume that it gives your hair. I don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair. This is the best product to make my hair smooth and full without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff!! it makes my hair so silky smooth and soft!! i do not know what i would do without it!</li>
            <li> Redken Velvet Gelatine 07 works excellent on my hair for blow drying and styling. This product works great and styles my hair without heavy , greasy or weighing my hair down and this product smells fresh. I recommend this hair product to everyone. I am very pleased and satisfied and this product deserves a 5 star rating or higher. Very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and smells good. I recommend this product to a lot of people. Very pleased and satisfied. I will purchase more soon. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Really adds volume to my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to me to help me with frizz after a shower.  I love it!  This product works wonders!  I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair.  I let it air dry and it still works.  It doesn&#x27;t keep my hair straight, it just contains the frizz which is all I wanted.  :)  If you hate frizzy hair, this product is for you!</li>
            <li> Consistently good product</li>
            <li> So glad I found this product! I&#x27;m a 29-year-old lady with long wavy hair and have always loved the volume I get when I blow-dry and style after a shower. The next day, however, it always looked limp, flat, and depressing. Now that I apply this product to my damp hair after a shower, I get that bouncy, voluminous 1st-day hair for 3 or 4 days, without greasiness! I based my purchase on other people&#x27;s promising reviews and the fact that it had been in a &amp;#34;Best Hair Products&amp;#34; category from an old Allure magazine. It really works! Don&#x27;t hesitate if you&#x27;re thinking about buying it! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of less expensive volumizing products from the drug store and they seem to do nothing but weigh hair down and make it flat within an hour. Kedken Velvet Gelatine 07 Blow-Dry Gel is a life-saver!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gives my fine hair extra body! And the smell is very nice! Been using it for 8 years now!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It does have more of a masculine scent but I kinda like that with my pixie cut! GREAT product and I WILL keep buying! Great to use on a pixie cut and helps handle the humidity!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 55 years old and in all my years of searching for the perfect product that would give my hair full body, shine, and sexy bounce this Redken Velvet Gelatine 07 is a Miracle Product!! I get more compliments on my hair than my 5 carat diamond ring!! Run DO NOT walk and purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Love this product, just use it on the ends.</li>
            <li> Good basic blow dry product.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended and a little goes a long way. Holds hair cut nicely without a lot of work and clean feeling. I have fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> I do not like heavy conditioners and am fussy about how my hair looks, this product gives me just enough finish for a easy blow dry of my hair is always just as I want it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve tried many many other products, and this one by far is the best.  It is worth paying the extra dollars to get this, and even though the container is small it lasts a long while.</li>
            <li> This product is a concentrated gel that I found to be &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;. I also disliked the smell that lingered on my hair for about 2 days.  I have a philosophy that If I want to wear fragrance, it should be of my choosing and not something that imposes itself from some product I am using  for other reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have fine hair that tends to frizz so I am always looking for products that give body without weight.  This product did give some body but it did it by making my hair frizz.  There are other Redkin projects that work much better for my problem hair, unfortunately they have stopped making several of them.  I returned this product because I would not use it again.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product after washing my hair I use very little product and it does keep my hair looking beautiful.  The trick is just a little product on damp hair.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this product at the IBS in NYC and really liked it. I bought it directly from the retailer at the event and since it comes from Paris the container looks exactly the same except instead of silver color lettering it was purple. Purchasing in the US the color on the bottle is silver as pictured but it is the exact same thing. Works great.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product.  Great for styling curly hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a little pricey but totally worth it. I get lots of compliments on my hair since I&#x27;ve been using this. Has a nice, clean scent. Makes my hair look thicker and no greasiness. And a little goes a long way so it lasts. My hair is short and I don&#x27;t need to blow dry it with this product.Will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Best gel I&#x27;ve ever used. It isn&#x27;t sticky or anything. Can&#x27;t say anything con about it. I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I found this gel to be very sticky feeling and I can&#x27;t tell much of a difference between my hair when I have used it and when I have forgotten to use it....</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It smells good and makes my hair very manageable. I have fine, straight hair that can get a little frizzy/wavy at times. I mix this with argon oil and put in my hair while damp and then blow dry and style as usual.</li>
            <li> Redken Velvet Gelatine 07 Blow Dry Gel is ok.  I wasn&#x27;t impressed . . . really couldn&#x27;t tell that it did anything at all.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Great for styling.  My hair is hard to work with and this product does a great job. Also, have let my hair go white, and this product does not turn it yellow or make it dingy looking.</li>
            <li> I have fine thin straight hair and this product works for me.  It is expensive but doesn&#x27;t take but a dab for short hair to give you fully body.  The  heat from the blow dryer is what pumps up the hair product.  Nothing else has worked for me like this product.  I don&#x27;t like the next day look after sleeping on it... hair feels/looks greasy.  Not a problem for me as I typically shower every day and wash the product out but might be a problem for people who don&#x27;t shampoo daily.</li>
            <li> I first heard of this product at my beauty shop. I have very fine hair and this works great to apply then blow dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 8 years.  Recently had a hard time finding it and was so glad to see I could get it through Amazon. It makes a huge difference in the way my hair moves!</li>
            <li> great product, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I just adore this stuff. It&#x27;s super thick and sticky out of the tube, but makes your hair smell yummy and keeps it from drying out or frizzing when styling.</li>
            <li> I found this product in the blowout bin at my cosmetology school, and since then I&#x27;ve never used anything else... it works on EVERYONE. I mean some people cant get over the smell, but I love it. It feels a little heavy going on, but the weight just disappears, and it leaves your hair super soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And its purple, so it gives all the blondes out there just a little bit of freshness to their color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, its worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;But you might wanna smell it first, its a little strange until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> Love the Redken Gel for my hair. My hair is short and this product helps keep it in style during the day.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!! I get compliments when I use this product on my hair. My hair is so shiny, manageable and lovely when I use this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I have used it for some time now.  It gives body with no stickiness or loss of shine.  Perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I love this product and this is the best price I have ever purchased it for. I received it as promised, in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Great for blow drying.  It beefs up straight hair to be full, but not bushy.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years for fine hair this is the best stling product that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Can not get it at my local stores.</li>
            <li> This product is the BEST product I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair. I love it. It does not smell bad, it smells a little minty. Does not leave your hair smelling bad, as a matter a fact,I don&#x27;t smell it at all in my hair. I have never dried my hair faster and beautifully before. As soon as I applied it my hair felt fantastic. It felt soft manageble and shiny. Its true it seems to melt in your hair. It was so easy to dry my hair, then I did a little flat iron, so easy. OMG I hope they continue having this product. I just received it yesterday and I went and bought two more today. I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Perfect for my hair. Makes it feel so soft.  Great price too. Cheaper than getting it at the salon!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product especially for thinning hair. It gives hair just the right amount of body!!</li>
            <li> I am not a first time user, I love this stuff</li>
            <li> This is the best gel I have found for using with a blow dryer.  It has good hold.  Yet it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair all weighted down.  I like how it is easily reactivated by just adding water.  I frequently dry my hair with the blower and then run my wet fingers back through it to give it a more wild wet look.  Then it drys again and remains.  A very good product.</li>
            <li> I got this to use with my new hair Elchim dryer.  Now my hair looks awesome without spending the salon money, smells wonderful, too.  I use somewhere between a dime and nickel&#x27;s worth for shoulder length frizzy curly hair, comes out perfect.  Doesn&#x27;t flatten my hair out and my hair gets straight, but with nice ringlet curl going on at the ends.  Not super shiny, but definitely healthy looking.  This also works on my daughter&#x27;s dry hair for de-tangling, I just use like a dot or two on my palms and run it through her hair before brushing it in the morning. She has straight hair with the tiniest bit of wave, and if used wet and blow dried, her hair comes out looking like a hair commercial.</li>
            <li> As a woman, it is pretty disappointing to receive comments that you smell like a man wearing cologne...&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the \\&quot;Unisex\\&quot; word fool you!!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a guy, definitely buy this product.  I, however, prefer not to smell like a dude.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the actual use of the product, I didn&#x27;t notice a big difference when I used this product, rather than not, when blow-drying my hair.  My hair was maybe a little bit less \\&quot;poofy\\&quot;?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I was disappointed, considering how much this product costs.</li>
            <li> The smell. The texture.  This stuff is terrific!  It gives my hair body and bounce, just like it says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it was a heat protectant as well, then it would truly be the ONLY hair product (besides hair spray) I would need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Redken, are you listening? ;O)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this gel was edible, I would eat it.  That&#x27;s how good it smells.  People comment on the scent, when I&#x27;m not wearing perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE THIS STUFF.  I have bought it at least 5 times over the past few years.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS!!! It seems like it is going to be like a thick gel but it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s AWESOME!&lt;br /&gt;&#x60;</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this gel! The smell is absolutely amazing- so soft and smooth on my hair. You will not be dissapointed!</li>
            <li> This product was okay.  Makes my hair too stiff for what I like.  I like a soft moveable look to my hair which this product does not lend itself to.</li>
            <li> This product gives great voulme without the greasy or stiff feeling some products leave in your hair. Nice fragrnce as well.</li>
            <li> Great product. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Amazing product love it.</li>
            <li> Came on time and it works.</li>
            <li> I love this gel. My hair is very baby fine and I must wash it everyday to style it. With the help of this gel my hair is fuller, and feels like velvet. I have tried so many others, but found this is the best for my hair to get it to style the way I like it. You only need a small dab so it last a long time.</li>
            <li> I have super straight hair and want volume to last all day. I use this before I blow dry, like the smell, and it makes my hair feel soft.</li>
