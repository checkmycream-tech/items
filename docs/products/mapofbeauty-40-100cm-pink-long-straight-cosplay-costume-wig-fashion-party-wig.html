            <li>It was good.</li>
            <li>I love all the wigs I&#x27;ve gotten from this company and their all in really good shape</li>
            <li>They were so nice when I emailed them to ask a question</li>
            <li>and it tangles and sheds very easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first wig, and it is a very outstanding color, I didn&#x27;t know if it would look good against my skin color.</li>
            <li>I really do love it though</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>product, I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more colors.</li>
            <li>It was ok and worked for the price i paid though.</li>
            <li>Super cute wig though! :)</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li>The wig came in early so that was great.</li>
            <li>Tangled easy.</li>
            <li>Quality not the best, but good for price, don&#x27;t see it lasting long</li>
            <li>Overall GREAT product for cosplay.</li>
            <li>and I enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Omg love the color and the lenghth, it works perfect for the character I cosplayed as, yuno gasai, but it shipped late</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very soft and I love the color!</li>
            <li>This was my first wig through amazon, and frankly it was okay.</li>
            <li>: Was supposed to take at least a month to arrive but came in a few weeks, the wig is very nicely put together with a kind of netting inside the wig rather than just the &amp;#34;grid&amp;#34;, the color of it is great, it is very nice and simple to style.&lt;br /&gt;Notes:</li>
            <li>wig is true to color.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this wig so much.</li>
            <li>The wig color is exactly as pictured, and incredibly smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>My favorite wig so far!</li>
            <li>The wig is definetely worth the price.</li>
            <li>It also arrived super fast and the seller was kind enough to include a wig cap!</li>
            <li>But I liked it the color matched, and it tangled alot when it was long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a neon or bright pink but in true bubblegum fashion the shade suits and is almost a little more pastel.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased</li>
            <li>This was the first time I ever bought a wig from this company.</li>
            <li>This wig is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I an going to gladly use this wig for a simple Luka</li>
            <li>The colour is true and it&#x27;s soft, but tangles like hell.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s in love with the shade of pink that it was</li>
            <li>and it went really well with her costume.</li>
            <li>I was very dissatisfied.</li>
            <li>Much better quality than expected.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s ready to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent</li>
            <li>I cut the bangs to make them straight across.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Of course since its a long wig it tangles easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The wig has a decent thickness to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than the wig being thin it was perfect!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so thin and tangles very easily!</li>
            <li>It came earlier than expected, it was a lighter shade of pink than in the picture, but I am still happy with it.</li>
            <li>It was very soft and did not have that &amp;#34;wig shine&amp;#34; to it</li>
            <li>Exact same color as advertised.</li>
            <li>I will probably trim some of the length off, because of this issue.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are shorter than pictured so they have to be pinned out of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The internal cap doesn&#x27;t have much structure or elastic</li>
            <li>also the hair tangles a lot, but other than that its a very pretty wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not surprised if I&#x27;m not even the first person to complain over this.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I wore it out and some people actually thought it was real hair?</li>
            <li>The wig is so soft and looked like the photo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty long and did well for the costume!</li>
            <li>The second I started to comb it, the wig completely ratted out.</li>
            <li>Also for being able to see the netting some when parted, you couldn&#x27;t see any of my dark hair or black hair net underneath, only the flesh tone netting on the wig.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as full and thick as the picture appears and it tangles quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;Positives</li>
            <li>I assume it&#x27;s the wig that made it messy, since my wig comb is in very good condition and has never made a wig look so bad.</li>

            <li> that it matters much, but it was a tad bit too small for my head, and I know I don&#x27;t have a big head.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping, it got to me in less than 2 weeks and even came with a black hair net.</li>
            <li> I read other reviews about tangling, which is to be expected for such a long wig and immediately sprayed it with wig spray and cut off abou 10 inches, as well as cut bangs (the long bangs come this way</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s to be expected with long wigs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a long wig so it does tangle, but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
            <li> When I first put the wig on I noticed it was a bit thin.</li>
            <li> I ordered the black wig from this same seller and got this one for her.</li>
            <li> the hair cap is rather small, and no i dont have a large head, im actually a very small person, i just thought the head cap didnt cover my head enough as i expected it too.</li>
            <li> It was way thinner than expected</li>
            <li> Arrived when expected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expected for it to tangle based on the length.</li>
            <li> but that was due to the holidays</li>
            <li> Just Be Friends cosplay, I have worn this with other dressed</li>
            <li> ordered from the US and it took about a month and a half to arrive.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It got here in less than a week, and came with a wig cap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a little ratty when I received it, so I decided to brush it out with a wig comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had so much trouble with the tangles</li>
            <li> and it was not easy to brush out.  </li>
            <li> never mind the cap being too small</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little difficult to style, but it can be done with some work.</li>
            <li> The only issue I have with it is the shedding, which is bad.</li>
            <li> , it was thin</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s just horribly thin.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s kinda thin, but it will do.</li>
            <li> This wig is soooo thin!  </li>
            <li> This wig was very very thin, sadly.</li>
            <li> but it is very thin.</li>
            <li> so it moved around like crazy on my head until I pinned it</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with that as well.</li>

            <li> I ordered this wig for halloween for my sister in law since I was going as Marceline and she was Princess Bubblegum. I ordered the black wig from this same seller and got this one for her. She&#x27;s in love with the shade of pink that it was and it went really well with her costume. It&#x27;s not a neon or bright pink but in true bubblegum fashion the shade suits and is almost a little more pastel. It worked out well and she took steps to prevent it from tangling. It&#x27;s pretty long and did well for the costume! It also arrived super fast and the seller was kind enough to include a wig cap!</li>
            <li> Omg love the color and the lenghth, it works perfect for the character I cosplayed as, yuno gasai, but it shipped late but that was due to the holidays so I understand. I love all the wigs I&#x27;ve gotten from this company and their all in really good shape</li>
            <li> Tangled easy. But it&#x27;s to be expected with long wigs. Overall GREAT product for cosplay.</li>
            <li> S&#x27;great, for the price. It was way thinner than expected but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
            <li> I purchased this wing for a Princess Bubblegum Costume.  While I do think it will work for my purpose with some extra manipulation, this wig does come with some issues others might want to consider before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROs:&lt;br /&gt;The wig is true to color.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely 40&amp;#34; long.&lt;br /&gt;The wig has a decent thickness to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONs:&lt;br /&gt;It was shipped all folded up so when I took it out of the bag the bottom was already knotted and it was not easy to brush out.  I will probably trim some of the length off, because of this issue.&lt;br /&gt;The bangs are shorter than pictured so they have to be pinned out of my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;The internal cap doesn&#x27;t have much structure or elastic so it moved around like crazy on my head until I pinned it down.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered from the US and it took about a month and a half to arrive.</li>
            <li> the hair cap is rather small, and no i dont have a large head, im actually a very small person, i just thought the head cap didnt cover my head enough as i expected it too. also the hair tangles a lot, but other than that its a very pretty wig.</li>
            <li> I bought this to cosplay as Nyu/ Lucy from Elfen Lied. Overall I&#x27;m pretty pleased, it looks good/feels good, it was thin but that&#x27;s what you should expect from such a low price. I read other reviews about tangling, which is to be expected for such a long wig and immediately sprayed it with wig spray and cut off abou 10 inches, as well as cut bangs (the long bangs come this way so you can cut them however you like) I really do love it though, it was a good buy for the price</li>
            <li> This was the first time I ever bought a wig from this company. It was a little ratty when I received it, so I decided to brush it out with a wig comb. The second I started to comb it, the wig completely ratted out. It looks like there&#x27;s a nest of rats inside of it! I assume it&#x27;s the wig that made it messy, since my wig comb is in very good condition and has never made a wig look so bad. If you&#x27;re looking to buy a quality Cosplay wig, I would not recommend this company. I was very dissatisfied. I&#x27;m not surprised if I&#x27;m not even the first person to complain over this.&lt;br /&gt;Not that it matters much, but it was a tad bit too small for my head, and I know I don&#x27;t have a big head. I was disappointed with that as well.</li>
            <li> This wig is exactly what I was looking for. The only issue I have with it is the shedding, which is bad. It&#x27;s a little difficult to style, but it can be done with some work.</li>
            <li> My favorite wig so far!</li>
            <li> Quality not the best, but good for price, don&#x27;t see it lasting long</li>
            <li> This wig will work great for my Princess Bubblegum costume. The color is as pictured.</li>
            <li> Very good quality and great experience.  Arrived when expected.  Much better quality than expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so thin and tangles very easily! would NOT recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this wig so much. I was a bit nervous to order it. It&#x27;s my first wig, and it is a very outstanding color, I didn&#x27;t know if it would look good against my skin color. But I&#x27;m glad I bought it. It is so gorgeous. Exact same color as advertised. I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;It got here in less than a week, and came with a wig cap.&lt;br /&gt;Of course since its a long wig it tangles easily. But just comb it through after it comes in the mail and it&#x27;s ready to wear.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product, I&#x27;m looking forward to buying more colors.</li>
            <li> The wig came in early so that was great. It was very soft and did not have that &amp;#34;wig shine&amp;#34; to it but it is very thin. No matter how you place the hair, you can see the wig net in the back and it tangles and sheds very easily. It was ok and worked for the price i paid though.</li>
            <li> This wig is soooo thin!  Just by taking the wig out of the bag, I could see the net!  There&#x27;s no way I could use this for any cosplay-never mind the cap being too small, it&#x27;s just horribly thin.</li>
            <li> This was my first wig through amazon, and frankly it was okay. But I liked it the color matched, and it tangled alot when it was long so I cut it about shoulder length, it&#x27;s kinda thin, but it will do. I wore it out and some people actually thought it was real hair? But yeah. It was good.</li>
            <li> This wig was very very thin, sadly. It still can work though... I cut the bangs to make them straight across. The colour is true and it&#x27;s soft, but tangles like hell. I&#x27;ve had so much trouble with the tangles I&#x27;ve almost cried.</li>
            <li> It came earlier than expected, it was a lighter shade of pink than in the picture, but I am still happy with it.</li>
            <li> The wig color is exactly as pictured, and incredibly smooth to the touch. It&#x27;s a long wig so it does tangle, but that&#x27;s to be expected. If you have to part it in any way you will see some of the netting, but there are styling ways to get around that. Fast Shipping, it got to me in less than 2 weeks and even came with a black hair net. Also for being able to see the netting some when parted, you couldn&#x27;t see any of my dark hair or black hair net underneath, only the flesh tone netting on the wig.</li>
            <li> (Sad face on the picture is because I messed up on the bangs, which I was able to fix.)&lt;br /&gt;Negatives: It&#x27;s not as full and thick as the picture appears and it tangles quite easily.&lt;br /&gt;Positives: Was supposed to take at least a month to arrive but came in a few weeks, the wig is very nicely put together with a kind of netting inside the wig rather than just the &amp;#34;grid&amp;#34;, the color of it is great, it is very nice and simple to style.&lt;br /&gt;Notes: It&#x27;s expected for it to tangle based on the length. I an going to gladly use this wig for a simple Luka Just Be Friends cosplay, I have worn this with other dressed and I enjoy it. The wig is definetely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This wig came in about 2 weeks after ordering. It came earlier then stated too. It came with a wig cap. When I first put the wig on I noticed it was a bit thin. Other than the wig being thin it was perfect! It&#x27;s very soft and I love the color!</li>
            <li> Do you know if i can get it to me by halloween? I want to use it for a princess bubblegum costume. Super cute wig though! :)</li>
            <li> They were so nice when I emailed them to ask a question and I got the wig asap when I paid to expedite i! The wig is so soft and looked like the photo.</li>
