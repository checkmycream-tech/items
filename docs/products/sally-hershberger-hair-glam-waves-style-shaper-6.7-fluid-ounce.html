            <li>Best of all, it smells like coconut!</li>
            <li>and i got beautiful beach waves!</li>
            <li>m good to go!)</li>
            <li>Either way, I have caucasian curls and this stuff works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair look amazing!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
            <li>It does a really good job in my already curly hair.</li>
            <li>This also smells really good.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>AMAZING product</li>
            <li>I always keep this one handy and travel with it.</li>
            <li>It did smell nice, so there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the most effective product I have found to make my shoulder-length curls into wash and go hair.  </li>
            <li>I love love LOVE this product!</li>
            <li>I found these products gae me more body than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>I love the line.</li>
            <li>but most days I just use this foam</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle product that makes my hair stunning</li>
            <li>curls - it&#x27;s like magic.  </li>
            <li>Probably better for thinner/less curly hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s more like a foam.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>So I put on my hand and rub into my hair and make it a bit more presentable.</li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommended :).</li>
            <li>-when-it&#x27;s-wet hair now has full time waves!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s instantly full of body again!</li>
            <li>However, if you never used the original, you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference and would love it.  </li>
            <li>and have baby fine hair to deal with.  </li>
            <li>I always wonder when I read curly hair product reviews what race the reviewer is, because it is important for curly hair products, but I think people worry about being offensive.  </li>
            <li>bought this because i needed something to define and smooth permed waves/</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the residue-y feeling that this product left in my hair.</li>
            <li>Beautiful styling, lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re into a natural looking hairstyle than this is a good product for you.</li>
            <li>It could be just me, or perhaps my perm is running out, but this product seems to be a bit \\&quot;stickier\\&quot; than the original that I had...and seems to work almost like a hair spray....</li>
            <li>I still like the product, and am using it each time I wash my hair...but just think perhaps they changed from the original.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this in hopes of adding texture and wave to my very fine and straight length hair.  </li>
            <li>and they look amazing AND feel soft;</li>
            <li>to keep my waves/curls full, and some [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products that I&#x27;m ready to go &amp;#34;productless&amp;#34; and see how that goes.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t a greasy feeling, but it wasn&#x27;t a clean, fresh feeling, either</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s my only reason for not giving it a perfect score, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li>I heard about this from Kelly Ripa, and I have loved her long bob with waves.</li>
            <li>and I love trying new things.</li>
            <li>I used it this morning along with So Gorgeous blow dry gel and Aussie sprunch mousse</li>
            <li>What it ended up doing was exactly what I had wanted every product to do-- it gave me full and bouncy hair.  </li>
            <li>( i now know it was cheaper on amazon) but it was worth it.</li>
            <li>I have fine straight hair, I just use it from about my ears down because most products make the top of my head look greasy (which I use Batise Dry Shampoo on to totally solve - I even use it on clean hair - great stuff).</li>
            <li>Seriously, if you&#x27;re looking for a great product for wavy/curly hair, this one is worth trying!</li>
            <li>Back when I had long hair I would use it and it would give me beautiful curls.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasted me for more than 3 months with daily use.</li>
            <li>just that I was using something different. :)</li>
            <li>Also smells great and seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li>I finally found this one maybe 2 or 3 years ago, and it&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
            <li>I thought it was a spray or spritz first of all</li>
            <li>My waves look very soft and full; not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this for someone with really unruly hair who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of time fussing with products and styling tools.</li>
            <li>However, I do like that it is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
            <li>plus the smell is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li>highly advise buying this for summer beach waves!</li>
            <li>I read a lot of reviews for this particular Sally Hershberger product, and I had previously used a Sally Hershberger heat protected spray on my hair that I liked a lot.</li>
            <li>3 squirts on my shoulder length hair coupled with 95 degree HUMID weather did pretty much nothing, so the next day I decided to get crazy and go 4 pumps, which worked out pretty much perfect!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have naturally curly hair, but did have a perm in that I wanted to keep some curl, but not frizz, and have it look like a natural curl as I have very straight hair and am confined to bed and cannot do much with my hair because of my disability.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for anyone with wavy hair.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny, and i totally recommend this to anyone with wavy hair!</li>
            <li>I also feel like however much I shook the bottle, the consistency of the actual foam was always really watery or something.</li>
            <li>My usually straight- only-</li>
            <li>I am 73 yrs old.</li>
            <li>It gives a natural look to you hair as well as a shine.  </li>
            <li>but when i tried it; I like it so far</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to use post-shower for my naturally frizzy/poofy/wavy hair (Caucasian, brunette).</li>
            <li>Minimal frizz, minimal static, a must have.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crispy, but it does leave it touchably soft and controlled... But not for very long... may have to reapply after 4  hours, unless you pile it on at first.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t put enough in because I didn&#x27;t want to use too much and look all early &#x27;90s wet look all day.  </li>
            <li>This is the first and only product i&#x27;ve ever tried that has left my hair soft, managable yet enhances my wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have not tried letting it air dry wavy because it just looks too darn good when I blow dry as usual.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder-length fine hair that has a natural wave, and I struggled for a long time to find a product that didn&#x27;t weigh my waves down or make them look greasy.</li>
            <li>I use 2 pumps and blow dry straight.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it wasn&#x27;t horrible and it might be great for some people, but it just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is pretty long, i use 4 pumps on wet hair, let it air dry, and im off to work!</li>

            <li> I actually can&#x27;t even feel any product in them when I touch them, and I think my curls have actually been a little curlier...</li>
            <li> Some days I blow dry</li>
            <li> (3 pumps for 4 inches longer than shoulder length hair) and let it air dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried this alone and with a few other styling products, letting my hair dry naturally and although it tames my frizz and shapes the waves, so does a cheaper version made by Garnier.</li>
            <li> I felt like it weighed my hair down instead of giving it bounce, which is personally what I seek in curl/wave-enhancer.</li>
            <li> I saturate wet hair with it and then blow dry.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on dry hair when I am about to leave the house and my long wavy hair need a little taming.  </li>
            <li> My other bottle ran out, and so I purchased this one.  </li>
            <li> (by the way, a little tip to get your hair beachy and wavy is to wait until your hair is almost completely dry but still a little wet.</li>
            <li> probably due to the fact that they don&#x27;t have a bunch of gels and sprays weighing them down.</li>
            <li> having random curly and straight spots.</li>
            <li> It does not do anything for my hair which is wavy, thick and coarse and needs smoothing.</li>
            <li> I also use a little bit of [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I had a small bottle of this brand hair product, that was given to me.</li>
            <li> i have naturally wavy hair...but its a crazy, frizzy wave.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much product over the years, but was very unhappy with my hair and decided to give this a whirl.</li>
            <li> And late in the day, when I want to freshen up in a hurry, I spray the underside of my hair.</li>
            <li> the smell--which is not great at all--fades within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I mean, but</li>
            <li> I rated it four stars because it has a bunch of crap chemicals that are terrible for your hair as well as many other products out in the market.</li>
            <li> It might just be my hair type (very thick and curly), but it requires a lot of this to seem to make a difference in my hairstyle and doesn&#x27;t help control frizz.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m miserable any day I don&#x27;t use it.</li>

            <li> This is the most effective product I have found to make my shoulder-length curls into wash and go hair.  The first time I tried it I didn&#x27;t put enough in because I didn&#x27;t want to use too much and look all early &#x27;90s wet look all day.  3 squirts on my shoulder length hair coupled with 95 degree HUMID weather did pretty much nothing, so the next day I decided to get crazy and go 4 pumps, which worked out pretty much perfect!  My curls are separated and not frizzy AT ALL....buuuuuttt, they also aren&#x27;t crunchy at all.  I actually can&#x27;t even feel any product in them when I touch them, and I think my curls have actually been a little curlier...probably due to the fact that they don&#x27;t have a bunch of gels and sprays weighing them down. I actually look like I have a hairstyle now instead of a mane, and all I have to do is wash, use this stuff, and go.    * I always wonder when I read curly hair product reviews what race the reviewer is, because it is important for curly hair products, but I think people worry about being offensive.  Either way, I have caucasian curls and this stuff works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Just to let you know, I never, ever write reviews but I had to make an exception for this product.  I purchased this in hopes of adding texture and wave to my very fine and straight length hair.  What it ended up doing was exactly what I had wanted every product to do-- it gave me full and bouncy hair.  I use 2 pumps and blow dry straight.  I have not tried letting it air dry wavy because it just looks too darn good when I blow dry as usual. AMAZING product and I hope it never gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product i&#x27;ve ever tried that has left my hair soft, managable yet enhances my wavy hair. No crunchy hair, even if you apply tons of it it never leaves your hair crunchy or greasy. I rated it four stars because it has a bunch of crap chemicals that are terrible for your hair as well as many other products out in the market. I mean, but if you don&#x27;t care about the ingredients then this is the product i recommend for eveyrone with wavy hair! The bottle lasted me for more than 3 months with daily use.</li>
            <li> Never used anything like it- and I have tried them ALL (ex beauty supply manager). My usually straight- only- wavy-when-it&#x27;s-wet hair now has full time waves! And late in the day, when I want to freshen up in a hurry, I spray the underside of my hair. It&#x27;s instantly full of body again! BEST STUFF EVER!!!</li>
            <li> I am 73 yrs old. and have baby fine hair to deal with.  I ran across this product, on sale, at CVS.  Picked it up, tried it, and went back to purchase all they had.  Problem I guess CVS stopped handling I have not found it since.  I did order some Sally Hershberger products on line &amp; from Amazon.com.  I found these products gae me more body than anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I love the line.</li>
            <li> The BEST curly hair product ever! I have a mix of ringlets and wavy hair and it&#x27;s perfect for both!</li>
            <li> I had a small bottle of this brand hair product, that was given to me. I don&#x27;t have naturally curly hair, but did have a perm in that I wanted to keep some curl, but not frizz, and have it look like a natural curl as I have very straight hair and am confined to bed and cannot do much with my hair because of my disability.  My other bottle ran out, and so I purchased this one.  It could be just me, or perhaps my perm is running out, but this product seems to be a bit \\&quot;stickier\\&quot; than the original that I had...and seems to work almost like a hair spray....but no where near a firm hold, if I&#x27;m making any sense.  I still like the product, and am using it each time I wash my hair...but just think perhaps they changed from the original.  However, if you never used the original, you wouldn&#x27;t know the difference and would love it.  It gives a natural look to you hair as well as a shine.  I&#x27;ve received compliments on it since I began using it and no one knew I what I was using...just that I was using something different. :)</li>
            <li> Beautiful styling, lasts a long time.  I heard about this from Kelly Ripa, and I have loved her long bob with waves.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m miserable any day I don&#x27;t use it. I have fine straight hair, I just use it from about my ears down because most products make the top of my head look greasy (which I use Batise Dry Shampoo on to totally solve - I even use it on clean hair - great stuff). Some days I blow dry but most days I just use this foam (3 pumps for 4 inches longer than shoulder length hair) and let it air dry. Minimal frizz, minimal static, a must have.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used much product over the years, but was very unhappy with my hair and decided to give this a whirl. I think it works quite well to assist my somewhat curly hair with looking like I actually put some time into it as opposed to it having random curly and straight spots. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle product that makes my hair stunning so that&#x27;s my only reason for not giving it a perfect score, but I&#x27;d definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best product I have ever found for curly hair!</li>
            <li> I have tried this alone and with a few other styling products, letting my hair dry naturally and although it tames my frizz and shapes the waves, so does a cheaper version made by Garnier. I like  Sally Hershbergers products and I love trying new things. I would recommend this for someone with really unruly hair who doesn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of time fussing with products and styling tools. If you&#x27;re into a natural looking hairstyle than this is a good product for you. Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair crispy, but it does leave it touchably soft and controlled... But not for very long... may have to reapply after 4  hours, unless you pile it on at first.</li>
            <li> bought this because i needed something to define and smooth permed waves/curls - it&#x27;s like magic.  95% humidity and they look amazing AND feel soft; no gel, no crunch, just perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and the smell--which is not great at all--fades within a few minutes.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful for wavy hair!  I saturate wet hair with it and then blow dry. It leaves my waves frizz-free and non-sticky.  Best of all, it smells like coconut! I would highly recommend it for anyone with wavy hair.</li>
            <li> It might just be my hair type (very thick and curly), but it requires a lot of this to seem to make a difference in my hairstyle and doesn&#x27;t help control frizz. However, I do like that it is very lightweight and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue. Also smells great and seems to last a long time. Probably better for thinner/less curly hair.</li>
            <li> I love love LOVE this product! I have shoulder-length fine hair that has a natural wave, and I struggled for a long time to find a product that didn&#x27;t weigh my waves down or make them look greasy. I finally found this one maybe 2 or 3 years ago, and it&#x27;s fantastic! My waves look very soft and full; not greasy at all. Seriously, if you&#x27;re looking for a great product for wavy/curly hair, this one is worth trying! I also use a little bit of [[ASIN:B0007CXWUG Aveda Confixor Liquid Gel, 8.5 Ounces]] to keep my waves/curls full, and some [[ASIN:B003VCF9MI Aveda Aveda by Aveda Control Force Hair Spray for Unisex, 9 Ounce]] to hold them all day. *Tip: Use all three products as sparingly as possible to ensure your hair doesn&#x27;t feel \\&quot;crispy\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, overall: Great product, highly recommended :).</li>
            <li> The sally hershberger style primer,is purchased by mistake but when i tried it; I like it so far and I am using it.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Back when I had long hair I would use it and it would give me beautiful curls. No stickiness or shine, no complaints.</li>
            <li> I see that everyone is raving about this product and so I bought this instead of the KMS I wanted to try.  I thought it was a spray or spritz first of all but it&#x27;s more like a foam.  It does not do anything for my hair which is wavy, thick and coarse and needs smoothing. Nothing for frizz either.  I&#x27;ve tried so many products that I&#x27;m ready to go &amp;#34;productless&amp;#34; and see how that goes.</li>
            <li> i love this stuff.  it&#x27;s the only thing i need to style my hair when i want a wavy look.  plus the smell is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li> It does a really good job in my already curly hair.</li>
            <li> I use this mostly on dry hair when I am about to leave the house and my long wavy hair need a little taming.  So I put on my hand and rub into my hair and make it a bit more presentable. I always keep this one handy and travel with it.</li>
            <li> i have naturally wavy hair...but its a crazy, frizzy wave.  This stuff makes my hair look amazing! my hair is pretty long, i use 4 pumps on wet hair, let it air dry, and im off to work! highly advise buying this for summer beach waves!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing! This also smells really good. I bought this yesterday at Ulta for 13 dollars ( i now know it was cheaper on amazon) but it was worth it. I used it this morning along with So Gorgeous blow dry gel and Aussie sprunch mousse and i got beautiful beach waves! Worth every penny, and i totally recommend this to anyone with wavy hair! (by the way, a little tip to get your hair beachy and wavy is to wait until your hair is almost completely dry but still a little wet. i use my blow dryer to get it this way. Then just scrunch up with Sally Hershberger and my Aussie and im good to go!)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a product to use post-shower for my naturally frizzy/poofy/wavy hair (Caucasian, brunette). I read a lot of reviews for this particular Sally Hershberger product, and I had previously used a Sally Hershberger heat protected spray on my hair that I liked a lot. So I decided to give it a try (I also bought the corresponding Sally Hershberger &#x27;Wavy Hair&#x27; shampoo &amp; conditioner). I used all three products for a couple of months (I&#x27;m still using them - however, I stopped using this style primer). I wasn&#x27;t really happy with the residue-y feeling that this product left in my hair. It wasn&#x27;t a greasy feeling, but it wasn&#x27;t a clean, fresh feeling, either and I didn&#x27;t like it. I felt like it weighed my hair down instead of giving it bounce, which is personally what I seek in curl/wave-enhancer. I also feel like however much I shook the bottle, the consistency of the actual foam was always really watery or something. It did smell nice, so there&#x27;s that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it wasn&#x27;t horrible and it might be great for some people, but it just wasn&#x27;t right for my hair.</li>
