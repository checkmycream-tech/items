            <li>it;s good but for colored girls you might want to add some shimmer to it or it will look ashy.</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing, I dropped it and it cracked</li>
            <li>Not an amazing thing.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing...</li>
            <li>It is light in weight which is great.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>The colors blend nicely and you can go darker if your skin tone  is darker.  </li>
            <li>was a gift, but apparently was the best gift he could do, she loved.</li>
            <li>This powder has a great texture, it&#x27;s very soft and feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li>Breaks very easily, too shimmery and orange for me</li>
            <li>Love the tones, looks great on my fair skin really brings out my colors.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprise how quickly it came in the mail.  </li>
            <li>And is very light weight</li>
            <li>I was hoping to get more of an effect with this product, but I didn&#x27;t accomplish that.</li>
            <li>Hmmm well can&#x27;t say the product is a great one for me not so much.  </li>
            <li>There has to be a better bronzer out there for me than this one.</li>
            <li>Love it...</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how much I love this</li>
            <li>Every time I use it somebody comments on how healthy I look</li>
            <li>I bought this on Amazon thanks to the great reviews</li>
            <li>I learned my lesson thats for sure.</li>
            <li>This is ok the color is ok.</li>
            <li>its ok.</li>
            <li>wish it had more of a shimmer.</li>
            <li>I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love this bronzer.  </li>
            <li>I love this powder.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it does not turn orange on me.  </li>
            <li>Love this product I use it in place of foundation</li>
            <li>There are lots of better options at the drugstore for bronzing, like the Loreal Face Powders, and this one didn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li>This product would be so much better for me</li>
            <li>if it had just been a bit more pigmented.</li>
            <li>I use this every day because I just love the glow it gives me.</li>
            <li>I look stunning.</li>
            <li>I need to buy 2 more just in case it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this wheel.</li>
            <li>i love this bronzer.</li>
            <li>I love this Bronzer.</li>
            <li>It is really easy to control how light or dark you want it to be, which is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Which is fine and</li>
            <li>My product arrived as DUST (which would be fine in some cases....</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and stays.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this one though and use it every day.</li>
            <li>It is perfect year round.  </li>
            <li>have light skin</li>
            <li>I fortunately did not have that problem.  </li>
            <li>how smooth it was going on to my skin.</li>
            <li>I also received several compliments on how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li>I apply a light amount and voila</li>
            <li>This stuff is nice but has to be reapplied and isn&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I get a nice sun kissed glow that is not too much.</li>
            <li>And I wanted the powder how I originally ordered it.</li>
            <li>Great, as expected.</li>
            <li>but photo is true to life.</li>
            <li>so maybe my familiarity should be exercised before I give a full opinion on the product.</li>
            <li>Has lots of pigment and color holds true all day.</li>
            <li>Powder is pretty finely milled and builds well, but a bit streaky if you use a denser brush like MUFE kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have pale or light skin and this works perfectly for me because it looks fairly natural.</li>
            <li>I just love my new york color wheel mosaic face power</li>
            <li>Really pretty bronzer!</li>
            <li>It came fast and it doesn&#x27;t look that cheap on.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s smooth and goes on really well.</li>
            <li>Gives a nice sun-kiss look without actually being in the sun.  </li>
            <li>I like it so far, the wheel is fun and interesting.</li>
            <li>But other than that it is an good product.</li>
            <li>and then when I tried to clean it up to use it the whole thing fell apart into the trash...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and light and you can&#x27;t mess up the application.  </li>
            <li>and I think it looks good on me---not to dark.</li>
            <li>Very decent color!</li>
            <li>I really like this, not much to say, it works, stays in the skin, good texture and mate which I like</li>
            <li>Not cakey...and blends pretty well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light and natural looking.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I love that you can go as light or as dark as you want.</li>
            <li>but I will buy from a store next time to see if my experience is better.</li>
            <li>cuz I couldn&#x27;t find the exact color at the drugstore.</li>
            <li>This bronzer is a good product, as I have used it in the past.  </li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not sure how good the product itself is.</li>
            <li>the price is very decent as well.</li>
            <li>not the most pigmented, I really have to swirl my brush in there to pick up the product and it seems to fade throughout the day, but I have long 10-12 hour work days...</li>
            <li>The shades in the mosaic have a lot of brown in them, however, when you swirl a brush in them they create a very natural looking peachy golden glow.</li>
            <li>If you have yellow undertones it could be a fine contourer.</li>
            <li>It was hoping for it to be a little darker, but the coverage is nice.</li>
            <li>re in control how deep or light the color needs to be.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>Very well packed</li>
            <li>But I did not see much color showing on my cheek bone.</li>
            <li>The whole thing cracks.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>I got it to try to copy her look and while that didn&#x27;t really turn out well, it&#x27;s become a staple in my make up box.</li>
            <li>Very well made product.</li>
            <li>I could&#x27;ve spent twice more and not been any happier.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Lo&#x27;real face powders or even NYC bronzer in Sunny before I would by this one again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how nicely tan</li>
            <li>beautiful bronze effect, especially in the winter when there is hardly any sun.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>For an inexpensive bronzer, this is decent.  </li>
            <li>It looks very natural on me and I can control how much I apply.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually iffy about new makeup because I have super sensitive skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li>I have a light to medium complexion, so it might be a little dark for very light skin.</li>
            <li>Obviously, I was excited to finally try the ABH kit since there&#x27;s so much buzz about it.  </li>
            <li>I sent an email and all i wanted was a new one</li>
            <li>/&gt;This has become my new go to product before I leave the house.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll be searching for a new bronzer today.</li>
            <li>just need a new container.</li>
            <li>But once it&#x27;s on it looks really nice and subtle.</li>
            <li>Very natural and blended look once applied - Youa</li>
            <li>Very natural.</li>
            <li>I have an olive complexion but it is on the lighter side meaning I have to be very modest with the amount I use.  </li>
            <li>not very dry and the color is pretty natural.</li>
            <li>Luckily it&#x27;s pretty darn cheap--gets an extra star for the value.</li>
            <li>As many other have stated, this item is not packaged properly before shipping!  </li>
            <li>The colors are pretty but the powder cracked shortly after I received it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good subtle color when mixed together, I quite like it.</li>
            <li>You can make bronze as light or as dark as you wish!</li>
            <li>You have to brush back and forth little more times.</li>
            <li>It had completely blended together to the point it looked like cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>I use a kabuki brush to apply it around my face and for contours and so far it has held up well.</li>
            <li>I really am just starting off with bronzing and contouring</li>
            <li>Received this completely shattered.</li>
            <li>and it was as mention soft to my skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s decent, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li>I believe this cheap face powder does the &amp;#34;contouring job&amp;#34; as equally fina as the ABH kit, for less money.</li>
            <li>It was packaged normal with bubble wrap and what not, but the fragile compressed powders can&#x27;t handle shipping.</li>
            <li>its not too heavy and gives a nice little glow to my face</li>
            <li>but don&#x27;t really see a big difference from when I did not wear the bronzer I will be looking for different ones.  </li>
            <li>I use a big old face brush to apply.  </li>
            <li>I barely got any bronzing effect on my cheek bones, and sometimes I felt as if I was applying nothing to my face at all.</li>
            <li>I bought this powder due to some YouTube beauty bloggers hyping this on their channels, so I decided to give this a shot since it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my wallet that much.</li>
            <li>Light and goes on subtle.</li>
            <li>I definitely ordered from the same vendor as they were prompt and professional.</li>
            <li>I received mine with a cracked lid that had a huge hole in the middle of it and the broken parts of the lid had dug into the bronzer.  </li>

            <li> There are lots of better options at the drugstore for bronzing, like the Loreal Face Powders, and this one didn&#x27;t cut it for me.</li>
            <li> This product would be so much better for me</li>
            <li> if it had just been a bit more pigmented.</li>
            <li> I use this every day because I just love the glow it gives me.</li>
            <li> I look stunning.</li>
            <li> I need to buy 2 more just in case it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wheel.</li>
            <li> i love this bronzer.</li>
            <li> I love this Bronzer.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to control how light or dark you want it to be, which is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Which is fine and</li>
            <li> My product arrived as DUST (which would be fine in some cases....</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth and stays.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this one though and use it every day.</li>
            <li> It is perfect year round.  </li>
            <li> have light skin</li>
            <li> I fortunately did not have that problem.  </li>
            <li> how smooth it was going on to my skin.</li>
            <li> I also received several compliments on how great my skin looked.</li>
            <li> I apply a light amount and voila</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice but has to be reapplied and isn&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I get a nice sun kissed glow that is not too much.</li>
            <li> And I wanted the powder how I originally ordered it.</li>
            <li> Great, as expected.</li>
            <li> but photo is true to life.</li>
            <li> so maybe my familiarity should be exercised before I give a full opinion on the product.</li>
            <li> Has lots of pigment and color holds true all day.</li>
            <li> Powder is pretty finely milled and builds well, but a bit streaky if you use a denser brush like MUFE kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have pale or light skin and this works perfectly for me because it looks fairly natural.</li>
            <li> I just love my new york color wheel mosaic face power</li>
            <li> Really pretty bronzer!</li>
            <li> It came fast and it doesn&#x27;t look that cheap on.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s smooth and goes on really well.</li>
            <li> Gives a nice sun-kiss look without actually being in the sun.  </li>
            <li> I like it so far, the wheel is fun and interesting.</li>
            <li> But other than that it is an good product.</li>
            <li> and then when I tried to clean it up to use it the whole thing fell apart into the trash...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and light and you can&#x27;t mess up the application.  </li>
            <li> and I think it looks good on me---not to dark.</li>
            <li> Very decent color!</li>
            <li> I really like this, not much to say, it works, stays in the skin, good texture and mate which I like</li>
            <li> Not cakey...and blends pretty well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love that you can go as light or as dark as you want.</li>
            <li> but I will buy from a store next time to see if my experience is better.</li>
            <li> cuz I couldn&#x27;t find the exact color at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> This bronzer is a good product, as I have used it in the past.  </li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure how good the product itself is.</li>
            <li> the price is very decent as well.</li>
            <li> not the most pigmented, I really have to swirl my brush in there to pick up the product and it seems to fade throughout the day, but I have long 10-12 hour work days...</li>
            <li> The shades in the mosaic have a lot of brown in them, however, when you swirl a brush in them they create a very natural looking peachy golden glow.</li>
            <li> If you have yellow undertones it could be a fine contourer.</li>
            <li> It was hoping for it to be a little darker, but the coverage is nice.</li>
            <li> re in control how deep or light the color needs to be.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> Very well packed</li>
            <li> But I did not see much color showing on my cheek bone.</li>
            <li> The whole thing cracks.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> I got it to try to copy her look and while that didn&#x27;t really turn out well, it&#x27;s become a staple in my make up box.</li>
            <li> Very well made product.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve spent twice more and not been any happier.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Lo&#x27;real face powders or even NYC bronzer in Sunny before I would by this one again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how nicely tan</li>
            <li> beautiful bronze effect, especially in the winter when there is hardly any sun.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive bronzer, this is decent.  </li>
            <li> It looks very natural on me and I can control how much I apply.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually iffy about new makeup because I have super sensitive skin that breaks out easily.</li>
            <li> I have a light to medium complexion, so it might be a little dark for very light skin.</li>
            <li> Obviously, I was excited to finally try the ABH kit since there&#x27;s so much buzz about it.  </li>
            <li> I sent an email and all i wanted was a new one</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has become my new go to product before I leave the house.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll be searching for a new bronzer today.</li>
            <li> just need a new container.</li>
            <li> But once it&#x27;s on it looks really nice and subtle.</li>
            <li> Very natural and blended look once applied - Youa</li>
            <li> Very natural.</li>
            <li> I have an olive complexion but it is on the lighter side meaning I have to be very modest with the amount I use.  </li>
            <li> not very dry and the color is pretty natural.</li>
            <li> Luckily it&#x27;s pretty darn cheap--gets an extra star for the value.</li>
            <li> As many other have stated, this item is not packaged properly before shipping!  </li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but the powder cracked shortly after I received it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good subtle color when mixed together, I quite like it.</li>
            <li> You can make bronze as light or as dark as you wish!</li>
            <li> You have to brush back and forth little more times.</li>
            <li> It had completely blended together to the point it looked like cocoa powder.</li>
            <li> I use a kabuki brush to apply it around my face and for contours and so far it has held up well.</li>
            <li> I really am just starting off with bronzing and contouring</li>
            <li> Received this completely shattered.</li>
            <li> and it was as mention soft to my skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s decent, especially considering the price.  </li>
            <li> I believe this cheap face powder does the &amp;#34;contouring job&amp;#34; as equally fina as the ABH kit, for less money.</li>
            <li> It was packaged normal with bubble wrap and what not, but the fragile compressed powders can&#x27;t handle shipping.</li>
            <li> its not too heavy and gives a nice little glow to my face</li>
            <li> but don&#x27;t really see a big difference from when I did not wear the bronzer I will be looking for different ones.  </li>
            <li> I use a big old face brush to apply.  </li>
            <li> I barely got any bronzing effect on my cheek bones, and sometimes I felt as if I was applying nothing to my face at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this powder due to some YouTube beauty bloggers hyping this on their channels, so I decided to give this a shot since it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my wallet that much.</li>
            <li> Light and goes on subtle.</li>
            <li> I definitely ordered from the same vendor as they were prompt and professional.</li>
            <li> I received mine with a cracked lid that had a huge hole in the middle of it and the broken parts of the lid had dug into the bronzer.  </li>
            <li> When i received the powder, it was so broken i couldnt even see the original pattern .</li>
            <li> Other powders are so expensive this works better then</li>
            <li> I have light skin so a lot of bronzers look silly on me.</li>
            <li> I will always use this product for as long as it&#x27;s around.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s been on the self for too long.  </li>
            <li> Seemed a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> I do like this powder, though I think the color is a little red for me like a terra-cotta.</li>
            <li> it gives me a little summer glow in the middle of the winter.  </li>
            <li> I was very exited about it, but it was broken, i am dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday for daily wear...</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned, this product does not stay together during the shipping process.  </li>
            <li> (mac NW 22, neutral-pink undertones)--better than orange but not right.</li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected.</li>
            <li> but I wish it didn&#x27;t apply onto the skin so dark.</li>
            <li> and I used the dark colors from the this NYC wheel mosaic face powder</li>
            <li> Looks too dark and unnatural.</li>
            <li> Product came completely in pieces and broken.</li>
            <li> Other than that, I like the minimal pigmentation, not too much as I am very pale.</li>
            <li> Product arrived in pieces in powdery mess.</li>
            <li> I use it for blush and a little on my forehead and contour of my face for an all-over bronzed look...especially in the summer.  </li>
            <li> When I received mine it was completely broken and mixed up to the point where it was basically all one color (like cocoa powder - as a previous person described it).  </li>
            <li> Most also have a pink undertone which I hate!</li>
            <li> But unfortunetly spilled when arrived, but still using it everyday and now can&#x27;t imagine my day without it.</li>
            <li> Alas it was a deep terracotta on me</li>
            <li> I need to buy another one because I just dropped this one a few days ago.  </li>
            <li> I am not gay or anything I use this when I get pictures taken and when I go out.</li>
            <li> It makes my pale complection look bronzed for the gods.</li>
            <li> not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> I dropped this on the thin edge after a few weeks and everything shattered past fixing.</li>
            <li> I use a small dusting with a brush- forehead, cheeks, under chin!</li>
            <li> When I recieved it, it was kindof broken up and now it has broken up into little pieces</li>
            <li> I know some reviews noted that theirs was broken when it arrived.  </li>
            <li> The one that I ordered arrived broken</li>
            <li> When I received this package everything was broken.</li>
            <li> The product came to me broken in pieces</li>
            <li> When its dilever to me it was broken</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very thin compact.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am sad :(&lt;br /&gt;i am so sad :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t completely hate the product</li>
            <li> Very poor packing!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the best bronze ever!!</li>
            <li> I use this as a bronzer daily. I was hoping to get more of an effect with this product, but I didn&#x27;t accomplish that. For the price, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and it lasts forever!  It has been months since I purchased it.  It is a great color for blondes.</li>
            <li> Hmmm well can&#x27;t say the product is a great one for me not so much.  I used it maybe 3 times since I got it but don&#x27;t really see a big difference from when I did not wear the bronzer I will be looking for different ones.  I don&#x27;t think I will purchase this again.  There has to be a better bronzer out there for me than this one.</li>
            <li> I was very exited about it, but it was broken, i am dissapointed.</li>
            <li> A little darker than I expected. It&#x27;s nice but I wish it didn&#x27;t apply onto the skin so dark.</li>
            <li> Love it...I use it everyday for daily wear...and it&#x27;s perfect for my needs. Not cakey...and blends pretty well.</li>
            <li> Love this product! I use it all over my face as a bronzer.  Gives a nice sun-kiss look without actually being in the sun.  I&#x27;ve gotten a few compliments on how nicely tan I look when I wear it.  I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how much I love this, it makes you glow. Every time I use it somebody comments on how healthy I look, It is great! I use a small dusting with a brush- forehead, cheeks, under chin!</li>
            <li> Really pretty bronzer!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted...</li>
            <li> not the most pigmented, I really have to swirl my brush in there to pick up the product and it seems to fade throughout the day, but I have long 10-12 hour work days...But once it&#x27;s on it looks really nice and subtle. It&#x27;s decent, especially considering the price.  **edit** this is around $3-5 at the drugstore and I paid about $3 for it on Amazon, just fyi...</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t tell when it&#x27;s on. I am not gay or anything I use this when I get pictures taken and when I go out. It makes skin look flawless. It&#x27;s amazing. I&#x27;m very light skinned and it makes my skin look amazing!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Was worried about the shade of this but it is perfect.  Thought it might look different than photo but photo is true to life. It goes on smooth and stays.  You can make bronze as light or as dark as you wish!</li>
            <li> This review is not about the product itself but the condition of the product when it was received. I bought this on Amazon thanks to the great reviews but my advice- GET IT SOMEWHERE ELSE . When i received the powder, it was so broken i couldnt even see the original pattern . It had completely blended together to the point it looked like cocoa powder. I sent an email and all i wanted was a new one but the company offered to pay me my money back just to keep it. Which is fine and all but I wanted the powder! And I wanted the powder how I originally ordered it. I am very fair skinned so when it mixed together it does nothing for me. What am I going to do with it except throw it away ? I learned my lesson thats for sure.</li>
            <li> It was hoping for it to be a little darker, but the coverage is nice. It&#x27;s really light and natural looking.</li>
            <li> This is ok the color is ok. When I recieved it, it was kindof broken up and now it has broken up into little pieces and I can&#x27;t even use it anymore. But other than that it is an good product.</li>
            <li> Looks great and covers well. But unfortunetly spilled when arrived, but still using it everyday and now can&#x27;t imagine my day without it.</li>
            <li> I do like this powder, though I think the color is a little red for me like a terra-cotta. Still works great as a blush and for the temple area but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend for any contouring.</li>
            <li> Very Good. Recomended!!! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great as a bronzer and a blush.  Very natural and blended look once applied - Youa re in control how deep or light the color needs to be.  Very natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d planned to use this for contouring and hoped it would be sort of shadowy, ashy bronze/taupe, like Nars Laguna. Alas it was a deep terracotta on me (mac NW 22, neutral-pink undertones)--better than orange but not right. If you have yellow undertones it could be a fine contourer. And of course it&#x27;s a solid bronzer for all light-to-medium shades. Powder is pretty finely milled and builds well, but a bit streaky if you use a denser brush like MUFE kabuki.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re butterfingers like me, be warned. I dropped this on the thin edge after a few weeks and everything shattered past fixing. Luckily it&#x27;s pretty darn cheap--gets an extra star for the value.</li>
            <li> It makes my pale complection look bronzed for the gods. Beautiful, light, and makes you look great all day.</li>
            <li> this is the most amazing bronzer ever! its not too heavy and gives a nice little glow to my face</li>
            <li> When I received my color wheel it was smashed all up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually iffy about new makeup because I have super sensitive skin that breaks out easily. Most also have a pink undertone which I hate! However I&#x27;m in love with this bronzer! And for the price you definitely can&#x27;t go wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has become my new go to product before I leave the house. I love that you can go as light or as dark as you want. Does not look cakey or as though I have mud on my face. Blends in well and gives that nice sun kissed glow without looking &amp;#34;baked&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Product arrived in pieces in powdery mess. All the colors were mixed. I cant use it, It just sits there in my wardrobe not sure what to do with it.</li>
            <li> I have brown skin and this bronzer on my skin is like a powder. its ok. wish it had more of a shimmer. I mix it with my blush to give it the effect I want. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing, I dropped it and it cracked and I wanted to cry.  I definitely ordered from the same vendor as they were prompt and professional.</li>
            <li> As many other have stated, this item is not packaged properly before shipping!  I received mine with a cracked lid that had a huge hole in the middle of it and the broken parts of the lid had dug into the bronzer.  If it was for me I would have kept it and tossed it in my make up case.  I bought this for my daughter who is a dancer and I didn&#x27;t want the bronzer getting all over her dance stuff so I sent it back.  I guess I&#x27;ll be searching for a new bronzer today.</li>
            <li> was a gift, but apparently was the best gift he could do, she loved. no se que más escribir, no lo uso.</li>
            <li> SO PERFECT! THANKS I WILL BUYING MORE PRODUCTS IN YOUR STORE</li>
            <li> Great, as expected. Very well packed</li>
            <li> I have light skin so a lot of bronzers look silly on me. I really enjoy this one though and use it every day. It is really easy to control how light or dark you want it to be, which is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I like it so far, the wheel is fun and interesting. But I did not see much color showing on my cheek bone. You have to brush back and forth little more times.</li>
            <li> beautiful bronze effect, especially in the winter when there is hardly any sun. I don&#x27;t have pale or light skin and this works perfectly for me because it looks fairly natural. I use a kabuki brush to apply it around my face and for contours and so far it has held up well.</li>
            <li> Light and goes on subtle. Love it. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> Good...my wife loves it!</li>
            <li> I love this bronzer.  It is perfect year round.  I use it for blush and a little on my forehead and contour of my face for an all-over bronzed look...especially in the summer.  I have a light to medium complexion, so it might be a little dark for very light skin.</li>
            <li> I love this powder.  Problem is I drop stuff all the time and once you drop this, it&#x27;s done for.  The whole thing cracks.  But the product itself blends perfect.  I use a big old face brush to apply.  It&#x27;s nice and light and you can&#x27;t mess up the application.  I need to buy another one because I just dropped this one a few days ago.  I wish they could figure out a way to package it safer for klutzes like me.  The price is perfect!  just need a new container.</li>
            <li> Breaks very easily, too shimmery and orange for me</li>
            <li> Product came completely in pieces and broken. Very poor packing!!</li>
            <li> Good bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this from Amazon, and unlike others it arrived in one piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have light skin so I use this as a bronzer.  It&#x27;s a good subtle color when mixed together, I quite like it.</li>
            <li> Not an amazing thing. I feel like a powder in my face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good but it seems warmer looking online. I really am just starting off with bronzing and contouring so maybe my familiarity should be exercised before I give a full opinion on the product. It came fast and it doesn&#x27;t look that cheap on. it;s good but for colored girls you might want to add some shimmer to it or it will look ashy.</li>
            <li> Received this completely shattered. Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> I found this from a Youtube video. The girl used this as a transition color under the eyebrow I got it to try to copy her look and while that didn&#x27;t really turn out well, it&#x27;s become a staple in my make up box. I like makeup I forgot is on my face, it&#x27;s smooth and goes on really well. Great find!</li>
            <li> For an inexpensive bronzer, this is decent.  I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.  I love the fact it does not turn orange on me.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Came smashed, but i&#x27;ll blame that on delivery. Other than that, I like the minimal pigmentation, not too much as I am very pale. Nice product!</li>
            <li> Gotta have some bronzer to boost them cheek bones. Best price and great quality.</li>
            <li> As other people have mentioned, this product does not stay together during the shipping process.  When I received mine it was completely broken and mixed up to the point where it was basically all one color (like cocoa powder - as a previous person described it).  I have an olive complexion but it is on the lighter side meaning I have to be very modest with the amount I use.  I don&#x27;t completely hate the product but I will buy from a store next time to see if my experience is better.</li>
            <li> Love this product I use it in place of foundation and it is amazing... Coverage is great and makes for a flawless look...</li>
            <li> I know some reviews noted that theirs was broken when it arrived.  I fortunately did not have that problem.  It was packed well and arrived intake.  I like that it gives me a little summer glow in the middle of the winter.  The colors blend nicely and you can go darker if your skin tone  is darker.  I have very fair skin and I think it looks good on me---not to dark.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend loved it she says &amp;#34;the variety of colors is the best&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This bronzer is a good product, as I have used it in the past.  The one that I ordered arrived broken so I didn&#x27;t get to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at a drugstore because it was on sale. About the same time, I bought the Anastasia Beverly Hills contour kit at Sephora.  Obviously, I was excited to finally try the ABH kit since there&#x27;s so much buzz about it.  Well, I am no makeup pro, I must clarify but I believe it&#x27;s just meh. Nothing out of this world.  One day, I was in a hurry and I used the dark colors from the this NYC wheel mosaic face powder and I replicated the contour instructions with this. I believe this cheap face powder does the &amp;#34;contouring job&amp;#34; as equally fina as the ABH kit, for less money. I dropped my NYC and it smashed in pieces so I ordered it thru amazon cuz I couldn&#x27;t find the exact color at the drugstore.</li>
            <li> Very well made product. Has lots of pigment and color holds true all day. I could&#x27;ve spent twice more and not been any happier. Will re-order.</li>
            <li> I really like this, not much to say, it works, stays in the skin, good texture and mate which I like</li>
            <li> While the product is great, I always buy it in stores - I dont recommend getting it online.  My product arrived as DUST (which would be fine in some cases....but it&#x27;s not what I ordered!)  It was packaged normal with bubble wrap and what not, but the fragile compressed powders can&#x27;t handle shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the tones, looks great on my fair skin really brings out my colors.  Great bang for the buck!!  Other powders are so expensive this works better then any others I have tried.</li>
            <li> When I received this package everything was broken. So I&#x27;m not sure how good the product itself is. So yeah.</li>
            <li> I bought this powder due to some YouTube beauty bloggers hyping this on their channels, so I decided to give this a shot since it wouldn&#x27;t hurt my wallet that much. As a woman with medium skin tone, I bought this with the intentions of using it as a bronzing powder, not an actual face setting powder. This powder has a great texture, it&#x27;s very soft and feels great on the skin. But, it&#x27;s not pigmented enough for me. I barely got any bronzing effect on my cheek bones, and sometimes I felt as if I was applying nothing to my face at all. There are lots of better options at the drugstore for bronzing, like the Loreal Face Powders, and this one didn&#x27;t cut it for me. This product would be so much better for me if it had just been a bit more pigmented. It&#x27;s not the worst bronzing powder I&#x27;ve tried from a drugstore brand, but it&#x27;s not the best. I would recommend the Lo&#x27;real face powders or even NYC bronzer in Sunny before I would by this one again.</li>
            <li> I just received my Mosaic Face Powder yesterday. I was pleasantly surprise how quickly it came in the mail.  The package was well pack not to be damage and came in perfect condition. It is light in weight which is great. I was extra surprise how smooth it was going on to my skin. The colors in the mosaic palate are perfect to fit my skin colors. And, I am medium in my skin complexion, and it looks great. What I believe you get in this product is everything written in the description. I actually apply it last night for a function I attended and it was as mention soft to my skin, I didn’t have an oily face during the night. And I did not have to reapply during the evening, how great is that. I also received several compliments on how great my skin looked. I will be purchasing this Mosaic Face Powder again when it runs low.</li>
            <li> I use this every day because I just love the glow it gives me. I apply a light amount and voila I look stunning. I need to buy 2 more just in case it gets discontinued.</li>
            <li> the color is perfect ..but it breaks so easily.&lt;br /&gt;i used only one week&lt;br /&gt;i am sad :(&lt;br /&gt;i am so sad :(</li>
            <li> The product came to me broken in pieces and then when I tried to clean it up to use it the whole thing fell apart into the trash...</li>
            <li> Looks too dark and unnatural.</li>
            <li> Great product, I use it in place of liquid makeup!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is nice but has to be reapplied and isn&#x27;t very pigmented.</li>
            <li> Very decent color! Love it! not very dry and the color is pretty natural. the price is very decent as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this wheel. It fits my tone so well. And is very light weight</li>
            <li> i love this bronzer. i use it all over my face since i have brown skin. it gives me the sunkissed glow. would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this Bronzer. You just can&#x27;t beat the price and it&#x27;s a great product. It&#x27;s easy to apply and the shade is perfect. I get a nice sun kissed glow that is not too much. I will always use this product for as long as it&#x27;s around. I highly recommend. The best beauty buy ever.</li>
            <li> When its dilever to me it was broken</li>
            <li> Seemed a bit dry.  I do not want to buy this again.  I think it&#x27;s been on the self for too long.  It&#x27;s a very thin compact.</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty but the powder cracked shortly after I received it.</li>
            <li> I just love my new york color wheel mosaic face power</li>
            <li> Great Bronzer, great coverage.</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant to buy this NYC Color Wheel Mosaic Face Powder in All Over Bronze Glow because I am very fair. The shades in the mosaic have a lot of brown in them, however, when you swirl a brush in them they create a very natural looking peachy golden glow. It looks very natural on me and I can control how much I apply. This is a great product and value.</li>
