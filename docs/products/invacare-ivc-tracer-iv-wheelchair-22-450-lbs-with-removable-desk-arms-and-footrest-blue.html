            <li>finally, GOOD LUCK in finding replacement parts!!!!!</li>
            <li>So I ordered it and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>you see those football players sitting on the sidelines what do you think they have up to there face, to get the best performance on the field...</li>
            <li>This one is 22in (used 24in in the hospital), and it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li>Great chair and great price.</li>
            <li>Great chair.</li>
            <li>Very nice chair.</li>
            <li>Works great and is fairly comfortable</li>
            <li>I then looked it up and realized I could own the chair for what it would cost me to rent for 10 weeks and</li>
            <li>Considering the weight capacity it is fairly lightweight and is easy to load/unload from the vehicle.  </li>
            <li>very easy rolling and well built.</li>
            <li>The wheelchair itself is comfortable, but it doesn&#x27;t do me any good if I can&#x27;t take it anywhere with me.  </li>
            <li>I thought it was an easy decision!</li>
            <li>This wheelchair is great...easy to push and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>It is lighter weight than many of the chairs with this kind of weight capacity, and is quite easy to get around even in a cluttered indoor enviroment.</li>
            <li>My doctor wanted me to be evaluated by a specialist that ends up recommending the appropriate chair.  </li>
            <li>The higher and wider design along with sharper edges, cause more rubbing and catching on household items...</li>
            <li>It is sturdy and comfortable.</li>
            <li>Also, the wheels appear a bit cheap, however we have not had any problems.  </li>
            <li>But comfortable, easier than my transfer chair for others to push.</li>
            <li>because I needed something light in weight.  </li>
            <li>My father has been using the chair since December and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Originally bought this for a friend to use during a vacation (for the places his scooter could not go).</li>
            <li>both sidearm wheel guards (new plastic design) have cracked and I now keep catching my hands on these edges of the cracked plastic......</li>
            <li>Rolls very well on most surfaces.</li>
            <li>The chair arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, after compressing the chromed Handrims here and there, cutting threads, all is done, now fits great, and looks great.  </li>
            <li>It is plenty wide, but seems like if it had a bit more depth it would be more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>So other than the OEM mislabeling, and a bit of a hassle to get the right Handrims and the conversion install, the seller came through, and our chair works and looks great.</li>
            <li>Since I weigh 315 pounds it really was easy to determine I needed a chair with the specifications of this one.  </li>
            <li>The chair is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Since the price was right</li>
            <li>The HD version of the Tracer IV is by far the most satisfactory match with my particular needs.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>although my physical height and weight have remained the same for many years, I do sag more toward the floor.)</li>
            <li>The wheels are heavy duty and add a good look to the chair.</li>
            <li>Aside from the adjustable foot rests it comes fully assembled and ready to go.  </li>
            <li>Fits in the back of my 2009 Handa Fit Sport.</li>
            <li>It is very well constructed.</li>
            <li>This chair was advertised at 38 lbs., but is much heavier than that.  </li>
            <li>The wheelchair is for my wife, and she is now much happier also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(why don&#x27;t they design the seats on these things to fit a normal human body).</li>
            <li>Overall however, this wheelchair is top quality, well built, extra heavy rubber wheels that roll smoothly, good chroming of the metal, the dual cross-member bracing underneath is strong, the seat and back material is quality commercial grade.  </li>
            <li>After having my left leg amputated and passing through a number of different facilities, I have had the opportunity to experience many differnt makes and models of wheelchairs.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say that it is worth it.  </li>

            <li> if you get the extra padding, other was the backside gets tired real quick</li>
            <li> small footnote herein - the Chromed Handrims utilize steel threaded inserts pressed into the Handrims themselves, with metal spacers and #10x32 machine screws to attach the Handrims to the Wheels themselves vs. the Black Plastic Handrims utilizing a #10 hex head sheet metal type screw directly into the plastic for attaching Handrims to the Wheels (obviously faster production and cost cutting) but does eliminate the otherwise necessary precise alignment of threaded inserts to the holes in the main wheels.  </li>

            <li> Chair is sturdy and fairly heavy, close to 50 lbs.</li>
            <li> 27th 2013,  Only 8 months later, I still feel disappointed with this</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The chair arrived quickly. It is sturdy and comfortable. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Will review again after some time in use. My mother is in this chair all day so we will know how it stands up in 6 months. The brake handles could be a little bigger. The footrests are plastic so I&#x27;ll wait and see how they stand up. Chair is sturdy and fairly heavy, close to 50 lbs.</li>
            <li> I was very nervous about purchasing this chair without having a chance to see the actual product.  Since the price was right and I gave it a go.  Overall, I would say that it is worth it.  My father has been using the chair since December and so far so good.  Considering the weight capacity it is fairly lightweight and is easy to load/unload from the vehicle.  Aside from the adjustable foot rests it comes fully assembled and ready to go.  The only cons I have seen so far are that the seat is a bit shallow for a heavier person.  It is plenty wide, but seems like if it had a bit more depth it would be more comfortable.  Also, the wheels appear a bit cheap, however we have not had any problems.  All in all, I would recommend without hesitation, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> A bit too hard to roll by myself over carpet. But comfortable, easier than my transfer chair for others to push. Fits in the back of my 2009 Handa Fit Sport.</li>
            <li> the chair is perfect I purchased this for my son. it arrivied  on the day I was told it would  and there was nothing to  assemble. I would recommend  this to anyone. I am very happy.</li>
            <li> My chair arrived today and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it. It is very well constructed. The wheels are heavy duty and add a good look to the chair. I like the way that it doesn&#x27;t sit real &#x27;deep&#x27; as that makes it easier to sit at a desk and work or sit up at the sink to do dishes.</li>
            <li> Had less than four months and the seat is already stretched out and I an sitting on the cross bars.  It is very rough on my spinal stenosis.  Have order another seat pad that will hopefully be thick enough for protection.</li>
            <li> After having my left leg amputated and passing through a number of different facilities, I have had the opportunity to experience many differnt makes and models of wheelchairs. The HD version of the Tracer IV is by far the most satisfactory match with my particular needs. It is lighter weight than many of the chairs with this kind of weight capacity, and is quite easy to get around even in a cluttered indoor enviroment.</li>
            <li> Ordered this new chair Feb 3rd, 2013. I have bought a new INVACARE TRACER IV every three years for the past 15 years along with 3 used ones that I have no idea of their age. I usually put the newest in my suburban for travel to medical appointments, but because of the amount of plastic used in the framework of this newest chair, I was concerned that the temperature extreems in a parked vehicle may effect the durability of the frame parts, I therefore replaced my everyday chair used in my home with the new chair.&lt;br /&gt;Sept. 27th 2013,  Only 8 months later, I still feel disappointed with this purchase.&lt;br /&gt;The first complaint is the newer raised design of the cross bracing under the seat caused me to sit directly on the hard cross brace, OK I purchased a 3&amp;#34; thick gel cushion...&lt;br /&gt;The second complaint, the longer front wheel forks are causing much more damage to door frames and woodwork than all of the previous chairs that I have used. The higher and wider design along with sharper edges, cause more rubbing and catching on household items...&lt;br /&gt;The third complaint, due to the required use of the 3&amp;#34; thick gel cushion, and possibility of shape changes on my part (although my physical height and weight have remained the same for many years, I do sag more toward the floor.) both sidearm wheel guards (new plastic design) have cracked and I now keep catching my hands on these edges of the cracked plastic...... have tried to pad or tape edges... only lasts a few days and causes an ugly mess on both hands, clothing and chair wheels.&lt;br /&gt;The fourth complaint, the old chairs that I use outside and in garage have stickers proudly stating &amp;#34;Made in the USA&amp;#34;. This plastic infused cheaper version of INVACARE has a sticker &amp;#34;MADE in MEXICO&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, GOOD LUCK in finding replacement parts!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big guy, so was looking for a solid wheelchair when I got home from rehab. This one is 22in (used 24in in the hospital), and it&#x27;s just great. A fraction of the cost compared to a medical supply store . . . very easy rolling and well built. Not a huge fan of the plastic foot rests, but they seem solid enough.</li>
            <li> This is the third Invacre chair that I have purchased. The chair is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I used this wheelchair on vacation to Alaska.  It held me and all our luggage going from place to place.</li>
            <li> Blew out my achillies tendon.  Resulting in surgery 6 weeks in cast and 6 weeks in boot.  Doctor gave me script to rent a wheelchair.  I did for 4 weeks.  It was this chair.  I then looked it up and realized I could own the chair for what it would cost me to rent for 10 weeks and that is with my insurance paying half.  So I ordered it and am very happy with it.  Great chair and great price.</li>
            <li> there is nothing wrong with this chair. I use to do wheelies in a chair like this to entertain people in hospitals, grater chair if you get the extra padding, other was the backside gets tired real quick, you can also get the oxygen bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; you see those football players sitting on the sidelines what do you think they have up to there face, to get the best performance on the field...</li>
            <li> Great chair. Price. And shipping!</li>
            <li> this has been a godsend to my father as he is elderly and can&#x27;t get around as well as he used to.</li>
            <li> This chair was advertised at 38 lbs., but is much heavier than that.  One &amp;#34;able-bodied&amp;#34; person cannot lift it into my vehicle.  It was even difficult for 2 people to lift it, so I am unable to take it anywhere.  Purchased this one over two other ones that said they weighed close to 100 lbs. because I needed something light in weight.  However, I would guess that this one probably weighs closer to 100 lbs as well.  It is basically unusable to me if I can&#x27;t take it anywhere as I don&#x27;t need a wheelchair in my house.  The wheelchair itself is comfortable, but it doesn&#x27;t do me any good if I can&#x27;t take it anywhere with me.  I am in the process of trying to return it to ProChoice Medical, but they have not responded to my email or Amazon&#x27;s email on my behalf.</li>
            <li> Originally bought this for a friend to use during a vacation (for the places his scooter could not go). It ended up being used by all 3 of us (different times - different reasons) before all was said &amp; done. Rolls very well on most surfaces. Very nice chair.</li>
            <li> I looked at this chair at all of the local area medical supply stores and did not find one for less that $900.  The price I paid was just unbelievable ($345).  My doctor wanted me to be evaluated by a specialist that ends up recommending the appropriate chair.  This evaluation would have carried a total cost of about $1,000 to be paid by me and the insurance company.  Since I weigh 315 pounds it really was easy to determine I needed a chair with the specifications of this one.  Why cause over $1,000 in costs in order to purchase a product costing $345?  I thought it was an easy decision!</li>
            <li> I need a wheelchair for any walking longer than a block.  This wheelchair is great...easy to push and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Works great and is fairly comfortable (why don&#x27;t they design the seats on these things to fit a normal human body). The only complaint is one of the big wheels is a little tough to turn. I haven&#x27;t messed with it yet but my caretaker said he thinks it&#x27;s bent a little bit, probably from shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a bigger (but not huge) chair I would recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Received this new wheelchair some ten days ago.  The ad \\&quot;states and shows\\&quot; the unit as having Chromed Handrims.  Upon receipt of the large shipping box, with the manufactures contents Label on the outside of the box clearly stated this unit as having Chromed Handrims.  However, after removing the wheelchair from the shipping box, the new chair had \\&quot;black hard plastic\\&quot; Handrims!  Disappointing!  Contacted the seller, and after a few back and forth messages (they had to truly verify our desire to have the Handrims as advertised) - the seller \\&quot;Medical For You\\&quot; has followed through, and as of yesterday we received a pair of Chromed Handrims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small footnote herein - the Chromed Handrims utilize steel threaded inserts pressed into the Handrims themselves, with metal spacers and #10x32 machine screws to attach the Handrims to the Wheels themselves vs. the Black Plastic Handrims utilizing a #10 hex head sheet metal type screw directly into the plastic for attaching Handrims to the Wheels (obviously faster production and cost cutting) but does eliminate the otherwise necessary precise alignment of threaded inserts to the holes in the main wheels.  In my case, a couple of the threaded inserts did NOT line up exactly with the fastening holes in the chairs main wheels - off by just a small angle or amount.  Two inserts did not even have threads cut into them - however I cut threads with a 10x32 tap.  Bottom line, after compressing the chromed Handrims here and there, cutting threads, all is done, now fits great, and looks great.  The wheelchair is for my wife, and she is now much happier also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason for the detail in this review is in case anyone else should encounter the same situation.  The problems were NOT the fault of the seller, but of the manufacturer -you know- how things have become.  Overall however, this wheelchair is top quality, well built, extra heavy rubber wheels that roll smoothly, good chroming of the metal, the dual cross-member bracing underneath is strong, the seat and back material is quality commercial grade.  After spending much time looking and examining other wheelchair brands and models, this brand and model is worth every penny.  So other than the OEM mislabeling, and a bit of a hassle to get the right Handrims and the conversion install, the seller came through, and our chair works and looks great.</li>
