            <li>It didn&#x27;t give my lips a rash or a need to continue to over-use it, by drying them out like most lip balms.</li>
            <li>I wanted something that gave a bit of color, but worked more as a balm.  </li>

            <li>Everything about this lip drink balm is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Lip Drink is soothing, smooth, and everything I want in a lip balm.  </li>
            <li>A tip that works for me, I use a cotton pad - dampen it with warm water - put one drop of jojoba oil on it - and scrub (lightly and gently) the lips before applying any lip balm.</li>
            <li>THis is my new favorite lip balm!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding good lip balms, another good one is Melvita&#x27;s lip balm.</li>
            <li>It has a cool container</li>
            <li>Thicker and more pasty than the older version.</li>
            <li>Seems to stay on better then most of the similar products on the market but is still to waxy.</li>
            <li>Has a light lemon smell and moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>Great for chapped lips or just for everyday use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not priced like Chapstick, but then again it&#x27;s a higher quality product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying a lip balm with sun protection.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping for something to really soak my lips into.</li>
            <li>lemon-mint scent, very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I highly recommend any Jane products!</li>
            <li>and it felt really grainy.</li>
            <li>I have used Jane Iredale products for years and lip drink turned this lip balm \\&quot;junkie\\&quot; into a lady with healthy lips due to the fact that it is mineral and healing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t particularly like the sheen this lip balm gave me.</li>
            <li>My favorite lip stuff and the only thing I will use daily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this lip balm.</li>
            <li>I live in Az,</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high quality, natural, and</li>
            <li>She is adamant about the type of sunscreen in each of them.</li>
            <li>Also I have sensitive skin, so my lips became peeled and chapped.  </li>
            <li>I slather it on at least four times a day, and it keeps my lips healthy.  </li>
            <li>Would highly recommend for individuals who are not big fans of lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty comparable to other lip balms as far as performance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to a non-SPF Shea butter based lip balm for now, and my lips feel back to normal.</li>
            <li>Looks like new packaging since the last time I ordered.</li>
            <li>I hope they never stop carrying this lip balm, it&#x27;s an absolute lifesaver if other lip balms don&#x27;t work for you.</li>

            <li> however it is white and leaves your lips with a white dry film.</li>
            <li> so dry lips are a constant.  </li>
            <li> It has a subtle pink shimmer that is not real noticeable but looks classy</li>
            <li> I purchased on the recommendation of my dermatologist along with some other products.</li>
            <li> but I wish the color was just a little darker because my lip color is.</li>
            <li> It washes the color out in my face just a little bit unless I put on a lipstick.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this everyday, I have noticed a significant decrease in the amount of cold sores I get!</li>
            <li> This will plump and moisten the skin, get rid of dead skin cells on your lips, and prime them for the protective lip balm.</li>
            <li> Packaging is not important to me, but I do like the tube it comes in.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my lips paler than my already albino self :/</li>
            <li> Weird color on my lips</li>
            <li> This product made my lips look iridescent, and being a woman of color, it looks terrible.</li>

            <li> This is my all time favorite lip balm. A swipe of this before bedtime can prevent me from ever getting chapped lips. I&#x27;m in love with the light lemon smell!! The only reason I don&#x27;t wear this during the day is because it has zero tint and it makes my lips paler than my already albino self :/</li>
            <li> Great Shipping, Excellent Product!</li>
            <li> I like the original formula much better</li>
            <li> Great product, and SPF!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t particularly like the sheen this lip balm gave me. Medium skin tone, blonde hair. It is pretty comparable to other lip balms as far as performance. I purchased on the recommendation of my dermatologist along with some other products. She is adamant about the type of sunscreen in each of them. This works well for the purpose intended (sunscreen), however I will probably try another product on her list next time around just because of the color.</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm addict and this is the best lip balm I&#x27;ve ever used. I bought one to keep beside my bed and one in my purse. It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my lips, and I love the smell-so does my husband-but I wish the color was just a little darker because my lip color is. It washes the color out in my face just a little bit unless I put on a lipstick. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Thicker and more pasty than the older version.</li>
            <li> Love love love this lip balm. Has a light lemon smell and moisturizes very well. Highly recommend this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Great product, tastes like lemon meringue pie!!</li>
            <li> This is very nice - a bit pricey though.  It is very smooth and the smell is wonderful (I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it - lemony?).</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  By far, the best lip balm/lip conditioner that I have used.  Impressed with the quality and ingredients.  Light lemongrass scent.  I have sent them as gifts as well.</li>
            <li> It is the Balm!!!  just love this balm</li>
            <li> ... Model lips, no joke - and SPF ... are you kidding? I hope they never stop carrying this lip balm, it&#x27;s an absolute lifesaver if other lip balms don&#x27;t work for you. I&#x27;ve always had a hard time finding good lip balms, another good one is Melvita&#x27;s lip balm. A tip that works for me, I use a cotton pad - dampen it with warm water - put one drop of jojoba oil on it - and scrub (lightly and gently) the lips before applying any lip balm. This will plump and moisten the skin, get rid of dead skin cells on your lips, and prime them for the protective lip balm.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for something to really soak my lips into. This lip drink is actually like a Chapstick...however it is white and leaves your lips with a white dry film. Nothing about this was a drink for my lips.</li>
            <li> My favorite lip stuff and the only thing I will use daily. I put this on morning, noon, and night. It&#x27;s high quality, natural, and smells/ tastes great. I recommend it to anyone and everyone. Looks like new packaging since the last time I ordered. The only thing I don&#x27;t like in there is the SPF, but it is everywhere these days.</li>
            <li> I really liked the look of the lip balm in a lipstick container. It didn&#x27;t give my lips a rash or a need to continue to over-use it, by drying them out like most lip balms.</li>
            <li> Terrific lip balm.  I use it in the evening and it lasts for several hours.  Fresh light scent is nice too.</li>
            <li> lemon-mint scent, very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I have used Jane Iredale products for years and lip drink turned this lip balm \\&quot;junkie\\&quot; into a lady with healthy lips due to the fact that it is mineral and healing. Nothing better out there!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! I highly recommend any Jane products! Must have! Great for chapped lips or just for everyday use.</li>
            <li> I live in Az, so dry lips are a constant.  I wanted something that gave a bit of color, but worked more as a balm.  This is the item!  It leaves a very light pink/violet tint (very light) which I like for daytime.  It also moisterizes quite well, especially after using a lip scrub.  Packaging is not important to me, but I do like the tube it comes in.  All around a great product.</li>
            <li> THis is my new favorite lip balm! Everything about this lip drink balm is fantastic.  It has a cool container, it is nourishing, it leaves my lips the perfect pink-toned color though it is just clear balm.</li>
            <li> This is the best lip balm I have ever owned!!!  Would highly recommend for individuals who are not big fans of lipstick.  It has a subtle pink shimmer that is not real noticeable but looks classy</li>
            <li> Seems to stay on better then most of the similar products on the market but is still to waxy.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip moisturizer. I love the light citrus smell. It&#x27;s not priced like Chapstick, but then again it&#x27;s a higher quality product, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying a lip balm with sun protection.  This product made my lips look iridescent, and being a woman of color, it looks terrible. Also I have sensitive skin, so my lips became peeled and chapped.  I&#x27;ve switched to a non-SPF Shea butter based lip balm for now, and my lips feel back to normal.</li>
            <li> Weird color on my lips and it felt really grainy. Don&#x27;t recommend</li>
            <li> It is a nice lip treatment..  Keeps my lips quite moist..</li>
            <li> Favorite lip balm ever!</li>
            <li> Lip Drink is soothing, smooth, and everything I want in a lip balm.  I slather it on at least four times a day, and it keeps my lips healthy.  Since I started using this everyday, I have noticed a significant decrease in the amount of cold sores I get!</li>
