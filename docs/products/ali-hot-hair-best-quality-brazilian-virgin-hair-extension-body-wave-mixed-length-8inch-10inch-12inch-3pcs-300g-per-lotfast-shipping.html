            <li>that surprised me.</li>
            <li>But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be too much of a problem, we&#x27;ll see later on tho.</li>

            <li>I wanted a long bob and it took only two bundles to do my whole head</li>
            <li>After my install, in which I only used 4 of the six bundles  I purchased, I am completely sold on this product.</li>
            <li>i can honestly say that i was kinda skeptical</li>
            <li>There is only one slight draw back (but for the price who cares, right?).</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ok so I wanted to upload a picture but I don&#x27;t see how I can. I also wanted to wait a few weeks but hey there is no need. So when I first got the hair I co washed it. The hair became frizzy and lost all wave. I was a little disappointed because the previous Brazilian hair I purchased kept the wave after several washed and a year. Anywho so I put a little frizz serium and it knocked that out and the hair didn&#x27;t become heavy that surprised me. I then attempted to dye it the dye didn&#x27;t take well but the tones still came out nice. Overall the hair is very soft and and curls well. So I didn&#x27;t cut the weft when I put it in so I didn&#x27;t think I would have shedding but so far it is shedding not hair all over the place shedding maybe one or two pieces which again is not bad. I also tried the burn test on it just for gp and it passed atleast according to the youtube videos it passed because of it instantly turning to ash. The bundles was also FULL like really FULL I wanted a long bob and it took only two bundles to do my whole head and I have a big head. Umm the hair does tangle a little but nothing to get upset about I find it does it mostly at night when I put in my bonnet but once I brush it out there is no problem also when the curls drop but that is typical. Overall for what I paid I would buy it again hands down this is my 2nd time buying Brazilian hair on AMAZON so I really feel the need to write these reviews. I would recommend this hair to anyone who asked. You really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo GOOD . I was very skeptical of buying this on Amazon but it proved me wrong . Thank you so much . I will be buying again !</li>
            <li> Love the hair!love the fast shipment!and the seller!keep doing what you do best !</li>
            <li> Love this hair, nice soft full bundles at a good price, Yes I&#x27;ll purchase again Thanks</li>
            <li> Good quality hair. No shedding. Have worn it for two weeks now. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Just as described.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of this hair as I was a little leery about buying hair off Amazon. My only issue is the shedding. This hair sheds a lot. I had read in other reviews this hair shed little to none but that is not the case for me. Other than that, I like and would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> Love everything about this hair, holds curls, no tangles, Will definitely be purchasing from them in the future.</li>
            <li> Product exceeded expectations.  Hair is holding up well.  Only downside is the weft is quite thick.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed with the hair I received, the hair was super thin. Not enough of hair for a full sew-in.</li>
            <li> Honest review..I just received this hair today and it feels amazing.I haven&#x27;t installed it yet,but will keep you guys posted.5stars for texture</li>
            <li> This hair is beautiful! Barely any shedding! I believe I got 1 strand of hair out of all 3 bundles when I ran my fingers thru. them. I received NO tangling either! I&#x27;ve already co-washed the hair &amp; it&#x27;s still very soft. I braided the hair while it was air drying &amp; the hair came out some what of a loose/water wave, not complaining bc I use flexi rods. Even after I washed the hair I still didn&#x27;t have any tangling/shedding. I gave the hair 4 stars bc I haven&#x27;t installed it yet. 1 CON I&#x27;ll say I have already is the hair is not dounble wefted! But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be too much of a problem, we&#x27;ll see later on tho. GREAT HAIR OVERALL!! Amazon is not letting me upload pictures for some reason, sorry!!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase something other than a closure online, but I opted to purchase based on the reviews. I love the hair. There is only one slight draw back (but for the price who cares, right?). The hair arrived in 4 bundles. The package was enough to complete my entire head; however, the curl pattern was different on the 12 inch ( almost straight after the first wash before installation/it even looked straight before I washed it).  I highly suggest that you wash/dye it before installation ( there were color variations throughout the pack ranging from off black to dark/medium brown). I will purchase again. Remember, Indian/Brazilian has a tendency to be thin on the ends. That is pretty much the standard in my opinion. I just have my beautician trim the ends. I hope this helps, thanks:)</li>
            <li> hair is a bit thin and it shreds when you comb it but the texture is great</li>
            <li> I bought 6 bundles 12&amp;#34;14&amp;#34;16... only used 3 bundles and I&#x27;m  very satisfied</li>
            <li> Worth the price. Rest assured.</li>
            <li> I have bought many types of hair but never online. This hair was soo soft and did not tangle. The price was great! I have straightened the hair and it held the curl nicely.</li>
            <li> This was some nice hair...i read the reviews and i can honestly say that i was kinda skeptical but it was really nice hair.</li>
            <li> BTW... I am a female, using I&#x27;m my husband&#x27;s account...Anywhoo... I received my hair in two days as expected. the hair felt soft and silky and without scent.  I ordered 6 bundles due to the reviews about the bundle sizes. I was extremely impressed with the packaging and the presentation of the product.  After my install, in which I only used 4 of the six bundles  I purchased, I am completely sold on this product. I can run my hand through the hair with minimal to no shedding. This is the second day of wear and I absolutely love it.  I will update this post with a follow up in a few weeks to update everyone on how the hair is holding up, if it holds, I will definitely purchase additional product from this vendor again.  Hope this helps,as I was skeptical on ordering online from an unknown vendor as well.  So happy I decided to take the chance!!!!!  Worth every PEN-TY!  :)</li>
            <li> Got my hair installed today and my stylist even said this was really great hair. She was shocked when I told her the price I paid for the 3 bundles (12&amp;#34;, 14&amp;#34;16&amp;#34;). She was so impressed she wanted the information so she could order some for her clients. Guess I made a come up by being frugal with my money! This hair is soft, curls perfectly and I love it!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks for the hair . It took an extra day because of the weather here in Memphis . But it looks great and I can&#x27;t wait to install it Friday ! 😘😘😭👏 you guys did great with responding to my emails I was eased with the tracking number thanks again</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this product; however, I do wish the hair was a little more curly.Delivery was pretty fast and the company included a free gift which was a long braided Plat.The hair is very soft and has not shed at all.I definitely recommend this product and I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> hair was not 12 14 16 fast delivery hair was 101212  after measures and waves disappered after co wash.</li>
            <li> good so far, the ends of the 16 are a little thin, overall the hair is very soft it washes really nice, the hair was packaged nice. I only have only had it in for one day and so far so good. I really didn&#x27;t expect much for the price but will update again after 1 month. Hair arrived within 2 days</li>
            <li> Just Received My Hair I Can&#x27;t Wait Til Friday To Get It Installed!</li>
            <li> love this hair. Have it now for three weeks. Washed it once at the beauty salon and my stylist even commented on how good of a quality this hair is. No shedding at all. Will buy again.</li>
