            <li>I&#x27;m quite positive that using this soap overtime has made a difference!</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive and dry skin like mine.</li>
            <li>Feels very gentle - if you leave the suds on your skin, you&#x27;ll notice they&#x27;ll sort of pull at your face.</li>
            <li>First one was a gift.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried this product I felt</li>

            <li>I originally bought this as a substitute for another brand of egg white facial soap.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is it doesn&#x27;t really get anything off like a soap should, notably makeup.</li>
            <li>Rinses off immediately and completely, leaving you skin soft.  </li>

            <li>I have fine thin hair that is very very picky</li>
            <li>They actually package this soap in the state I live in...</li>
            <li>I do recommend anyone to try these, you will never go back to your old soap again.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> Had some really bad dry skin this year tried everything, this was my cure.  </li>
            <li> and my mom loves everything from the whimsical designs on the box and the soap itself!</li>

            <li> Love these so much I have used them for a year and half and they don&#x27;t dry my facial skin perfect gentle soap since I tend to have oily skin.</li>
            <li> Amazing soap. When I was a kid my mom had found some &amp;#34;egg soaps&amp;#34; from a boutique shop and never could find them again. Finally I came across these and they don&#x27;t look the same as the ones my mom originally loved, but they work wonderfully and smell like bliss! I bought a box for Mothers Day and my mom loves everything from the whimsical designs on the box and the soap itself! Put some on a washcloth and gently rub away the day&#x27;s dirt and it&#x27;ll leave you skin soft and even!</li>

            <li> Whoa! I really love this soap! I think it smells really good! Eggwhite has been shown to shrink pores. I&#x27;m quite positive that using this soap overtime has made a difference! My pores look a lot smaller! I have acne proem skin. This soap has not broken me out, as a matter of fact I think it&#x27;s keeping my breakouts at bay. Buy this soap! It&#x27;s great, you will love it!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd order on this soap.  I LOVE this soap!  My face feels clean, fresh &amp; firmer.  It even has a glow from using this soap.  The smell is nice &amp; light.  It&#x27;s a really good clean facial soap.  I prefer it over Clinique, Lancôme &amp; all the more expensive brands.  This soap lasts.  I ordered the 6 pack last Jan &amp; I still have 3 bars left!  I gave 1 to my sister, 1 in my shower &amp; 1 by my sink.  They last &amp; it&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> This soap smells wonderful, feels wonderful and the box is very attractive for yourself or a gift.</li>
            <li> The best bar facial soap ever. I have very oily skin and this is the only soap that doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of all moisture or leave it too oily. I always feel the perfect amount of clean yet still hydrated after using it. It&#x27;s so refreshing; I don&#x27;t buy any other face cleanser now.</li>
            <li> Ok I am going to be honest with you. The first time I tried this product I felt like my face was dry once I got out of the shower but I decided to continue to use it anyway. After 3 days of continued use I noticed a huge difference in my face/skin. My skin was vibrant and glowing. It was not dry nor oily but a perfect texture. I will be using this product as long as I can keep ordering it. I recommend this to anyone young or old. I love it so much that I purchased some for my family members.</li>
            <li> Feels very gentle - if you leave the suds on your skin, you&#x27;ll notice they&#x27;ll sort of pull at your face. It feels like your pores are shrinking. Afterwards, my skin was ridiculously soft.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage daughters. I used it once and could not believe how soft it made my old face.</li>
            <li> Love eggwhite soap, it leaves my skin feeling great!  This stuff last awhile and it is soo easy to purchase on Amazon!</li>
            <li> Too drying for me.  Smells nice.</li>
            <li> Had some really bad dry skin this year tried everything, this was my cure.  My skin looks clearer, smoother, pores seems smaller, even have my husband using it now.</li>
            <li> My wife and many of her friends love this soap</li>
            <li> EggWhite Soap lives up to its name because it does every thing that it state it will do the soap does it.  Upon using this soap my skin became very smooth and clean. I also bathe in this soap and I felt like I was on cloud nine up in Heaven.

            <li> Love this soap.  Very creamy, non drying and it  makes you face feel so soft.  At Christmas, I gave a bar to each of the ladies in my family and all just love it!  From 20 to +70 years old.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin and it is really hard for me to find a facial soap that will not make me break out. This soap has not made me break out at all and my face feels so clean after. I love this and will never use another face soap!</li>
            <li> Smells good, lanolin free.</li>
            <li> Love this soap - I have fine thin hair that is very very picky what works on it without leaving flat and needs washed daily to look good.  I can even use this soap on my hair - works better than any shampoo!  Soft clean suds and smell.</li>
