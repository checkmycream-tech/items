            <li> I have had this shaver for several years and it is simply the best shaver I have ever owned. The cleaning and charging unit needs these refill cartridges when the base unit tells you that it&#x27;s time to replace it with a new one. I always buy them from Amazon and am VERY happy with the price I get them for and reasonable shipping charges. I hope they continue to be available for years to come!</li>
            <li> What can I say?  Nothing sexy about shaver cleaning cartridges.  These are as advertised and do the job.  Amazon does their usual great job of advertising and delivering as promised.</li>
            <li> The only way to go. I have tried the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; versions and they do not do the job.</li>
            <li> THere used to be  a screen that filtered out the micro hairs from being recycled through the cleaner. This isn&#x27;t present in these, making me wonder if there was a bad revision or these are phoney items.  Sure..they work, but having the stubble recycled through the cleaner is not good.  If you can&#x27;t find anything else, these will work, but be aware you&#x27;ve got some cleaning to do of the machine itself regularly.</li>
            <li> Excellent cleaning properties for my electric shaver. Very reasonably priced for the amount of cleaning they do. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband&#x27;s shaver system.  They were quite a bit cheaper than buying them in the store. They work great.</li>

            <li> Great Braun cleaner as always.  Very easy to clean your husband&#x27;s/son&#x27;s razor.  Great price for the pack of cartridges.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My husband uses these for his Braun shaver.  This amazon price was about $4.00 cheaper for a set of four from the local pharmacy store.  Price is good, product is good.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> If you own a braun electric shaver that has a cleaning attachment you certainly will want these refills. It is important to keep your shaver clean to prolong the life of the razor and for a clean shave.</li>
            <li> I got these for my husband and he is so pleased!  Love that I can get them for this price.</li>
            <li> Items received promptly &amp; exactly as advertised.  This is our second purchase of these cartridges.</li>
            <li> Great buy for this cleaner refill.  Get this pack from Amazon and save by buying ahead. The cleaner is exactly the same as the local store products. So far, the item cleans superbly. Fits in wth my series 7 very well, and the quality of the refill is high. A good if not great buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve order this before for my husband and he is very pleased with the performance and the price.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is the ideal way to clean my shaver. I recently upgraded to a newer Braun. Nothing was wrong with the old one, I just wanted newer features and a spiffier look. I bought a new shaver head for the old one and gave it to my son in law. He is very happy with the hand me down. I love the cleaning system with this shaver. It tells u when it needs cleaning and does it automatically. You never have to touch the solution. This is the way to go. These people at Braun now their business.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s to say?  This product cleans the head of my electric razor, it does so with a very pleasant aroma.  The product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - clean the blades.</li>
            <li> I really notice the difference in my Braun shaver after I clean it.  Electric shavers can get a kind of musky/nasty odor from skin oil and the hair shavings.  These remove that and leave it smelling fresh.  Been using it and happy for years.</li>
