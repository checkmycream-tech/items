            <li>Good product, I recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am so very pleased to have found this product, it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li>It is truly amazing</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and packed nicely.</li>
            <li>Kind of like a Vaseline feeling.</li>
            <li>It comes in a tube kind of like a toothpaste tube, and while 2 to 4 oz.</li>
            <li>I love this heel balm.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>This foot cream is okay.</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>you will love it.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will take more than the three days that I said</li>
            <li>At any rate, some people have mentioned a strong odor to it.</li>
            <li>If you could go pass the smell (not offensive, just strong)</li>
            <li>So while it is not a long term fix i would say 3 years of good feeling skin for a matter of just 7-10 dollars is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about what a wonderful product it is, I even occasionally use it on my elbows.</li>
            <li>I received my product quickly and it was still cheaper (even with shipping cost) than buying it at the store.</li>
            <li>Softens your feet well and is not dangerous like some of this stuff which seems to burn your skin.</li>
            <li>It works and you don&#x27;t even have to use very much of it.</li>
            <li>My heels stay soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li>first foot cream, and i have tried many that actually seems to work.  </li>
            <li>It really works.  </li>
            <li>let me assure you i have never had to use a whole tube.   </li>
            <li>This thing works for real.  </li>
            <li>I use mainly for heals but rub in everywhere but between toes.</li>
            <li>I used it for a bit and just wasn&#x27;t particularly getting results.</li>
            <li>I guess anyway; it&#x27;s been years since my heels have looked or felt anywhere close to normal.</li>
            <li>I am a California girl who never wears shoes, I live in flip flops and sandals for work.</li>
            <li>Once your heals are soft, (within DAYS)</li>
            <li>My feet get super dry and crack, I have been using Flexitol for years and let me tell you it is the only thing that acutally heals your feet.</li>
            <li>I would give it ten if it went that high.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that I need to use it more diligently as the tough skin comes back if I don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>In a very short period of time it totally cleared up the hang-nail and cuticle problems, and left my skin so soft</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I applied this cream twice a day for 3 days, and my heels are almost completely back to \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. I guess anyway; it&#x27;s been years since my heels have looked or felt anywhere close to normal. I have coated my heels in Aquaphor ointment, wrapped them in cling wrap, and wore socks over them to bed, and THAT treatment doesn&#x27;t come close to 3 days of Flexitol. I think using this every day would eliminate the need for pedicures. I applied it to my entire feet. I can&#x27;t get over how well it works. It does smell pretty bad. But, I just wash my hands and ignore any lingering scent. You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> After years of filing, soaking, pedicures, etc. my mom used Flexitol and raved about it.  So, with doubts, I tried it and guess what?  It really works.  The thick skin on my heels is softed completely.  My only problem is that I need to use it more diligently as the tough skin comes back if I don&#x27;t.  Good product, I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and have not had a crack in my heel since.  I can&#x27;t say enough about what a wonderful product it is, I even occasionally use it on my elbows.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! It works and you don&#x27;t even have to use very much of it. Once your heals are soft, (within DAYS) you can use it occasionally to maintain the softness.</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and packed nicely. I love this heel balm. It&#x27;s the only thing that cures cracked heels.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I used to destroy my socks with my rough heels. I have used this for years, putting it on just at night after my shower and then wearing sox to bed. My heels stay soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> For all of those who are skeptic about all those reviews where they are all 5 star, let me assure you this product is the best in heal repair. It deserves a 5 star. I would give it ten if it went that high. My heals get hard dry skin and get deep cracks in them. I am only 30 years old and the cracks are so dark and deep they look like black cuts. This product not only gave me smoother skin within just a matter of a week but it also repaired the cracking skin. It is one of the best products i have used in my life. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product. If you are looking for something that works this is the product. It does feel a little greasy when going on. Kind of like a Vaseline feeling. However, a little soap and water will wash it off your hands. It comes in a tube kind of like a toothpaste tube, and while 2 to 4 oz. don&#x27;t seem like a lot of product let me assure you i have never had to use a whole tube.   I stopped using for a while like 3 years and have not had a problem till now. So while it is not a long term fix i would say 3 years of good feeling skin for a matter of just 7-10 dollars is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> My wife was looking for a product like this.  She had tried a similar product that her sister uses.  I found this one on Amazon and my wife loves it. It does exactly what it claims.</li>
            <li> I received my product quickly and it was still cheaper (even with shipping cost) than buying it at the store.</li>
            <li> Works if you faithfully use it. Softens your feet well and is not dangerous like some of this stuff which seems to burn your skin. Just put it on every morning after shower. Wash hands. Don&#x27;t get in eyes. I use mainly for heals but rub in everywhere but between toes. My podiatrist recommended it. I also use a small gentle file.</li>
            <li> This foot cream is okay. I used it for a bit and just wasn&#x27;t particularly getting results. It could have been that I just did not use it as regularly as required. At any rate, some people have mentioned a strong odor to it. I did not note that. It has a scent but it is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this cream is! I went though a tramatic time and started chewing around my nails, which caused hang nails and just \\&quot;chewed up\\&quot; looking hands. When I got the cream,I started massaging it into my fingers and cuticles every morning and night for about 2 minutes, longer if I had the time. In a very short period of time it totally cleared up the hang-nail and cuticle problems, and left my skin so soft I wasn&#x27;t tempted to chew on them. I also gave a tube to my mom, who has terrible Neuropathy in her feet, and it has healed up the hard, splitting cracks she would get. I am so very pleased to have found this product, it&#x27;s truly amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  Heals heels overnight. Buy some!</li>
            <li> This thing works for real.  If you could go pass the smell (not offensive, just strong) you will love it. This is result that you can feel.</li>
            <li> first foot cream, and i have tried many that actually seems to work.  I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle cream I kid you not. If your heels get rough and scratchy use this stuff. After three nights you will visibly see a difference. By night three my feet were not snagging on the blanket at night. I have been using this for a while now. It is not to greasy, it rubs in well and feels great. My teenager has an issue with his hands getting really red and cracking during the winter. This year I had him try this and it even worked on his hands. You will not regret buying this. If you feet are as bad as the photo shows on the box I&#x27;m sure it will take more than the three days that I said but, I still think you will notice the difference in three days. Good Luck!</li>
            <li> I am a California girl who never wears shoes, I live in flip flops and sandals for work. My feet get super dry and crack, I have been using Flexitol for years and let me tell you it is the only thing that acutally heals your feet. It is truly amazing and I reccomend this to everybody!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent foot cream!</li>
            <li> Bought for my mom who suffers from severely cracked heels and she wears this with socks and highly recommends it! We noticed great improvement over time.</li>
            <li> The product works!  Not only do I put it on my heels (which aren&#x27;t cracked, only dry/rough) I put it on my dry elbows.  This product seems to be softening the skin.  I bought it on a recommendation of a friend with very bad heels.  She swears by it.  I have diabetes, so this helps with my skin.</li>
            <li> Nothing has ever worked on my feet!! I bought this because of the reviews but figured again I was wasting my money. I was wrong!! The stuff works incredibly well!!</li>
