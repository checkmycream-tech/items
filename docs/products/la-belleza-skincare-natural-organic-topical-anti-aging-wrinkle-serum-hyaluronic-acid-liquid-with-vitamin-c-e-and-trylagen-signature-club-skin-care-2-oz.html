            <li>Love this product, it easily absorbs.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not have a strong scent and it is not watery but not oily either.</li>
            <li>I love the glow on my face and those fine wrinkle lines are fading.</li>
            <li>I love the glow on my face and those fine wrinkle lines are fading.</li>
            <li>I love this and have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>am 68 years old and people tell me how great I look.</li>
            <li>La Belleza serum contains the antioxidant effectiveness of hyaluronic acid, Vitamins C and E, and more, La Belleza fights free radicals and restores your skin to its youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I got the product very quickly as well.</li>
            <li>Because you don&#x27;t need to slather your face and neck with the serum (2 pumps covers mine just fine)</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed....  and very light</li>
            <li>just take my word for it, try La Belleza Skincare 2fl/oz Hyaluronic Acid Serum for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item.</li>
            <li>I have received this product for free or discount for my review.</li>
            <li>and my sisters&#x27; letting me use their product for free</li>
            <li>really enjoy using this product &amp; find that makeup application is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and almost wrinkle-free and I am 56.</li>
            <li>I was overall happy with this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li>This just made my skin lovely and its really light and quickly absorbed</li>
            <li>My face looks and feels better since La Belleza, and that&#x27;s an absolute truth!</li>
            <li>I look forward to applying this every morning before I go to work knowing my skin looks great and better everyday.</li>
            <li>It is light and absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin feels much softer and looks much better.</li>
            <li>It just looks cool.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I came across this product as it has really worked.</li>
            <li>and I have had no bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, and has improved the look and texture of my problem skin.</li>
            <li>Thankfully I found this awesome product that keeps my skin looking a lot younger than I ever thought possible.  </li>
            <li>Kept over my toilet cabinet, people always ask me about this product as its so prominently good looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Nice product, very useful, helped in the various areas described.</li>
            <li>super nifty design for a great product, thick and rich, aborbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and renewed.</li>
            <li>Great product cream based but not to heavy.  </li>
            <li>and I use this stuff religiously (even bought my own).  </li>
            <li>I like the way it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin without leaving a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks natural and healthy.</li>
            <li>The first evening I put it on my face , the treatment was absorbed so fast by what I guess was my very thirsty face that I used more than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li>I thought this is another lotion that won&#x27;t work but due to good reviews</li>
            <li>Started to see results right away.</li>
            <li>The price is right</li>
            <li>I believe this one has more ingredients in it to help smooth your skin and tone  than some of the others I have tried that dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I really love La Belleza skincare serum, it goes easily, and sinks into my skin.</li>
            <li>It smoothes out my fine lines and little wrinkles and leaves a nice glow.</li>
            <li>I have noticed some of my fine lines dissipating, and the texture of my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li>An important feature that drew me from day One is the fact that it is Organic and Natural and rich with Antioxidant Vitamin C. Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li>Certainly, a must have!</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend It!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s odor free so you don&#x27;t have to worry about something that smells &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; and you certainly don&#x27;t have to worry about having super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>My skin appears more hydrated and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>Really noticed a change in my skin!  </li>
            <li>Mom likes it, thanks!</li>
            <li>It really sems to be doing the trick!</li>
            <li>Tried other serums but this for sure takes the lead!</li>
            <li>The price is very convenient too!</li>
            <li>so if I wanted to use it more often like day wear, then I definitely could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the pump of the container was faulty in the first bottle I&#x27;ve got;</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I like the fact that not only is the price good (you get twice the amount of serum - 2 ounces - for the same price I used to get for 1 ounce with another brand)</li>
            <li>I also love that I don&#x27;t have to slather a moisturizer on after I apply the serum as it has the consistency of a lotion and does not take long to absorb into my skin.  </li>
            <li>Its absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I just never realized how much.  </li>
            <li>My wife has been using this for a couple weeks and really loves it.</li>
            <li>Serum works really on well on skin with no issues.  </li>
            <li>but once I applied it to my skin, I could feel the gentle way it was tightening my pores and soothing it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and it really works.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone that goes out in the sun a lot!</li>
            <li>Comes in a big bottle and goes on smoothly without greasy film.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s really nothing to say.  </li>
            <li>My whole complexion has improved.  </li>
            <li>It came as described and well packaged, but I really don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li>I also really like the fact that there is no odor with this product</li>
            <li>noticed skin is smooth and do far no rash or breakout since my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>My skin looks and feels soft and brighter!!!</li>
            <li>The product works better than other crème I have tried and recommend it to all others</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin - this product made dry areas drier and did nothing to clear up areas with more oil.  </li>
            <li>however I was so excited to try it, my husband merely pierced a hole in the very top, for me to use</li>
            <li>First I was rather surprised about the consistency  and color of the liquid was not</li>
            <li>I recommend highly.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li>La Belleza products are all high quality.</li>
            <li>Within a few days, I noticed&lt;br /&gt;fine lines diminishing and radiant healthy skin.  </li>
            <li>so you definitely get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li>Living on a sailboat and being exposed by the sun constantly, my face and complexion is pretty much fried.  </li>
            <li>Just in a few weeks I really see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I have noticed a difference in the feel of the skin and the fine wrinkles are starting to appear smaller.  </li>
            <li>There is no way to tell how much is in the bottle and it is a rather large bottle for only two ounces of product.</li>
            <li>and they recommended this new product on amazon.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li>It went on and soaked in right away and left my face feeling so soft and hydrated without an oily residue.</li>
            <li>I figured for $20 I wasn&#x27;t wasting as much as I have on other products and the reviews were  positive as a whole.</li>
            <li>it work so much better than every other products I tried, even the regular face cream I brought with me from Israel.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no struggling with it to produce product which is a total plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results from using this serum have definitely been a more refined overall texture of the skin.</li>
            <li>I fear I will have to end up prying the top off or end up tossing the bottle with half of the product left in it because I doubt it will pump it all out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m now in my early 40s and want to make a change while I still can.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am 50 yrs young, but do have to admit that my skin is not getting that message.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Makes skin soft and lines disappear.</li>
            <li>and I was in a wow</li>
            <li>The hole to dispense cream, was completely unpunctured, no hole to dispense cream.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old and when I&#x27;m with my 33 year old son, people mistake me for his sister.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Initially when I pumped the top it was a slow start -</li>
            <li>I could actually feel my skin getting softer and smoother and see some of the fine lines specially around my eyes be less and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li>I love how there is twice as much product in this bottle than other hyaluronic serums I have ordered in the past.  </li>
            <li>I am noticing fine lines and dull skin.  </li>
            <li>There is an advantage to being a little heavy set with oily skin, I don&#x27;t wrinkle very easily.  </li>
            <li>My face is not absorbing the serum as quickly now and a smaller amount covers a larger area.</li>
            <li>This is one anti aging product that I&#x27;m going to buy again due to the positive results - and I didn&#x27;t have to wait 2 or 3 months to see those results.</li>
            <li>I was sitting at the table with my husband a couple of hours later on day 2 and he commented out of the blue, &amp;#34;You must have slept really well last night because you look younger.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>might be coming near the future</li>
            <li>I may be in my early to mid 30&#x27;s, but I feel like I am in a relay race to turn back the hands of time to a youthful glow that I used to have in my mid 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous at first because it seemed like it would be a heavy cream.</li>
            <li>I could not believe how smooth my skin looked in a few days and in a week, my skin was not only smoother, but it looked less ravaged.  </li>

            <li> I love the glow on my face and those fine wrinkle lines are fading.</li>
            <li> I love this and have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li> am 68 years old and people tell me how great I look.</li>
            <li> La Belleza serum contains the antioxidant effectiveness of hyaluronic acid, Vitamins C and E, and more, La Belleza fights free radicals and restores your skin to its youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> I got the product very quickly as well.</li>
            <li> Because you don&#x27;t need to slather your face and neck with the serum (2 pumps covers mine just fine)</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed....  and very light</li>
            <li> just take my word for it, try La Belleza Skincare 2fl/oz Hyaluronic Acid Serum for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item.</li>
            <li> I have received this product for free or discount for my review.</li>
            <li> and my sisters&#x27; letting me use their product for free</li>
            <li> really enjoy using this product &amp; find that makeup application is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and almost wrinkle-free and I am 56.</li>
            <li> I was overall happy with this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This just made my skin lovely and its really light and quickly absorbed</li>
            <li> My face looks and feels better since La Belleza, and that&#x27;s an absolute truth!</li>
            <li> I look forward to applying this every morning before I go to work knowing my skin looks great and better everyday.</li>
            <li> It is light and absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin feels much softer and looks much better.</li>
            <li> It just looks cool.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I came across this product as it has really worked.</li>
            <li> and I have had no bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, and has improved the look and texture of my problem skin.</li>
            <li> Thankfully I found this awesome product that keeps my skin looking a lot younger than I ever thought possible.  </li>
            <li> Kept over my toilet cabinet, people always ask me about this product as its so prominently good looking.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Nice product, very useful, helped in the various areas described.</li>
            <li> super nifty design for a great product, thick and rich, aborbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and renewed.</li>
            <li> Great product cream based but not to heavy.  </li>
            <li> and I use this stuff religiously (even bought my own).  </li>
            <li> I like the way it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin without leaving a greasy residue.  </li>
            <li> My skin looks natural and healthy.</li>
            <li> The first evening I put it on my face , the treatment was absorbed so fast by what I guess was my very thirsty face that I used more than the recommended amount.</li>
            <li> I thought this is another lotion that won&#x27;t work but due to good reviews</li>
            <li> Started to see results right away.</li>
            <li> The price is right</li>
            <li> I believe this one has more ingredients in it to help smooth your skin and tone  than some of the others I have tried that dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> I really love La Belleza skincare serum, it goes easily, and sinks into my skin.</li>
            <li> It smoothes out my fine lines and little wrinkles and leaves a nice glow.</li>
            <li> I have noticed some of my fine lines dissipating, and the texture of my skin is very soft.</li>
            <li> An important feature that drew me from day One is the fact that it is Organic and Natural and rich with Antioxidant Vitamin C. Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum.</li>
            <li> Certainly, a must have!</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend It!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s odor free so you don&#x27;t have to worry about something that smells &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; and you certainly don&#x27;t have to worry about having super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> My skin appears more hydrated and fine lines are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> Really noticed a change in my skin!  </li>
            <li> Mom likes it, thanks!</li>
            <li> It really sems to be doing the trick!</li>
            <li> Tried other serums but this for sure takes the lead!</li>
            <li> The price is very convenient too!</li>
            <li> so if I wanted to use it more often like day wear, then I definitely could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the pump of the container was faulty in the first bottle I&#x27;ve got;</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I like the fact that not only is the price good (you get twice the amount of serum - 2 ounces - for the same price I used to get for 1 ounce with another brand)</li>
            <li> I also love that I don&#x27;t have to slather a moisturizer on after I apply the serum as it has the consistency of a lotion and does not take long to absorb into my skin.  </li>
            <li> Its absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I just never realized how much.  </li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for a couple weeks and really loves it.</li>
            <li> Serum works really on well on skin with no issues.  </li>
            <li> but once I applied it to my skin, I could feel the gentle way it was tightening my pores and soothing it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and it really works.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone that goes out in the sun a lot!</li>
            <li> Comes in a big bottle and goes on smoothly without greasy film.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing to say.  </li>
            <li> My whole complexion has improved.  </li>
            <li> It came as described and well packaged, but I really don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> I also really like the fact that there is no odor with this product</li>
            <li> noticed skin is smooth and do far no rash or breakout since my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> My skin looks and feels soft and brighter!!!</li>
            <li> The product works better than other crème I have tried and recommend it to all others</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to the hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin - this product made dry areas drier and did nothing to clear up areas with more oil.  </li>
            <li> however I was so excited to try it, my husband merely pierced a hole in the very top, for me to use</li>
            <li> First I was rather surprised about the consistency  and color of the liquid was not</li>
            <li> I recommend highly.  </li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> La Belleza products are all high quality.</li>
            <li> Within a few days, I noticed&lt;br /&gt;fine lines diminishing and radiant healthy skin.  </li>
            <li> so you definitely get your moneys worth.</li>
            <li> Living on a sailboat and being exposed by the sun constantly, my face and complexion is pretty much fried.  </li>
            <li> Just in a few weeks I really see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the feel of the skin and the fine wrinkles are starting to appear smaller.  </li>
            <li> There is no way to tell how much is in the bottle and it is a rather large bottle for only two ounces of product.</li>
            <li> and they recommended this new product on amazon.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my face very soft.</li>
            <li> It went on and soaked in right away and left my face feeling so soft and hydrated without an oily residue.</li>
            <li> I figured for $20 I wasn&#x27;t wasting as much as I have on other products and the reviews were  positive as a whole.</li>
            <li> it work so much better than every other products I tried, even the regular face cream I brought with me from Israel.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no struggling with it to produce product which is a total plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results from using this serum have definitely been a more refined overall texture of the skin.</li>
            <li> I fear I will have to end up prying the top off or end up tossing the bottle with half of the product left in it because I doubt it will pump it all out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m now in my early 40s and want to make a change while I still can.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am 50 yrs young, but do have to admit that my skin is not getting that message.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Makes skin soft and lines disappear.</li>
            <li> and I was in a wow</li>
            <li> The hole to dispense cream, was completely unpunctured, no hole to dispense cream.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old and when I&#x27;m with my 33 year old son, people mistake me for his sister.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Initially when I pumped the top it was a slow start -</li>
            <li> I could actually feel my skin getting softer and smoother and see some of the fine lines specially around my eyes be less and less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I love how there is twice as much product in this bottle than other hyaluronic serums I have ordered in the past.  </li>
            <li> I am noticing fine lines and dull skin.  </li>
            <li> There is an advantage to being a little heavy set with oily skin, I don&#x27;t wrinkle very easily.  </li>
            <li> My face is not absorbing the serum as quickly now and a smaller amount covers a larger area.</li>
            <li> This is one anti aging product that I&#x27;m going to buy again due to the positive results - and I didn&#x27;t have to wait 2 or 3 months to see those results.</li>
            <li> I was sitting at the table with my husband a couple of hours later on day 2 and he commented out of the blue, &amp;#34;You must have slept really well last night because you look younger.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> might be coming near the future</li>
            <li> I may be in my early to mid 30&#x27;s, but I feel like I am in a relay race to turn back the hands of time to a youthful glow that I used to have in my mid 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit nervous at first because it seemed like it would be a heavy cream.</li>
            <li> I could not believe how smooth my skin looked in a few days and in a week, my skin was not only smoother, but it looked less ravaged.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t tell you this is the fountain of youth because I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough to boast</li>
            <li> lay out in the sun on a regular basis, plus, I ride on a motorcycle weekly, this serum has helped to keep my skin from looking like aged parchment</li>
            <li> La Belleza Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a 2 fl oz instead of the traditional one that you get from other products.</li>
            <li> way bigger than I expected!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you are concerned about age lines and dull skin.</li>
            <li> After using just a short few months I can tell a big difference.  </li>
            <li> but they are not as deep and are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> My wrinkles definitely seem much less noticeable&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I am shocked because I didn&#x27;t really expect much in the way of results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After just a few uses of the La Belleza Skincare 2fl/oz Hyaluronic Acid Serum, I can tell a difference in the look and texture of my facial skin.  </li>
            <li> In a few weeks time, I noticed that my complexion had an overall improvement in everything - the texture, the feel, the look -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent years working in the sun</li>
            <li> I had expected from the ones I’ve used before.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when u first bought the product; I have tried several anti aging products with minimal results.</li>
            <li> A little of this fast-acting product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use it every time I wash my face and layer it with other products.</li>
            <li> The bottle size is commendable as usually these products come in a rather tiny bottle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review when I use it for a while longer as to the small facial lines and their reduction.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure of long term results yet.</li>
            <li> So far, I can see my complexion has become brighter , I do not look so  tired anymore.</li>
            <li> And anti aging products are ones that work slowly but give a lasting affect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> When we reach the age of 50, everything seems to start going down hill, even the wrinkles on your face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, very sadly, there is not much changes on my deep wrinkles and the saggy bags under the eye area...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still chunky and not so wrinkled, but my skin has become dull and lackluster in the last few years.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkles appear less noticeable..</li>
            <li> Lines around the eyes maybe a little less too.</li>
            <li> I just squirt a few pumps into my hand and rub it into my face, neck, and chest.  </li>
            <li> I was very skeptical at first, but not being an expert at this</li>
            <li> I even use this under my chin hoping to help firm that dreaded area up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product with the vitamin C for a few months now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid if I use too much it will aggravate my acne, so I use a small amount, wait for it to absorb and then apply a small amount of acne product.</li>
            <li> Not sure it you&#x27;re supposed to use it there</li>
            <li> I can see a drastic reduction in the small lines on my face.</li>
            <li> and then it&#x27;s just a small amount at a time.</li>
            <li> After trying this a few times I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s been helpful already!</li>
            <li> As this is the age since the signs of aging start appearing slowly and gradually.</li>
            <li> and I was a bit skeptical that it would even make a slight difference</li>
            <li> Too bad I did not actually get hyaluronic</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t get that sticky feeling once it dries like when you use the poorly made products.</li>
            <li> but I was so wrong.</li>
            <li> I even had a faint glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li> La Belleza&#x27;s serum doesn&#x27;t have a weird, chemical smell either.</li>
            <li> You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> when it arrived the bottle was broken :(</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know how bad until I got home to my sisters to visit</li>
            <li> Doubtful,</li>

            <li> La Belleza Skincare 2fl/oz Hyaluronic Acid Serum is Perfect for the 40s or whatever age you start noticing a change in your skin.  I&#x27;ve always had oily skin, ALWAYS!  There is an advantage to being a little heavy set with oily skin, I don&#x27;t wrinkle very easily.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a hysterectomy with ovary removal in my mid 30s and knew it would have an effect in my skin.  I just never realized how much.  I&#x27;m still chunky and not so wrinkled, but my skin has become dull and lackluster in the last few years.  I&#x27;m now in my early 40s and want to make a change while I still can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After just a few uses of the La Belleza Skincare 2fl/oz Hyaluronic Acid Serum, I can tell a difference in the look and texture of my facial skin.  It has no greasy feel.  I just squirt a few pumps into my hand and rub it into my face, neck, and chest.  If anything feels like it&#x27;s left on my hands, I rub it into the tops of my hands as well.  After all, if it&#x27;s good for my face, it HAS to be good for my hands, too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t just take my word for it, try La Belleza Skincare 2fl/oz Hyaluronic Acid Serum for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I was provided with a free or discounted product in order to review this item. However, this did not influence my review. All opinions are true and my own.</li>
            <li> Product seems to be working. Skin does feel smoother.....tighter. Lines around the eyes maybe a little less too.</li>
            <li> the pump stopped working, had to take it apart to use the rest of it</li>
            <li> Use this product every night and my skin feels smooth and firmer!</li>
            <li> This just made my skin lovely and its really light and quickly absorbed</li>
            <li> I gave it to my friend and she loves it. I wish I had purchased one for myself. Maybe the discount will be sent out again so I can purchase one for myself.</li>
            <li> I am 48 years of age.  I am noticing fine lines and dull skin.  I tried La Belleza and, I am completely satisfied.  Within a few days, I noticed&lt;br /&gt;fine lines diminishing and radiant healthy skin.  I recommend highly.  I even bought one for my husband.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. Started to see results right away.</li>
            <li> Bought this a second time. I use it every time I wash my face and layer it with other products. I feel this is controlling sagging.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for a couple weeks and really loves it. Can already see a difference with using this product.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF.  MY SKIN FEELS AND LOOKS SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I STARTED USING THIS.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.</li>
            <li> Really noticed a change in my skin!  My complexion looks brighter and my skin feels firmer.</li>
            <li> Serum works really on well on skin with no issues.  I have combination skin - this product made dry areas drier and did nothing to clear up areas with more oil.  The texture was nice and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I love vitamin C in my skin care routine.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Started using this and noticed skin is smooth and do far no rash or breakout since my skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> I am 50 yrs young, but do have to admit that my skin is not getting that message. So when I had the opportunity to test this product ouyt, I grabbed it and all honesty hoped for the best, and that is exactly what I got.  I have to say my skin is younger looking and I&#x27;ve had several compliments in the time I have been using this. I could actually feel my skin getting softer and smoother and see some of the fine lines specially around my eyes be less and less noticeable.  I&#x27;m not saying they are not there, oh yeah, they are,  just not as noticeable as they were before I started using this product. I look forward to applying this every morning before I go to work knowing my skin looks great and better everyday. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The product works better than other crème I have tried and recommend it to all others</li>
            <li> I have been using this for about 2 weeks and my skin does seem smoother and radiant</li>
            <li> Nice product, very useful, helped in the various areas described.</li>
            <li> Great product cream based but not to heavy.  works well under makeup. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> great product-great transaction</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and so when this skincare product was suggested, I had some reservations. My concerns were unfounded because when I received my La Belleza Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum, not only did it arrive neatly packaged but once I applied it to my skin, I could feel the gentle way it was tightening my pores and soothing it.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it several times since I received it and I&#x27;m delighted to share that the La Belleza Skincare Hyaluronic Acid Serum works.  An important feature that drew me from day One is the fact that it is Organic and Natural and rich with Antioxidant Vitamin C. Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It&#x27;s easy to use too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this lotion. Since I have started using it I have noticed that my acne scars are disappearing, and so are my crow&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> Absorbs nicely into the skin.</li>
            <li> La Belleza Hyaluronic Acid Serum comes in a 2 fl oz instead of the traditional one that you get from other products. It is not twice the price so you definitely get your moneys worth. I believe this one has more ingredients in it to help smooth your skin and tone  than some of the others I have tried that dry out your skin.  My face does feel nice and silky smooth after I applied it.  I love the bottle design.  It reminds me of a baton at a relay race.  I may be in my early to mid 30&#x27;s, but I feel like I am in a relay race to turn back the hands of time to a youthful glow that I used to have in my mid 20&#x27;s.  This may be just the product to help do that!  *received for testing and review.</li>
            <li> Too bad I did not actually get hyaluronic that&#x27;s what I ordered i received Hydroxyethyl which not was pictured or described I did not want a starch cellulose expander but it hasn&#x27;t harmed my skin I just don&#x27;t know that it is actually doing anything</li>
            <li> I really love La Belleza skincare serum, it goes easily, and sinks into my skin. It is not greasy feeling, or make my skin feel clogged. I have noticed some of my fine lines dissipating, and the texture of my skin is very soft. I will continue to use La Belleza and would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I realy like it! I thought this is another lotion that won&#x27;t work but due to good reviews i thought i try it. It smoothes out my fine lines and little wrinkles and leaves a nice glow. It does not leave a oily film what i realy like. Good experience and i can recommend it.</li>
            <li> Mom likes it, thanks!</li>
            <li> I got the product three days ago.  I figured for $20 I wasn&#x27;t wasting as much as I have on other products and the reviews were  positive as a whole. The first evening I put it on my face , the treatment was absorbed so fast by what I guess was my very thirsty face that I used more than the recommended amount. I smoothed on another dose the next morning. I was sitting at the table with my husband a couple of hours later on day 2 and he commented out of the blue, &amp;#34;You must have slept really well last night because you look younger.&amp;#34; No kidding. It floored me. I haven&#x27;t told him yet my rested look came from something I ordered on line.  I wish I had taken some &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; close ups of my eyes. I&#x27;m on day three and can see a difference in the area between my cheeks and eyes where I have a lot sun damage.  There are still wrinkles there but they are not as deep and are less noticeable. I am shocked because I didn&#x27;t really expect much in the way of results. My face is not absorbing the serum as quickly now and a smaller amount covers a larger area. I&#x27;m going to order more soon. Just tried some on my lips. Not sure it you&#x27;re supposed to use it there but we&#x27;ll see what happens.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! For sure a Buying again!</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of this a while back before listing on Amazon, and can see the benefits of this anti aging serum when I look in the mirror every morning. I like the fact that not only is the price good (you get twice the amount of serum - 2 ounces - for the same price I used to get for 1 ounce with another brand) but I can tell a definite difference in the texture of my skin and appreciate the way it makes my skin glow after use. Because you don&#x27;t need to slather your face and neck with the serum (2 pumps covers mine just fine) the product will last me for quite some time. This is one anti aging product that I&#x27;m going to buy again due to the positive results - and I didn&#x27;t have to wait 2 or 3 months to see those results.</li>
            <li> I was given this as a gift and I was a bit skeptical that it would even make a slight difference but I was so wrong. This has improved my skin 100% I can see a drastic reduction in the small lines on my face. My skin feels much softer and looks much better. I highly recommend this if you are concerned about age lines and dull skin.</li>
            <li> My daughter presented me with La Balleza Anti-Aging Serum for mother&#x27;s day and it really works. Aging comes to all of us, but we can age gracefully by keeping our skin moisturized. I have been using this anti-aging serum since my daughter gave it to me and I am seeing the results. I love the glow on my face and those fine wrinkle lines are fading. The price is right and so is the product.</li>
            <li> Good stuff for your skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I lay out in the sun on a regular basis, plus, I ride on a motorcycle weekly, this serum has helped to keep my skin from looking like aged parchment and I have had no bad reaction to it. In my bag, it&#x27;s the number one Item I keep for taking care of my skin. Great product and it smells nice, too!</li>
            <li> Like the dropper and liquid product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing I used it one time &amp; could tell the difference. I recommend it to all. Makes skin soft and lines disappear. Disclosure: I have received this product for free or discount for my review.</li>
            <li> Just Love it! a friend got me this product a while ago and it is amazing! it work so much better than every other products I tried, even the regular face cream I brought with me from Israel. going to order another one here for sure</li>
            <li> Living on a sailboat and being exposed by the sun constantly, my face and complexion is pretty much fried.  I didn&#x27;t know how bad until I got home to my sisters to visit and they recommended this new product on amazon.  I was very skeptical at first, but not being an expert at this and my sisters&#x27; letting me use their product for free, I used it.  I could not believe how smooth my skin looked in a few days and in a week, my skin was not only smoother, but it looked less ravaged.  In a few weeks time, I noticed that my complexion had an overall improvement in everything - the texture, the feel, the look - I even had a faint glow to my skin.  Now, I&#x27;m a convert and I use this stuff religiously (even bought my own).  I highly recommend this for anyone that goes out in the sun a lot!</li>
            <li> Love this product, it easily absorbs. My skin looks and feels soft and brighter!!!</li>
            <li> hoping it works as promised!</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing! I use this lotion as directed and my skin looks healthier and smoother. No scent, either-a plus.</li>
            <li> Quickly absorbed....  and very light</li>
            <li> I love this face cream and I was in a wow after I used this product the result was amazing I loved the way my face felt after using it I&#x27;m so pleased with this product and my recommendations are go for it, it&#x27;s definitely effective and worth the money!</li>
            <li> great my skin feels much better</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s start with the packaging. It just looks cool. It&#x27;s sleek and clean!&lt;br /&gt;Initially when I pumped the top it was a slow start - I had to pump 10-15 times to get the lotion to come out. -If this happens don&#x27;t be alarmed!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s odor free so you don&#x27;t have to worry about something that smells &amp;#34;funky&amp;#34; and you certainly don&#x27;t have to worry about having super sensitive skin - this doesn&#x27;t sting when you put it on!&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy using this product &amp; find that makeup application is smoother.&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t tell you this is the fountain of youth because I&#x27;ve not been using it long enough to boast but I did get carded buying a bottle of wine this weekend!</li>
            <li> Love it, great serum, I have seen a difference in my skin texture and firmness. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the pump container was fafaulty. The hole to dispense cream, was completely unpunctured, no hole to dispense cream. however I was so excited to try it, my husband merely pierced a hole in the very top, for me to use</li>
            <li> This is the best face serum by far. My skin is smooth and almost wrinkle-free and I am 56.</li>
            <li> A little of this fast-acting product goes a long way. It absorbs quickly, and has improved the look and texture of my problem skin. I&#x27;m afraid if I use too much it will aggravate my acne, so I use a small amount, wait for it to absorb and then apply a small amount of acne product.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  Love it~~~</li>
            <li> Comes in a big bottle and goes on smoothly without greasy film.</li>
            <li> when it arrived the bottle was broken :(</li>
            <li> I love this product. You can tell because I&#x27;m not one to give 5 stars out to every company. This hyaluronic acid serum feels great when you put it on. You don&#x27;t get that sticky feeling once it dries like when you use the poorly made products. La Belleza&#x27;s serum doesn&#x27;t have a weird, chemical smell either. I put this on after I shave.  ** received for review and inspection purposes **</li>
            <li> It really sems to be doing the trick! My wrinkles definitely seem much less noticeable&lt;br /&gt;I am 68 years old and people tell me how great I look. Great product!.</li>
            <li> the dispenser doesnt work so I have no idea whether I like it or not</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when u first bought the product; I have tried several anti aging products with minimal results. I was so impressed with this product that I immediately purchased a second bottle.</li>
            <li> I started using this product the same day I received it. I use it twice a day. So far, I can see my complexion has become brighter , I do not look so  tired anymore. I like the fact that my skin is also smoother. I like to switch around my beauty products every now and then, this one has definitely delivered. I love the fact that it does not have a strong scent and it is not watery but not oily either. I am very happy witt my purchase.</li>
            <li> This skin serum feels creamy upon application on your skin. Its absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft. I&#x27;ve only been using for a few days so I&#x27;m not sure of long term results yet. My skin appears more hydrated and fine lines are less noticeable. I feel the pump could be easier to use though. I have to pump several times just to get anything out of it and then it&#x27;s just a small amount at a time. I worry the pump will stop working before all of the product has been used. There is no way to tell how much is in the bottle and it is a rather large bottle for only two ounces of product. I think they should have made the bottle smaller and improved the pump. Or put a screw on lid on it so you could get all the product out. I fear I will have to end up prying the top off or end up tossing the bottle with half of the product left in it because I doubt it will pump it all out. But the product itself is a great quality product. The packaging could be improved upon. I would have given it 5 stars if the packaging would have been better.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Certainly, a must have! Was introduced to the skincare line beginning of the year and have been on it ever since! My face looks and feels better since La Belleza, and that&#x27;s an absolute truth! Tried other serums but this for sure takes the lead! The price is very convenient too! Would certainly recommend It!</li>
            <li> Hey we all worry about aging and I&#x27;m not getting any younger.  Thankfully I found this awesome product that keeps my skin looking a lot younger than I ever thought possible.  I&#x27;ve spent years working in the sun and it took it&#x27;s toll but this anti aging serum is fixing all the damage I did.</li>
            <li> Like this product. I use it in the morning before applying sun screen. It is light and absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> As per studies one must start using anti aging product since the age of 25. As this is the age since the signs of aging start appearing slowly and gradually. And anti aging products are ones that work slowly but give a lasting affect.&lt;br /&gt;The La Belleza serum contains the antioxidant effectiveness of hyaluronic acid, Vitamins C and E, and more, La Belleza fights free radicals and restores your skin to its youthful appearance.&lt;br /&gt;My skin texture has become smoother since i have started using this product making it glow and more youthful. The bottle size is commendable as usually these products come in a rather tiny bottle. But in this the quantity is good too.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is also really beautifully made. Kept over my toilet cabinet, people always ask me about this product as its so prominently good looking.&lt;br /&gt;I really liked this product and i am sure you will too.</li>
            <li> WOW! I love the bottle!! way bigger than I expected! super nifty design for a great product, thick and rich, aborbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and renewed. I even use this under my chin hoping to help firm that dreaded area up. Great high quality product</li>
            <li> Love it !! I can see a big difference, plus my daughter said she could see a difference ,as well.I use it with the La Belleza Vitamin C Serum. Great combo!</li>
            <li> The La Belleza Skincare has a nice packaging. This is a good sized bottle, easy to hold and easy to find on my vanity. The weight of it is nice and the bottle is easy to use. There&#x27;s no struggling with it to produce product which is a total plus in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results from using this serum have definitely been a more refined overall texture of the skin. Overtime I think this will definitely lighten acne spots as well. But for now I have noticed a better, deeper, hydration and I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s due to the hyaluronic acid. There&#x27;s no funky smell, after feel like some - some can feel stick, this just seems to go on and sink in nicely without anything that leaves you going ew, this is too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this underneath moisturizer and allow it to sink in a good five minutes before I do my eye cream and then moisturizer. I use it every night and have to admit, I have sensitive skin and it doesn&#x27;t irritate me so if I wanted to use it more often like day wear, then I definitely could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the over all look of the bottle and how my skin feels smoother and tighter after use. I&#x27;ll update this review when I use it for a while longer as to the small facial lines and their reduction. I can&#x27;t give you one reason to NOT try this product, I was impressed and I think you will be too.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s really nothing to say.  This stuff is awesome.  Try it.  If you don&#x27;t like it, don&#x27;t buy any more, but you have got to try it.  Crows feet are a thing of the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wonder if it&#x27;ll get rid of the gray hairs..... maybe if I shampoo with it?  Doubtful, but it&#x27;s certainly great on my face!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have been using on my chest and can already see a big difference.</li>
            <li> I love this and have noticed a HUGE difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this product with the vitamin C for a few months now</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a product to help me with my skin issues. I&#x27;m glad I came across this product as it has really worked. I saw great results within a week. I got the product very quickly as well. I would definitely suggest this product.</li>
            <li> When we reach the age of 50, everything seems to start going down hill, even the wrinkles on your face. We&#x27;ll that was one thing I could control with this product. My skin is younger looking and I&#x27;ve had several compliments that I look younger. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My daughters bought this product for my birthday as I approach the big 40.  I have been using this anti-aging serum sor the last 3 months and I am seeing and feeling the results. I love the glow on my face and those fine wrinkle lines are fading.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best skincare that I have found and used in years.  After using just a short few months I can tell a big difference.  I will continue to use this product in the future</li>
            <li> I can see no difference as a result of this product. Same wrinkles and no change in radiance. Ah  well, you&#x27;d think I&#x27;d have given up trying for magic by now.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and I like it! I turned 30 recently and decided I need to start taking care of my skin! After trying this a few times I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s been helpful already! It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent which is good for most people. I was asked to try this out and I&#x27;m glad I did. Can&#x27;t wait to see the difference after another week or so!</li>
            <li> I’m happy with the size for sure! First I was rather surprised about the consistency  and color of the liquid was not I had expected from the ones I’ve used before. This one is more like lotion rather than serum but I’ve been using it hoping for the best result regardless.&lt;br /&gt;So far, very sadly, there is not much changes on my deep wrinkles and the saggy bags under the eye area... I will keep on using it still hoping for the best result might be coming near the future</li>
            <li> I love this!!! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks and it makes my face very soft. Wrinkles appear less noticeable.. I would recommend it to everyone. I&#x27;m going to try it along with the vitamin c serum and see what the results are... Thank you</li>
            <li> I love how there is twice as much product in this bottle than other hyaluronic serums I have ordered in the past.  I also love that I don&#x27;t have to slather a moisturizer on after I apply the serum as it has the consistency of a lotion and does not take long to absorb into my skin.  I have been using it twice a day for 2 weeks now and have noticed a difference in how my face feels tighter and smoother.  I am 54 years old and when I&#x27;m with my 33 year old son, people mistake me for his sister.  Since I still had a jar of RoC Multicorrexion 5-in-1 Restoing Night Cream, I will put that on after the serum.  Maybe that helped speed up the process, whatever the case may be, I am happy with the results!</li>
            <li> the pump of the container was faulty in the first bottle I&#x27;ve got;</li>
            <li> Great product and company  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am a beauty cream junkie and I was was very impressed with this product. I have used this for a week. I was a bit nervous at first because it seemed like it would be a heavy cream. It was not! It went on and soaked in right away and left my face feeling so soft and hydrated without an oily residue. Must mention that the lines around my eyes are gone. Give this a try. You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was overall happy with this product and would buy again.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing face serum.  Just in a few weeks I really see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes. My whole complexion has improved.  I love it.</li>
            <li> It came as described and well packaged, but I really don&#x27;t see any difference. I would&#x27;nt buy It again.</li>
            <li> La Belleza products are all high quality. I use this along with the Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid nightly. Would buy again and recommend to anyone looking for any of these products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for just about three weeks.  I like the way it&#x27;s absorbed into the skin without leaving a greasy residue.  My skin looks natural and healthy.</li>
            <li> I am totally in love with this product.  It goes on very light and has no odor at all.  I have noticed a difference in the feel of the skin and the fine wrinkles are starting to appear smaller.  I also really like the fact that there is no odor with this product and it does not sting the skin but to get a more effective result I exfoliate the skin lightly prior to applying at night.  I also use it during the day under my bronzer.  Thank you for an awesome product.</li>
