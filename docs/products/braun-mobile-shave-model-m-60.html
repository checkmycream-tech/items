    <ol>
            <li>Bruan is an excellent quality shaver,</li>
            <li>This is a great razor.</li>
            <li>They are a great well thought out design.</li>
            <li>A great item to keep in your briefcase.</li>
            <li>Great for in between.</li>
            <li>For the cost, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li>Great shaver to keep in the glove compartment.</li>
            <li>This gives a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wanted a more portable item and this Braun certainly is perfect.</li>
            <li>Good job when on the run</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find replacement blade, but at $20 it&#x27;s a good value.  </li>
            <li>Nice size for travel.</li>
            <li>It does a very good job of shaving reasonably close.</li>
            <li>and it is the best, top of the line shaver any company offers.  </li>
            <li>and I love every minute of it.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to bring a spare battery.</li>
            <li>and it will take you more time</li>
            <li>but it does pretty good.</li>
            <li>We do need better technology and more options for permanent hair removal for men because of the damage to skin from any kind of shaving, but this so far is the best we can get for 2012 apparently.  </li>
            <li>After two years, it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get fine hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li>and it gives a close comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>and I bought him a a cheap rotary head.  </li>
            <li>if you wanna shave clean.</li>
            <li>More money needs to be spent on research for better healthcare and more advanced technologies</li>
            <li>They are far to handy to not have one around.</li>
            <li>shave every day I use the Braun Electric two days and do a full shave 3X a week.  </li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!</li>
            <li>I have a heavy beard and this razor is a great itm to keep in the car for afternoon touch ups.  </li>
            <li>The sound of this blazer is really load</li>
            <li>No need to worry about having the right socket to charge it up.  </li>
            <li>The price was ok but every site I went to had the same price or close, after you factored in the cost of shipping.</li>
            <li>Excellent portable small pocket size for travelling with wet/dry option, using only 2 AA battery.  </li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as the larger model did, but it&#x27;s a great replacement for more limited, emergency travel use, and it&#x27;s well worth every single penny for that purpose alone.  </li>
            <li>More powerful than expected for a compact mobile razor.</li>
            <li>I am glad, i bought mine  from Amazon because not only thry offer the lowest price than any other retailor, they also offer excellent customer service based on my past 4 years experiance shopping on line from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I really like the size, and the fact it takes AA</li>
            <li>Well, I am blown away by the price, ease of use, closeness of the shave and the important fact that it uses regular batteries (no charging cords or base)and</li>
            <li>He much preferred my Braun, so I bought him one as well.</li>
            <li>and it was very good)&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I find most companies have the same price it generally infers the company that makes the razor does not allow much discounting.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how the soldier liked it, but my boyfriend loves his.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty good about not cutting my skin or making me bleed, although i have pressed a little hard on the skin by accident and it will cut, just like any crappy shaver out there these days.  </li>
            <li>but for the above price it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Nice for a touch up late in the day or to use in the car if you are in a hurry to get out of the house in the morning.  </li>
            <li>When you can get a new razor for $15 and shipping it does not make any sense to even buy a foil.    </li>
            <li>I will try new batteries.</li>
            <li>I mainly shave with an old DE razor this wont shave that close</li>
            <li>This is my second razor; my first gave me 5 years of service and was still working well.  </li>
            <li>This product not only works as advertised but actually exceeded my expectations, keep in mind you sometimes need to go over the same spot more then once</li>
            <li>My fourteen year old began shaving</li>
            <li>replacement shaver is simple and shaves very close.  </li>
            <li>I had an old one that I used often (on the road a touch up shave after work before going out, etc.</li>
            <li>I also like to pack light and small.</li>
            <li>I bought this cute little green Braun shaver to replace a much fancier Braun model that finally died after nearly 18 years.  </li>
            <li>It is the least expensive, best electric razor ever</li>
            <li>This little razor is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>He keeps it in his car and uses it going down the road and says if it breaks, he wants another one.  </li>
            <li>Thought a new one would provide a closer shave, but I am not certain it was necessary.  </li>
            <li>They take a little time to shave really close,  but it can get the job done.</li>

            <li> speciaally the 7-790cc serious which is the pulsonic shaver</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great razor. Does what it suppose to do. Not whippy at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this cute little green Braun shaver to replace a much fancier Braun model that finally died after nearly 18 years.  This little green one is smaller, lighter, more portable, and much, much less costly.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as closely as the larger model did, but it&#x27;s a great replacement for more limited, emergency travel use, and it&#x27;s well worth every single penny for that purpose alone.  It also works well with rechargeable AA batteries too, which is yet another plus.  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This will be the third one of these I have had. They are a great well thought out design. They take a little time to shave really close,  but it can get the job done. I really like the size, and the fact it takes AA batteries.(no need to charge it) I mainly shave with an old DE razor this wont shave that close but it does pretty good. They are far to handy to not have one around. I have taken mine all over the world. No need to worry about having the right socket to charge it up.  I also like to pack light and small. This fits the bill on both accounts. The fact it is washable does not hurt anything ether.  One very small CON: That is the price of parts.  The only reason I just ordered my third one is because while washing the foil I let the foil go down the drain. Foils are $8.95 plus $6.00 shipping. Braun says the foil and the razor block should be replaced every 18 months (if you use it every day) When you can get a new razor for $15 and shipping it does not make any sense to even buy a foil.    You should get one.</li>
            <li> This little Braun may seem to be a minor bump in the road of shaving in today&#x27;s fast paced world.  Well, I am blown away by the price, ease of use, closeness of the shave and the important fact that it uses regular batteries (no charging cords or base)and that after a month (2 shaves per day) the batteries are still humming along. I bought this to replace and MUCH more expensive electric razor with charging base, triple floating heads, flashing lights and all the do-das they could cram into the package.  I wanted a more portable item and this Braun certainly is perfect. Sold the expensive, big name razor and now utilize only this one. It&#x27;s a razor version of the \\&quot;Energizer Bunny\\&quot;. Buy it, you won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and this razor is a great itm to keep in the car for afternoon touch ups.  Easy to use and clean and it gives a close comfortable shave.  I have not been able to find replacement blade, but at $20 it&#x27;s a good value.  This is my second razor; my first gave me 5 years of service and was still working well.  Thought a new one would provide a closer shave, but I am not certain it was necessary.  Long battery life on 2 AAs.  My fourteen year old began shaving and I bought him a a cheap rotary head.  He much preferred my Braun, so I bought him one as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this razor for travel and I has meet all my needs.  The price was ok but every site I went to had the same price or close, after you factored in the cost of shipping. When I find most companies have the same price it generally infers the company that makes the razor does not allow much discounting.</li>
            <li> Excellent portable small pocket size for travelling with wet/dry option, using only 2 AA battery.  Bruan is an excellent quality shaver, speciaally the 7-790cc serious which is the pulsonic shaver and it is the best, top of the line shaver any company offers.  I am glad, i bought mine  from Amazon because not only thry offer the lowest price than any other retailor, they also offer excellent customer service based on my past 4 years experiance shopping on line from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This little thing is sharp.  I had a cordless panasonic that finally gave out after 18 years.  The panasonic replacement blades weren&#x27;t sharp and then the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold charge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This replacement shaver is simple and shaves very close.  Only negative is this model doesn&#x27;t have a popup sideburn shaver.</li>
            <li> Unless you get lazer hair removal or electrolysis, this is the product to use.  I use it over any corded shavers and just put rechargable alkaline batteries in it, and then i dont have anything to throw away after use.  It is pretty good about not cutting my skin or making me bleed, although i have pressed a little hard on the skin by accident and it will cut, just like any crappy shaver out there these days.  We do need better technology and more options for permanent hair removal for men because of the damage to skin from any kind of shaving, but this so far is the best we can get for 2012 apparently.  More money needs to be spent on research for better healthcare and more advanced technologies</li>

            <li> This little razor is well worth the money. It does a very good job of shaving reasonably close.A great item to keep in your briefcase.</li>
            <li> Great for in between.</li>
            <li> Nice size for travel. Works well even on my tough beard.  Nice for a touch up late in the day or to use in the car if you are in a hurry to get out of the house in the morning.  Takes a little longer to do a thorough job, but that is only because it has the one foil.  More powerful than expected for a compact mobile razor.</li>
            <li> For the cost, it does a great job.  Portable enough to carry for traveling.  Just be sure to bring a spare battery.</li>
            <li> Great shaver to keep in the glove compartment.</li>
            <li> I had an old one that I used often (on the road a touch up shave after work before going out, etc. and it was very good)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;two months back I started shaving my head and rather than do a foam and blade shave every day I use the Braun Electric two days and do a full shave 3X a week.  This gives a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was prompt and efficient too.</li>
            <li> The sound of this blazer is really load and it will take you more time if you wanna shave clean.</li>
            <li> Naturally not as close as a razor but it is acceptable. Doesn&#x27;t get fine hair. Batteries last for about 8-10 shaves.</li>
            <li> Good job when on the run</li>
            <li> I found these on sale somewhere for about $10.00 a few years ago and bought two.  I gave one to my boyfriend and sent one to Afghanistan for the troops. I&#x27;m not sure how the soldier liked it, but my boyfriend loves his.  He keeps it in his car and uses it going down the road and says if it breaks, he wants another one.  After two years, it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Shaves well but power does not run evenly depending on the position of the shaver. I will try new batteries.</li>
