            <li> This is a nice hand creme. Bought an agave for my daughter-in-law and she loves it, it absorbs nicely and has a nice soft scent.  Good natural ingredients and paraben free</li>
            <li> I love this lotion, love the fragrance. I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for it, and this is the only place I can find it now.</li>
            <li> This is my least favorite of all the Thymes products I have used.  Lavender is one of my favorite fragrances but this one didn&#x27;t measure up to my expectations.  In comparison to their Olive Leaf which would be a number 10 on my scale, the Lavender would be a 2.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious, goes on smoothly and absorbs without leaving greasy residue.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and the way it is absorbed</li>
            <li> I love Thymes hand lotion, as it works on dry, rough HANDS without being greasy and the lavender scent is great, not too overpowering.  I have never had a problem with delivery on anything I&#x27;ve ordered from Amazon and this was no exception.</li>
            <li> Received as a gift and now am ordering more!  Love the scent and the way it soothes my dry hands.  Am sensitive to overpowering scents and think this one is NOT overpowering, but very soothing.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend and now ordered from Amazon. Great product with gentle lavender scent! And Amazon service is the best !!</li>
            <li> I love Thymes scents and Lavender is one I associate with evenings and peace.  If you want that feeling, this is for you!</li>
            <li> My wife really likes the scent of lavender  it she said &amp;#34;This smells like old women &amp;#34; She also got hives from it. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it or other products with the same aroma again.</li>
            <li> I loved this lotion. I left it on my bedside table and used it every night. It has a nice subtle scent, not too strong. However, I did find that it took a while to get absorbed into my skin. This didn&#x27;t bother me since I used it before I went to sleep but it definitely isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;d reach for in the morning ( it makes my phone screen greasy).</li>
            <li> I love the Thymes products.  The hand lotions are thick enough to moisturize your hands well but not so thick that they are greasy.  They also smell delicious!  Worth the extra money you pay because it&#x27;s a good quality and great smelling (but not overwhelmingly so) lotion.</li>

            <li> The smell was so bad I had to wash my hands three times to expel it.  It actually made me gag.  I thought I was ordering some nice lotion.  I didn&#x27;t want to smell like a bad grandma.&lt;br /&gt;Skip it.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  The fragrance is just enough to be nice, but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> Fragrance is not as strong as I would like it to be, but it&#x27;s o.k.  Has a good feel and does not leave a sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> I love Thyme&#x27;s Lavender Hand Lotion.  The aroma is delightful and I only wished it lasted longer. I like that it is not greasy.  I like the effects on my hands, arms and legs.  Oh, and my grandson loves the aroma.</li>
            <li> Could it be any gentler, classier, or more beautifully perfumed.  GREAT QUALITY LOTION.  Bottle is kinda cheap-o, but pretty and functions very well.  Pump is great even if plastic is kinda thin.</li>
            <li> Excellent complement to hand wash and gel candle.</li>
            <li> Although it is a matter of taste, this lavender lotion is the most pleasing of any lavender scent out there.</li>
            <li> Great lotion. Smells very good and really moisturizers the skin. Good and relaxing and stays hydrated all day long. Great product</li>
            <li> The very best, lovely lavender lotion! A special treat for me!  It&#x27;s my go-to fragrance and doesn&#x27;t smell like &amp;#34;little old lady&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to anyone who likes the fragrance of lavender.  Leaves hands and body feeling soft, but not greasy.</li>
            <li> I like the larger size container- unfortunately they no longer make it. The fragrance seems to have changed slightly from the prior formulation - it now has a stronger lavender smell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the rave reviews about this lotion. It does not smell like lavender at all to me. Once I put it on my hands the smell was way too strong and smelled like old lady perfume. I had to wash my hands 3 times in order to try to get the scent off completely. What a waste. If you want a good hand lotion that smells like lavender, try the Pre de Provence brand.</li>
            <li> I love all the Thymes products, especially the lavender scents.  How feminine and clean and fresh without being too flowery.  I&#x27;ve been using these for years!  Wendy Lawson</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed in this lotion.  It has a very strong scent&lt;br /&gt;which is NOT lavender.  I will be donating it to a thrift shop.</li>
            <li> not too thick so soaks in the skin very nicely ; smell is great</li>
            <li> I thought This would be a mild smelling lotion. It is not. The fragrance is overwhelming and overpowering, much like a teenager on his first date..</li>
