            <li>the price is super duper great as i can&#x27;t find this in my area anywhere...</li>
            <li>Even then it chips very easily and by the end of the day they will start chipping.  </li>
            <li>Chips very easily too.</li>
            <li>I loved this so much, I ordered two more because I don&#x27;t want to run out anytime soon!!</li>

            <li>I love, love, love the color of this polish!  </li>
            <li>Kleancolor nail polish isn&#x27;t all that great of a brand first off.</li>
            <li>I love this brand and most of their polishes.</li>
            <li>Love the color reflections.</li>
            <li>Mostly lots of orange.</li>
            <li>Interesting, but didn&#x27;t apply &amp; look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>i just had to add more glitter</li>
            <li>Love this</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li>have much more depth.  </li>
            <li>The picture makes chunky holos look more rainbow</li>
            <li>but overall very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>love my nail polish.</li>
            <li>AND IT&#x27;S LIKE MAGIC.</li>
            <li>This polish is absolutely STUNNING.</li>
            <li>more</li>
            <li>I am sooooooo in love with it.</li>
            <li>The finish looks just like you came from the nail salon would give more than 5 stars if i could :-)</li>
            <li>i love it but takes lots of coats</li>
            <li>Would score better if better represented.</li>
            <li>I just received today its ok</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that it would take so many coats to get the color to show up.</li>
            <li>It looks much better in the pics than in person, and all the colors you can see on the bottle, you cannot see on the nail.</li>
            <li>i have to say that i absolutely love this polish....</li>
            <li>I love this brand and the color turned out to be way better</li>
            <li>This brand cost way more in a store and I have found getting offline is way cheaper for the same great quality !</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on this and anticipate to get more when I run out</li>
            <li>My fingers look like 10 lil grade school art class mothers day broaches, its truly a cute affect.  </li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I might wear it a couple more times, but I won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li>then i would love it</li>
            <li>Looks better on my toes then</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>my girls love it too.</li>
            <li>some glitters even say \\&quot;top coat\\</li>
            <li>Okay, so here goes.  </li>
            <li>In order to capture those multichrome colors you have to get the perfect angle, otherwise its just red glitter.  </li>
            <li>Love the effect.</li>
            <li>makes me pleased with this nail polish.</li>
            <li>Cute color</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color and the effect.</li>
            <li>Then 2 coats of the glitter polish followed by a glossy top coat.</li>
            <li>The photo shows it on top of another color</li>
            <li>I gave this polish as a gift (kept one for myself too) and the recipient was very happy, both initially when opening it and after using it on her nails.</li>
            <li>Is neat but mostly shows up as orange and gold glitter.</li>
            <li>Most nail polish smells</li>
            <li>This was such an awesome buy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the color</li>
            <li>Okay so, I&#x27;m a polisholic.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more of a top coat..</li>
            <li>I love it(:</li>
            <li>I had to use 3 coats to be able to see some of the sparkles on my nail bed.</li>
            <li>Maybe that will work better.</li>
            <li>I love the nail polish</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>This polish is ok.</li>
            <li>Looked better in picture.</li>
            <li>Love ‚ù§</li>
            <li>look very trendy and very sparkly love it</li>
            <li>And I was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li>It looks more orange than anything else to me, which is just fine</li>
            <li>With each coat, you get more iridescence if you will, the flecks of color are beautiful, especially in the sunlight, I always get compliments and ask where I got it.</li>
            <li>Fell in love with this from pictures (not just here, googled swatches too) and it was relatively cheap for a holo polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But once on, the holo flakes are nice and colorful and sparkly.</li>
            <li>It really glows in good light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over all still a pretty top coat glitter polish, just not what I was expecting, no rainbow effect!</li>
            <li>but when i got it it smeared off really easy</li>
            <li>glitter).&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly</li>
            <li>it almost doesn&#x27;t look that great with multiple coats on top of a colored coat.</li>
            <li>This looks really nice in photos on the web site; however I gather you need a very good glossy top coat because it&#x27;s really dull once it dries.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s best over dark colors.  </li>
            <li>This looks awesome over dark colors.</li>
            <li>Works wonderful over dark colors.</li>
            <li>best with a black basecoat</li>
            <li>I applied it over a black polish as I&#x27;d read works best.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S SUPER CUTE</li>
            <li>This color really came out nice and it does need to be places over a black nail polish to get the best effect of the glitter.</li>
            <li>but it is still very PRETTY!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s still very pretty and can be paired with any color!</li>
            <li>disapponted but happy for the 5 extra nail polishes i recieved</li>
            <li>This is a great company, I just don&#x27;t recommend this specific polish.</li>
            <li>This polish is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I bought this nail lacquer for my girlfriend and it looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li>payoff is fantastic though.</li>
            <li>UNTIL YOU GET INTO THE LIGHT</li>
            <li>The reds/greens/coppers are all bright and clear.</li>
            <li>If you pay more than a quarter you are not getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency, it is just right</li>
            <li>Beautiful polish, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li>Should be fun!</li>
            <li>First off, it&#x27;s a lovely chunky holo polish!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unique-</li>
            <li>my nails look exactly like the picture with a top coat.</li>
            <li>it look very good over black nail polish</li>
            <li>and I was sure I had given it plenty of time.)&lt;br /&gt;Wrote as much to the seller...</li>
            <li>The price is more than reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Cool effect</li>
            <li>Wanted this one because I have seen what cool manicures can be made with this.</li>
            <li>but its still kinda cool</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cool glitter Polish though.</li>
            <li>It really does look more like holographic flecks than it does glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it will look good on top of black but</li>
            <li>Sometimes if the light hits your hand just right</li>
            <li>Beautiful if you put it on with black background polish, like in the picture.</li>
            <li>which it is a pretty strong smell..</li>
            <li>Looking forward to trying to create something fun and unique with this one.</li>
            <li>If you really want it, go for it because the price is good, but it doesnt show up like the pictures, kind of a let down for me.</li>
            <li>And the shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super</li>
            <li>THEN a high gloss top coat to get the holo affect.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>This color is very pretty and lasts.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.  </li>
            <li>the color is very pretty in the picture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be irritated with myself for not reading the reviews but the polish is really very pretty.  </li>
            <li>Still very pretty</li>
            <li>You have to use a 3-4 coats of this, but the color ends up being really cool and really worth it.</li>
            <li>Looks beautiful over black polish!</li>
            <li>Looks great with black under it, though.</li>
            <li>Looks great over purple and also over black polish</li>
            <li>SO PRETTY I WANNA DIE!</li>
            <li>Overall a good top coat but not so great if mixed with other brand names.</li>
            <li>Exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be!  </li>
            <li>Perfect color just wish the polish wa clear instead of black.</li>
            <li>This is super important because If you put too much at once, it&#x27;ll just clump up and peel off.</li>
            <li>Very nice over black.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get why because it is a nice little top coat.  </li>
            <li>Like in other reviews, it works best when used in light coats that are completely dry before adding another coat.  </li>
            <li>You have to wear a light colour to really see that part of it though.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a clear sparkle coat.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>The bigger glitter pieces kind of just stick together and clump.</li>
            <li>I got some kind of red polish...</li>
            <li>and then you need 2-3 coats of this polish and then a clear coat on top.</li>
            <li>It takes a long time to dry, but otherwise it is very beautiful.</li>
            <li>Other wise i still like it and its really fun looking.</li>
            <li>Shipped and received right away.</li>
            <li>you can see right through it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;M WEARING THIS RIGHT NOW.</li>
            <li>&quot; right on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the only downside is that is has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li>Its pretty but smells funny!</li>
            <li>This polish is a top coat so please try appliying it on top of a black color as a base.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks especially great over black as well as white.  </li>
            <li>I have tried this top coat on several different colors besides black and it looks great on most.</li>
            <li>Once again the listing is very inaccurate but the product is still very pretty.</li>
            <li>VERY fast shipping.</li>
            <li>but it add ssoommee sparkle, not as much as I wished, still pretty though!</li>
            <li>I was really excited to recieve this for a new year manicure.</li>
            <li>Even with a quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li>I tried doing this exactly w/black on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I will experiment with maybe 2 top coats but overall</li>
            <li>go find sunshine and admire your nails because under florescent lighting they won&#x27;t look as pretty.</li>
            <li>The larger pieces of glitter make the holo effect much more evident.  </li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>you do the better the holo effect gets so next time</li>
            <li>(It got messed up the first time</li>
            <li>have more red glitters in them now.</li>
            <li>The color is pretty</li>
            <li>This polish looks nothing like the picture shown it mostly sparkles red and orange and</li>
            <li>The glitter is so pretty has reds,greens and gold.</li>
            <li>This is my first kleancolor polish.</li>
            <li>This polish is a lovely purpley/black based gelly polish with iridescent reflective glitters of different sizes.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it the pictures you see that the seller have up wasn&#x27;t there before and when I contacted him/her said no one ever complain but as I looking at the seller item again I see his picture saying its gel like</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it said it was</li>
            <li>Pretty color, although I haven&#x27;t used it in earnest yet.  </li>
            <li>It has so many different layers to it, every time you look at it you see a different color and the formula is fabulous, too!</li>
            <li>You have to use several coats to get it to cover like the picture (more coats&#x3D;</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m still pleased with it and would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li>Also, I had a problem where the sparkles were hanging off and sticking out of the the nail polish, but maybe I just didn&#x27;t use enough top coat.</li>
            <li>This polish is really pretty</li>
            <li>I will still use it though it is pretty.</li>
            <li>Pretty, wished I knew I had to put on a coat of</li>
            <li>This is a pretty glitter polish.</li>
            <li>But I love this polish just definitely turns a fan on when I use it.</li>
            <li>pretty for Halloween, but not like the picture.</li>
            <li>It is more red than anything else!</li>
            <li>This color was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>Cute &amp; different.</li>
            <li>It cost more to send it back then</li>
            <li>It does not look like the pic,  but it is a pretty manicure.</li>
            <li>This is pretty in the bottle</li>
            <li>but I should have read the reviews first to learn that this color looks nothing like the color from the picture on</li>
            <li>It also last for days without chipping which I love.</li>
            <li>it isn&#x27;t quite what is shown in the picture, more red glitter than anything</li>
            <li>I AM ALWAYS IFFY ABOUT ORDERING NAIL COLOR WITHOUT TESTING IT FIRST.</li>
            <li>Just be aware, it does not have colored polish in it.  </li>
            <li>this color is so pretty</li>
            <li>Just looking at the bottle sitting there, you think it&#x27;s mostly copper, but once you have it on, you can see the different colors.</li>
            <li>The chunky chips do not come out evenly &amp; I have many polishes that I can work with that are made with similar material.</li>
            <li>The Polish was not as pretty as pictured but with about 5 coats you could probably achieve the pictured look</li>
            <li>but i was expecting it to be many different colors.</li>
            <li>and it looks pretty.  </li>
            <li>Nice color but not what was expected.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more red than rainbow.</li>
            <li>It only really look good on black if it went with more colors</li>
            <li>more clear with sparkles than the vivid color in picture</li>
            <li>im disapointed.. not what I expected.. overall not that great</li>
            <li>The only down fall is the smell very strong but like most polishes they all smell.</li>
            <li>This is so pretty and works very well.</li>
            <li>she was surprised and very pumped because of how unique it is.</li>
            <li>I layered it over black and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>because you have to wait for it to dry before you can apply the gelish top coat.  </li>
            <li>The main polish was a nice clear, but 99% of the glitter was red tones.</li>
            <li>Pretty good formula consistency, not too thick.</li>
            <li>Moving your hand a certain way reflects color changes.</li>
            <li>It was harder to get my black polish on good enough to get this on top of it!</li>
            <li>Looks better with a black undercoat, but still not as colorful as the picture.</li>
            <li>it is a clear coat with the sparkles so don&#x27;t be fooled by the black in the picture under over all good nail polish</li>
            <li>Beautiful polish especially over dark colored polishes!!</li>
            <li>and you will see how much of a difference it</li>
            <li>though it looks like one color when viewing from one angle, it actually changes color as the light setting changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like this polish-</li>
            <li>this works better than I had expected</li>
            <li>Very dis pointed</li>
            <li>Over in all they should update the picture because it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>It is translucent pink in color and the holographic effects aren&#x27;t as stunning as in the picture.</li>
            <li>And it came really fast.</li>
            <li>Takes alot of coats to get desired effect, and uyou have to be very patient</li>
            <li>but the shipment was fast</li>
            <li>The picture is much prettier than the reality.</li>
            <li>I would suggest 2 or three coats to really make it pop.</li>
            <li>I really like this.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>The flakes are red/orange and don&#x27;t reflect much color.</li>
            <li>not so much.</li>
            <li>This polish is really more of a glittery topper rather than anything opaque with glitter in it, so be careful.</li>
            <li>CAME IN THE MAIL FAST.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s red no matter what light it&#x27;s under).</li>
            <li>Arrived on time but the color inst much like what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Received product fast.</li>
            <li>After one use the brush also seemed really gunked up..</li>
            <li>but if you turn against the light you see different colors.  </li>
            <li>This would look nice over green polish too.</li>
            <li>To get the full affect, a solid color will need to be put on first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just orange and kind of green depending on the angle.</li>
            <li>Also the polish has a pretty strong chemical odor when wet, so watch out for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sparkles are great and they definitely show and there are large and small.  </li>
            <li>Has a nice mixture of small and large glitter flakes in it.</li>
            <li>I would suggest buying a chunky glitter either for nails or from a craft store and sprinkling it on top of wet dark colored polish instead and top coating it.</li>
            <li>The bottle does look mostly coppery, but at angles you can see the other colors.</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S MORE ORANGE THAN ANY OTHER COLOR.</li>
            <li>The color peels very easy and the way it is down in picture you would think it would come out more black</li>
            <li>It wasnt what I expected I thought it would look like pic showed when u put it on but its actually more of a clearish black top coat</li>
            <li>it looks great especially over black polish!!</li>
            <li>Since I am busy and I cannot spend all day for the polish to dry, it took 2 days to really be able to  know if I did like it.</li>
            <li>its not as it appears much like a clear polish with a lil glitter in it to get desired rusults you would need to first apply black polish then add about 5 layers or more of this polish</li>
            <li>First of all it&#x27;s clear polish.</li>
            <li>PARTY IN A BOTTLE DARK FOR WINTER NEEDGOOD TOP COAT</li>
            <li>my hands... Can appear dark sometimes &amp; colors show at angles, but I like it..  :-)</li>
            <li>It is as pictured, but you do have to view it at different angles and lighting to see the full rainbow of colors.</li>
            <li>It smells worse than most polishes, but it removes just fine despite the glitter.</li>
            <li>The picture is very misleading, making you believe it&#x27;s a nice gradual shift from red-orange to green with some nice yellow and even blue mixed in.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend applying it over a dark color like black for the best effect.</li>
            <li>I put a quick dry top coat, nail dry spray, and a hairdryer to it!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a very pretty color if you&#x27;re willing to wait hours for it to dry.</li>
            <li>OPI Black  2 coats than we put this on to get the look like the picture we used 3 coats of the Holo than a top coat.</li>
            <li>Stunning nail lacquer, it makes your nails look like black opals, you will get lots and lots of compliments on this</li>
            <li>I used two coats of this over two coats of black, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I suggest black and it looks really cute and have gotten lots of compliments.</li>
            <li>so make sure you have black</li>
            <li>It is a very see-through black, so it is best used as a top coat over another dark color like black, grey, brown, or navy.</li>
            <li>it would have to be painted over black polish as a top coat</li>
            <li>You have to use a BLACK under coat to see the sparkles better than just the polish alone.</li>
            <li>It is mostly red in appearance and gives more of a red glitter affect.</li>
            <li>When Applied on the nail it&#x27;s mostly orange red yellow.</li>
            <li>It looks like a bottle full of red goo with glitter in it at first, but if you take it outside or move the bottle around in the light you can see the different colors.  </li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t send it back because it will cost more than I paid to ship back, but I will not recommend purchasing this color.</li>
            <li>very pretty but must apply SEVERAL coats !</li>
            <li>The polish is a bit syrupy and even after I used a quick dry top coat and quick dry spray over it, it still took about 2 hours to completely dry.</li>
            <li>Looks cooler in the bottle, and has a strange smell, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very fast at all, over all it&#x27;s just ok</li>
            <li>This product had high reviews</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it c:</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actual clear lacquer with different color sparkles, not BLACK going on with this product, but it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easily seen in the bottle due to the curved nature of the glass bottle and reflection at 180 degrees</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s pretty, but requires a little more delicacy and care to use than I generally prefer in my polishes.</li>
            <li>I love the metallic colors and a few of their glitters.</li>
            <li>For the love of all things fluffy let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;5)repeat step 4</li>
            <li>mostly orange, and sometimes they shine green.</li>
            <li>I will try it again over Kleancolor metallic red and over my china glaze black leather rather than the other black, as well as with more coats of this on top, but with the clumping factor I don&#x27;t anticipate much better results.</li>
            <li>Didnot live up to my expectation.</li>
            <li>I love how this looks on top of a my crazy colors.  </li>
            <li>SO THE RED ONLY SHOWS IN THE LIGHT.</li>
            <li>The sparkle is not as strong as the picture makes it, even over black nail polish</li>
            <li>I took away a star because it didn&#x27;t look exactly as it does in the picture, but I definitely recommend this nail polish!!!</li>
            <li>No one has time for one coat of color,2 coats of glitter and one coat clear!O have some colors from this brand I bought in the discount store for $1.49.the first pic posted is one coat of glitter ,second pic is 2 coats.still</li>
            <li>the red is pretty but its not what i wanted.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s one of my favorite brands especially because some of the colors stamp nice, but this was hard to get the glitter to drop on the nail, I got a mostly jelly like black polish when I used it and hardly any of the glitter specks would go on the nail.</li>
            <li>This polish comes with multiple sized glitter &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; in a clear (top coat style) polish, JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER GLITTER POLISH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you have trouble applying glitter polishes easily, use a foam makeup applicator - brush the glitter onto the applicator and then press the applicator to your nail.</li>
            <li>This polish is beautiful but you need a base color to make it pop like fun in a bottle.</li>
            <li>The only down side to this polish is that from most angles it appears as a red/orange glitter.</li>
            <li>Beautiful color, will look lovely over dark nail colors like black or dark green.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many people out there actually thought that a glitter polish came with black as the suspension polish.</li>
            <li>You have to polish your nails the black then put this as a top coat for the big chunks of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome over any dark color - especially black!!</li>
            <li>I love the color, but it is hard to use with gelish nail polish and it takes a lot of patience.</li>
            <li>This is a VERY opaque, very light black tinted color &amp; in order for it to be this dark</li>
            <li>I have a pink top coat with pink speckles.</li>
            <li>Its a redish orangeish/ clear color.</li>
            <li>This is a somewhat clear nail polish with sparkles in it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear glitter.  </li>
            <li>it is clear with the glitter in the picture.....</li>
            <li>Product is not how it appears in the picture, it is actually a clear purpleish hue with multifaceted glitter.</li>
            <li>Its just basically a clear coat with glitter in it.</li>
            <li>then followed with a clear coat to seal in the holograph chips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear with colors goes on just not what I thought</li>
            <li>I really like using this with different colors</li>
            <li>it is far lighter when applied than in the bottle</li>
            <li>Bought elsewhere yet buy from Amazon frequently so want to review it here as well.</li>
            <li>Sparkly but not childish.</li>
            <li>I bought this product for my 14 year old niece who loves nail polish and seems to have every shade of nail polish out there.</li>
            <li>I am not a nail professional</li>
            <li>disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Painted on a really deep purple thinking that would make the red/orange really pop.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see if it looks anything at all like the pictures in natural sunlight.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dark tinted translucent glitter polish and the glitter is not even that full.</li>
            <li>I bought 2, the first one had only red and yellow chips and was more reddish coat than black.</li>
            <li>Just make sure the little bits are laying flat and arenas hanging off the edge of your nails</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S COOL BECAUSE THE POLISH LOOKS JUST BLACK</li>
            <li>Looks really cool over black.</li>
            <li>Polish is a little slow to dry and doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really see the greenish shades, though, unless you look at the nails flat, like from the sides.</li>
            <li>This shouldnt be called chunky halo &amp;#34;BLACK&amp;#34; bc its not black.</li>
            <li>Not black.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not black with glitters like it shows and advertises in the picture &amp; description.</li>
            <li>Not black polish with glitter.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not black with glitter</li>
            <li>Very pretty, I apply it on in contrast of black and it look just lik</li>
            <li>clearly didn&#x27;t read what I wrote, I didn&#x27;t complain about the color, but if that&#x27;s such an issue take new photos and update your description.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it a pink top coat with pink and a bit of red specs.</li>
            <li>It is still pretty but not really as holographic as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>but it really only goes from red to green :)</li>
            <li>Pretty, but not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li>word of warning: it is S-L-O-W to dry, so this is definitely not something to put on right before you run out the door.</li>
            <li>Unless you paint your nails black first and use this as a top coat with at least 3 to 4 additional layers.</li>
            <li>Its look like a tinted black nail polish very light with specks of tiny red glitter and big glitter balls.</li>
            <li>Make sure u have black Polish if u buy this other then</li>
            <li>NOT Black at all, more of a dark pink polish with big flecks if glitter in it.</li>
            <li>Its really pretty,  it is able to look like the photo, but only if it has a black or grey bass.</li>
            <li>The only colors I&#x27;ve been able to pull from it are red or green, and only one per angle.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s really tacky, so it takes a while to dry!</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m talking willing to open a soda can dry.&lt;br /&gt;4)apply one coat of the clear glitter polish you just received that&#x27;s pictured above and let it dry.</li>
            <li>it looks like some I got at the Dollar General Store for a dollar.</li>
            <li>Polish is clear with red glitter.</li>
            <li>It is pretty thin and to achieve a good look it needs to be painted over a dark color like black.</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that I felt the odor of the nail polish was really strong.</li>
            <li>u add black first.</li>
            <li>Even painting my nails black first did not help.</li>
            <li>U also must use a black nail polish first</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty, but you do have to use a lot of layers or put it over black.</li>
            <li>black first</li>
            <li>You need to buy a separate bottle of black and apply it first.</li>
            <li>SO that being said, polish your nails first with black and use this as a overcoat.</li>
            <li>but really pretty on black</li>
            <li>It willbe cute for Halloween at least, but its not what I expected.</li>
            <li>and it was still not dry.</li>
            <li>/&gt;anyone who uses glitter effects will know you really won&#x27;t get a good look unless you have a contrasting base coat.  </li>
            <li>Will really pop on dark polishes.  </li>
            <li>We did get this to dry fast by using OPI rapid dry works</li>
            <li>This is really meant to be layered over black, not used alone.</li>
            <li>Over a black base coat this polish is great!</li>
            <li>Love it on top if a black base color</li>
            <li>Only small amounts of the other colors appear in the light.  </li>
            <li>AT CERTAIN ANGLES AND LIGHTING, you can get that blue green.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>

            <li> Amazing .</li>
            <li> This looks great on top of any polish, I am so pleased.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but not as pictured.</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, I love glitter.&lt;br /&gt;Looks amazing on</li>
            <li> it layers nicely.  </li>
            <li> Not as nice as the picture.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> It looks better in the bottle, but looks good on your nails too.</li>
            <li> But with all that it is nice.</li>
            <li> This polish is nice.</li>
            <li> But over all it is nice.</li>

            <li> A Unique Nail Polish at a Great Price.</li>
            <li> She is very pleased with nail polish and her being pleased</li>
            <li> looks great on top of any color...dark or light.</li>
            <li> the price is super duper great as i can&#x27;t find this in my area anywhere...</li>
            <li> Even then it chips very easily and by the end of the day they will start chipping.  </li>
            <li> Chips very easily too.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much, I ordered two more because I don&#x27;t want to run out anytime soon!!</li>
            <li> fast and very good</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the color of this polish!  </li>
            <li> Kleancolor nail polish isn&#x27;t all that great of a brand first off.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and most of their polishes.</li>
            <li> Love the color reflections.</li>
            <li> Mostly lots of orange.</li>
            <li> Interesting, but didn&#x27;t apply &amp; look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> i just had to add more glitter</li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t regret it :)</li>
            <li> have much more depth.  </li>
            <li> The picture makes chunky holos look more rainbow</li>
            <li> but overall very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> love my nail polish.</li>
            <li> AND IT&#x27;S LIKE MAGIC.</li>
            <li> This polish is absolutely STUNNING.</li>
            <li> more</li>
            <li> I am sooooooo in love with it.</li>
            <li> The finish looks just like you came from the nail salon would give more than 5 stars if i could :-)</li>
            <li> i love it but takes lots of coats</li>
            <li> Would score better if better represented.</li>
            <li> I just received today its ok</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that it would take so many coats to get the color to show up.</li>
            <li> It looks much better in the pics than in person, and all the colors you can see on the bottle, you cannot see on the nail.</li>
            <li> i have to say that i absolutely love this polish....</li>
            <li> I love this brand and the color turned out to be way better</li>
            <li> This brand cost way more in a store and I have found getting offline is way cheaper for the same great quality !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on this and anticipate to get more when I run out</li>
            <li> My fingers look like 10 lil grade school art class mothers day broaches, its truly a cute affect.  </li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I might wear it a couple more times, but I won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> then i would love it</li>
            <li> Looks better on my toes then</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> my girls love it too.</li>
            <li> some glitters even say \\&quot;top coat\\</li>
            <li> Okay, so here goes.  </li>
            <li> In order to capture those multichrome colors you have to get the perfect angle, otherwise its just red glitter.  </li>
            <li> Love the effect.</li>
            <li> makes me pleased with this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Cute color</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the effect.</li>
            <li> Then 2 coats of the glitter polish followed by a glossy top coat.</li>
            <li> The photo shows it on top of another color</li>
            <li> I gave this polish as a gift (kept one for myself too) and the recipient was very happy, both initially when opening it and after using it on her nails.</li>
            <li> Is neat but mostly shows up as orange and gold glitter.</li>
            <li> Most nail polish smells</li>
            <li> This was such an awesome buy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love the color</li>
            <li> Okay so, I&#x27;m a polisholic.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a top coat..</li>
            <li> I love it(:</li>
            <li> I had to use 3 coats to be able to see some of the sparkles on my nail bed.</li>
            <li> Maybe that will work better.</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> This polish is ok.</li>
            <li> Looked better in picture.</li>
            <li> Love ‚ù§</li>
            <li> look very trendy and very sparkly love it</li>
            <li> And I was very excited to try it.  </li>
            <li> It looks more orange than anything else to me, which is just fine</li>
            <li> With each coat, you get more iridescence if you will, the flecks of color are beautiful, especially in the sunlight, I always get compliments and ask where I got it.</li>
            <li> Fell in love with this from pictures (not just here, googled swatches too) and it was relatively cheap for a holo polish.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But once on, the holo flakes are nice and colorful and sparkly.</li>
            <li> It really glows in good light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over all still a pretty top coat glitter polish, just not what I was expecting, no rainbow effect!</li>
            <li> but when i got it it smeared off really easy</li>
            <li> glitter).&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly</li>
            <li> it almost doesn&#x27;t look that great with multiple coats on top of a colored coat.</li>
            <li> This looks really nice in photos on the web site; however I gather you need a very good glossy top coat because it&#x27;s really dull once it dries.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s best over dark colors.  </li>
            <li> This looks awesome over dark colors.</li>
            <li> Works wonderful over dark colors.</li>
            <li> best with a black basecoat</li>
            <li> I applied it over a black polish as I&#x27;d read works best.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S SUPER CUTE</li>
            <li> This color really came out nice and it does need to be places over a black nail polish to get the best effect of the glitter.</li>
            <li> but it is still very PRETTY!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s still very pretty and can be paired with any color!</li>
            <li> disapponted but happy for the 5 extra nail polishes i recieved</li>
            <li> This is a great company, I just don&#x27;t recommend this specific polish.</li>
            <li> This polish is fabulous.</li>
            <li> I bought this nail lacquer for my girlfriend and it looks fantastic.  </li>
            <li> payoff is fantastic though.</li>
            <li> UNTIL YOU GET INTO THE LIGHT</li>
            <li> The reds/greens/coppers are all bright and clear.</li>
            <li> If you pay more than a quarter you are not getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> I love the consistency, it is just right</li>
            <li> Beautiful polish, just not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Should be fun!</li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s a lovely chunky holo polish!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unique-</li>
            <li> my nails look exactly like the picture with a top coat.</li>
            <li> it look very good over black nail polish</li>
            <li> and I was sure I had given it plenty of time.)&lt;br /&gt;Wrote as much to the seller...</li>
            <li> The price is more than reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Cool effect</li>
            <li> Wanted this one because I have seen what cool manicures can be made with this.</li>
            <li> but its still kinda cool</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cool glitter Polish though.</li>
            <li> It really does look more like holographic flecks than it does glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it will look good on top of black but</li>
            <li> Sometimes if the light hits your hand just right</li>
            <li> Beautiful if you put it on with black background polish, like in the picture.</li>
            <li> which it is a pretty strong smell..</li>
            <li> Looking forward to trying to create something fun and unique with this one.</li>
            <li> If you really want it, go for it because the price is good, but it doesnt show up like the pictures, kind of a let down for me.</li>
            <li> And the shipping was quick as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super</li>
            <li> THEN a high gloss top coat to get the holo affect.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty and lasts.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  </li>
            <li> the color is very pretty in the picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be irritated with myself for not reading the reviews but the polish is really very pretty.  </li>
            <li> Still very pretty</li>
            <li> You have to use a 3-4 coats of this, but the color ends up being really cool and really worth it.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful over black polish!</li>
            <li> Looks great with black under it, though.</li>
            <li> Looks great over purple and also over black polish</li>
            <li> SO PRETTY I WANNA DIE!</li>
            <li> Overall a good top coat but not so great if mixed with other brand names.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be!  </li>
            <li> Perfect color just wish the polish wa clear instead of black.</li>
            <li> This is super important because If you put too much at once, it&#x27;ll just clump up and peel off.</li>
            <li> Very nice over black.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get why because it is a nice little top coat.  </li>
            <li> Like in other reviews, it works best when used in light coats that are completely dry before adding another coat.  </li>
            <li> You have to wear a light colour to really see that part of it though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more of a clear sparkle coat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> The bigger glitter pieces kind of just stick together and clump.</li>
            <li> I got some kind of red polish...</li>
            <li> and then you need 2-3 coats of this polish and then a clear coat on top.</li>
            <li> It takes a long time to dry, but otherwise it is very beautiful.</li>
            <li> Other wise i still like it and its really fun looking.</li>
            <li> Shipped and received right away.</li>
            <li> you can see right through it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M WEARING THIS RIGHT NOW.</li>
            <li> &quot; right on them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the only downside is that is has a very strong smell.</li>
            <li> Its pretty but smells funny!</li>
            <li> This polish is a top coat so please try appliying it on top of a black color as a base.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks especially great over black as well as white.  </li>
            <li> I have tried this top coat on several different colors besides black and it looks great on most.</li>
            <li> Once again the listing is very inaccurate but the product is still very pretty.</li>
            <li> VERY fast shipping.</li>
            <li> but it add ssoommee sparkle, not as much as I wished, still pretty though!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to recieve this for a new year manicure.</li>
            <li> Even with a quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> I tried doing this exactly w/black on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I will experiment with maybe 2 top coats but overall</li>
            <li> go find sunshine and admire your nails because under florescent lighting they won&#x27;t look as pretty.</li>
            <li> The larger pieces of glitter make the holo effect much more evident.  </li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> you do the better the holo effect gets so next time</li>
            <li> (It got messed up the first time</li>
            <li> have more red glitters in them now.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty</li>
            <li> This polish looks nothing like the picture shown it mostly sparkles red and orange and</li>
            <li> The glitter is so pretty has reds,greens and gold.</li>
            <li> This is my first kleancolor polish.</li>
            <li> This polish is a lovely purpley/black based gelly polish with iridescent reflective glitters of different sizes.</li>
            <li> The first time I bought it the pictures you see that the seller have up wasn&#x27;t there before and when I contacted him/her said no one ever complain but as I looking at the seller item again I see his picture saying its gel like</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it said it was</li>
            <li> Pretty color, although I haven&#x27;t used it in earnest yet.  </li>
            <li> It has so many different layers to it, every time you look at it you see a different color and the formula is fabulous, too!</li>
            <li> You have to use several coats to get it to cover like the picture (more coats&#x3D;</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m still pleased with it and would definitely buy it again!</li>
            <li> Also, I had a problem where the sparkles were hanging off and sticking out of the the nail polish, but maybe I just didn&#x27;t use enough top coat.</li>
            <li> This polish is really pretty</li>
            <li> I will still use it though it is pretty.</li>
            <li> Pretty, wished I knew I had to put on a coat of</li>
            <li> This is a pretty glitter polish.</li>
            <li> But I love this polish just definitely turns a fan on when I use it.</li>
            <li> pretty for Halloween, but not like the picture.</li>
            <li> It is more red than anything else!</li>
            <li> This color was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> Cute &amp; different.</li>
            <li> It cost more to send it back then</li>
            <li> It does not look like the pic,  but it is a pretty manicure.</li>
            <li> This is pretty in the bottle</li>
            <li> but I should have read the reviews first to learn that this color looks nothing like the color from the picture on</li>
            <li> It also last for days without chipping which I love.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t quite what is shown in the picture, more red glitter than anything</li>
            <li> I AM ALWAYS IFFY ABOUT ORDERING NAIL COLOR WITHOUT TESTING IT FIRST.</li>
            <li> Just be aware, it does not have colored polish in it.  </li>
            <li> this color is so pretty</li>
            <li> Just looking at the bottle sitting there, you think it&#x27;s mostly copper, but once you have it on, you can see the different colors.</li>
            <li> The chunky chips do not come out evenly &amp; I have many polishes that I can work with that are made with similar material.</li>
            <li> The Polish was not as pretty as pictured but with about 5 coats you could probably achieve the pictured look</li>
            <li> but i was expecting it to be many different colors.</li>
            <li> and it looks pretty.  </li>
            <li> Nice color but not what was expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more red than rainbow.</li>
            <li> It only really look good on black if it went with more colors</li>
            <li> more clear with sparkles than the vivid color in picture</li>
            <li> im disapointed.. not what I expected.. overall not that great</li>
            <li> The only down fall is the smell very strong but like most polishes they all smell.</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and works very well.</li>
            <li> she was surprised and very pumped because of how unique it is.</li>
            <li> I layered it over black and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> because you have to wait for it to dry before you can apply the gelish top coat.  </li>
            <li> The main polish was a nice clear, but 99% of the glitter was red tones.</li>
            <li> Pretty good formula consistency, not too thick.</li>
            <li> Moving your hand a certain way reflects color changes.</li>
            <li> It was harder to get my black polish on good enough to get this on top of it!</li>
            <li> Looks better with a black undercoat, but still not as colorful as the picture.</li>
            <li> it is a clear coat with the sparkles so don&#x27;t be fooled by the black in the picture under over all good nail polish</li>
            <li> Beautiful polish especially over dark colored polishes!!</li>
            <li> and you will see how much of a difference it</li>
            <li> though it looks like one color when viewing from one angle, it actually changes color as the light setting changes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like this polish-</li>
            <li> this works better than I had expected</li>
            <li> Very dis pointed</li>
            <li> Over in all they should update the picture because it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> It is translucent pink in color and the holographic effects aren&#x27;t as stunning as in the picture.</li>
            <li> And it came really fast.</li>
            <li> Takes alot of coats to get desired effect, and uyou have to be very patient</li>
            <li> but the shipment was fast</li>
            <li> The picture is much prettier than the reality.</li>
            <li> I would suggest 2 or three coats to really make it pop.</li>
            <li> I really like this.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> The flakes are red/orange and don&#x27;t reflect much color.</li>
            <li> not so much.</li>
            <li> This polish is really more of a glittery topper rather than anything opaque with glitter in it, so be careful.</li>
            <li> CAME IN THE MAIL FAST.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s red no matter what light it&#x27;s under).</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but the color inst much like what I was expecting.</li>
            <li> Received product fast.</li>
            <li> After one use the brush also seemed really gunked up..</li>
            <li> but if you turn against the light you see different colors.  </li>
            <li> This would look nice over green polish too.</li>
            <li> To get the full affect, a solid color will need to be put on first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just orange and kind of green depending on the angle.</li>
            <li> Also the polish has a pretty strong chemical odor when wet, so watch out for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sparkles are great and they definitely show and there are large and small.  </li>
            <li> Has a nice mixture of small and large glitter flakes in it.</li>
            <li> I would suggest buying a chunky glitter either for nails or from a craft store and sprinkling it on top of wet dark colored polish instead and top coating it.</li>
            <li> The bottle does look mostly coppery, but at angles you can see the other colors.</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S MORE ORANGE THAN ANY OTHER COLOR.</li>
            <li> The color peels very easy and the way it is down in picture you would think it would come out more black</li>
            <li> It wasnt what I expected I thought it would look like pic showed when u put it on but its actually more of a clearish black top coat</li>
            <li> it looks great especially over black polish!!</li>
            <li> Since I am busy and I cannot spend all day for the polish to dry, it took 2 days to really be able to  know if I did like it.</li>
            <li> its not as it appears much like a clear polish with a lil glitter in it to get desired rusults you would need to first apply black polish then add about 5 layers or more of this polish</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s clear polish.</li>
            <li> PARTY IN A BOTTLE DARK FOR WINTER NEEDGOOD TOP COAT</li>
            <li> my hands... Can appear dark sometimes &amp; colors show at angles, but I like it..  :-)</li>
            <li> It is as pictured, but you do have to view it at different angles and lighting to see the full rainbow of colors.</li>
            <li> It smells worse than most polishes, but it removes just fine despite the glitter.</li>
            <li> The picture is very misleading, making you believe it&#x27;s a nice gradual shift from red-orange to green with some nice yellow and even blue mixed in.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend applying it over a dark color like black for the best effect.</li>
            <li> I put a quick dry top coat, nail dry spray, and a hairdryer to it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a very pretty color if you&#x27;re willing to wait hours for it to dry.</li>
            <li> OPI Black  2 coats than we put this on to get the look like the picture we used 3 coats of the Holo than a top coat.</li>
            <li> Stunning nail lacquer, it makes your nails look like black opals, you will get lots and lots of compliments on this</li>
            <li> I used two coats of this over two coats of black, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I suggest black and it looks really cute and have gotten lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> so make sure you have black</li>
            <li> It is a very see-through black, so it is best used as a top coat over another dark color like black, grey, brown, or navy.</li>
            <li> it would have to be painted over black polish as a top coat</li>
            <li> You have to use a BLACK under coat to see the sparkles better than just the polish alone.</li>
            <li> It is mostly red in appearance and gives more of a red glitter affect.</li>
            <li> When Applied on the nail it&#x27;s mostly orange red yellow.</li>
            <li> It looks like a bottle full of red goo with glitter in it at first, but if you take it outside or move the bottle around in the light you can see the different colors.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t send it back because it will cost more than I paid to ship back, but I will not recommend purchasing this color.</li>
            <li> very pretty but must apply SEVERAL coats !</li>
            <li> The polish is a bit syrupy and even after I used a quick dry top coat and quick dry spray over it, it still took about 2 hours to completely dry.</li>
            <li> Looks cooler in the bottle, and has a strange smell, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very fast at all, over all it&#x27;s just ok</li>
            <li> This product had high reviews</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it c:</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actual clear lacquer with different color sparkles, not BLACK going on with this product, but it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easily seen in the bottle due to the curved nature of the glass bottle and reflection at 180 degrees</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s pretty, but requires a little more delicacy and care to use than I generally prefer in my polishes.</li>
            <li> I love the metallic colors and a few of their glitters.</li>
            <li> For the love of all things fluffy let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;5)repeat step 4</li>
            <li> mostly orange, and sometimes they shine green.</li>
            <li> I will try it again over Kleancolor metallic red and over my china glaze black leather rather than the other black, as well as with more coats of this on top, but with the clumping factor I don&#x27;t anticipate much better results.</li>
            <li> Didnot live up to my expectation.</li>
            <li> I love how this looks on top of a my crazy colors.  </li>
            <li> SO THE RED ONLY SHOWS IN THE LIGHT.</li>
            <li> The sparkle is not as strong as the picture makes it, even over black nail polish</li>
            <li> I took away a star because it didn&#x27;t look exactly as it does in the picture, but I definitely recommend this nail polish!!!</li>
            <li> No one has time for one coat of color,2 coats of glitter and one coat clear!O have some colors from this brand I bought in the discount store for $1.49.the first pic posted is one coat of glitter ,second pic is 2 coats.still</li>
            <li> the red is pretty but its not what i wanted.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s one of my favorite brands especially because some of the colors stamp nice, but this was hard to get the glitter to drop on the nail, I got a mostly jelly like black polish when I used it and hardly any of the glitter specks would go on the nail.</li>
            <li> This polish comes with multiple sized glitter &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; in a clear (top coat style) polish, JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER GLITTER POLISH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you have trouble applying glitter polishes easily, use a foam makeup applicator - brush the glitter onto the applicator and then press the applicator to your nail.</li>
            <li> This polish is beautiful but you need a base color to make it pop like fun in a bottle.</li>
            <li> The only down side to this polish is that from most angles it appears as a red/orange glitter.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, will look lovely over dark nail colors like black or dark green.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many people out there actually thought that a glitter polish came with black as the suspension polish.</li>
            <li> You have to polish your nails the black then put this as a top coat for the big chunks of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome over any dark color - especially black!!</li>
            <li> I love the color, but it is hard to use with gelish nail polish and it takes a lot of patience.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY opaque, very light black tinted color &amp; in order for it to be this dark</li>
            <li> I have a pink top coat with pink speckles.</li>
            <li> Its a redish orangeish/ clear color.</li>
            <li> This is a somewhat clear nail polish with sparkles in it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear glitter.  </li>
            <li> it is clear with the glitter in the picture.....</li>
            <li> Product is not how it appears in the picture, it is actually a clear purpleish hue with multifaceted glitter.</li>
            <li> Its just basically a clear coat with glitter in it.</li>
            <li> then followed with a clear coat to seal in the holograph chips.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear with colors goes on just not what I thought</li>
            <li> I really like using this with different colors</li>
            <li> it is far lighter when applied than in the bottle</li>
            <li> Bought elsewhere yet buy from Amazon frequently so want to review it here as well.</li>
            <li> Sparkly but not childish.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my 14 year old niece who loves nail polish and seems to have every shade of nail polish out there.</li>
            <li> I am not a nail professional</li>
            <li> disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Painted on a really deep purple thinking that would make the red/orange really pop.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it looks anything at all like the pictures in natural sunlight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dark tinted translucent glitter polish and the glitter is not even that full.</li>
            <li> I bought 2, the first one had only red and yellow chips and was more reddish coat than black.</li>
            <li> Just make sure the little bits are laying flat and arenas hanging off the edge of your nails</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S COOL BECAUSE THE POLISH LOOKS JUST BLACK</li>
            <li> Looks really cool over black.</li>
            <li> Polish is a little slow to dry and doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really see the greenish shades, though, unless you look at the nails flat, like from the sides.</li>
            <li> This shouldnt be called chunky halo &amp;#34;BLACK&amp;#34; bc its not black.</li>
            <li> Not black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not black with glitters like it shows and advertises in the picture &amp; description.</li>
            <li> Not black polish with glitter.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not black with glitter</li>
            <li> Very pretty, I apply it on in contrast of black and it look just lik</li>
            <li> clearly didn&#x27;t read what I wrote, I didn&#x27;t complain about the color, but if that&#x27;s such an issue take new photos and update your description.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it a pink top coat with pink and a bit of red specs.</li>
            <li> It is still pretty but not really as holographic as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> but it really only goes from red to green :)</li>
            <li> Pretty, but not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> word of warning: it is S-L-O-W to dry, so this is definitely not something to put on right before you run out the door.</li>
            <li> Unless you paint your nails black first and use this as a top coat with at least 3 to 4 additional layers.</li>
            <li> Its look like a tinted black nail polish very light with specks of tiny red glitter and big glitter balls.</li>
            <li> Make sure u have black Polish if u buy this other then</li>
            <li> NOT Black at all, more of a dark pink polish with big flecks if glitter in it.</li>
            <li> Its really pretty,  it is able to look like the photo, but only if it has a black or grey bass.</li>
            <li> The only colors I&#x27;ve been able to pull from it are red or green, and only one per angle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s really tacky, so it takes a while to dry!</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m talking willing to open a soda can dry.&lt;br /&gt;4)apply one coat of the clear glitter polish you just received that&#x27;s pictured above and let it dry.</li>
            <li> it looks like some I got at the Dollar General Store for a dollar.</li>
            <li> Polish is clear with red glitter.</li>
            <li> It is pretty thin and to achieve a good look it needs to be painted over a dark color like black.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that I felt the odor of the nail polish was really strong.</li>
            <li> u add black first.</li>
            <li> Even painting my nails black first did not help.</li>
            <li> U also must use a black nail polish first</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but you do have to use a lot of layers or put it over black.</li>
            <li> black first</li>
            <li> You need to buy a separate bottle of black and apply it first.</li>
            <li> SO that being said, polish your nails first with black and use this as a overcoat.</li>
            <li> but really pretty on black</li>
            <li> It willbe cute for Halloween at least, but its not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and it was still not dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;anyone who uses glitter effects will know you really won&#x27;t get a good look unless you have a contrasting base coat.  </li>
            <li> Will really pop on dark polishes.  </li>
            <li> We did get this to dry fast by using OPI rapid dry works</li>
            <li> This is really meant to be layered over black, not used alone.</li>
            <li> Over a black base coat this polish is great!</li>
            <li> Love it on top if a black base color</li>
            <li> Only small amounts of the other colors appear in the light.  </li>
            <li> AT CERTAIN ANGLES AND LIGHTING, you can get that blue green.</li>
            <li> Although I love it, it takes WAY too long to dry as the coat is very thick.</li>
            <li> I put a black base down, and this on top, and all I can really see red glitter pop out when light shines on it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gorgeous over a black base because its pretty translucent.</li>
            <li> Pink suspension, not black.</li>
            <li> first, as with any \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; polish or gel...or any polish or gel with pieces of anything suspended in it...if the base gel were a solid colour, the pieces would most likely not be visible.  </li>
            <li> It completely overpowered the other colors.  </li>
            <li> polish you have recieved is the correct one - all the new batches of Holy Black 236&#x27;s from Kleancolor</li>
            <li> after a black base coat Loved it solo much</li>
            <li> It is shown and described as black with multi color glitter but was clear with red glitter.</li>
            <li> It is very transparent and multiple coats will need to be applied to a dark black polish to accomplish  some</li>
            <li> The nail polish says halo black but comes out clear.</li>
            <li> it was just some clear polish with red and green flakes on it</li>
            <li> I really like this but be sure that you use a base coat before painting the Holo on.</li>
            <li> You will definitely need to apply a solid dark color prior to applying Kleancolor or you will not get the desired effect.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is that it takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> This is just clear polish with a little sparkles in it.</li>
            <li> Only gives off a reddish color, not very holo.</li>
            <li> The green and yellow colors barely show.</li>
            <li> Over a dark base coat, two layers gives you a great effect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks great with a black base coat.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a different color, but it turned out to be the same chunky holo black I ordered before they tricked me</li>
            <li> All of the coats take a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> Takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> glitter polish is no different than any other I have in regards to ease of application.</li>
            <li> As one of the other reviewers stated, this is red !</li>
            <li> It looks like chunky red glitter (not exactly like their pic)</li>
            <li> and it still isn&#x27;t dry.</li>
            <li> takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> So I waited until each coat was completely dry before doing another coat.</li>
            <li> And takes for EVER TO dry</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t get it to dry.....</li>
            <li> but when i paint it on my nails the only colors that i can ever see is red, yellow, little bit of green and blue but barely, but the coating was black instead of reddish color, pluse both have an odd smell before it dries.</li>
            <li> Definitely needs a dark undercoat.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was a bit disappointed with it.  </li>
            <li> I tried it with different base coats and am starting to like it more.</li>
            <li> you also need a dark under coat, and by the time you get as much glitter on as you want, the nail polish is so thick and wont dry.</li>
            <li> holographic, the only time you see the other colors (green, gold) is when you tilt the actual bottle and catch a glimpse sideways.</li>
            <li> takes forever to dry and harden !</li>
            <li> ONLY GET TO GO OVER BLACK POLISH</li>
            <li> But I will try it with a black under coat next time</li>
            <li> it showed black with red flakes in it.</li>
            <li> YOU HAVE TO PUT BLACK UNDERCOTE IN ORBER TO GET THIS VISUAL.</li>
            <li> Is NOT solid black.</li>
            <li> I used over a coat of black nail polish, but all that shows up is orange glitter only.  </li>
            <li> I have put this over white, black, pink, and even paper.</li>
            <li> so it was a little earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> To get the look from the picture you have to carefully go about</li>
            <li> STILL WET</li>
            <li> I had did a white polish on all nails with designs on a few.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen green or yellow flakes.</li>
            <li> not the color i expected.  </li>
            <li> you never really achieve this look</li>
            <li> then I had expected.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> not really a rainbow.</li>
            <li> Expected this to look like the photo.</li>
            <li> Looks pink on.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll see some yellow and green shimmer in the polish.  </li>
            <li> Came sooner than expected.  </li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the picture, and did not get anything i expected.</li>
            <li> However, it did arrive before expected.</li>
            <li> but I put one layer over my nails and after an hour it still hadn&#x27;t dried even after I had to cut hair dryer on a low setting and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Especially blue and green.  </li>
            <li> Obviously you will need a base coat and a top coat...</li>
            <li> In addition, I think I received an old bottle because mine was thick and went on goopy.</li>
            <li> Although it needs a base coat to look like shown in the photo, I liked this lacquer.</li>
            <li> Put a coat of black or dark green behind this color and it looks fantastic</li>
            <li> This is red nothing black about it!</li>
            <li> only were way it will show is with a dark black color under it...</li>
            <li> Luckily after the second coat it&#x27;s almost impossible to chip.</li>
            <li> I usually start with one coat of this polish, then add the next coat a few days later.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s mostly pink, with a glimmer of other colors.</li>
            <li> I was only sad that its not as thick and full coverage as the picture shows.</li>
            <li> I used one coat of black, let it dry and then applied this.</li>
            <li> I waited an hour and a half for it to dry</li>
            <li> With black you see more of the rainbow effect, but I am still trying different base colors.  </li>
            <li> another notes, looks nice on dark color nail polish base.</li>
            <li> I used a matte black polish, single coat.</li>
            <li> Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> the sequence was not pretty.</li>
            <li> Anxious to try different combinations.</li>
            <li> I like it and will try other colors.</li>
            <li> Other than that.</li>
            <li> Received by due date.  </li>
            <li> I think you would need a black base coat to come close and even then the glitter doesn&#x27;t really change as much as in the picture.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it hard to get the big pieces of glitter to stick.</li>
            <li> It only shows well on a black base coat and the color is mostly a rich burgundy.</li>
            <li> not worth your money</li>
            <li> I thought it had that dark look</li>
            <li> but it will give it a dark tinge.  </li>
            <li> it was so thin when applied its almost clear.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> I use it with a dark nail polish and it just makes the polish pop.</li>
            <li> This polish doesnt go on as dark as it shows, so its not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> The darker the base and the more coats</li>
            <li> Update: it&#x27;s not as holographic on a red base, but still looks cool.</li>
            <li> So it works with any color as base (darker is better, though).</li>
            <li> I put it on top of some nail polish and it was still crap.</li>
            <li> I love this even though you need a base coat with it</li>
            <li> First, put a dark base coat like dark blue or black and let it dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any of the other colors that the picture shows!</li>
            <li> You need to have a black or dark color under it because of the black tint of this polish.</li>
            <li> I may try this on a several new base colors but  not necessary black.</li>
            <li> I had to put 4 coats of the chunky holo black policy on</li>
            <li> I put one coat over 2 coats of black and it didn&#x27;t look like in the picture.</li>
            <li> It does not come out like the picture at all unless you put black under it.  </li>
            <li> the polish looks in the picture like its black with chunky holo glitters in it.</li>
            <li> and you have to cover over with black nail polish.</li>
            <li> I USE IT OVER BLACK POLISH</li>
            <li> There has to be black polish underneath this polish to make it look anything like the picture</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the base of the polish isn&#x27;t black, mine is a light pink with chunky holo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course the color isn&#x27;t black like the nails but</li>
            <li> I used black underneath and the end result was like the picture.</li>
            <li> I guess to get the look of the picture you have to paint a black under coat cause when I painted my nails</li>
            <li> keep in mind all of you who say it doesn&#x27;t go on black, that the glitter wouldn&#x27;t show in black polish.</li>
            <li> the polish itself is not superthick or gunky, so you can get away with 2 coats of it over the black.  </li>
            <li> Not as described at all and seller said it HAD to be applied over black to get the effect.</li>
            <li> Even over black I couldn&#x27;t get it to look this &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> It does not look anything like the picture once you put it on over black nail polish.</li>
            <li> u need to polish nails black</li>
            <li> but I had to add black under it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing remotely black about this nail polish.  </li>
            <li> think they should show a nail with just the product in question along with the black painted nail, and remove the word &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; from the bottle.</li>
            <li> The picture is over black nail polish.</li>
            <li> A dark base coat color (so far I&#x27;ve tried blue, black, and red) and two coats of glitter give a look close to the image shown on here.</li>
            <li> the ad did not state that they had used a different polish as a base coat or else I wouldn&#x27;t have just ordered clear polish with green and red Christmas flakes in it.</li>
            <li> The picture is a little misleading.  </li>
            <li> The base coat can be Dark red or Green, or brown, as long as its dark enough for the colors to contrast.</li>
            <li> the product never even dried,.</li>
            <li> A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE ALONE.</li>
            <li> My item came within just a few days of ordering.</li>
            <li> and it hadn&#x27;t dried</li>
            <li> It goes on thick, so be careful.</li>
            <li> No blues, green, yellows, etc.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> To achieve the shift from orange to green, you basically have to angle your nails</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a heavy duty nail dryer or patience...</li>
            <li> I will try a few diffrent things and maybe it will work.</li>
            <li> this is not very black, you have to use a black base to get what the picture shows and at least 4 coats for that much glitter.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also added a few photos in case anyone wanted to see the end effects of putting two coats of this polish over one coat of black!</li>
            <li> just use over black !</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like other nail polish you buy at the store where you hardly get any sparkle on your nail.  </li>
            <li> Like it was stiff.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and not easy to paint nails with.</li>
            <li> I dabbed some of the polish into a small container and added a tiny bit of acetone to try and thin it.</li>
            <li> Put on a THIN coat of this glitter polish and let it dry.</li>
            <li> first, if you have to use a black base then the directions/information should have had said that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s due to being old, a bad formula or counterfeit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ultimately, this polish requires very little work for a chic look.</li>
            <li> SO I HOPE YOU LIKE PINK!!!!</li>
            <li> The small particles do.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m not sure how it will look over all colors</li>
            <li> It has to have a base coat, then the color black or dark color like dark blue.</li>
            <li> This nail polish came very heavy.</li>
            <li> and the smell does not smell any worse than the other polish that I use.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell any worse than any other polish.</li>
            <li> I just receive this package the other day and it did not come up leak or broken</li>
            <li> It does tend to tint red, but the different sized sparkles the base colors</li>
            <li> But making my nails look like the picture was near impossible.</li>
            <li> Did not get the chunky Holo Black got some ugly blue polish that I immediately threw in the trash</li>
            <li> it is to hard to explain over a computer.</li>
            <li> I am hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> what of the affect of what is portrayed in this pic...;( and at that the glitter is hard to get off the brush..</li>
            <li> The polish holding the glitter is dull finish.</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to manage once the air hits it.</li>
            <li> Big disappointment on my birthday.</li>
            <li> I had to stop adding costs because it was making my nails look so thick.</li>
            <li> but polish is too thick.</li>
            <li> Although it&#x27;s thick.</li>
            <li> Goes on unbelievably thick and NEVER dries.</li>
            <li> but its so thick</li>
            <li> OR IT IS A SEE THRU GREY UGLY COLOR, OVER BLACK POLISH</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m the girl known for changing nail polish ever few days, but I kept this on for a WEEK!!</li>
            <li> Difficult to see over any other color.</li>
            <li> Disappointed you don&#x27;t get what you see,it&#x27;s an illusion like an infomercial,I feel tricked completely!</li>
            <li> black gives it.&lt;br /&gt;3)apply desired amount of base color and let it dry all the way</li>
            <li> but this nail polish again it sucks!</li>
            <li> The only thing I was disappointed with using this polish was the drying time.  </li>
            <li> And it goes on really really thick!</li>
            <li> VERY hard to see the sparkles.</li>
            <li> After 30 mins it adhered to my base coat and became a moldable blob as it would not dry.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is very thick when it goes on.</li>
            <li> I decided to put it over a white base.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m going to try it with a red or orange base.   </li>
            <li> So thin it would take 10 coats to get the sparkle coverage, like in the picture.</li>
            <li> but i had worst.. wont be using it much..</li>
            <li> therefore, these polishes/gels are usually thin to allow the pieces to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Read the reviews my polish so thin</li>
            <li> To me its false advertisement.</li>
            <li> ridiculous!</li>
            <li> This is a CLEAR polish with glitter, you must put a base coat!!</li>
            <li> a dark base coat, I like the look</li>
            <li> Granted you have to base your nail with a dark color before applying this polish but once all is done</li>
            <li> you just have to use a Black base to get the picture shown.</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a black to the Base.</li>
            <li> a black base coat and 2 coats of this polish</li>
            <li> I do suggest a darker color for a base coat, but the photo advertised is very unlikely without several coats.</li>
            <li> When I twisted the lid off the cap came off the brush.  </li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I am not impressed.</li>
            <li> You need to apply an unrealistic amount coats to obtain the look in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Wrong.</li>
            <li> I received the wrong item because what is displayed is not the colors you see.</li>
            <li> This is a very thin grey-ish background.  </li>
            <li> I was not happy and I am very disappointed :/</li>
            <li> and then you are talking about at least 4 coats of polish plus base coat.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s crazy...</li>
            <li> the smell i am not too crazy about BUT will endure it for the look.  </li>
            <li> To use it alone would &#x3D; frustration and disappointment.</li>
            <li> Rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> If you do put on layers to get it to look like the picture, its at least 5, and then it looks horrible.</li>
            <li> to use it is not like the photo, it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sad with this buy.</li>
            <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad for the product.  </li>
            <li> This polish smells SO BAD.</li>
            <li> but after receiving I&#x27;m a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it looks nothing like the photo</li>
            <li> So disappointed and it never dries</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture :(&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> :-(  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed because it was a color I already had and don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> Try any color and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed .  </li>
            <li> I tried purple base</li>
            <li> HATE IT AND</li>
            <li> I use it with out a color base.</li>
            <li> To get the color in the photo you need a base coat of a color</li>
            <li> but the &amp;#34;holo&amp;#34; effect is a load of crap.</li>
            <li> but I was honestly very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> and I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> was very disappointed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was nothing like this picture I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> Terrible!!!</li>
            <li> this is horrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible!</li>
            <li> VERY disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible polish will never order anything by this brand again!</li>
            <li> Smells Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very thin grey-ish background.  It is not anything like the picture.  I guess you have to use 3 or 4 coats to get that effect.</li>
            <li> I ordered this and recieve six halo nail polishes every color but the bkack that i ordered ..... disapponted but happy for the 5 extra nail polishes i recieved</li>
            <li> I love this brand and most of their polishes. I have a couple dozen bottles. I love the metallic colors and a few of their glitters. I tried doing this exactly w/black on the bottom. I had to put 4 coats of the chunky holo black policy on so it was even noticeable. Even then didn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. This is a great company, I just don&#x27;t recommend this specific polish.</li>
            <li> Love the color reflections.</li>
            <li> I put one coat over 2 coats of black and it didn&#x27;t look like in the picture. Mostly lots of orange. I tried purple base but then it didn&#x27;t show up at all. I will experiment with maybe 2 top coats but overall, it&#x27;s prettier in the picture.</li>
            <li> The picture is deceiving. This color does not come out like that at all. It&#x27;s more of a clear sparkle coat. Wish I could return it.</li>
            <li> Terrible!!! It looks nothing like the picture, not even u add black first. Total waste of money!</li>
            <li> This product had high reviews so I was encouraged but after receiving I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. It is mostly red in appearance and gives more of a red glitter affect. It is still pretty but not really as holographic as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> This polish is fabulous. I definitely recommend applying it over a dark color like black for the best effect.</li>
            <li> Honestly I was a bit disappointed with it.  It does not come out like the picture at all unless you put black under it.  Even then it chips very easily and by the end of the day they will start chipping.  And I was very excited to try it.  The quality of the bottle wasn&#x27;t very nice either.  When I twisted the lid off the cap came off the brush.  Sorry but I was honestly very disappointed in the quality.</li>
            <li> ONLY GET TO GO OVER BLACK POLISH OR IT IS A SEE THRU GREY UGLY COLOR, OVER BLACK POLISH THOUGH IT&#x27;S SUPER CUTE</li>
            <li> To get the look from the picture you have to carefully go about this.&lt;br /&gt;1)Clean your nails&lt;br /&gt;2)pick a dark base coat, I like the look black gives it.&lt;br /&gt;3)apply desired amount of base color and let it dry all the way, I&#x27;m talking willing to open a soda can dry.&lt;br /&gt;4)apply one coat of the clear glitter polish you just received that&#x27;s pictured above and let it dry. For the love of all things fluffy let it dry.&lt;br /&gt;5)repeat step 4 once.&lt;br /&gt;6)now go find sunshine and admire your nails because under florescent lighting they won&#x27;t look as pretty.</li>
            <li> Beautiful flakes and soooo anticipated this to come. I used it and it NEVER DRIES,...EVER! I put a quick dry top coat, nail dry spray, and a hairdryer to it! STILL WET AS I JUST PAINTED THEM! Don&#x27;t waist your $ or time.</li>
            <li> SO PRETTY I WANNA DIE!</li>
            <li> I bought this nail lacquer for my girlfriend and it looks fantastic.  The larger pieces of glitter make the holo effect much more evident.  She gets tons of compliments and wears it a couple times a month.</li>
            <li> Interesting, but didn&#x27;t apply &amp; look anything like the picture.</li>
            <li> yeah!put sime metal balls in it..</li>
            <li> I was really excited to recieve this for a new year manicure. At first, I didn&#x27;t like it. I tried it with different base coats and am starting to like it more. I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s really tacky, so it takes a while to dry! I do suggest a darker color for a base coat, but the photo advertised is very unlikely without several coats.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. Shipped and received right away. I usually start with one coat of this polish, then add the next coat a few days later.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews before buying! I can&#x27;t believe how many people out there actually thought that a glitter polish came with black as the suspension polish. Rediculous! This polish comes with multiple sized glitter &amp;#34;chunks&amp;#34; in a clear (top coat style) polish, JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER GLITTER POLISH!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The payoff is fantastic though. A dark base coat color (so far I&#x27;ve tried blue, black, and red) and two coats of glitter give a look close to the image shown on here. Luckily after the second coat it&#x27;s almost impossible to chip. The only down side to this polish is that from most angles it appears as a red/orange glitter. The darker the base and the more coats you do the better the holo effect gets so next time I&#x27;ll go with three coats over black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the price. I&#x27;ll be buying some more for my polish enthusiast friends as gifts!</li>
            <li> i like it i just had to add more glitter</li>
            <li> How does this have ANY stars????</li>
            <li> HATE IT AND THE SELLER!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gummy/sticky. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s due to being old, a bad formula or counterfeit. I used one coat of black, let it dry and then applied this. It was still sticky an hour later I timed it. (It got messed up the first time and I was sure I had given it plenty of time.)&lt;br /&gt;Wrote as much to the seller... Here&#x27;s the response it got...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The polish you have recieved is the correct one - all the new batches of Holy Black 236&#x27;s from Kleancolor have more red glitters in them now. This polish is a top coat so please try appliying it on top of a black color as a base.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They clearly didn&#x27;t read what I wrote, I didn&#x27;t complain about the color, but if that&#x27;s such an issue take new photos and update your description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah way redder than in the picture.</li>
            <li> this is NOTHING what the picture looks like. first, if you have to use a black base then the directions/information should have had said that. I decided to put it over a white base. I had did a white polish on all nails with designs on a few. so I put a couple of coats on my thumb. it a pink top coat with pink and a bit of red specs. now 15 min later I hit my thumb with another nail and not only did the polish smudge but the white I put on days ago smudge also. this polish doesn&#x27;t look anything like the picture. I have a pink top coat with pink speckles. and it still isn&#x27;t dry. this is horrible. I haven&#x27;t seen green or yellow flakes.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t look anything like picture.</li>
            <li> The color is pretty you just have to use a Black base to get the picture shown.</li>
            <li> This shouldnt be called chunky halo &amp;#34;BLACK&amp;#34; bc its not black. Its a redish orangeish/ clear color. Im syre it will look good on top of black but thats not what it is. Quite deceiving.</li>
            <li> it look very good over black nail polish thank you</li>
            <li> Terrible! This is red nothing black about it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even give this item a star it sucked. it took over 2 months to be out for delivery. of course what you may be thinking, well it got lost in the mail.. no. it is to hard to explain over a computer. but when i got it it smeared off really easy the product never even dried,. not worth your money do not buy this item.  the sequence was not pretty. it  is chunky.</li>
            <li> I got it in a timely fashion. But making my nails look like the picture was near impossible. Even painting my nails black first did not help. I had to stop adding costs because it was making my nails look so thick.</li>
            <li> not the color i expected.  more clear with sparkles than the vivid color in picture</li>
            <li> Disappointed that it looks nothing like the photo</li>
            <li> Love this but polish is too thick. U also must use a black nail polish first</li>
            <li> Have got a lot of comments about my nails with this polish.</li>
            <li> Pink suspension, not black. Looks great with black under it, though.</li>
            <li> Looks cooler in the bottle, and has a strange smell, and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry very fast at all, over all it&#x27;s just ok</li>
            <li> I ordered this expecting rainbow glitter like polish like the picture shows but instead got a red-looking glitter polish but it is still very PRETTY! A few tips:&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE ALONE. This is a CLEAR polish with glitter, you must put a base coat!! First, put a dark base coat like dark blue or black and let it dry. Put on a THIN coat of this glitter polish and let it dry. This is super important because If you put too much at once, it&#x27;ll just clump up and peel off. After it dries, put a second coat of the glitter and you will see how much of a difference it makes!&lt;br /&gt;Even though it looks like one color when viewing from one angle, it actually changes color as the light setting changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this polish requires very little work for a chic look. I took away a star because it didn&#x27;t look exactly as it does in the picture, but I definitely recommend this nail polish!!! You won&#x27;t regret it :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also added a few photos in case anyone wanted to see the end effects of putting two coats of this polish over one coat of black!</li>
            <li> This polish looks nothing like the picture shown it mostly sparkles red and orange and it isn&#x27;t very pretty.</li>
            <li> PARTY IN A BOTTLE DARK FOR WINTER NEEDGOOD TOP COAT</li>
            <li> Total trash for almost $5.00.save your money.No one has time for one coat of color,2 coats of glitter and one coat clear!O have some colors from this brand I bought in the discount store for $1.49.the first pic posted is one coat of glitter ,second pic is 2 coats.still horrible.will try with color and get back with a 3rd pic.</li>
            <li> I really like this polish- the only downside is that is has a very strong smell. With each coat, you get more iridescence if you will, the flecks of color are beautiful, especially in the sunlight, I always get compliments and ask where I got it. The price is more than reasonable too.</li>
            <li> the polish looks in the picture like its black with chunky holo glitters in it. Not the case! its just a regular glitter! So disappointed and it never dries</li>
            <li> It is a translucent . Not black. You have to polish your nails the black then put this as a top coat for the big chunks of glitter.&lt;br /&gt;But even with that said. It is a beautiful glitter..</li>
            <li> The color does not loo lie the photo at all. It basically looks like jut red glitter.</li>
            <li> Did not get the chunky Holo Black got some ugly blue polish that I immediately threw in the trash I was so dissappointed!</li>
            <li> I really like using this with different colors</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter for inexpensive polish this works better than I had expected ,We did her nails OPI Black  2 coats than we put this on to get the look like the picture we used 3 coats of the Holo than a top coat.The glitter is so pretty has reds,greens and gold.The only down fall is the smell very strong but like most polishes they all smell.This would look nice over green polish too. We did get this to dry fast by using OPI rapid dry works fast and very good and when it comes time to remove this we will use the Opi nail remover that I swear by works the best for removing any glitter.</li>
            <li> The nail polish I received is completely different</li>
            <li> U know get this so called nail polish  if looks could kill they lied about how it&#x27;s suppose yo look it looks nothing like the picture I will not ever but this nail polish again it sucks!</li>
            <li> Very beautiful. It takes a long time to dry, but otherwise it is very beautiful. Deoending on the angle and lighting, all red or rainbow colors appear. It looked just red when I applied it but looked rainbow in a different room later.</li>
            <li> nothing close to the picture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m SO in love with this color! It&#x27;s awesome over any dark color - especially black!! The colors in it are AMAZING! I&#x27;m the girl known for changing nail polish ever few days, but I kept this on for a WEEK!! I&#x27;ve never received as many compliments as I did on this one! If you&#x27;re a nail polish junkie/addict...YOU MUST BUY THIS NOW!!!</li>
            <li> I love how this looks on top of a my crazy colors.  It does tend to tint red, but the different sized sparkles the base colors have much more depth.  With black you see more of the rainbow effect, but I am still trying different base colors.  I loved this so much, I ordered two more because I don&#x27;t want to run out anytime soon!!</li>
            <li> This is not what it appears once you apply it to your nails. Granted you have to base your nail with a dark color before applying this polish but once all is done you never really achieve this look and I am very disappointed. I will not be purchasing anymore of this.</li>
            <li> It was harder to get my black polish on good enough to get this on top of it! Cool effect but I&#x27;m going to try it with a red or orange base.   Update: it&#x27;s not as holographic on a red base, but still looks cool.</li>
            <li> Once again the listing is very inaccurate but the product is still very pretty. I&#x27;d recommend purchasing a thinner with this.</li>
            <li> you can see right through it I thought it had that dark look so it must be a darker color underneath  because this is not what I thought I was buying</li>
            <li> This is my first kleancolor polish. Wanted this one because I have seen what cool manicures can be made with this. Looking forward to trying to create something fun and unique with this one.</li>
            <li> This polish is a lovely purpley/black based gelly polish with iridescent reflective glitters of different sizes. It smells worse than most polishes, but it removes just fine despite the glitter. This looks great on top of any polish, I am so pleased. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> best with a black basecoat</li>
            <li> The nail polish says halo black but comes out clear. The first time I bought it the pictures you see that the seller have up wasn&#x27;t there before and when I contacted him/her said no one ever complain but as I looking at the seller item again I see his picture saying its gel like and you have to cover over with black nail polish.The description of it is misleading. Very dis pointed</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it said it was and I have had lots of compliments!</li>
            <li> Beautiful polish, just not what I expected. It&#x27;s gorgeous over a black base because its pretty translucent. The picture makes chunky holos look more rainbow but it really only goes from red to green :) but overall very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> What I got was NOTHING like the picture or description. Polish is clear with red glitter. VERY disappointed!</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture :(&lt;br /&gt;But I love glitter and in nail polishes best combo. You have to get around 5 coats to get a desired look you want. Over in all they should update the picture because it&#x27;s very misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE)5/24/14&lt;br /&gt;I love my nail polish. I use it with out a color base. Its look like a tinted black nail polish very light with specks of tiny red glitter and big glitter balls. Moving your hand a certain way reflects color changes. I may try this on a several new base colors but  not necessary black.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M WEARING THIS RIGHT NOW. IT&#x27;S COOL BECAUSE THE POLISH LOOKS JUST BLACK UNTIL YOU GET INTO THE LIGHT AND THEN THE RED GLITTER CATCHES AND IT&#x27;S LIKE MAGIC. I USE IT OVER BLACK POLISH SO THE RED ONLY SHOWS IN THE LIGHT.</li>
            <li> :-(  It&#x27;s not black with glitters like it shows and advertises in the picture &amp; description.</li>
            <li> The picture is a little misleading.  This is a somewhat clear nail polish with sparkles in it.  You can  use it over lighter nail color but it will give it a dark tinge.  That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s best over dark colors.  The sparkles are great and they definitely show and there are large and small.  It&#x27;s not like other nail polish you buy at the store where you hardly get any sparkle on your nail.  This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Pretty color, although I haven&#x27;t used it in earnest yet.  It looks more orange than anything else to me, which is just fine -- I plan to wear it over copper and russet colored polish when autumn arrives.  Should be fun!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t look like the picture. It is translucent pink in color and the holographic effects aren&#x27;t as stunning as in the picture. It&#x27;s mostly pink, with a glimmer of other colors. Looks better with a black undercoat, but still not as colorful as the picture.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a different color, but it turned out to be the same chunky holo black I ordered before they tricked me they had it under a different company and it looked completely different in the picture when I received it I was disappointed because it was a color I already had and don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> This polish is absolutely STUNNING. It has so many different layers to it, every time you look at it you see a different color and the formula is fabulous, too!</li>
            <li> This color really came out nice and it does need to be places over a black nail polish to get the best effect of the glitter.</li>
            <li> Stunning nail lacquer, it makes your nails look like black opals, you will get lots and lots of compliments on this</li>
            <li> This polish looks nothing like the picture.  There has to be black polish underneath this polish to make it look anything like the picture and then you are talking about at least 4 coats of polish plus base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read that people are complaining that the polish itself isn&#x27;t opaque. But if it were opaque, the glitter in it wouldn&#x27;t be visible. I used two coats of this over two coats of black, and I love it. You have to use several coats to get it to cover like the picture (more coats&#x3D;more glitter).&lt;br /&gt;It arrived very quickly and I&#x27;ve had no problems with it. Highly recommend it c:</li>
            <li> Beautiful top coat!  I have tried this top coat on several different colors besides black and it looks great on most. This vendor shipped my order promptly and it arrived sooner than anticipated. Great price.</li>
            <li> Great quality polish, looks just like the picture. My item came within just a few days of ordering. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> First off, it&#x27;s a lovely chunky holo polish!&lt;br /&gt;However, the base of the polish isn&#x27;t black, mine is a light pink with chunky holo.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still very pretty and can be paired with any color! It wasn&#x27;t exactly what I was expecting but I&#x27;m still pleased with it and would definitely buy it again! For a softer look it can be worn alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it!!</li>
            <li> Got it faster then I thought&lt;br /&gt;But only were way it will show is with a dark black color under it...Make sure u have black Polish if u buy this other then That I like it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty, but you do have to use a lot of layers or put it over black. Also, I had a problem where the sparkles were hanging off and sticking out of the the nail polish, but maybe I just didn&#x27;t use enough top coat. You don&#x27;t really see the greenish shades, though, unless you look at the nails flat, like from the sides.</li>
            <li> It wasnt what I expected I thought it would look like pic showed when u put it on but its actually more of a clearish black top coat u have to put a color under it but its still kinda cool</li>
            <li> I have already used this polish twice.. I am sooooooo in love with it. Of course the color isn&#x27;t black like the nails but after a black base coat Loved it solo much i just bought another set of colors of the same brand. The finish looks just like you came from the nail salon would give more than 5 stars if i could :-)</li>
            <li> i love it but takes lots of coats but i only do 2. look very trendy and very sparkly love it</li>
            <li> it is a clear coat with the sparkles so don&#x27;t be fooled by the black in the picture under over all good nail polish</li>
            <li> Very pretty. I used black underneath and the end result was like the picture. Anxious to try different combinations. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> So thin it would take 10 coats to get the sparkle coverage, like in the picture.</li>
            <li> This nail polish came very heavy. Like it was stiff. I tried adding fingernail polish remover her but I ended up throwing the product away</li>
            <li> Exactly like on the picture if not, better. Beautiful if you put it on with black background polish, like in the picture.</li>
            <li> This color is very pretty and lasts. I am hard on my nails.</li>
            <li> Loved everything about this polish.</li>
            <li> it is far lighter when applied than in the bottle</li>
            <li> This polish is really pretty but it looks like some that I already have. Once I got it and saw it up close it looks like some I got at the Dollar General Store for a dollar. I will still use it though it is pretty. And it came really fast.</li>
            <li> great color and applies nicely</li>
            <li> This is deceiving. Its nothing like the pic. Save your money</li>
            <li> Pretty, wished I knew I had to put on a coat of black first.. Could have saved a lot of time and polish!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, but not as pictured. It&#x27;s clear glitter.  Not black polish with glitter. Would score better if better represented.</li>
            <li> I just received today its ok I guess to get the look of the picture you have to paint a black under coat cause when I painted my nails it was so thin when applied its almost clear. But I will try it with a black under coat next time cause the colors in it are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Looks really cool over black. Takes alot of coats to get desired effect, and uyou have to be very patient takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> looks great but takes alot of coats to make it look like the picture</li>
            <li> This is a translucent color. To get the full affect, a solid color will need to be put on first. I like it, though. VERY fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The sparkle is not as strong as the picture makes it, even over black nail polish but the shipment was fast</li>
            <li> It does have a bit of a black to the Base. You have to wear a light colour to really see that part of it though. The glitter is sparkly</li>
            <li> First of all it&#x27;s clear polish. You need to buy a separate bottle of black and apply it first. Secondly, it hard to get the big pieces of glitter to stick. The small particles do. Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that it would take so many coats to get the color to show up.</li>
            <li> Bought elsewhere yet buy from Amazon frequently so want to review it here as well. I looked forward to getting this. I applied it over a black polish as I&#x27;d read works best. I am not impressed. I&#x27;m good at applying polish, yet cannot get it to look like it does in the pics here. The bigger glitter pieces kind of just stick together and clump. The only colors I&#x27;ve been able to pull from it are red or green, and only one per angle. I personally wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. It looks much better in the pics than in person, and all the colors you can see on the bottle, you cannot see on the nail. I will try it again over Kleancolor metallic red and over my china glaze black leather rather than the other black, as well as with more coats of this on top, but with the clumping factor I don&#x27;t anticipate much better results. It&#x27;s unique- that&#x27;s the one thing it has going for it.</li>
            <li> i have to say that i absolutely love this polish....it&#x27;s so holographic it&#x27;s crazy...the smell i am not too crazy about BUT will endure it for the look.  the price is super duper great as i can&#x27;t find this in my area anywhere...i would definitely recommend this brand and color to anyone....looks great on top of any color...dark or light.</li>
            <li> I love this brand and the color turned out to be way better then I had expected. This brand cost way more in a store and I have found getting offline is way cheaper for the same great quality !</li>
            <li> Gorgeous, I love glitter.&lt;br /&gt;Looks amazing on</li>
            <li> Looks great over purple and also over black polish</li>
            <li> This is a pretty glitter polish. It only shows well on a black base coat and the color is mostly a rich burgundy. The picture is much prettier than the reality.</li>
            <li> The polish itself was great just not the glitter in the polish. The glitter tents to stand out sometimes. Overall a good top coat but not so great if mixed with other brand names. Thank You.</li>
            <li> Great color as pictured. Polish is a little slow to dry and doesn&#x27;t smell very good.</li>
            <li> In order to get the polish to look like it does on the picture, you need to give it 7-9 coats!!!!  ridiculous!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!  Over a black base coat this polish is great!</li>
            <li> You need to use on top of another color, but it&#x27;s a beautiful polish. Just like picture.</li>
            <li> Very pretty. Sparkly but not childish.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I expected</li>
            <li> keep in mind all of you who say it doesn&#x27;t go on black, that the glitter wouldn&#x27;t show in black polish. SO that being said, polish your nails first with black and use this as a overcoat. I would suggest 2 or three coats to really make it pop. I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments on this and anticipate to get more when I run out</li>
            <li> Def has a red tint. But once on, the holo flakes are nice and colorful and sparkly. Seller was terrific,  timely, and polite.&lt;br /&gt;Lots of compliments,  btw.</li>
            <li> I have never seen a colour like this before.  it layers nicely.  Has staying power as well!!</li>
            <li> Although I love it, it takes WAY too long to dry as the coat is very thick. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> im disapointed.. not what I expected.. overall not that great but i had worst.. wont be using it much..</li>
            <li> This is so pretty and works very well. I love the consistency, it is just right and the smell does not smell any worse than the other polish that I use. I have severe Asthma and COPD and a-lot of odors trigger breathing difficulties and this does not.</li>
            <li> it does not look like that in the picture when you put it on in fact it looks like regular sparkles you can buy at any store</li>
            <li> This is really meant to be layered over black, not used alone. The best of all the chunky holos for sure.</li>
            <li> A-MAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glitter is so beautiful and sparkly. The reds/greens/coppers are all bright and clear. It really glows in good light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have trouble applying glitter polishes easily, use a foam makeup applicator - brush the glitter onto the applicator and then press the applicator to your nail. This allows you to get even placement/distribution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This glitter polish is no different than any other I have in regards to ease of application.</li>
            <li> I really like this but be sure that you use a base coat before painting the Holo on.I suggest black and it looks really cute and have gotten lots of compliments.The only complaint I have is that I felt the odor of the nail polish was really strong.But I love this polish just definitely turns a fan on when I use it.</li>
            <li> In the bottle, it has that rainbow reflection. When Applied on the nail it&#x27;s mostly orange red yellow. AT CERTAIN ANGLES AND LIGHTING, you can get that blue green. It&#x27;s easily seen in the bottle due to the curved nature of the glass bottle and reflection at 180 degrees + angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;on another notes, looks nice on dark color nail polish base. Would not suggest using it alone.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the picture. I got a red glittery color. I wouldn&#x27;t of ordered it because I tons like that.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not black with glitter it is clear with the glitter in the picture.....was very disappointed so make sure you have black</li>
            <li> It is shown and described as black with multi color glitter but was clear with red glitter.</li>
            <li> You need to apply an unrealistic amount coats to obtain the look in the picture.  Unless you paint your nails black first and use this as a top coat with at least 3 to 4 additional layers.</li>
            <li> not really a rainbow. mostly orange, and sometimes they shine green. pretty for Halloween, but not like the picture. you also need a dark under coat, and by the time you get as much glitter on as you want, the nail polish is so thick and wont dry.</li>
            <li> Gave 3 as gifts thinking this is great for fall. Expected this to look like the photo. Looks pink on. But I will keep and use over different colors.</li>
            <li> Exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to be!  It&#x27;s gorgeous!  Nothing else like it out there!!! Omg!  I&#x27;m in nail heaven</li>
            <li> It looks nothing like the picture</li>
            <li> This polish looks nothing like the picture displayed by the seller. It is more red than anything else! Sometimes if the light hits your hand just right you&#x27;ll see some yellow and green shimmer in the polish.  Over all still a pretty top coat glitter polish, just not what I was expecting, no rainbow effect!</li>
            <li> Product is not how it appears in the picture, it is actually a clear purpleish hue with multifaceted glitter. It is very transparent and multiple coats will need to be applied to a dark black polish to accomplish  some what of the affect of what is portrayed in this pic...;( and at that the glitter is hard to get off the brush..;(</li>
            <li> This polish is takky-tastic. I did like it. My fingers look like 10 lil grade school art class mothers day broaches, its truly a cute affect.  But I have 2 issues. It has to have a base coat, then the color black or dark color like dark blue. Then a 2 coats of the chunky holo. THEN a high gloss top coat to get the holo affect. The polish holding the glitter is dull finish. All of the coats take a long time to dry. So I waited until each coat was completely dry before doing another coat. Since I am busy and I cannot spend all day for the polish to dry, it took 2 days to really be able to  know if I did like it.</li>
            <li> Just alot of glitter with a  Burgundy color.</li>
            <li> What I received was a red polish with red glitter flakes. It says &amp;#34;Chunky Holo Black&amp;#34; but it looks nothing like what is in the picture.</li>
            <li> This is def red . I have put this over white, black, pink, and even paper. It is a red glitter. Looks nothing like the pic at all</li>
            <li> I use a lot of kleancolor polishes- it&#x27;s one of my favorite brands especially because some of the colors stamp nice, but this was hard to get the glitter to drop on the nail, I got a mostly jelly like black polish when I used it and hardly any of the glitter specks would go on the nail. I would suggest buying a chunky glitter either for nails or from a craft store and sprinkling it on top of wet dark colored polish instead and top coating it.</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the nail color in the picture.</li>
            <li> This color was exactly as pictured. It is pretty thin and to achieve a good look it needs to be painted over a dark color like black. To use it alone would &#x3D; frustration and disappointment. I really like this. It had different sized glitter chunks and creates a deep illusion when used properly.</li>
            <li> Okay. Not as nice as the picture. I put a black base down, and this on top, and all I can really see red glitter pop out when light shines on it. The green and yellow colors barely show. I might wear it a couple more times, but I won&#x27;t buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> It only really look good on black if it went with more colors then i would love it but really pretty on black</li>
            <li> Cute &amp; different. Looks better on my toes then my hands... Can appear dark sometimes &amp; colors show at angles, but I like it..  :-)</li>
            <li> This polish is beautiful but you need a base color to make it pop like fun in a bottle. Try any color and you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Guys, it IS a translucent with reflector bits in it, in case anyone was still wondering about that. So it works with any color as base (darker is better, though). Just make sure the little bits are laying flat and arenas hanging off the edge of your nails and you got it! I&#x27;m terrible at doing my nails, yet it still works great for me!</li>
            <li> this is not very black, you have to use a black base to get what the picture shows and at least 4 coats for that much glitter.</li>
            <li> Truly holographic rainbowness haha. I love it my girls love it too. Perfect color just wish the polish wa clear instead of black.</li>
            <li> first, as with any \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; polish or gel...or any polish or gel with pieces of anything suspended in it...if the base gel were a solid colour, the pieces would most likely not be visible.  therefore, these polishes/gels are usually thin to allow the pieces to be visible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone who uses glitter effects will know you really won&#x27;t get a good look unless you have a contrasting base coat.  some glitters even say \\&quot;top coat\\&quot; right on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;with a black base coat and 2 coats of this polish, you get the most beautiful effect.  the polish itself is not superthick or gunky, so you can get away with 2 coats of it over the black.  it is prismatic in that it shifts colour and intensity as you move your fingers around.  i only had one piece that stuck up, but i think that was my fault and it hadn&#x27;t dried and i scraped it against something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY happy with this and recommend it to experienced glitter users who won&#x27;t expect it to cover on its own.  my nails look exactly like the picture with a top coat.</li>
            <li> Love this color and great price!!!</li>
            <li> the Polish was not received as stated, and the pictures online it showed black with red flakes in it. When I receive the Polish it was just some clear polish with red and green flakes on it the ad did not state that they had used a different polish as a base coat or else I wouldn&#x27;t have just ordered clear polish with green and red Christmas flakes in it. It cost more to send it back then the polish cost so I just kept it I do not like being misled when I am making purchases online.</li>
            <li> Okay, so here goes.  I have a love/hate relationship with this nail polish.  The glitter is beautiful but nothing like the pictures shown. In order to capture those multichrome colors you have to get the perfect angle, otherwise its just red glitter.  If you really want it, go for it because the price is good, but it doesnt show up like the pictures, kind of a let down for me.</li>
            <li> It looks like a bottle full of red goo with glitter in it at first, but if you take it outside or move the bottle around in the light you can see the different colors.  Like in other reviews, it works best when used in light coats that are completely dry before adding another coat.  2 or 3 coats do the trick and your nails will look awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Love the effect. It goes on thick, so be careful. Takes a long time to dry.</li>
            <li> It does not look like the pic,  but it is a pretty manicure. Works great as a top coat.</li>
            <li> Clumpy and not easy to paint nails with.</li>
            <li> This is pretty in the bottle but i&#x27;m not sure how it will look over all colors cause i haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
            <li> As one of the other reviewers stated, this is red ! I don&#x27;t see any of the other colors that the picture shows! And it goes on really really thick! I won&#x27;t purchase again!</li>
            <li> I received this polish today and it looks nothing like the picture! The flakes are red/orange and don&#x27;t reflect much color. Big disappointment on my birthday.</li>
            <li> A Unique Nail Polish at a Great Price. I bought this product for my 14 year old niece who loves nail polish and seems to have every shade of nail polish out there. When I gave her this nail polish she was surprised and very pumped because of how unique it is. She is very pleased with nail polish and her being pleased makes me pleased with this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.  Can&#x27;t wait to try this.  Came sooner than expected.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Yup, it&#x27;s red.  Pretty, but not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> the color doesnt look as it is shown in the picture...i would definetely doesnt recomment this</li>
            <li> Love it on top if a black base color</li>
            <li> For me, the color was not at all like pictured. The main polish was a nice clear, but 99% of the glitter was red tones. It only changed from reds to pinks. No blues, green, yellows, etc. Rather disappointing.</li>
            <li> the color is very pretty in the picture but it doesn&#x27;t look the same in person. on my nails it comes out looking like red sparkles. the red is pretty but its not what i wanted.</li>
            <li> Did not get what this picture shows at all. I got some kind of red polish...so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to the picture, and did not get anything i expected. If you do put on layers to get it to look like the picture, its at least 5, and then it looks horrible. I put it on top of some nail polish and it was still crap. I would not recommend this to anyone! I wouldn&#x27;t mind having my dollar back that i paid for it!</li>
            <li> Put a coat of black or dark green behind this color and it looks fantastic</li>
            <li> not so much. doesn&#x27;t last. great color,</li>
            <li> Beautiful color! Perfect drying time :)</li>
            <li> Cute color but I should have read the reviews first to learn that this color looks nothing like the color from the picture on it&#x27;s own. But all in all it is a good polish</li>
            <li> very pretty but must apply SEVERAL coats !</li>
            <li> Very nice over black. Difficult to see over any other color.</li>
            <li> Awesome color. It also last for days without chipping which I love. I layered it over black and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li> This looks awesome over dark colors. Love it.</li>
            <li> it isn&#x27;t quite what is shown in the picture, more red glitter than anything</li>
            <li> NOT Black at all, more of a dark pink polish with big flecks if glitter in it.</li>
            <li> This polish is really more of a glittery topper rather than anything opaque with glitter in it, so be careful. The bottle does look mostly coppery, but at angles you can see the other colors. Over a dark base coat, two layers gives you a great effect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning: it is S-L-O-W to dry, so this is definitely not something to put on right before you run out the door. I like the effect, but the amount of time I have to baby my nails afterwards is a point of concern. Also the polish has a pretty strong chemical odor when wet, so watch out for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s pretty, but requires a little more delicacy and care to use than I generally prefer in my polishes.</li>
            <li> NOTHING LIKE THE PICTURE. IT&#x27;S MORE ORANGE THAN ANY OTHER COLOR. YOU HAVE TO PUT BLACK UNDERCOTE IN ORBER TO GET THIS VISUAL. CAME IN THE MAIL FAST. I AM ALWAYS IFFY ABOUT ORDERING NAIL COLOR WITHOUT TESTING IT FIRST. I WOULD HAVE HELD OFF IF I SAW IT IN PERSON.</li>
            <li> I love the color and the effect. Definitely needs a dark undercoat. I used a matte black polish, single coat. Then 2 coats of the glitter polish followed by a glossy top coat. The only downside is that it takes a long time to dry. Still 5 stars because its gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Not as described at all and seller said it HAD to be applied over black to get the effect. SELLER REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING AND FALSLY DESCRIBES PRODUCT SO I HOPE YOU LIKE PINK!!!! üò†üò≤üò≠</li>
            <li> Its pretty but smells funny! And takes for EVER TO dry</li>
            <li> This nail Polish was a bit pricey. I could&#x27;ve purchased something very similar at Walmart, Walgreens, or beauty supply store. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She enjoys painting her nails.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail polish and they sent me an message that said they were returning my money so I never received the nail polish</li>
            <li> Needs undercoat. Is NOT solid black. Only gives off a reddish color, not very holo. Chips very easily too. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> color is very different than what is shown</li>
            <li> I love this even though you need a base coat with it i still love it! i&#x27;ll buy more when i run out!</li>
            <li> Its just basically a clear coat with glitter in it. The photo shows it on top of another color</li>
            <li> I was hoping to have my nails look like the picture but my bottle seemed to have too much red chunky glitter.  It completely overpowered the other colors.  Only small amounts of the other colors appear in the light.  However, it did arrive before expected.</li>
            <li> Color was very red not the holographic color pictured</li>
            <li> no funcione. to use it is not like the photo, it is very expensive.</li>
            <li> This polish is packed with glitter. It is a very see-through black, so it is best used as a top coat over another dark color like black, grey, brown, or navy. It looks better in the bottle, but looks good on your nails too. I gave this polish as a gift (kept one for myself too) and the recipient was very happy, both initially when opening it and after using it on her nails.</li>
            <li> Not at all as described</li>
            <li> Must be used over another color of nail polish. Even over black I couldn&#x27;t get it to look this &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34;.  Is neat but mostly shows up as orange and gold glitter.</li>
            <li> Beautiful color, will look lovely over dark nail colors like black or dark green. Has a nice mixture of small and large glitter flakes in it.</li>
            <li> It does not look anything like the picture once you put it on over black nail polish. It looks red.</li>
            <li> In ordered to make it look like picture u need to polish nails black then use this polish wish it said that in description</li>
            <li> Horrible polish will never order anything by this brand again! I am not a nail professional so maybe I just didn&#x27;t know how to use it, but I also seen this polish @ my local swamp meet for 1.00</li>
            <li> One of the best glitters out there. I use it with a dark nail polish and it just makes the polish pop.</li>
            <li> I love the color, but it is hard to use with gelish nail polish and it takes a lot of patience. because you have to wait for it to dry before you can apply the gelish top coat.  It is not a gel color.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love the color of this polish!  It doesn&#x27;t smell any worse than any other polish. You will definitely need to apply a solid dark color prior to applying Kleancolor or you will not get the desired effect.  The price isn&#x27;t bad for the product.  The only thing I was disappointed with using this polish was the drying time.  The polish is a bit syrupy and even after I used a quick dry top coat and quick dry spray over it, it still took about 2 hours to completely dry.</li>
            <li> This is just clear polish with a little sparkles in it. You can find nicer polish at the 99 cent store. Don&#x27;t waste your money. If you pay more than a quarter you are not getting your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> To get the color in the photo you need a base coat of a color and then you need 2-3 coats of this polish and then a clear coat on top. But with all that it is nice.</li>
            <li> Love all the colors of the rainbow in this polish!  Looks especially great over black as well as white.  Just be aware, it does not have colored polish in it.  It should be used over a colored polish or in the case of a French manicure on the tip.</li>
            <li> Smells Horrible! Most nail polish smells but this one is suspect and truly takes the cake.This can not be good for your nails or you lungs.</li>
            <li> I love it! It looks great with a black base coat. Definitely will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Awesome formula love it!</li>
            <li> This was such an awesome buy I would reccomend this polish to any and everyone!!! Don&#x27;t  pass this one up!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful. Although it&#x27;s thick. Kinda hard to manage once the air hits it. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied. Will definitely order from them again. And the shipping was quick as well. ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ</li>
            <li> Although it needs a base coat to look like shown in the photo, I liked this lacquer. The color does shine and sparkle as shown. The base coat can be Dark red or Green, or brown, as long as its dark enough for the colors to contrast.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews my polish so thin i have to put alot of layers on nothing like the pic or info as stated</li>
            <li> This polish is nice. You need to have a black or dark color under it because of the black tint of this polish. But over all it is nice. I like it and will try other colors.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this. They said it would be delivered here July 1st and it&#x27;s still not here. I don&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;ll get the nail polish. I&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I received this polish on Monday so it was a little earlier than expected. I love the color it looks great especially over black polish!!</li>
            <li> Was nothing like this picture I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
            <li> I just receive this package the other day and it did not come up leak or broken this color is so pretty and I luv glitter like that from kleancolor</li>
            <li> Okay so, I&#x27;m a polisholic. Fell in love with this from pictures (not just here, googled swatches too) and it was relatively cheap for a holo polish.&lt;br /&gt;annnd I&#x27;m super disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Painted on a really deep purple thinking that would make the red/orange really pop. It did... but the &amp;#34;holo&amp;#34; effect is a load of crap. So lets just go through everything that has upset me about this.&lt;br /&gt;1. This polish smells SO BAD. Like holy hell it reeks.&lt;br /&gt;2. this should be called a colorshifting glitter, there is nothing holo about it.&lt;br /&gt;3. To achieve the shift from orange to green, you basically have to angle your nails so you can&#x27;t even see it.&lt;br /&gt;4. The picture is very misleading, making you believe it&#x27;s a nice gradual shift from red-orange to green with some nice yellow and even blue mixed in. Wrong. It&#x27;s just orange and kind of green depending on the angle. Mostly it just looks like weird halloween polish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably end up giving this away. We&#x27;ll see if it looks anything at all like the pictures in natural sunlight. maybe then it&#x27;ll redeem itself.</li>
            <li> It is as pictured, but you do have to view it at different angles and lighting to see the full rainbow of colors. Just looking at the bottle sitting there, you think it&#x27;s mostly copper, but once you have it on, you can see the different colors.</li>
            <li> This looks really nice in photos on the web site; however I gather you need a very good glossy top coat because it&#x27;s really dull once it dries.</li>
            <li> Did not have all the rainbow colors in it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more of a top coat.. you need a color underneath of this, but that&#x27;s what I wanted. I love it!</li>
            <li> Kleancolor nail polish isn&#x27;t all that great of a brand first off. But it does do what it was made for. The Holo line of Kleancolor isn&#x27;t the easiest to get the look you want... Obviously you will need a base coat and a top coat... but you&#x27;ll also need about 5-7 coats of the holo to look like it is pictured... Also, people complain about the smell A LOT.. which it is a pretty strong smell..</li>
            <li> Disappointed you don&#x27;t get what you see,it&#x27;s an illusion like an infomercial,I feel tricked completely!</li>
            <li> Will use soon. I think it is what I wanted though.</li>
            <li> This is a VERY opaque, very light black tinted color &amp; in order for it to be this dark it would have to be painted over black polish as a top coat then followed with a clear coat to seal in the holograph chips. The chunky chips do not come out evenly &amp; I have many polishes that I can work with that are made with similar material. This one is not cooperative though. I won&#x27;t send it back because it will cost more than I paid to ship back, but I will not recommend purchasing this color.</li>
            <li> Very pretty, I apply it on in contrast of black and it look just lik the image presented</li>
            <li> The Polish was not as pretty as pictured but with about 5 coats you could probably achieve the pictured look</li>
            <li> Its really pretty,  it is able to look like the photo, but only if it has a black or grey bass. Other than that. I love it(:</li>
            <li> I received the wrong item because what is displayed is not the colors you see. All u see is a Coppery red color.I had to use 3 coats to be able to see some of the sparkles on my nail bed. SO!! You have to use a BLACK under coat to see the sparkles better than just the polish alone.VERY hard to see the sparkles. I was not happy and I am very disappointed :/ To me its false advertisement.</li>
            <li> This polish doesnt go on as dark as it shows, so its not what I thought it would be. Great seller though, thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look as advertised in the photo (It&#x27;s red. It&#x27;s red no matter what light it&#x27;s under). Goes on unbelievably thick and NEVER dries. Even with a quick dry top coat.</li>
            <li> Nothing like the picture at all.  I used over a coat of black nail polish, but all that shows up is orange glitter only.  It willbe cute for Halloween at least, but its not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but the color inst much like what I was expecting. I was expecting to have to use a couple of coats of this but its so thick it almost doesn&#x27;t look that great with multiple coats on top of a colored coat.</li>
            <li> another very nice color</li>
            <li> Received product fast. Beautiful illusion color. Will really pop on dark polishes.  Would recommend this store to buy from. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;From a Thankful nail tech.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone who doesn&#x27;t have a heavy duty nail dryer or patience... its beautiful yes but I put one layer over my nails and after an hour it still hadn&#x27;t dried even after I had to cut hair dryer on a low setting and &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; my hair for 30 minutes. After one use the brush also seemed really gunked up.. I dabbed some of the polish into a small container and added a tiny bit of acetone to try and thin it. Maybe that will work better.</li>
            <li> I like it but i was expecting it to be many different colors. I bought 2, the first one had only red and yellow chips and was more reddish coat than black. The second one had every color but when i paint it on my nails the only colors that i can ever see is red, yellow, little bit of green and blue but barely, but the coating was black instead of reddish color, pluse both have an odd smell before it dries. Other wise i still like it and its really fun looking.</li>
            <li> I love the nail polish but I can&#x27;t get it to dry..... I will try a few diffrent things and maybe it will work. It&#x27;s a cool glitter Polish though. I love the colors.</li>
            <li> This was not what it looks like here in the picture .  Disappointed .  It&#x27;s clear with colors goes on just not what I thought</li>
            <li> Beautiful polish especially over dark colored polishes!!</li>
            <li> Works wonderful over dark colors.</li>
            <li> Received by due date.  It looks like chunky red glitter (not exactly like their pic) but if you turn against the light you see different colors.  Especially blue and green.  Like the way it goes on.  I put it on over the deep red I had on already for Valentine&#x27;s day and it looks pretty.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Looks NOTHING like the picture. Not even in the bottle. It&#x27;s a dark tinted translucent glitter polish and the glitter is not even that full. In addition, I think I received an old bottle because mine was thick and went on goopy. After 30 mins it adhered to my base coat and became a moldable blob as it would not dry. The pictures are sooo misleading.</li>
            <li> Veeeeery opaque!! You would need like 10 coats for it to look like it does in the photo...</li>
            <li> Only sparkles, you would need a color to go under it.</li>
            <li> The color peels very easy and the way it is down in picture you would think it would come out more black but I had to add black under it.</li>
            <li> This polish is ok. It looks nothing like the picture, though. I think you would need a black base coat to come close and even then the glitter doesn&#x27;t really change as much as in the picture.</li>
            <li> Looks beautiful over black polish!</li>
            <li> Finally am wearing this. The star of my purchases.</li>
            <li> Looked better in picture. Didnot live up to my expectation. Delivery was on time.</li>
            <li> You have to use a 3-4 coats of this, but the color ends up being really cool and really worth it.</li>
            <li> looks nothing like the picture&lt;br /&gt;but is still beautiful takes forever to dry and harden !</li>
            <li> chunky and not as pictured</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I thought.  It&#x27;s only glitter...don&#x27;t like it at allüòù</li>
            <li> you need a lot of layers</li>
            <li> There is nothing remotely black about this nail polish.  I&#x27;d be irritated with myself for not reading the reviews but the polish is really very pretty.  I think it&#x27;s deceptively depicted here and I don&#x27;t get why because it is a nice little top coat.  It really does look more like holographic flecks than it does glitter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think they should show a nail with just the product in question along with the black painted nail, and remove the word &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; from the bottle.</li>
            <li> This polish is not what is shown. It is a red, orange &amp; purple (?) holographic, the only time you see the other colors (green, gold) is when you tilt the actual bottle and catch a glimpse sideways. Nice color but not what was expected. Pretty good formula consistency, not too thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more red than rainbow.Do not buy it.The picture is deceptive!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing . just use over black ! Would buy again!!!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is very thick when it goes on. I waited an hour and a half for it to dry and it was still not dry. I had to remove it and use a different nail polish to paint my nails. I&#x27;m very sad with this buy. It&#x27;s still a very pretty color if you&#x27;re willing to wait hours for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Love ‚ù§ the nail polish</li>
            <li> its not as it appears much like a clear polish with a lil glitter in it to get desired rusults you would need to first apply black polish then add about 5 layers or more of this polish</li>
            <li> I was only sad that its not as thick and full coverage as the picture shows. I know its a Lacquer but it add ssoommee sparkle, not as much as I wished, still pretty though!</li>
            <li> Thought that the color was darker. Still very pretty</li>
            <li> The nail polish I got is a red color it looks nothing like this at all</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actual clear lacquer with different color sparkles, not BLACK going on with this product, but it&#x27;s nice.  The picture is over black nail polish.</li>
