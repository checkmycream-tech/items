    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>o cream is perfect.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful to use a product, which is made from nature - without chemicals.</li>
            <li>Feels great on my face</li>
            <li>Never have had something so amazing!</li>
            <li>this night cream is amazing!</li>
            <li>My make up stays nice!</li>
            <li>All good oils, and not greasy</li>
            <li>but this item is really good.</li>
            <li>It smells really good.</li>
            <li>feels good</li>
            <li>smells good though</li>
            <li>Now, I can stop exfoliating as much, this cream is that good!</li>
            <li>This stuff is fantastic!</li>
            <li>I use this avocado cream every night and love how silky it makes my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love Nature&#x27;s Gate &amp;#34;Oh</li>
            <li>quickly - smells nice but not an overpowering &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; smell.  </li>
            <li>a great natural product.</li>
            <li>really hydrates the skin, good for around the eyes.</li>
            <li>The scent is light, and the texture of the cream isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li>I will go to just night time, once I feel my skin has gotten the full benefit of recovery with this product and can go to an easy &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The main reason i purchased it was because it got a pretty good rating on the Environmental Works Group website.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I will finish using it on my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed quickly, which makes it perfect for massaging my face.</li>
            <li>Obviously old product, works okay,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;night cream.</li>
            <li>love that it&#x27;s natural, and the smell is natural and light as well.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite cream, as it is simple in ingredients.  </li>
            <li>The side I used it on, showed an increase in elasticity, which was evident because the visible size of my pores shrunk.</li>
            <li>After the first night, i could tell it works.</li>
            <li>No strong smell or greasy feel and feels really good on the face.</li>
            <li>My face was getting dry trying to find a good facial moisturizer, so by the time i got this cream in, it was like sand paper.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t need much to cover.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>It stinks up to high heaven, but it works great!  </li>
            <li>So far I am really liking this night cream, and have had no allergy problems, which is a really big deal for me,</li>
            <li>It does not absorb completely, I can still feel it on my skin, but, to me, it is worth it based on the improvement in such a short period of time.</li>
            <li>I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>really wanted to like this night cream; I am a big fan of Nature&#x27;s Gate products, but I couldn&#x27;t like this one.</li>
            <li>This natural face cream provided moisture and healing to my face immediately.</li>
            <li>I did use a lot the first night because my face was dry.</li>
            <li>Just a touch goes a long way and my skin really absorbs it</li>
            <li>I used it on only half of my face the first 2 times I applied it &amp; could see the difference!</li>
            <li>For being such a reasonable price (in comparison to the specialized creams you can buy at a makeup counter), this little tub &#x27;</li>

            <li> Hardly any scent.</li>
            <li> then I put it on my face and it feels too thick</li>
            <li> It doesnt have a bunch of chemicals and the other bad things that are in alot of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> On cold days.</li>
            <li> I am shocked.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Purchased dec 2014 and coupon in the product had expired in the beginning of 2013.  Obviously old product, works okay, again I think it&#x27;s likely expired.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite cream, as it is simple in ingredients.  All good oils, and not greasy</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin greasy at all I use during the day. On cold days. My make up stays nice! Never have had something so amazing!</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic! I used it on only half of my face the first 2 times I applied it &amp; could see the difference! The side I used it on, showed an increase in elasticity, which was evident because the visible size of my pores shrunk. I am shocked. For being such a reasonable price (in comparison to the specialized creams you can buy at a makeup counter), this little tub &#x27;o cream is perfect. It does not absorb completely, I can still feel it on my skin, but, to me, it is worth it based on the improvement in such a short period of time. I used it Saturday night, Sunday morning, Sunday night and Monday morning. I will go to just night time, once I feel my skin has gotten the full benefit of recovery with this product and can go to an easy &amp;#34;maintenance&amp;#34; schedule.  Additionally, my facial skin has started to have rough patches, and I have had to increase my exfoliation to keep those manageable. Now, I can stop exfoliating as much, this cream is that good!</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I use it mainly on my throat area and dab a little under my eye as a night cream. Hardly any scent. Absorbs quickly. will purchase again!</li>
            <li> No strong smell or greasy feel and feels really good on the face. I would recommend if you&#x27;re looking for natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the product description on Amazon does not list all of the ingredients in the product, so if you have any sensitivities or allergies, I would suggest that you see the full ingredients list in this review before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this night cream; I am a big fan of Nature&#x27;s Gate products, but I couldn&#x27;t like this one. I had to return this product because it contained an ingredient that gives me acne, rosemary oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Country of Origin: USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full Ingredient List: Water, Glycerin, Coco-Caprylate, Prunus Armeniaca (Apricot) Kernel Oil, Glyceryl Stearate, Acacia Decurrens/Jojoba/Sunflower Seed Wax Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Candelilla/Jojoba/Rice Bran Polyglyceryl-3 Esters, Persea Gratissima (Avocado) Oil, Microcrystalline Cellulose, Cetearyl Alcohol, Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate, Hydrolyzed Lepidium Meyenii(Maca) Root, Hydrolyzed Ceratonia Siliqua (Carob) Seed Extract, Beta-Glucan, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Camellia Sinensis (White Tea) Leaf Extract, Rubus Villosus (Blackberry) Fruit Extract, Argania Spinosa (Argan) Kernel Extract, Linum Usitatissimum (Linseed/Flaxseed) Seed Extract, Olea Europaea(Olive) Fruit Unsaponifiables, Malpighia Glabra (Acerola) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Extract, Citrus Aurantium Dulcis (Orange) Peel Oil, Citrus Grandis (Grapefruit) Peel Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Leaf Oil, Salvia Lavandulaefolia (Sage) Leaf Oil, Xanthan Gum, Cellulose Gum, Glyceryl Undecylenate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Phenoxyethanol, Sodium Hydroxide.</li>
            <li> I use this as my night-time moisturizer.  Feels great on my face and you don&#x27;t need much to cover.  As a result this lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> My face was getting dry trying to find a good facial moisturizer, so by the time i got this cream in, it was like sand paper.  After the first night, i could tell it works. It stinks up to high heaven, but it works great!  I did use a lot the first night because my face was dry. The smell goes away after about 30 mins and you dont have to use alot.  A little goes a long way.  The main reason i purchased it was because it got a pretty good rating on the Environmental Works Group website. It doesnt have a bunch of chemicals and the other bad things that are in alot of moisturizers.</li>
            <li> So far I am really liking this night cream, and have had no allergy problems, which is a really big deal for me,</li>
            <li> I use this avocado cream every night and love how silky it makes my skin.  The scent is light, and the texture of the cream isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;night cream. It&#x27;s not like I trust this brand but this item is really good. It&#x27;s very thick and doesn&#x27;t get absorbed quickly, which makes it perfect for massaging my face. I notice the difference in the next morning.</li>
            <li> Like the way it leaves my skin. However, it&#x27;s patchy when you put it on.</li>
            <li> This night cream is a bit greasy feeling. It did not sink into my skin like night creams that I prefer. I love Nature&#x27;s Gate &amp;#34;Oh What a Night&amp;#34; night cream.</li>
            <li> this night cream is amazing! really hydrates the skin, good for around the eyes. love that it&#x27;s natural, and the smell is natural and light as well. a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This natural face cream provided moisture and healing to my face immediately. It is wonderful to use a product, which is made from nature - without chemicals.</li>
            <li> It smells really good. feels good then I put it on my face and it feels too thick n greasy doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb so I will finish using it on my pregnant belly. smells good though</li>
            <li> we found this product via swaggable and my wife likes it a lot. helps moisturize her face after showering and such. i even use it sometimes as it is unscented. a great natural product.</li>
            <li> I finally found something for &amp;#34;60&#x27;s something&amp;#34; dry skin!  Just a touch goes a long way and my skin really absorbs it quickly - smells nice but not an overpowering &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; smell.  I bought several jars and plan to keep using it.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
