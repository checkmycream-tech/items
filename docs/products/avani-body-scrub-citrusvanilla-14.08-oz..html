            <li>Love this scrub!  </li>
            <li>I love all the AVANI products!  </li>
            <li>Yes, scent smells nice.</li>
            <li>I had to shake it before every use because the oil rose to the top.</li>
            <li>This has a very light scent that I love.</li>
            <li>I also have the body cream in this fragrance--and this is a lovely set.  </li>
            <li>Product is ok.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin, it sits on top).</li>
            <li>Love this product as well.  </li>
            <li>Very nice scent and gentle scrub.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that light and smells great for you face look no further.</li>
            <li>I noticed that this product helped smooth out the plaques and reduced the redness.</li>
            <li>It is great for ethnic skin during the dry winter months!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t use it on certain parts of my body to be sure this time</li>
            <li>It is my absolute favorite Avani product.  </li>
            <li>The ship was fast but the top was cracked there was oil in the box</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin really soft and smells pretty nice.</li>
            <li>For the money this product cannot be beat--in fact this scrub is far better than many high dollar scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I love Avani Dead Sea Mineral Body Scrub, but the citrus/vanilla kind of smells like Pledge.  </li>
            <li>When I run out i&#x27;ll buy again which is rare for me.</li>
            <li>Fragrance is wonderful--the citrus goes very well with mild vanilla fragrance--some vanilla blends are way too vanilla-y for me.  </li>
            <li>the smell is different and the salt is larger and doesn&#x27;t dissolved as well when you rub it in, but all in all it is a great value for the money</li>
            <li>I bought it because I have sensitive skin: it was assured it was easy on skin and tender.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla-citrus is much better smelling than I initially thought.</li>
            <li>My entire body is inflamed once more.</li>
            <li>It contains much oil, so if you don&#x27;t want an oily scrub that softens skin, may not be a match.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>but sometimes I forget and it is still very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>this is very close.  </li>
            <li>But it makes you feel very oily for one (that&#x27;s the mineral oil...</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t put the scrub on my butt, my feet, or under my arms, and I didn&#x27;t let much of it wash or touch across it as I rinsed the scrub off.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The scent is nice but not strong at all.  </li>
            <li>Amazon usually has the best price -- never cheap but always reasonable.</li>
            <li>It smells good, has just enough moisture in it to keep your skin feeling soft even after you towel dry, and exfoliates gently.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin soft it works like it said kinda greasy too much money for product wont buy again thanks</li>
            <li>We had been looking everywhere for this and finally found exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
            <li>Then my dermatologist added a prescription cream which has now cleared my skin completely.</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so soft.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this dead sea body scrub.</li>
            <li>but I personally feel that it&#x27;s still got to much oil in it.</li>
            <li>Salt scrubs do a better job of deep down exfoliating because the crystals are bigger and a bit rougher than the finer and smaller crystals in sugar scrubs.  </li>
            <li>I developed a rash the following day.</li>
            <li>Salt scrubs are far different from sugar scrubs.  </li>
            <li>people saying it was scabies, I might have poison ivy, I probably got something from such and such, I must have something new in the detergent, it must be irritants.</li>

            <li> Was not packaged well and was broken when I got it.</li>

            <li> I use this product on areas where I have problem psoriasis. I noticed that this product helped smooth out the plaques and reduced the redness. Then my dermatologist added a prescription cream which has now cleared my skin completely. This has a very light scent that I love.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin soft it works like it said kinda greasy too much money for product wont buy again thanks</li>
            <li> I love Avani Dead Sea Mineral Body Scrub, but the citrus/vanilla kind of smells like Pledge.  The pear/apple is smells really good.  The Avani body scrub is excellent, but get the pear/apple and you will love it.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.  I just started using it and will decide if I like it when I am through with this jar.</li>
            <li> I go through jars of this body scrub as I use daily.  My skin has never felt so soft.  It contains much oil, so if you don&#x27;t want an oily scrub that softens skin, may not be a match.  But for me, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. It leaves my skin really soft and smells pretty nice. I don&#x27;t even need a body lotion after using it.</li>
            <li> Very nice scent and gentle scrub.</li>
            <li> This is the most wonderful scrub I have ever used!  It is my absolute favorite Avani product.  It smells good, has just enough moisture in it to keep your skin feeling soft even after you towel dry, and exfoliates gently.  My hubby loves the scent and the feel of my skin after I use it, too.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this dead sea body scrub. The vanilla-citrus is much better smelling than I initially thought. The smell is unisex so guys won&#x27;t have a problem. I like the way the dead sea salt exfoliates my skin and leaves it soft and moisturized. I don&#x27;t use it daily, maybe once or twice a week. When I run out i&#x27;ll buy again which is rare for me.</li>
            <li> Love this scrub!  Fragrance is wonderful--the citrus goes very well with mild vanilla fragrance--some vanilla blends are way too vanilla-y for me.  This blend is perfect.  The texture exfoliates while moisturizing.  For the money this product cannot be beat--in fact this scrub is far better than many high dollar scrubs.  I also have the body cream in this fragrance--and this is a lovely set.  Thanks Avani--you do not disappoint :-0</li>

I usually follow with the body butter but sometimes I forget and it is still very moisturizing.  The scent is nice but not strong at all.

            <li> i have been looking for a sea salt scrubb that is like the &amp;#34;awaken&amp;#34; by arbonne but less expensive.  this is very close.  the smell is different and the salt is larger and doesn&#x27;t dissolved as well when you rub it in, but all in all it is a great value for the money and i will buy it again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  Was not packaged well and was broken when I got it.</li>
            <li> Product arrived before the estimated delivery date. Product is ok. I found the scrub to be too oily, it left a coating all over me. I had to shake it before every use because the oil rose to the top.</li>
            <li> I love all the AVANI products!  I use this after the AVANI deep cleansing mud facial gel and it makes my skin feel 20 years younger.  I recommend this to everyone!&lt;br /&gt;MIFF</li>
            <li> I bought this as a package containing the mineral scrub, body butter, eye cream, and face wash. The only thing that DID NOT irritate my skin were the face items. I bought it because I have sensitive skin: it was assured it was easy on skin and tender. Yes, scent smells nice. But it makes you feel very oily for one (that&#x27;s the mineral oil...it clogs your pores and prevents any air from getting underneath. It doesn&#x27;t absorb into skin, it sits on top). I developed a rash the following day. Over the next few days it became worse and worse, I couldn&#x27;t figure out what is was and had several different ideas: people saying it was scabies, I might have poison ivy, I probably got something from such and such, I must have something new in the detergent, it must be irritants. Then I had others say the scrub simply washed away my protective layer and all the irritants in the air now bothered my skin. However, it lessened over the course of 2weeks to using my regular stuff. Yesterday I tried the scrub again and immediately the rash returned. My entire body is inflamed once more. I didn&#x27;t use it on certain parts of my body to be sure this time: I didn&#x27;t let it touch my face, I didn&#x27;t put the scrub on my butt, my feet, or under my arms, and I didn&#x27;t let much of it wash or touch across it as I rinsed the scrub off. Everyone the scrub touched has a rash and covered again. I have broken out so badly with a few bumps and a rash. So I went and rinsed off my body with cold water and my natural soap I normally use. There was instant relief after serious scrubbing and washing with just the cold water and the soap I use. I am taking back these products and will never touch this scrub again!</li>
            <li> Excellent not greasy. If you&#x27;re looking for something that light and smells great for you face look no further. This is it</li>
            <li> It feels great. It does wonder for my eczema! It is great for ethnic skin during the dry winter months!</li>
            <li> Love this product as well.  Not very strong smelling, can barely smell it,  so if your looking that I&#x27;m not sure I would recomend it.  It still very nice on your skin  and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  I will be buying this again</li>
            <li> The ship was fast but the top was cracked there was oil in the box and the product was chunky. Returned.</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on reviews that said it wasn&#x27;t as oily but I personally feel that it&#x27;s still got to much oil in it.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful product!  We had been looking everywhere for this and finally found exactly what we were looking for.  Thank you</li>
            <li> I cannot believe how great this scrub is!  This is a SALT scrub made from Dead Sea salt. Salt scrubs are far different from sugar scrubs.  Salt scrubs do a better job of deep down exfoliating because the crystals are bigger and a bit rougher than the finer and smaller crystals in sugar scrubs.  The citrus and vanilla scrub smells heavenly and after your bath or shower, simply massage this scrub in all over your body.  The water will literally bead up all over you!  This scrub moisturizes and conditions your skin while it exfoliates.  When you rinse off before stepping out the shower, you&#x27;ll literally glow.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great stuff; makes my skin feel and look great.</li>
            <li> This has got to be the best foot scrub I have ever used.  Takes any hard callus off and leaves feet soft.</li>
