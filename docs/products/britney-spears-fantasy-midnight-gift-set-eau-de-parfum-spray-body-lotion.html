            <li> This was a blind buy, and EXACTLY what I&#x27;d hoped for!!!</li>
            <li> I like a few of her perfumes, but this one by far is my fav!</li>
            <li> In a big box, loose.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t spray out, it comes out in a heavy stream and has stained a couple shirts and ruined them and barely smells like perfume.</li>
            <li> The bottle was a little scratched, but luckily it wasn&#x27;t broken.</li>
            <li> If you like Pink Sugar perfume, you will like this.</li>
            <li> Not sure what was mixed with the perfume but what a waste of time and birthday money.</li>
            <li> but you have to wait a little bit to get the scent</li>
            <li> This was the First time that happen and im from venezuela. :(</li>
            <li> The perfume is fake.</li>
            <li> This perfume is nearly impossible to be found in Costa Rica.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Horrible.</li>
            <li> It was packaged horribly.</li>
