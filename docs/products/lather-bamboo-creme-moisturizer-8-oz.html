            <li>Great for summer time.</li>
            <li>it does not smell that great.</li>
            <li>It is so light &amp; is perfect to go with any perfume.</li>
            <li>good follow up to the lather shower creme.  </li>
            <li>They are all amazing.</li>
            <li>It also smells nice too.</li>
            <li>My partner doesn&#x27;t complain about the smell of this lotion &amp; that&#x27;s always nice :)</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Love the lotion.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>and I have been reaching for this lotion more and more.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>But that&#x27;s okay.  </li>
            <li>Loved the light and cool feel.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>doesnt have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>I loved the smell and the absorption of the lotion at the hotel and naturally, wanted to purchase more of this lotion.  </li>
            <li>I first tried it at a nice resort.</li>
            <li>This lotion has a lot of natural ingredients - which is really nice - and it has a very light scent.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li>It feels great going on and it has a terrific, clean light scent.  </li>
            <li>I had discovered their Bamboo/Lemongrass product at a recent hotel stay and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>They smell and amazing and leave your skin super soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a good moisturizer, just not as rich and creamy, and the smell is nice but definitely not quite the same.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I first smelled this in a hotel that featured Lather products in their rooms in downtown Chicago.</li>
            <li>Until now I have only been able to use Ivory bar soap on my face.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this moisturizer while staying at a Loews hotel -- really rich with an addictive scent (fresh but not overpowering).</li>
            <li>I would describe the scent as a unisex soft aquatic with a hint of citrus resulting in a calming aroma that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li>Not as much sandalwood I think.  </li>
            <li>and I have struggled for years trying new products on my super sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is lush and moisturizing but does not leave any greasy sticky residue; keeps the skin soft but &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and cool to the touch.  </li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s priced SO high.</li>
            <li>Since what I received was different than what the hotel product I felt like it wasn&#x27;t worth paying a premium for this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve been having a very hot dry April</li>
            <li>I just started to get into the natural craze pharse, and decided to buy it.</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my overly sensitive skin (no wheat products).  </li>
            <li>I was expecting a little more leafy green bamboo fragrance from this product but aside from that</li>
            <li>Fantastic and subtle scent.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> My brother got me this lotion with a few other things all by LATHER Bamboo.  They are all amazing. They smell and amazing and leave your skin super soft.</li>
            <li> GREAT GIFT FOR WIFE FOR CHRISTMAS, DIDN&#x27;T HURT THAT THERE WERE 2 GIFT WRAPPED BOXES OF A VARIETY OF SCENTS</li>
            <li> I just started to get into the natural craze pharse, and decided to buy it. Loved the light and cool feel. It also smells nice too. Great for summer time.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this in a hotel that featured Lather products in their rooms in downtown Chicago. I got the website from the back of the bottle &amp; ordered this. I love the way it smells. It is so light &amp; is perfect to go with any perfume. It&#x27;s not overpowering. I keep it on my nightstand &amp; put some on my hands each night. My partner doesn&#x27;t complain about the smell of this lotion &amp; that&#x27;s always nice :)</li>
            <li> Love the lotion. I first tried it at a nice resort. I gave 4 stars instead of 5 because it&#x27;s priced SO high.</li>
            <li> good follow up to the lather shower creme.  Easy to use doesnt have a strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> This stuff is not worth 18 bucks. A friend had their bamboo-lemongrass bath wash and I thought is was the best thing had ever bathed with. So I thought getting the lotion would be awesome! Thing is I must have missed read and now see that this is only bamboo-- it does not smell that great.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. Smells heavenly. Love it. I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products. I hope  Lather makes a facial toner or pore  minimizer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t prefer it over other moisturizers that I use.  It is a little too thick and doesn&#x27;t flow easily.</li>
            <li> I was expecting a little more leafy green bamboo fragrance from this product but aside from that, I do like it!  I use it with the matching body wash.  We&#x27;ve been having a very hot dry April and I have been reaching for this lotion more and more. It is lush and moisturizing but does not leave any greasy sticky residue; keeps the skin soft but &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and cool to the touch.  I would describe the scent as a unisex soft aquatic with a hint of citrus resulting in a calming aroma that dissipates quickly.</li>
            <li> I am so bummed that I didn&#x27;t return this ASAP--now I am stuck with it. I had discovered their Bamboo/Lemongrass product at a recent hotel stay and LOVED it. This is NOT the same product....NO lemongrass scent. My bad. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake that I did.</li>
            <li> I order two bottles Lather Bamboo Creme Moisturizer, 8-ounce bottles, the pumps on both bottles did not pump had to take pump caps off  and shake bottle upside to get the creme out.</li>
            <li> I got this brand as a sample at a resort in California, and went home and ordered it online.  It feels great going on and it has a terrific, clean light scent.  Love it</li>
            <li> I tried this lotion while on vacation at LOEWS in Coronado.  I loved the smell and the absorption of the lotion at the hotel and naturally, wanted to purchase more of this lotion.  This lotion has a lot of natural ingredients - which is really nice - and it has a very light scent.  Unfortunately, the smell that the hotel lotion had isn&#x27;t the same as what I received through Amazon.  Not as much sandalwood I think.  But that&#x27;s okay.  The lotion absorbs quickly, isn&#x27;t greasy and lasts all day.  It&#x27;s fantastic stuff.</li>
            <li> I cant use anything on my skin without it breaking out. I am a model and I have struggled for years trying new products on my super sensitive skin. Until now I have only been able to use Ivory bar soap on my face. But I finally found something I can use !! Lather&#x27;s Bamboo creme body wash for my body and face. Than I apply Lather&#x27;s Bamboo creme with shea butter for my mosturiser! Lovez this stuff! I would give it 10 stars if I could!</li>
            <li> Best hand cream ever!  Not too thick, not watery.  Does not irritate my overly sensitive skin (no wheat products).  Fantastic and subtle scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, cracked skin for years and have tried just about everything out there. Found this cream in the bathroom at the Aria Hotel in Las Vegas. This is the best hand/foot cream I&#x27;ve ever used. It absorbs quickly, it&#x27;s not greasy, and it lasts for hours. Expensive, however.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this moisturizer while staying at a Loews hotel -- really rich with an addictive scent (fresh but not overpowering). For Christmas I ordered two bottles as a gift and was disappointed to find that the product was different from the hotel version. It&#x27;s still a good moisturizer, just not as rich and creamy, and the smell is nice but definitely not quite the same. Since what I received was different than what the hotel product I felt like it wasn&#x27;t worth paying a premium for this moisturizer. Guess I&#x27;ll have to stock up next time I&#x27;m at a Loews!</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Great service!</li>
            <li> Not what I was looking for.  Do not like smell.</li>
