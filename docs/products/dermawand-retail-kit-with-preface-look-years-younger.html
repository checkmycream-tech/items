            <li>I wasn&#x27;t happy about the smell it gives off while in usage, it kindda</li>
            <li>B/c the pressure was off to search for a great &amp; immediate result</li>

            <li>honestly she is so happy, I am happy too!</li>
            <li>Oh how I love my derma wand!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s given me a lot more confidence and compliments!!</li>
            <li>Instead of looking like \\&quot;heck\\&quot; and not being able to do anything about it as I did before!!  </li>
            <li>I also have acne which is clearing up very nicely after one week of use.</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t do business very honestly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product samples were very nice for treating my hands.</li>
            <li>This is very nice.</li>
            <li>I suspect this product would be absolutely excellent if I was very consistent in using it!!  </li>
            <li>This wand is amazing!</li>
            <li>Truly amazing, exceeded all expectations!</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product!</li>
            <li>but the change to your skin is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have that many wrinkles to begin with but this thing is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Recommend increasing to the highest setting as soon as able for best results.</li>
            <li>Oh, and yes, we love the way these type of devices work, GREAT for acne and fever blister outbreaks!!</li>
            <li>At this point in my life I&#x27;d be happy if the Dermawand&#x27;s effect causes people to comment that I look good for my age.</li>
            <li>What a nice surprise!</li>
            <li>i have been very good about using it--once a day on most days.</li>
            <li>I bought one years ago on TV , loved it .</li>
            <li>it does feel good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good on pimples too, seems to zap (perhaps electrocute) them,</li>
            <li>I loved Derma Wand I´ve been using it for about a month</li>
            <li>My aesthetician couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin looks....  </li>
            <li>It does feel good on the face, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not good breakdown after 1 week</li>
            <li>This is a good product.</li>
            <li>Good.  5.  Years.  </li>
            <li>If so good as they claim</li>
            <li>This company had to pay these people stating this is a good product.  </li>
            <li>which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing the infomericial and then reading all the good reviews on AMAZON.      </li>
            <li>i read some good reviews online, and decided to order it from amazon, knowing that i could return it if i didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>The dermawand is definetly a good buy.</li>
            <li>People keep commenting how good I look and keep asking me if I had lost weight...</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Although it was good at moisturizing, no effect at all.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product for my mother, and  she loved it.</li>
            <li>By example, my grandmother taught me the value good skin care.</li>
            <li>Yet I did not start a good skin-care regime until I was in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I for one would be delighted to participate in a study, or to buy another one.</li>
            <li>It is good, but there is a lot of room for improvement.</li>
            <li>I thought I could see some good results.</li>
            <li>The one place I have seen good improvement is on my stomach.  </li>
            <li>I loved it</li>
            <li>I figured if I was spending over $100 on something, it would give good results.  </li>
            <li>I was hooked on this wand and loved the oxygen smell.</li>
            <li>Kinda makes me think that something is going on in a good way.....</li>
            <li>Really good for opening eyes.</li>
            <li>GOOD WOULD LIKE TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make Miracles happen, but if you&#x27;re worried you can&#x27;t afford a facelift, and you have the \\&quot;numbers 171\\&quot; in wrinkles between your eyebrows, than this is a good thing for you.  </li>
            <li>I think the Dermawand is a really good product, it just takes time.</li>
            <li>This works good, I also use it any where on my body that may be sore or any where the body feels stressed.</li>
            <li>While it works it is good;</li>
            <li>how good it was, however, until I tried it.  </li>
            <li>It may be a good product if it works as it supposed to</li>
            <li>I bought this and loved it and the tip broke</li>
            <li>Good product!Impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m both relieved and delighted.</li>
            <li>have a good feeling about the outcome.</li>
            <li>I do take care of my skin and use good naural products on my skin.</li>
            <li>And just for the record, I&#x27;m 66, and I must say, I haven&#x27;t felt this good about the way I look in years.</li>
            <li>I REALLY love this product, makes your face feel good!</li>
            <li>This is an exceptional product that helps maintain skin quality when used as directed.</li>
            <li>Now I get the joy of trying to get reimbursement, I plan to try again with QVC where you get a better warranty system.</li>
            <li>Hopefully I will keep getting great results...Would Recommend:)</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>~ get it, use it twice a day, and you will be very glad you did.</li>
            <li>She has been using it for a week or so now and he feels very confident in her one week results.</li>
            <li>most these great reviews must be shills/fakes...</li>
            <li>I have used the Dermawand for two months and I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>This product is awesome and worth the price.</li>
            <li>They make it look very convincing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be honest, I&#x27;ve got good ageing genes.</li>
            <li>think using your own beauty skin care product is just as good.</li>
            <li>I love Derma Wand!</li>
            <li>order one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li>I have had my dermawand for two weeks and love what its doing to my skin!  </li>

            <li>I have been using the Derma Wand now for over a month, and have already seen phenomenal results!  </li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I threw it away and bought something much better quality!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to use it again today for sure!  </li>
            <li>I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li>He hates the way the wand feels but endures it as his skin looks MUCH better!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, but had hoped I&#x27;d like my neck a bit more!</li>
            <li>&#x27;s to better aging!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>the best is that it really WORKS!</li>
            <li>Why have I been ignoring this device when I know better!  </li>
            <li>it was an easy install, and it works great.</li>
            <li>in all, I&#x27;m very excited about the way my skins looks!  </li>
            <li>Fine lines have disappeared, and the texture and tone are greatly improved.  </li>
            <li>Look, this doesn&#x27;t life your face miraculously, but I can attest to the amazing change in my skin.</li>
            <li>If you have cystic acne at all, this is amazing.</li>
            <li>Its cheap and works great as a conductor for this product.  </li>
            <li>What an amazing product.</li>
            <li>No person, women or man should be without this amazing repair tool.</li>
            <li>I know this sounds vain, but after about 6 weeks, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Its amazing.</li>
            <li>Whereas, Amazon has amazing customer service.  </li>
            <li>amazing.</li>
            <li>The difference is amazing.</li>
            <li>Already after two weeks seeing amazing results.</li>
            <li>I have never written a review before but this is so amazing</li>
            <li>but they were not as effective as DermaWand.  </li>
            <li>she really liked it.  </li>
            <li>but it actually feels great and makes your face look great too!</li>
            <li>I am just so thrilled...</li>
            <li>Good  : )</li>
            <li>My face feels nice and tingly afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I began doing my own facials and peels)</li>
            <li>it was smoother and had a nice sheen to it.</li>
            <li>says to do and after a week even my husband looked at me as we were waiting at the airport and said &#x27;you face looks so nice and smooth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Excellent and fast delivery</li>
            <li>The results are not as spectacular as advertised, but if I see some progress.</li>
            <li>I gave it two stars because it is nicely packaged</li>
            <li>The unit seems to work but it would have been nice to get the products with it.</li>
            <li>I am loving how it minimizes and kills the bacteria with acne.</li>
            <li>but not if you are looking for  Face Lift kind of results.</li>
            <li>really good, but I have to be more concisten.  </li>
            <li>i do use my own moisturizer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I&#x27;m not too thrilled about the skin care products that came with it.</li>
            <li>but I kind of like using it</li>
            <li>It was nice to hear from someone else that they noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had some really nice comments on my skin.  </li>
            <li>By the grace of God and some good genes, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, however, I do have some sun (age) spots, sagging in the jowl area and creasing of my eye</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful, amazing, it&#x27;s really works</li>
            <li>because I really liked the stuff</li>
            <li>Would recommend for a nice relaxed awake look.</li>
            <li>I could tell time was catching up with me.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure I need to give it more time before I see any great</li>
            <li>Also, I do not know if you HAVE to use their skin-care products, or if you can use with your own moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use my own skin care products to kept my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>BUT TO BE HONEST</li>
            <li>I WAS HONESTLY GOING TO CANCEL THE ORDER</li>
            <li>I liked the concept of Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and does what it says,  will take awhile though</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using the Dermawand with my own moisturizer and applying it twice a day like the booklet suggests.</li>
            <li>so it must be nice</li>
            <li>You will achieve even better results with higher (pharmaseutical grade) serum, check with your dermatologist or an esthetician who has been working with your skin to see which serum would be best for you.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>The wand however is my new best friend in the beauty department.</li>
            <li>I find that doing the full face&amp;#34; along with the &amp;#34;Spa exercise&amp;#34; at night and just the full face in the morning works best for me.  </li>
            <li>The question is whether this very mild electric stimulation is good for the skin or damaging it.  </li>
            <li>it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>On top of it 30 day free trial!!    </li>
            <li>The oxygen part was the one that I liked the most about the Derma Wand but those wrinkles that I had never had</li>
            <li>I use it frequently for my bruises and am very happy to have this device just for this reason.</li>
            <li>My products work more effectively now too.</li>
            <li>It is a lot more effective.</li>
            <li>its amazing, makes my face tighter, smoother and luminous love it</li>
            <li>Your own moisturizer will work much better.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s easy to follow!</li>
            <li>Dermawand arrived very quickly and I started using it immediately!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The dermawand has reduced the very fine lines around my lips, and plumped them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and refreshing but mainly works very good, meaning that my face is getting healthier</li>
            <li>good choice, after several months of use I can say that it is perfect for skin, fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I was using coconut and magnesium oil, and while it made my skin beautiful, it wasn&#x27;t doing much for the sag and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>So the expression if it seems to good to be true, listen to that.</li>
            <li>In fact one picture of a lady looked too good to be true.</li>
            <li>You know what they say about the too good to be true?</li>
            <li>I was dubious when I purchased Derma Wand as it sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li>Just call the phone number listed to order the Derma Wand instead, and you will be fine!</li>
            <li>The enclosed gel product is good to lubricate the skin but dries out really quickly.</li>
            <li>so I just use my own and find it works better for easy gliding over my skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using my derma wand twice a day for six weeks now and see a nice difference in my fine lines and pore size.</li>
            <li>I also use a nubrilliance microderm and love this stuff called BABYFACE Hyaluric Acid that I get on ebay for about $15.</li>
            <li>This did more for me than watching the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it is said that more you use the Derma Wand, the better it works.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve been using it intensively, according to the instructions booklet and DVD that was supplied with it, and even more than that.</li>
            <li>I have not returned it within 30 days, as I thought I should give it more time to see the results, but I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>How many women can afford it?</li>
            <li>it works better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to think that it&#x27;s working great but can&#x27;t tell too much.  </li>
            <li>I would probably get even better results if I used it twice a day.  </li>
            <li>This I have used safely on my face, throat, hands, fore arms, beneath my arms, chest, thighs and calves of my legs.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe in just two months (of using it 2x a day) how much better my skin looks.  </li>
            <li>How many out there would not be as diligent as I have been?</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>you will love it.</li>
            <li>I dont have many wrinkles anyway...</li>
            <li>I feel like my face seem brighter for sure,  </li>
            <li>so I will review again, and if I don&#x27;t feel free to remind me!  </li>
            <li>There is more to this wand than they promise.  </li>
            <li>He is bald and has a lot of sun damage on top of his head</li>
            <li>Someone commented on how fresh and bright</li>
            <li>but have many others in my arsenal against aging (I am a skin care product junkie..</li>
            <li>I love the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with the results, as I was very nervous about believing it works.</li>
            <li>When I was doing this regularly, my skin did look awesome.  </li>
            <li>Skin tone is more even.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will join those who love it.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks and get lots of compliments about how my face seems to glow..</li>
            <li>Generally more tone to the skin.  </li>
            <li>And using more and more moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I bought another Dermawand this year making sure I have another on hand.</li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>BUT I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li>My face feels better after each treatment.  </li>
            <li>but it better than just waiting for my wrinkle cr&amp;egrave;me to work alone..</li>
            <li>I wrote her again afterward because I had one more question - and she ignored me, twice.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I saw raving reviews and a convincing ad.</li>
            <li>I sure with i had gone through Amazon</li>
            <li>I love this machine.  </li>
            <li>After use my face is tighter, my brows lifted and my skin has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>for the most part, that has taken care of my cystic pimples.</li>
            <li>i will be returning this, as my bank account needs this money more than my face does.</li>
            <li>Satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Sometimes  these review surveys ask too many questions.  </li>
            <li>Came with everything and everything was top shape except for the product box but that didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>I look better now than I did 10 years ago.</li>
            <li>When I use it twice a day as suggested, I see better results at my age.</li>
            <li>I feel more firmness on my skin and somewhat \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I love the way it will lift up the brow line also.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be able to start using it twice a day soon.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>taking static shocks, on your face).  </li>
            <li>but once a week at most because I lack the time to do so; however, hope springs eternal and if it stimulates the production of collagen, all is not lost.  </li>
            <li>try more often in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Five</li>
            <li>more words required???&lt;br /&gt;People does not want to make a review...</li>
            <li>I had read many reviews and women</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I then would wipe off the remaining aloe and use my moisturizer; this works much better with the wand</li>
            <li>I think the magic of this product is hyped.  </li>
            <li>I sure hoped it would work for me.  </li>
            <li>because my wrinkles decrease, I love this product.</li>
            <li>I used it just as I was supposed to and even more after a while of noticing nothing.</li>
            <li>I still love my Dermawand</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased and would purchase this again.</li>
            <li>I hope to give it a better review.</li>
            <li>love this product.  </li>
            <li>I made sure the cap was removed, I even tried it at the highest setting......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more than a month that I keep getting charges on my credit card.</li>
            <li>I have never looked better...</li>
            <li>Nothing too overwhelming</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny to feel this good and not have to go under the knife.  </li>
            <li>The area around my eyes is better too.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my mom and she love love loves her derma wand.</li>
            <li>I am a retired Chemistry teacher, and have made many observations about the product, its quality and capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, 3 minutes twice</li>
            <li>Need to use more often.  </li>
            <li>Just exfoliate with scrubs and peels and your skin will look a lot better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t believe most things I see on TV because of all the ways u can fudge things with technology now days</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect anything great from this product, but my mom bought it for Christmas for my sister and I.  </li>
            <li>I can see more of a change than when I had it done at the spa once a month.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;shipping and handling&amp;#34; is exorbitant, and so many people are charged for a lot more than the cost of the item, and there is no customer service.  </li>
            <li>I think most Amazon shoppers realize that.....</li>
            <li>I Love this product.</li>
            <li>My face is better than before to use it.</li>
            <li>TO GETTING BETTER RESULTS SOON&lt;</li>
            <li>We all love it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t been able to use it since.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li>And so instead, I would use the Creme de Serum (by: Meaningful Beauty Cindy Crawford).</li>
            <li>This is okay.</li>
            <li>I think it takes more than 5-minutes a day.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect magic to happen in 1-3 days coz</li>
            <li>The more I use this, the better my face looks.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect magic to happen in 1-3 days coz</li>
            <li>The more I use this, the better my face looks.</li>
            <li>but I do love it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 and don&#x27;t have many lines</li>
            <li>I love this product so so much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE IT</li>
            <li>Well, I have no idea if it has helped my appearance, but I darn sure think it does the job the machine is set up to do.</li>
            <li>I am glad to have had the opportunity to buy an OTC appliance like this.</li>
            <li>and I am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t work miracles but it does help me to look better.</li>
            <li>This is an interesting device.  </li>
            <li>I am more than pleased with the product..</li>
            <li>I have gotten so many looks and compliments on my skin...</li>
            <li>well I was able to start out on setting 8...</li>
            <li>The customer service department is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>And you know how many of us can&#x27;t resist trying to puncture the cyst with a needle,</li>
            <li>Thanks Derma wand for great product.</li>
            <li>Need more reliability testing and improvements on the product.</li>
            <li>I love it and use it to depuff my eyes and keep finelines around eyes and mouth at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller this time</li>
            <li>giving it one more try because I thought maybe it was the smell making my head explode.  </li>
            <li>This is definatley not to be used alone, much more product than they suggest,.</li>
            <li>started using but tell u better invest  in face workout dvd  than this</li>
            <li>It does sting a bit on the highest level and almost smells like static in the air like when you forget to use fabric softener and your clothes cling together as you pull them apart</li>
            <li>Even though it says that the lifting of the eyebrows only lasts about 3 or 4 hours, I get great results all day!  </li>
            <li>I do wish I&#x27;d ordered it through Amazon, for I&#x27;m nervous that the company will charge me for more product with my Visa card and from all that I read, their customer service is nasty/nonexistent.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>Think it helps -- need more time</li>
            <li>It seems to make your skin look better than before.  </li>
            <li>It brings more circulation to the skin, tones and brightens it.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>I was able to notice some difference in the wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li>With that said, I am truly pleased with the way this Derma wand product continues to improve my skin.  </li>
            <li>forget to use,  but when i do, does ok job...</li>
            <li>taxes and shipping would be added on top of the agreed upon payment.  </li>
            <li>but more at myself because i fell for just another miracle in a can</li>
            <li>I have had one for many years.  </li>
            <li>and I am pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I believe most of the reviews I read on this product were paid for.  </li>
            <li>I found it to work excellently for lifting my upper eye area/lids and firming &amp; tightening the lower eye area as well...</li>
            <li>The skin does not seem to tighten are be firmer or look better.</li>
            <li>The DermaWand worked magic.</li>
            <li>The hardest part is convincing my friends</li>
            <li>Mostly I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; results.  </li>
            <li>With the Derma Wand skin care products,  my skin just feels better, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face sweat.</li>
            <li>However, I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li>My skin is smoother, tighter, and more evenly colored.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>I know she&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.....</li>
            <li>My skin looks better.</li>
            <li>I have no doubt that with continued use my appearance will improve even more.</li>
            <li>Started to love it and see a bit of a difference.  </li>
            <li>I love my Derma wand.</li>
            <li>and I feel it does help make look better.</li>
            <li>It seems to be helping, lines and wrinkles have improved and my eyes look better.</li>
            <li>If you would like to learn more go to www.skinremodelingdiy.com</li>
            <li>I think the price of this product would be more in the $29.99 price range.</li>
            <li>One thing is for sure.  </li>
            <li>I have found that the Derma Wand makes my skin appear smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li>Having said that, I do love this device although I am buying another brand.</li>
            <li>Time will tell on the wrinkles, but my skin texture and firmness is better after just 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I will keep at it as I think it will improve with more time.</li>
            <li>I confess I use the wand once a day most of the time.insted of twice.  </li>
            <li>It is truly magical.</li>
            <li>i have used derma wand for more than 6 years now.</li>
            <li>Gravity and genetics for the most part</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I NEED TO USE IT MORE - JUST HAVE SO MANY THINGS GOING ON</li>
            <li>Zapping stinging feeling and my skin smells burnt after use...not pleased with this product</li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t think it is that great of a product.</li>
            <li>Bought it for an aunt, shes really pleased with it</li>
            <li>Light bulb moment!  </li>
            <li>love this product and could not be without it for even 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>Wish I had better news.  </li>
            <li>Was very excited to get this product.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty amazing to me and reason alone to own it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That was great but my main concern is my face.</li>
            <li>actually it is a very clean smell.</li>
            <li>the manufacturers would design a higher powered unit, I would be delighted to have one.</li>
            <li>My skin is still pretty good, and I&#x27;m basically trying to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works pretty good..</li>
            <li>In the words of my beautiful, young, niece, &amp;#34;that scarf doesn&#x27;t do you any favors</li>
            <li>I urged my mom to buy one and am excited to see her results!  </li>
            <li>I use it MUCH more often as it&#x27;s so easy to just get it and use while watching TV or in bed instead of having to go find a plug.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and feels stimulating, although took a bit to get used to the interesting tingle/spark of static-type pluses.</li>
            <li>Ordered again, arrived ok, worked fine...</li>
            <li>I did a fair amount of research on this product before buying it but a lot of things work great for other people and not me.  </li>
            <li>The wand is easy to use, easy to incorporate into a morning routine, and I quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>my sin tingled and felt a little warm but all and all a very pleasant experince....</li>
            <li>, I can see my skin becoming softer, tighter, shinier and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The derma wand is simple to use and the results are incredible.  </li>
            <li>softening, spots fading, and most made it sound like a miracle wand.</li>
            <li>BUT SO FAR HAPPY</li>
            <li>BUT SO FAR HAPPY WILL KEEP YOU POSTED.  </li>
            <li>I have to say, I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li>It creates a really nice, fresh smelling ozone smell, and I feel that it did help my skin.</li>
            <li>Good seller, thanks</li>
            <li>The Dermawand is very easy and quick to use</li>
            <li>Arriving ahead of schedule, the Derma Wand is easily one of my most important healh and beauty purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li>However, for the \\&quot;blurring\\&quot; of the jawline, mild sagging of the upper eyelids, etc., this product is perfect.  </li>
            <li>But I also used a TON of other skincare products with it for best results.  </li>
            <li>but I would like to get another if I knew I would get one that was full strength!</li>
            <li>Shipping and handling costs to replace product comes to more than 25% of original price.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited to try the product like mostly everyone else in my age group.</li>
            <li>And it ships very quickly and comes w/ directional dvd and carrying case.</li>
            <li>Because it breaks so easy would  be my guess.</li>
            <li>Great product got it for my mother in law and she is looking younger love how it worked..</li>
            <li>It arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;rocks\\&quot; would surface quicker on my face with easy removal.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and does not take a lot of time.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, just need moisture with it - I&#x27;m using an Olay night creme I had in my cabinet.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use</li>
            <li>However, it is easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>so I can glide the Derma Wand easily.</li>
            <li>so I can glide the Derma Wand easily.</li>
            <li>I find the head (top and sides) clouds up after just a minute or 2, and requires effort to clean.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and compact.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, painless and</li>
            <li>Kudos to Amazon for making returns easy.</li>
            <li>This is why I STRONGLY recommend calling to order the Derma Wand and not ordering from the website.</li>
            <li>i strongly recomend not to buy this product based on my expirience and a cupleof friends that bought it and are returning it</li>
            <li>It not only is a great product to create oxygenation to kill bacteria, but it also helps to minimize puffiness and fine lines around the eye contour area when used with an eye cream and appropriate moisturizer.    </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect a quickfix here; it&#x27;s not &#x27;abracadabra&#x27;....just like losing weight or becoming financially secure.....</li>
            <li>coz, it doesn&#x27;t let you do soft stroke during tx, my own moisturizer works better:)</li>
            <li>It gave my cheeks a nice blush in the first week, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>That and a good moisturizer (cocoa butter) have made a huge difference in the anticipated neck &amp;#34;throttle&amp;#34; I antiipated developing in my neck area based on what I saw  in my older cousins and aunts.  </li>
            <li>I have been using the Derma Wand for nearly a month now and have gotten many unsolicited compliments on how clean and bright my complexion is.  </li>
            <li>The feeling is fine</li>
            <li>None of the fine lines are gone or softened and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fit into my schedule.</li>
            <li>Using it on the rest of my face seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li>I have been using a Vitamin C serum from Kiss My Face with the Dermawand, works just fine.</li>
            <li>My fine lines and pores are drastically reduced.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t shrink my pores, didn&#x27;t fade even the finest of fine lines.</li>
            <li>, she loves it and works fine</li>
            <li>Lets just say where it might work on fine lines on your face it does nothing for gravity ie:</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and it helps my skin look more toned.</li>
            <li>This device was not expensive at all, and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I am seeing a huge difference in my acne.  </li>
            <li>So without that, I cannot accurately comment on the toning part of it.</li>
            <li>AND I SEE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE TEXTURE OF MY FACE AND</li>
            <li>Within 1 week I noticed a HUGE improvemnet in my skin texture on my face and ESPCIALLY my neck..</li>
            <li>and I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li>and I got huge complements from all ladies in my party.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>I have noticed  the huge  difference in my complexion and the taughtness of my skin,....</li>
            <li>My pores were huge, I had breakouts, sallow-looking skin, and spots.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have huge expectations for this product, but figured for the price I would give it a try.</li>
            <li>BUT, the sagging skin and huge pores?</li>
            <li>Never used their creams they seemed cheap.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and looks radiant too, but I cannot claim it is because of the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li>Makes my lips and skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li>Which in turn, plumps up cells, which creates filled in lines.</li>
            <li>I am only happy that I have on hand something to use if I ever develop frown lines.</li>
            <li>I think DERMA WAND hoped I didn&#x27;t NOTICE that charge on my account, and rather that I would be suckered into paying for everything on a FREE TRIAL agreement ....</li>
            <li>The light at the end does come on.</li>
            <li>can you tell if it is on besides the light??</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous tool that I will be using for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>The enclosed booklet and instructional video aren&#x27;t as detailed as I would like, but there&#x27;s plenty of information on the internet.  </li>
            <li>as moisturizing makes it not move over my skin smoothly.  </li>
            <li>my eyes are lifted and my skin is showing great results.. who ever said this does not work , does not use it properly.</li>
            <li>I wrote to the developer of the product because she advertises this &amp;#34;feel free to write me&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>My husband uses it (when I gently nudge him) and just one use you can see an amazing transformation.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li>It requires more work than advertised, but I don&#x27;t mind, the results are worth it to me.</li>
            <li>my face looks and feels so smooth after using this after 3 days....    </li>
            <li>I love seeing my wrinkles disappear, pores closing, sagging eyelids getting tighter and that fresh smell that stays with me throughout the days I use it.</li>
            <li>I checked to see if I accidentally bumped up the setting because the needle like shocks were even more powerful than the level 5</li>
            <li>great buy for anyone wanting to manage facial wrinkles and sags.</li>
            <li>(More powerful).</li>
            <li>That Infomercial said that I get to try this for 30-days FREE including shipping is FREE but when I checked my credit card they charged me $20.63</li>
            <li>This product is cheaply made...</li>
            <li>this is a cheap china manufactured product that stopped working 9 days after amazon warranty expired.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it primarily to help with my hormonal chin acne that I have tried everything under the sun to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>but my skin gets smoothly.</li>
            <li>FYI, I use light lotions instead of the gel the send.</li>
            <li>Please feel free</li>
            <li>I feel fortunate that I don&#x27;t have to go to a clinic to get these treatments.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the convenience of  having &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; treatments at home.</li>
            <li>I felt it was cheaply made for the price.</li>
            <li>Hers was much more powerful and caused redness and pain.  </li>
            <li>I am an RN trained in aesthetic facial procedures &amp; I do feel this is a great home product...</li>
            <li>I have been using the DermaWand for the duration of the 30 day free trial and I am going to keep the product.</li>
            <li>Derma Wand refused to acknowledge return even though the U.S. Post Office has confirmed delivery to Derma Wand and our credit card company has agreed we do not owe for the product.  </li>
            <li>Estheticians do not recommend it, and they will bamboozle you into signing up for a Free Rewards program.</li>
            <li>And with regular use of the Wand they are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li>I also try it with premium quality skin creams instead of the cheap ones that come with the product.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>My face looks fantastic.</li>
            <li>The Derma Wand promises a great deal of improvement in facial skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews were good , that is the only reason I ordered this product.</li>
            <li>Just start out on a low setting and get ready to see awesome results!!!</li>
            <li>Your better off using a good facial cream</li>
            <li>I am 57 years old and have fair skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>absolutely nothing !!!</li>
            <li>I really like it tho.!!!</li>
            <li>I very rarely write reviews; but this one deserves a review.  </li>
            <li>Very useful.</li>
            <li>I should not have bought the Derma Wand but, as I am a great oxygen fan and use it in different ways (oral oxygen and ozonators), I decided to buy the Derma Wand.&lt;br /&gt;Though it is true that it *temporarily* plumps up and lifts the face, I had a problem with it</li>
            <li>Easy and quick to use, and</li>
            <li>I like using the derma at night it make my face look rivatilized and fresh for the next beautiful day.</li>
            <li>Not as quick and easy as advertised.  </li>
            <li>I never got to use it since I gifted it to my sister who loves it very much.</li>
            <li>The Derma Wand is fast, easy to use and it explains how it works as well as what you should expect...and most of all it delivers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was excited to use the Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li>I am excited to see what results i get after a moth of dedicated usage.</li>
            <li>I use this twice a day and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I want to say first off, that I&#x27;m so glad that items like this can be ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Drink plenty of water and eat food that are rich in vitamin a,c and e.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed that many of the pores on my nose were decreasing in size.  </li>
            <li>I am using it daily for 5 minues and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li>(so one month more consistently) and the pictures I took yesterday BLEW</li>
            <li>(so one month more consistently) and the pictures I took yesterday BLEW</li>
            <li>Jowls not completely gone, but greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>I have added Life Cell and Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream to my daily regime in addition to the DermaWand and continue to see better and better results!</li>
            <li>Just stick to the original offer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to see the results in another week or two.</li>
            <li>My satisfaction comes from my wife&#x27;s smile!  </li>
            <li>Just zapped one tonight and realized this is worth sharing!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my mid forties and honestly look better than when I was 28.</li>
            <li>But not much on my eye bags..but still good:)</li>
            <li>I am 47 yrs old and although I did not expect any miracles or to look 20 years younger,  I am impressed with the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li>wash my face, and use a toner to clean off any residue.</li>
            <li>If you clean the head.</li>
            <li>and I see so many positive changes I will purchase  again, when mine wears out.  </li>
            <li>Wow, am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>Never worked well the highest intensity was nothing special and the lowest wouldn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li>I have large poors and oily skin, for the most part.</li>
            <li>and  I am a true believer now...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as though I ever paid extra for this but to be honest, I don&#x27;t know how effective it really is...  </li>
            <li>SINCE TURNING 40, I&#x27;VE TRIED AT LEAST 13 PRODUCTS OFF OF THE INTERNET, AND THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!  </li>
            <li>It is ok I haven&#x27;t seen much of an improvement</li>
            <li>Sweet.</li>
            <li>You need a computer to watch the full CD.</li>
            <li>and it is not painful.  </li>
            <li>I use it twice a day for about three minutes, and &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34; it is not painful.</li>
            <li>You will love it and everyone will wonder how much you paid to take the wrinkles off your face.</li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel stimulated - it really seems to energize my face.</li>
            <li>Forget all the negative reviews, this product is GREAT!</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t POSSIBLY be 60!!?&amp;#34; That felt so good.</li>
            <li>really know if it was safe to use.....</li>
            <li>To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used it enough to know if it lends results.  </li>
            <li>but when I compared it with my sister&#x27;s, hers was much stronger and she is getting much better results.  </li>
            <li>I returned it, and Amazon gave me a full refund.  </li>
            <li>So far, it&#x27;s been a nice experience.</li>
            <li>I did not receive the full line of items that come with the one that is advertised on TV.</li>
            <li>But it is worth trying out for the 30 day free trial.</li>
            <li>My skin is in good shape for 43, but I bought this for the starting of crows feet</li>
            <li>The gel supplied with the machine is chock full of suspicious (to me) chemicals.  </li>
            <li>She also explained that today I would have to pay the full tax on the Derma Wand, which came to $8.27 for my state tax.</li>
            <li>Although the produuct construction is good and it does produce a variable controlled tingling sensation, it is soon to tell if the claims of the manufacturer are valid because I have only tried it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>so I know how a true in office machine like this works.</li>
            <li>The sting is not bad.  </li>
            <li>Since it is made out of aloe vera, I thought it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>Since it is made out of aloe vera, I thought it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li>And it is important to get the right amount of moisture on the skin for use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a gentle, steady, summer rain. :)</li>
            <li>I did not buy mine through their site--I paid about $60 for mine on Amazon, and for that price I most certainly got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>but since I&#x27;ve tried other items with \\&quot;great</li>
            <li>It was a waste of good money!  </li>
            <li>I chose a 1 star rating because the first time I used it the derma wand seemed to work fine</li>
            <li>The DW  smooths fine lines and absolutely opens the eyes!</li>
            <li>works just not as quickly as I would like&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Incidentally, works well with people with mild bells palsy.</li>
            <li>I am practically free of wrinkles and, thanks to some excellent facial exercises I have been doing for about three years, my face is firm and nicely toned up.</li>
            <li>It has made me feel more confident and youthful in a short time.</li>
            <li>Lastly, be loyal to the use of this product for skin tightening.</li>
            <li>I use it extensive my around the eyes on max setting with no problems, only great improvement!</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my mild wrinkles, either.</li>
            <li>had to stop, for my skin to heal &amp; under eye mild burning to stop  </li>
            <li>Quick shipment.</li>
            <li>My best to all of you who are in their pursuit of matching their external beauty with their internal beauty, God Bless.</li>
            <li>I´ve been wanting to buy this product for years now, and did´t because i was either pregnant, nursing, pregnant again nursing again and didn´t</li>
            <li>Super service from seller...</li>
            <li>I will say, if you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix or surgical results, this product is not for</li>
            <li>By the end of day 4, the enthusiasm swiftly quickly wears off.</li>
            <li>Received the product quite quickly.</li>
            <li>i think it  mostly killing grams and not really giving u amazing results</li>
            <li>Everything came quickly and fully.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed furrows between my eyebrows in my 30s, but managed to be mostly wrinkle and sag free until about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>and I was quickly beginning to look my age.  </li>
            <li>and  it&#x27;s toned my face, particularly the cheeks and under the chin  and has given me a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used it much but so far so good.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a smoother more toned look and feel to their skin.</li>
            <li>Since this is time consuming, I would normally do it during my favorite TV show.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles and my face is pretty smooth</li>
            <li>All-in-all, I am very pleased after using for only one week.</li>
            <li>I trust it will be good in the long run after applying it every day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m turning 47 in a couple months and years of too much fun, too much sun, too much sorrow, too much stress, weight fluctuations and neglect of a good skincare regime</li>
            <li>This should be called the magic wand instead, it is fantastic, after a couple of months you can see the difference - this is a product that you cannot live without it because it really helps, your face looks radiant and you notice that the wrinkles specially around the eyes get smoother every time.</li>
            <li>I would say though that you have to be consistent with using it and definitely use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>Overall I think it works pretty good</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use while watching TV and doesn&#x27;t take too much time.  </li>
            <li>Too soon to have real results but it is easy to use so</li>
            <li>Well when I got it I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li>I am almost 39 years old, look pretty young for my age and figured it would be a great tool to add to my anti aging routine.</li>
            <li>I look younger and more refreshed!</li>
            <li>I originally had a problem with the first product shipped, but they contacted me immediately to correct the problem.  </li>
            <li>was planning to wait to review until I used the device for one month, but saw results so fast!!  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for 3 weeks and honestly, I believe it has made my skin look more wrinkled than less.</li>
            <li>So I have to say you will get results quickly, but not miracles right away.  </li>
            <li>Really helpa fine lines, pores.&lt;br /&gt;Tightens skin.</li>
            <li>So far so good, easy to use, and it looks like it will improve my skin after constant use.  </li>
            <li>(I did clean it thoroughly when I first got it and</li>
            <li>In spite of all this, I still sometimes skip my twice a day, but other times, I&#x27;ll do a quick afternoon &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; just because I can&#x27;t believe how good it looks.</li>
            <li>Great product to keep your skin looking firm</li>
            <li>Then it was gone, and my skin really did become perfectly free of blemishes.</li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t real fast</li>
            <li>results do not seem lasting; perhaps I am too old, LOL</li>
            <li>Anything that is worth it takes time.</li>
            <li>Well worth the cost--</li>
            <li>this is defintly worth the money I use it every day</li>
            <li>and it surely does not compare to the professional treatment you receive in salons and dermatologist offices.</li>
            <li>......takes to much time suppose to use morning and night,it would be good if you had the time to spare especially in the morning</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel soft,  hopefully helping my moisturizers do a better job.  </li>
            <li>55 and most people peg me for early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>to be honest, i am quite prone to acne, especially on my chin.</li>
            <li>We use this procedure to help products (like serums, antioxidants) get absorbed into the skin, to help stimulate collagen production, and increase elasticity and tone in the skin.</li>
            <li>Some of the deeper creases at the smile line have softened.</li>
            <li>From all the reviews that I&#x27;ve read, this seems to be rare.  </li>
            <li>I could probably give this more stars if I were not 100 years old, plus I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>and the next day I looked liked</li>
            <li>the laugh lines are fading.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice at-home facial.</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about 4 weeks now, but thrilled with my results.</li>
            <li>did you finally turn 50?&amp;#34; I just smiled and shook my head</li>
            <li>I will keep you posted on my success...</li>
            <li>It was worth the money</li>
            <li>1/18/13: I&#x27;m starting to get compliments from friends and acquaintances telling me how nice my skin</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li>After three weeks, the results are visual - nice to receive complements.</li>
            <li>The massage this product provides leaves your skin feeling fresh and tingling from the increased bloodflow, creating the only true foundation for real, natural beauty: good skin.</li>
            <li>Feeling practically suicidal before I received this item, I can truly say that it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot for those looking for a painless fix.</li>
            <li>I have used it for six weeks and cannot observe any lessening of the crowsfeet around my eyes or lessening of the smile lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>It has been the only thing I have had any kind of success with.  </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>The smell that it emits when using reminds me of fresh outdoor air.  </li>
            <li>All in all, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li>face feels plumped and fresh</li>
            <li>I only use it once a day for about 5 minutes, with my own skin moisturizing products.  </li>
            <li>if the lifting didn&#x27;t work the dermawand is worth the price just for what it did for my skin...</li>
            <li>When my 12 year old grand daughter looked at me</li>
            <li>My eyes look fresh and lifted.  </li>
            <li>Had purchased dermawand, best thing I ever did, results are fantastic and unfortunately I broke it and will not hestitate to order another one.  </li>
            <li>But so far I&#x27;m enjoying the Wand.</li>
            <li>This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li>You can feel it &#x27;working&amp;#34;, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li>I am not a gadget person unless that product is worth the money</li>
            <li>I think the Dermawand is well worth the price from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I very rarely review anything, but I am so thankful that I found this item I felt compelled to share so that others would know that it really does work.  </li>
            <li>On another note, if anyone has experienced firming or toning of any other areas from using this product, namely upper arms or thighs, I would love to know.  </li>
            <li>After reading other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to take a chance; I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>The DermaWand was stashed away and forgotten for many years due to life having her way with me as she does for so many.  </li>
            <li>Just this past week, I&#x27;ve received more than a dozen compliments from friends, family and coworkers on how great my skin looks and how young I appear (I&#x27;m 60).  </li>
            <li>Other websites had this rated and it was not given good reviews.</li>
            <li>I decided to give the Derma Wand a try after reading good reviews by other customers.  </li>
            <li>and I need to just use it right twice a day once in the morning and one in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>Since I have used Derma wand, I notice I get a twitch in my right eye.  </li>
            <li>You just have to know that it isn&#x27;t going to work miracles right away.</li>
            <li>Results right away.  </li>
            <li>everyone feels the tingle sensation right away&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>That &amp;#34;response&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t sit right with me.  </li>
            <li>After the 1st time used it, I could see the result right away.</li>
            <li>I started to see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li>Right now, I am a work in progress.</li>
            <li>I HOPE I CAN GET IT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li>I used the products that came with the wand for the first few days then just went back to my regular day/night creams, added a bit of water when I needed more &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; and to be honest, I am super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>my eye area is lifted and full; my lips are fuller and more luscious &amp; youthful, especially if I use DW with a lip plumper!</li>
            <li>and im hopjng that with daily use effects will ne lomger lastimg very easy to use</li>
            <li>In an hour, I actually feel my eyesight becoming sharper!</li>
            <li>There are so many major health risks that come with RF...</li>
            <li>As with all the procedures like high frequency, galvanic, or light therapy the results are temporary.</li>
            <li>No matter how many facials I have had along with using only oil free products nothing gave me a clear smooth face.    </li>
            <li>Well after using it for a few weeks acne got slightly better, but my skin started to look better in general and the very fine lines around my eyes were practically gone.  </li>
            <li>Your eyes lift,creases go away, &amp; in the morning-I really saw the impact of a true \\&quot;lift\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>There has been no miraculous removal of wrinkles from my face, but my face does look smoother and just better in general.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true this can be very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li>I am disappointed because I really need this kind of item.let&#x27;s hope for the better one.the prize is attractive compare to nu-brilliance</li>
            <li>and I need help to change me a new one free of charge, as does the warranty</li>
            <li>If they come out with a cordless version or if I can trade this in for one, I&#x27;d certainly do that!</li>
            <li>I noticed a plumping right after I used the wand for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I really liked this device.......while it lasted, which wasn&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li>One has to wonder if different companies don&#x27;t pay them to \\&quot;work from home\\&quot; to post nothing but great things about various products.</li>
            <li>My 8 year old daughter has red hair and a fair complexion and tends to pick at her boo boos that take forever to heal.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money at medi-spas getting laser light treatments and peels and facials and this dermawand works better than all of it put together.</li>
            <li>I get good results with the derma-wand using it with Elizabeth Gant&#x27;s anti-aging serums and doing it slightly differnt than the directions.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always had kind of dry skin</li>
            <li>think there would be many more happier customers if  this unit was more of a medical device and less of a massager.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And my Marietta lines are less noticeable it is almost a good as a juvederm injection.</li>
            <li>I can say, that when I did use it with my other products I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this item and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying, I&#x27;m 48 and have never been very responsible when it comes to skin care.  </li>
            <li>The product came very fast.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, but it does seem like its doing something--not sure what yet!!!</li>
            <li>When I get a cyst starting, I put the DermaWand right on the top of where the cyst is, zap it at a setting of 6 or more for a minute a time three times a day, and the cyst quite simply disappears, without scarring or discoloring my skin, and without pain.</li>
            <li>I dark circles under my eyes and many fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super easy to use and I plan on continuing because I am definitely getting the results I had hoped for.</li>
            <li>product arrived super fast...and the return was done very fast and professional, it was even picked up at my home, thank you for a super fast service!</li>
            <li>Great product  when it&#x27;s new&lt;br /&gt;2stars after using it a while it hardly works</li>
            <li>At first I thought I might be imagining the improvement - but after catching my reflection in a mirror that I did not know was there, I realized the effects are real, and I will certainly keep using this wand as part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li>I First saw this derma wand on the FOX Channel.</li>
            <li>I used the Derma Wand twice a day, on a higher dial (#7, it stimulates and shocks the skin) for 1.5 months now.  </li>
            <li>But if you are willing to take the time and continue using it</li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S REAL !</li>
            <li>I am in a full blown battle with them at this time because I fell for their \\&quot;FREE TRIAL\\&quot; ad (info mercial) and they charged not only the $144.95, but they also then charged another $9.95 shipping the day I ordered it.</li>
            <li>I have had this for about a year, and it think it really works, keeps the skin tighter and helps with the smile lines</li>
            <li>However, I am on a medication that causes bleeding and some pretty severe bruising.</li>
            <li>There is absolutely no change of any kind.</li>
            <li>, I just relaxed &amp; actually used it more, like 3-4 times/week, not timing it, just enjoying the gentle massage, the general benefit which I know for a fact is there (i.e.: research).</li>
            <li>I returned it, the first week, this product does not work</li>
            <li>so he was willing to try it.  </li>
            <li>And speaking of pain, unless you are supersensitive, there is none, even at the higher settings.  </li>
            <li>since my eyebrows are higher so my eyes are brighter.</li>
            <li>Was using it pretty faithfully</li>
            <li>I have been wanting the Derma Wand Kit for many years and finally purchased one.  </li>
            <li>More youthful appearance after only about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li>The only thing this product does is crisp the top layer of your skin.</li>
            <li>but it did for me which is a first.</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>Since I have monthly facials, I am acquainted with the commercial size machine and how it works.</li>
            <li>I am an esthetician and continually get questions about the quality of this item, so I decided to buy it to see how it worked exactly.</li>
            <li>But they make you believe it happens the first use</li>
            <li>I think if you are younger, you will see more results than if you don&#x27;t start it till your 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact there were more wrinkles under my eyes after the initial swelling was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was eager to get started with Dermawand when I saw the infomercial and started using this and started seeing an improvement IMMEDIATELY after my first use.  </li>
            <li>Better to use it 2xs daily.</li>
            <li>I know it works as I told no one I was using it and have received so many compliments and inquiries as to what I am doing to make my skin look so much younger.  </li>
            <li>so it may work better for younger women.</li>
            <li>first off, I was only able to use this product for 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say this product does not work, just why I dislike it and stopped using it after 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Months later, I find that time is still winning with aging effect in spite of faithful use..  </li>
            <li>Maybe for younger skin it works better.  </li>
            <li>I purchased my first Derma Wand Kit about a month ago.  </li>
            <li>Be aware.</li>
            <li>It definitely helps if you stay on top of it.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a rip off, wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on it.</li>
            <li>At first my skin looked flushed and it seemed to be working .</li>
            <li>Item as described, I have been using this product daily and love the results.</li>
            <li>Today is the first day of trying this Derma Wand.</li>
            <li>I did exactly what the dvd said</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first impression.</li>
            <li>It truly does show improvement if used consistently.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day exactly as the directions, and nothing.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I was hoping for more improvement on my upper eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>looks(they don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve been using DermaWand), and I am starting to notice more improvement around my eyes.</li>
            <li>you look like you are so pretty now</li>
            <li>I wasnt pretty before she was</li>
            <li>I should do more resource next time</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>but not the changes that read like the first week or sooner.  </li>
            <li>- we put up with a lot more in the name of &amp;#34;beauty.&amp;#34;  Some reviewers commented that you had to use this on a regular basis; well, of course, you do.  </li>
            <li>you need to be constant to get better results.</li>
            <li>to test and see, I used Hydra Support Cream first then added the Hydra Infusion then Skin Mist.</li>
            <li>today is exactly 30 days from the day I started using Derma Wand.</li>
            <li>I use it on my eyes and above my eyebrows the most</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve skipped it for about 24 hours or so now, and I could tell first thing this morning when looked into the mirror.</li>
            <li>I received the Derma Wand over the weekend, and tried it out first thing Monday.  </li>
            <li>and as far as the popping sound of elecricity goes</li>
            <li>Although it takes a month to see improvement, I feel confident that by following the instructions and reviewing the video several times, I&#x27;ll look better.</li>
            <li>The machine does not hurt and my skin responded well after the first treatment.</li>
            <li>The first 2 weeks</li>
            <li>They also charged  me 60 plus for the first payment and convinitely</li>
            <li>Even the first week I noticed my skin looked healthier and had a glow.</li>
            <li>In fact I didn&#x27;t think I was seeing any lifting at all after the first month until I weighed...</li>
            <li>Dermawand is a great product at least for me.</li>
            <li>Maybe more later.</li>
            <li>First saw this product on TV over a decade ago.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughter was visiting the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>to better aging!has now been two months total</li>
            <li>which is what happened to my first one.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are not going away, or getting better (the wife uses it religiously)....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m  consistent with the use of it  in this way</li>
            <li>intend to continue though, thinking maybe even once a day several times a week is better than nothing at all.</li>
            <li>Not difficult to use..</li>
            <li>I ordered the Derma Wand about two weeks ago by first going to their web site and then calling the phone number listed on the web site.</li>
            <li>She explained that the Derma Vital skin care products automatically come with the Derma Wand offer and were free, except that my credit card would be charged the $9.99 for shipping/processing of the skin care products.</li>
            <li>see below for my first review.</li>
            <li>I have not been consistent in using this product so I will update in a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Saw a difference the first day.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t believe &amp;#34;nay sayers&amp;#34;, because it really works!</li>
            <li>would say better:  \\&quot;It does electrify like a real short circuit\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li>The first day we could see a difference.</li>
            <li>Feels good, skin is firm</li>
            <li>neither good, nor bad...until a few days ago.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and everyone says how rested and good</li>
            <li>A waste of good money.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it would burn my skin, but have quickly moved up to the high settings with no problem.</li>
            <li>It takes much longer if you want to do it right, and you have to do it twice a day.</li>
            <li>I have decided it is a foundational item to have in my beauty kit - not the only answer to every problem, but a key essential, along with a good cleansing/moisturizing routine, exercise, healthy eating, sleep &amp; reducing</li>
            <li>and I had these huge bags that sat at the top of my cheeks one week after I had stopped crying.</li>
            <li>The product is honest to goodnes true but unfortunately, I am lazy to use it.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny to try this product especially with the 30 day free trial.  </li>
            <li>Feels funny at first, but I really think it has helped my skin.  </li>
            <li>It feels good on your skin after used, almost the same feeling after facial tx @</li>
            <li>already the next day several people said I looked good today.</li>
            <li>The Dermawand works ok in the United States, but does not work very well outside of the US in places that require an adaptor.  </li>
            <li>Thanks you very much.  </li>
            <li>The scar is faintly visible, but if the unit was more powerful it would have more successfully and completely eliminated the puckers in my neck and stretched skin from where my thyroid damaged it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel it has a positive effect on my skin.</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to buy the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li>However, this device does produce positive results.</li>
            <li>I read positive reviews, but not my experience.  </li>
            <li>that should have been my first clue that this wouldn&#x27;t work, but the lady on there seemed to really perk up her face while using this.</li>
            <li>We got it pretty fast in the mail, no hassle.</li>
            <li>different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Derma Wand obsessively for the first two weeks straight.  </li>
            <li>It really works but you must use it consistently.</li>
            <li>Not sure yet but seems to feel good and will take time to see</li>
            <li>This seems like a good product but it is not magic as some might hope for.  </li>
            <li>So if you still decide to go ahead taking in of all the positive reviews like I did,  make sure you can commit to it EVERY single day twice a day like the instructions call for.</li>
            <li>You will find that it is easy to use and if used properly, it should make a dent in any wrinkle you might have.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product through Dermawand on TV; received the item very quickly with all the facial products.</li>
            <li>can wait until I see full result in few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It feels good on your face, but I have not had it long enough to see if it will do what it is touted to do.  </li>
            <li>I decided that it certainly couldn&#x27;t hurt,</li>
            <li>no allergic reaction problems, but i tend to get large cystic acne there.</li>
            <li>but I know everyone has a certain skin care regiment that suits them.  </li>
            <li>She says it works and certainly helps the skin</li>
            <li>(my bathroom is large and never steams up)</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy this, again, and recommend it to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li>It also burnt my face in certain areas.</li>
            <li>I had been using pure aloe gel and it does work as well</li>
            <li>followed by  coconut oil (pure &amp; organic), or castor oil (</li>
            <li>I use the wand everyday, I love it!</li>
            <li>At a gathering, no one could believe that I&#x27;m in my slightly over mid 50&#x27;s lol.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use but at the same time, very time consuming.  </li>
            <li>I was super surprised that the lines (not wrinkles, they&#x27;ve been with me my whole life)</li>
            <li>I have a few fine lines and puffiness under my eyes, that is all and the fine lines are just as noticeable today as they were 4 months ago.</li>
            <li>If you stop using it, your muscles won&#x27;t stay nice and tight.</li>
            <li>After the initial reaction &amp; all the drama calmed down, my grand daughter said,  &amp;#34;Nana, your face&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li>The progress makes the deep lines to be less noticeable; I believe my facial skin will look as good as my friend&#x27;s if I continue using it for a year!!!</li>
            <li>The fine lines around the lower eye are almost gone and overall, my skin is tighter around the chin and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>BE REALISTIC!</li>
            <li>Instead I look much older!  </li>
            <li>Made my skin look 5 years older!</li>
            <li>This is one nice little gadget.</li>
            <li>people who said it make them breakout clean the bulb with alcohol pad or something zap the areas with higher setting slightly above the skin surface...</li>
            <li>Only been using this for a few days, but I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li>It arrived much faster than I anticipated,  as well.</li>
            <li>and I really like it...</li>
            <li>I tried it once or twice and really like how it feels.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time getting ready</li>
            <li>and nothing is happening, nada, absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li>It has really helped the tone of my skin and the crows feet.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Derma wand a couple of years ago, and even though I used it faithfully, I didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, using it caused my bruises to fade much faster, and this in return, prevented the staining.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really seen results, yet.  </li>
            <li>It gradually (VERY gradually, in my case) smoothed out, improved &amp; appears to be gently restoring the condition of the skin &amp; underlying muscle.</li>
            <li>It is also very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>performed better that expected</li>
            <li>So I guess I really don&#x27;t know if it works...</li>
            <li>my smile lines and brow creases are nearly gone.</li>
            <li>lightening fast</li>
            <li>That is my case, the skin hasn&#x27;t really begun to sag yet (</li>
            <li>This device really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I think the lotion used really matters too.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know much about how it works yet.  </li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>I really bought this for entertainment value..</li>
            <li>I have not used this product as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>Same feel, smell, sound, and results.</li>
            <li>I really feel I will be returning it.</li>
            <li>Intense.</li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>The product works very well.</li>
            <li>It is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really feel like my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li>The lotion that comes with this dries too fast, so I use my grapeseed oil or Argon oil.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it.  </li>
            <li>As much as I wanted to believe it worked, I saw no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li>I have been using the wand for about 2 weeks straight.  </li>
            <li>so I assume it is working, but will have to continue use to make up my mind on how much it works.</li>
            <li>, I really like the way it makes my face feel and it does seem to make my face feel tighter, it has become a routine for me</li>
            <li>I was very faithful in using it.</li>
            <li>I used this with the Aloe that was included for the 1st 3 minutes massaging my face, I did not like the included aloe, it dries fast and is very sticky</li>
            <li>And I really don’t want that type of lift, I want my collagen restored as I thought this product was supposed to help with.</li>
            <li>Just beginning and works really well.</li>
            <li>I cant really see that it is improving my skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t think I got much benefit.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I know that there is a lot of controversy regarding if the Dermawand really works.  </li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t until one of my friends at work told me I looked really rested and my wrinkles had soften.</li>
            <li>Simply works fantastic.</li>
            <li>Thanks god.</li>
            <li>For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li>so much Christina Boves for creating the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li>One time my eyes was really puffy when I woke up.</li>
            <li>and it is working really well.  </li>
            <li>Really would not reccomend wasting your money.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a confirmed Amazon shopper, and would never order one of these from the television commercial.  </li>
            <li>Also, if I can just maintain what I have, and then maybe see a bit of improvement, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m really looking for.  </li>
            <li>That is how much stronger</li>
            <li>WORKED REALLY</li>
            <li>BUT IT REALLY DOES WORK FOR REAL</li>
            <li>thanks to my friend who recommend me this product.</li>
            <li>the cream that comes with it dries up to fast.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is doing anything that much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t start thinking much about it until about age 40.  </li>
            <li>It took me a couple weeks to see a real difference in firmness.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it very highly...especially for women my age....</li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t give this a rating because I never even tried it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 60 and have fought cystic acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li>will really work.</li>
            <li>The Baby Quasar did absolutely nothing either.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my skin DOES feel much firmer.</li>
            <li>I tried it for a month and did not realize how much of a difference in the tone and firmness of my eylids, jawline, and neck until I did not use it for a month.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice much around my mouth though.</li>
            <li>My skin looks much firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li>what did you do?&amp;#34; I told her about the Derma Wand and now she wants one.</li>
            <li>I tried this for three months on my face as directed, and also gave it a try on scars just to see if it really could stimulate collagen in the area.</li>
            <li>What is it really trying to do??</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in my skin</li>
            <li>I had lost 7 pounds and there was no change in my face...and for me that is unusual.</li>
            <li>If your not feeling the tingling sort of buzzing sensation then you are either using too much pressure with the wand against your skin or you used too much product...</li>
            <li>, you looked really sick&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>If you really want to look really &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; in terms of the youth today it works.  </li>
            <li>DermaWand really works.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Nothing, no matter how much I tried, was making a noticeable (to anyone but me</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
            <li>it works real well, I like it and will recommend ti to my friends</li>
            <li>Jaw line is much firmer.</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>My face feels so much smoother</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement with wrinkles  </li>
            <li>I NEVER want to be without one and will be a faithful user because the results are REAL.</li>
            <li>REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>I really like using it</li>
            <li>In fact, I was amazed at how much the Derma Wand helped heal the skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use the skin care products that came with it, except for the pre-face.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping as described AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li>Too bad--it worked really well for 5 weeks--</li>
            <li>and they are much plumper.  </li>
            <li>Just started using my derma wand and already see results, not so much on the wrinkles</li>
            <li>I REALLY SHOULD</li>
            <li>Mwife really likes this product</li>
            <li>I so much wanted to believe the hype.</li>
            <li>Also, after 5 minutes of use it doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li>but we need to moisturize more, stay young on the outside as well.</li>
            <li>I believe we all have different conditions in aging that make the very same product effective or not.</li>
            <li>I am 67 year old female and have always taken care of my complexion and stopped the sun worship many years ago.  </li>
            <li>I am especially happy about my under jaw and neck area, which was the area I hated the most.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Today, nearly a decade later I am doing better.  </li>
            <li>Like others, I would not order directly from Dermawand - why pay $50 or more extra if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li>I just got this a few days ago, but I can honestly say I think it is making a difference.  </li>
            <li>so far so good I can see a difference- take a bit of time everyday</li>
            <li>I have, after two weeks use, noticed a marked improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture, and my adult acne breakouts are much improved!!!  </li>
            <li>not very expensive.</li>
            <li>whole thing about guaranteed money back is bs too because I have the original packaging, receipt &amp; so on &amp; am being told it has been 65 days instead of the stated on receipt 60 days to return</li>
            <li>But as time went by there were other products promising more easier glory, and my Derma Wand got resigned to the &amp;#34;it works but requires dedication&amp;#34; box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the tingly sensation of the DermaWand and find it refreshing and relaxing at the end of a long day after a deep facial cleansing.</li>
            <li>I think I use it better after watching some youtube videos of how other people were using it.  </li>
            <li>Remember to prep your skin with the pre-treatment or any other moisturizer before use, so that the wand glides along your skin better.</li>
            <li>Other than that it make skin look much better.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Dermawand for about three weeks, and I actually see a significant firming effect on my neck and jawline, which have been been a concern for some time.</li>
            <li>This is my first negative review but have to be honest.</li>
            <li>great product, gets rid of small wrinkles,lesson deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The Pre-Face treatment gets dry so easy on my face, I cannot glide the wand on my face.</li>
            <li>My health suffered and my skin turned older faster than it would have if I hadn&#x27;t went through so much.</li>
            <li>but my pores are smaller and skin generally looks better.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my go-to for those occasional zits that develop before a special event.  </li>
            <li>only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I do not want to suggest it is some kind of single, lighting-strike miracle.</li>
            <li>I am noticing a minor tightening in my neck and jawline area, as well as a smoothing of the light lines and \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot; between my eyes.  </li>
            <li>Then, if after the 30 day trial I decide to keep the Derma Wand, then I would be charged $39.95 for the first real payment plus $14.95 for the shipping/processing for a total of $54.90 for the first of 3 monthly payments.</li>
            <li>I really haven&#x27;t been able to tell much different in the amount of times I have used it, not as regular as recommended</li>
            <li>I love this product as it helps keep the redness down on my skin and my skin feels a lot</li>
            <li>Received az a gift and dedicated way too many hours and hopes for just a minimal improvement but no change whatsoever!!</li>
            <li>pure &amp; organic too) and a few more minutes running the wand over it in circles and upstrokes from mouth to forehead.  </li>
            <li>I feel healthier with my new glow and the bags are gone!  </li>
            <li>New shoes would be nicer!</li>
            <li>MY NEW DRIVERS LICENSE PICTURE TELLS THE WHOLE STORY (JUST GOT IT YESTERDAY)  </li>
            <li>I have been using the DermaWand for about 2 weeks, and have noticed improvement along the jaw line in particular (which was the main reason I purchased the wand).  </li>
            <li>My complaints are mostly with the products/creams that come with the kit -- they&#x27;re OK, but not awesome.  </li>
            <li>I am a lot older than she and have scarring and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>it to my older daughter to amuse herself with.</li>
            <li>older woman.  </li>
            <li>, I do it longer at night while watching TV before going to sleep and a quick overall after I moisturize in the morning before I apply make-up.  </li>
            <li>bought this item for my wife, she uses it everyday and absolutely loves it, price was about $30 cheaper than at most places too, and it arrived 2 days after placing order.</li>
            <li>It is not an inexpensive beauty tool, and  after 6 months daily use I do not believe it should have burnout that quickly.  </li>
            <li>But costing over $100, I am hoping to get a refund, or better yet, to see if a properly working unit will give me the results claimed, exchange it to see if another unit will last to give me the reduced lines and jowls.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it one star is because it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>That would not be realistic.  </li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re patient enough to use this on a regular basis, you won&#x27;t need to spend a lot more money paying a plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li>I think I was realistic in my expectations.</li>
            <li>and I just love it and after about the 2nd week (using only about 4-5 mins twice a day)</li>
            <li>YouTube has some decent vids, maybe if I continue to get results I&#x27;ll throw up a video.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m an older woman</li>
            <li>I have seen the different though she looks a bit younger :)</li>
            <li>I use it for blemishes, facial massage, and more recently to promote healing of a skin injury.</li>
            <li>Since I haven&#x27;t used it THAT long, I cannot comment on the long term benefits but the instant benefits are remarkable.  </li>
            <li>The prod does give you a fast mini face lift--&amp; over time -WOW-!</li>
            <li>I was very surprised!</li>
            <li>Highly suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used it on the high settings...</li>
            <li>I do not use indirect high frequency, so the Dermawand suits me well as it is compact and portable.</li>
            <li>We do a procedure called high frequency in our spa, derma wand is a high frequency machine.</li>
            <li>I use a high setting everywhere except upper-eye area under brows.</li>
            <li>I did this (not noticing that I was not supposed to go as high as I did)</li>
            <li>After reading about the radio high frequency being put into your body with the use of this, I opted to return it and valued my health versus having wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly...</li>
            <li>I have been using it twice a day on the high setting for approx.</li>
            <li>So  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this treatment.</li>
            <li>and I really do not have high hopes that it will improve my fine lines I have.</li>
            <li>DermaWand has given me a whole new look and a new beginning,  I will tell anyone who is considering getting a DermaWand to  do it.  </li>
            <li>but I am going to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles so was looking for a little improvement.</li>
            <li>Do Not waste your money!!</li>
            <li>They told me to email Derma Wand directly and, surprise!!, no response.</li>
            <li>Wow! Believe!</li>
            <li>I just got &#x27;carded&#x27; this weekend by a club security guard who suspected I was under 21 years old!!</li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel better as in softer and maybe a little firmer, but has not reduced any wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The only thing is the instructions don&#x27;t mention you have to CLEAN THE CLEAR HEAD WITH EVERY USE.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product that already has made major changes in my skin after only about a month of use.  </li>
            <li>....I might edit my rating down the line, but this item, and the reasonable price, is just fine with me.  </li>
            <li>and wow it really works.</li>
            <li>It was never dropped, always stored in its case in a clean, dry cabinet, never exposed to even a steamy room</li>
            <li>On my young son&#x27;s face... it really does help with skin breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Dermawand for what could could have cost thousands by a professional.</li>
            <li>After just a few uses they were noticeably better.</li>
            <li>but I just haven&#x27;t had a lot of time since you are supposed to use it only with a freshly cleaned face and time</li>
            <li>My wife is extremely satisfied with the results after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and I  love the effects on my face</li>
            <li>as with most stuff like this it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li>My skin is much more firm than it use to be.  </li>
            <li>I got it for my double chin, pores, and laugh lines..</li>
            <li>Worth the price if you are starting to notice some sagging of the jaw and neckline and don&#x27;t want to do anything drastic like plastic surgery.</li>
            <li>The deep laugh lines I had</li>
            <li>I´ll comment in a few more months and see if I´m getting younger!haha</li>
            <li>I had open heart surgery and have to take blood thinners for the rest of my life so for me to have any kind of face lift surgeries was completely out of the question and through this has aged me faster</li>
            <li>Normally, it would take me 30-45 minutes each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it makes me look almost normal again.  </li>
            <li>did&#x27;t think it was worth the money, so I sent it back</li>
            <li>but the key to any success is to keep using it.</li>
            <li>If only for this reason this product is worth it for me.</li>
            <li>I am 60 years of age and have been around the &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; a few times, had many facials, etc.</li>
            <li>Its easy to use but just makes getting ready take a little longer everyday.&lt;br /&gt;5/31/14-</li>
            <li>My jaw line looks smoother and my color is better (not so pale).</li>
            <li>The evening treatment will take me about 30 minutes and my face and neck feel very soft, look brighter, and the few lines I do have appearing better.  </li>
            <li>But I stopped using is for a month - and did notice a slip right back.</li>
            <li>if I can return it I would send it right back.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t done much for one of the deep creases next to my mouth yet, but I was so glad it put my eyes back to practically normal.  </li>
            <li>Also, the travel case that comes with it seems to be a little small for the wand and cord to fit into -- kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li>I get acne cysts occasionally and if I catch the bump fast, I can keep it from getting large and developing a head.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li>When I was inspecting my NEW Derma Wand</li>
            <li>I have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>If the dermawand breaks, you have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>In any event a new wand was sent to me by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping the one I purchased is just defective and when I exchange it the new one does something.</li>
            <li>and I decided that the lines were just going to be something I would have to live with.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find a new one</li>
            <li>and you don´t live in US</li>
            <li>I thought for some reason, I was buying this from Amazon not from a guy in New York.</li>
            <li>Item came new, but did nothing for me.</li>
            <li>Can I use this in New Zealand</li>
            <li>but New Zealand has 240V) ??</li>
            <li>Broke it and so bought this new one.  </li>
            <li>When I really set down to do it, I spend more than 5 minutes because I have several areas that need the work.</li>
            <li>you really have to do it more than 5 minutes that is the only down fall</li>
            <li>Although i have tried other similar devices including derma needle roller, D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct, and even Tria age-defying Lasor, i found Derma Wand being the most beneficial and economical facial tool.  </li>
            <li>She is addicted and wants one of her own now.</li>
            <li>I have seen no real change since using this daily, but I will continue using it in the event it takes more time to show results.</li>
            <li>What I disliked was the facial gel it came with because I felt it didn&#x27;t moisturize as I would have liked</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t see much difference, if any and no one has said anything about me looking any younger as seen in the ads.  </li>
            <li>I mainly purchased it to help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li>I decided that I spent the money, it was working some, and unless I truly gave it a fair trial, I had wasted my money (again).  </li>
            <li>GIve me a professional product even if it cost a few bucks more...</li>
            <li>also have a little bit of freckles under on my cheeks and they are becoming lighter .&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>Very clear instructions.</li>
            <li>I was very clear with the CS rep</li>
            <li>They must be very old.  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m just very sensitive</li>
            <li>The product is Just OK, seen a very little change after a month.</li>
            <li>I have a more even tone, my age spots are fading, albiet, slowly and everything seems more lifted and a little tighter.  </li>
            <li>It gives the exact results as a larger direct high frequency unit would.  </li>
            <li>so the wand did not glide smoothly over my face unless I used a ton of it and then the buzzing sound made from the wand was hardly noticeable which made me believe it was not working properly.</li>
            <li>However, after trying the &#x27;at home&#x27; version, far from the smooth texture I experience after my professional facial, I found that it caused mild breakouts and generally my skin looked rough and blotchy.    </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>The first two I used diligently on a daily basis and noticed immediate effects.  </li>
            <li>and hopefully this third one does not die on me like the the first two.</li>
            <li>BUT... I bought the thing and actually tried it and like so many other \\&quot;anti-aging</li>
            <li>WOW !</li>
            <li>My pores are shrinking, eye brows are higher (just like on the commercial), and my skins is noticeably tighter.  </li>
            <li>All I am saying is look into other reviewer&#x27;s posts, and research on different sites to make sure you are getting a quality product that does what it claims, or does something at all.</li>
            <li>After getting a pretty deep bruise, I decided to see what the derma wand could do .</li>
            <li>After the first time I used it, the next morning I could see a difference in my face.</li>
            <li>the first wand stopped working, I called customer service and after submitting proof of purchase to them, I was allowed to mail the wand back to their shipping division in GA at my expense.  </li>
            <li>within minutes of using it the first time my pores were smaller.</li>
            <li>This works, but you have to be consistent in using it to maintain tightening of the facial and jawline muscles, and to keep the neckline from sagging.</li>
            <li>My face feels tighter, looks clearer and the fine lines are getting less noticable.  </li>
            <li>Who&#x27;s the youngest looking 60 year old of all - ME!</li>
            <li>Got my derma wand today I was so excited to begin using this only to have the instructions in spanish</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised at how well it works!</li>
            <li>I think the first one I purchased had a stronger current.</li>
            <li>I was religious about using it twice a day and followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li>30 days and for the past week I have been noticing more improvement.</li>
            <li>I saw results the first time I used the DermaWand way back then.  </li>
            <li>The result is that the wand will only revert to the very highest setting!  </li>
            <li>When I first started using it, my face got very red, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Also other products come with diferent wands, which will get you more specific results,</li>
            <li>I also removed other scars that were more recent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know yet what the exact results will be because I have only had it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>the shocks of this product are a little strong</li>
            <li>I rated with high marks due to quick delivery; not on the product yet.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I love this little gadget!</li>
            <li>But, one dermawand costs as much as one facial with high frequency electrode</li>
            <li>but this is very effective and it helps to retain my results from the Pelleve at a dramatic fraction of the price!</li>
            <li>I use clean and clear detoxyfying facial scrub with microbeads while in the shower, moisturize with Cetaphil cream and for nighttime: I use Cetaphil skin cleanser, moisturize with organic shea butter, then use dermawand especially under my chin to prevent that skin from sagging.</li>
            <li>I can only assume there was a manufacturing defect, and the component that allows you to change the power setting suddenly shorted to full power all the time, regardless of the dial setting.</li>
            <li>What it claims about getting rid of zits, making pores smaller, diminishing fine lines, making the skin firmer, etc...that&#x27;s all true (at least in my case).</li>
            <li>I did drop the first one and broke the glass end, but immediately purchased my second one because I wanted to complete scar removal.</li>
            <li>And so I try to keep the wand DOWN on my face by going back &amp; forth, mostly stroking upward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have had my Derma Wand for a few day and have used it for the past four days, and am happy, so far, with what I am seeing.  </li>
            <li>I see a slight lifting effect above my eyes, though I think this is going to improve with more time.</li>
            <li>This is NOT a special laser or light that comes out and fixes your problems.</li>
            <li>a little one popped up, and now two huge cystic ones as well.</li>
            <li>I retuned this product because the little light didn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li>Bought this with the best of hopes because of all the positive reviews just to try it long enough to find it totally useless and too long to return it.</li>
            <li>that I did not want to order anything extra or be charged anything extra and that is exactly what she gave me!  </li>
            <li>Dermawand is a high frequency electrode, the gas does release a smell and this is normal, it works just them same as the spa machines.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect it to do anything for wrinkles, but I thought at the very least, maybe my skin appearance would look better.</li>
            <li>The improvement is clearly shown in two weeks.  </li>
            <li>Clearly the sent me a used wand.</li>
            <li>It does stimulate the skin with out pulling or stretching so clearly does increase blood supply to the surface.</li>
            <li>My chin today is absolutely clear.  </li>
            <li>The derma wand has helped to clear up my skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>the instructions are clear.</li>
            <li>She said it paid for itself as far as her skin condition.</li>
            <li>After reviews (most of the negative) save your money &amp; get juvaderm injections or somethin.</li>
            <li>We could still hear the buzzing sound but there was not light and no zap.  </li>
            <li>My laughing line looked like tiny mustaches on my face; I was very self-conscious about it.  </li>
            <li>I am young but I have used it on my friends mom and even she has noticed a diffrence.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that slathering on any lotion (lots and lots) completely eliminates the \\&quot;sting\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>BUT RITERATING , SO FAR NO DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>I really wanted to work on the deep line between my eyes and around my lips.</li>
            <li>I will judge for myself, but I find it very suspicious that all of those who gave it 5 stars and rave reviews only have 5 stars to give every product they review.</li>
            <li>I will not help to fade the old blood staining however.</li>
            <li>I am 36y old</li>
            <li>I bought it, used it religiously for about 6 weeks, and really saw no difference.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve been too busy to use this 2x a day, probably used it twice a day 6 days and used it another 6 times once per day.</li>
            <li>The rash is smaller and doesn&#x27;t itch as much.  </li>
            <li>I do it twice a day while I watch TV so it doesn&#x27;t really take any extra time.</li>
            <li>He 63 and is always complaining that he looks old</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for one week now, twice a day for about 6 minutes per application, and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I use it on my whole face with a vitamin c serum to get it deep into my pores...works well!</li>
            <li>The bags under my eyes are noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One unexpected perk, it also heals acne</li>
            <li>It is not going to tighten skin for someone who is young.</li>
            <li>Would not waste $100.00 ever again.</li>
            <li>And even if it did, the skin damage would far outweigh that temporary benefit.  </li>
            <li>I am 67 years old</li>
            <li>a Christian woman that absolutely dont want people to get cheated out of their money.</li>
            <li>People are always surprised to learn I am 67 years old.  </li>
            <li>However you do need to keep using it, maybe not as frequently</li>
            <li>I am 50 years old</li>
            <li>My personal opinion is that effectiveness of this product really depends on how your skin is built.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a difference except for looking slightly younger.</li>
            <li>and I can really see a big difference.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people who accumulate fat on my face..even though I am not overweight (well maybe a tad) and only eat whole foods, no alcohol or junk food.</li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>So far no results.  </li>
            <li>However I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say this product wouldn&#x27;t work on anyone.</li>
            <li>So far I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference</li>
            <li>I got busy and missed the 30 day return time frame</li>
            <li>75 years old and taking the age and wrinkles off the neck and face.</li>
            <li>It took around 20 minutes to complete all of the suggested exercises.</li>
            <li>BUY DIRECTLY FROM DERMAWAND.  </li>
            <li>I called Dermawand to get it fixed</li>
            <li>Because I did not buy it directly from them they will not replace it.  </li>
            <li>They told me that they do not repair, they replace and since I did not buy directly from Dermawand there is no replacement.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I wake up and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li>The skin under my eyes has tightened up and the puffiness is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li>So far it is not working as stated.</li>
            <li>I shall try to get some information from the Licensd Beauty  Professional.</li>
            <li>However, while Clairns really did help clear up what had always been mediocre skin and made it look nice, the clock DID continue to tick</li>
            <li>Used religiously twice a day for two months but didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>I use this to stop blemishes before they mature to the surface of the skin and it works.</li>
            <li>I will be 40 years old this month.  </li>
            <li>I am 47 years old and bought this product based on a dermatologist recommendation on The Dr. Oz Show.  </li>
            <li>If this thing really did what it says then Doctors that do cosmetic surgery and facial fillers would go out of business.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
            <li>I was taking a picture and comparing it to my old style</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 67 years old, so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles from my Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li>I tried all kinds of creams and things about 15 years ago to deal with my droopy eyelids (REAL droopy), and finally gave in and had eyelid surgery on them.  </li>
            <li>let alone direct exposure to water.</li>
            <li>maybe it is to early...</li>
            <li>So far my face doesn&#x27;t react to it.</li>
            <li>The skin on my eyes had dropped so far that I was being looked at like a \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; everywhere</li>
            <li>told to contact derma wand directly.</li>
            <li>So far I have the wand for over a month</li>
            <li>I am a 62 old grandmother...</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was packaged professionally</li>
            <li>I purchased this because my -45 year old-</li>
            <li>The FREE S&amp;H was not free - I was charged $9.95 and they sent no invoice or instructional dvd with the product.</li>
            <li>I can not wait to see how far it will go to work on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I started using it in my late 40&#x27;s just to bring more circulation to my face.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised to see that it worked.</li>
            <li>Most of the negative reviews I have read seemed like people did not give it the time it takes for the collagen under the skin to be renewed.</li>
            <li>over a year, and one day realized that I looked old.  </li>
            <li>, Everyone wants instant results.....</li>
            <li>I have observe real tightening in the skin on my face when used regularly.</li>
            <li>Shortly after purchase, bulb broke, now the company wants $25 to replace.</li>
            <li>She said I looked all glommed up and young.</li>
            <li>my 70 year old aunt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am almost 42 years old and am just beginning to see the signs of aging on my face.</li>
            <li>The biggest difference I seen so far is the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I also was complemented yesterday day on how I look young for my age.</li>
            <li>My skin can be sensitive.</li>
            <li>I just turned 46 yrs old.</li>
            <li>SO FAR I HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN FIRMING AND</li>
            <li>I am almost 60 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it at least twice a day, sometimes more.</li>
            <li>My face and neck feel so soft and have begun to look youthful.</li>
            <li>People remark when they learn how old I am</li>
            <li>Amazon.com recommends contacting them directly for warranty support - emailed them 7 times now and they have not bothered to respond.</li>
            <li>I used this product for a month twice daily for 3 minutes each session as instructed and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.....</li>
            <li>I have since returned it for a refund...maybe 30 days isn&#x27;t enough to really show noticable changes and they should offer a 90 day trial instead.  </li>
            <li>Three months of use, twice a day is just not in my busy schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will keep it but am marginal on the results so far after about a month.</li>
            <li>Before I go in to the offer and what you receive and the cost, I just wanted to say that I am 49 years old.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 58 years old.</li>
            <li>Smoker prune lips are scarred and can&#x27;t be fixed by this.  </li>
            <li>So far I like it.</li>
            <li>Completely misleading.</li>
            <li>I am 34 year old no face lift</li>
            <li>but no results so far.  </li>
            <li>OLD AND FAMILY FRIENDS  </li>
            <li>takes time, but boy, it does get rid of wrinkles, and really smoothes the deep ones somewhat.  </li>
            <li>I look old and nothing changed.</li>
            <li>My daughters skin is actually smooth and she has had no more new bumps pop up.</li>
            <li>Due to the severity of these side effects, I have permanent staining on my arms from the blood not being absorbed fast enough.</li>
            <li>I thought that it was unlikely I would use it more than a couple time due to the many steps and convoluted instructions.  </li>
            <li>Also, it is small and easy to store.</li>
            <li>I use the wand directly on it and believe me when I say it either goes away completely or when the pimple does surface, it is small and goes away quickly!  </li>
            <li>We have filed complaints with their Customer Service, New York BBB, Corporate Headquarters and the Consumer Protection Division for the State of New York,</li>
            <li>Will continue to use for a few more weeks, if it get worse or I don&#x27;t get more positive results, I will chalk it up to my own stupidity and never purchase another so call age defying miracle again and learn to except my wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I do not think it is strong enough to have the effect shown on the TV demo&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;age 64 with previous face lift</li>
            <li>If you want to know how it will feel, smell and work look up a local spa in your area that offers high frequency and go get a procedure done with the electrode.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re buying the Professional Grade Portable High Frequency D&#x27;arsonval Facial Device.  </li>
            <li>but really if I see no difference in the future it will be rated 2 stars (didn&#x27;t like it)and of course if it proves what is stated in the article it will get a hands down 5.  </li>
            <li>Time in particular, as the daily treatment takes a lot of time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not trying to look younger, I just don&#x27;t want to look older than I feel.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time the day before my husband and I went out for dinner and was shocked when I looked in the mirror and saw how good my skin looked...and yes it was just after one use</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s actually one the main ingredients in their pre-face treatment anyway.</li>
            <li>So far I am out a non-refundable $14.95 processing fee &amp; should have no other charges.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to adapt to the smell, but the results proclaimed are true.</li>
            <li>highest setting except for right under the eyes which I go no higher with than a 4.</li>
            <li>You have to get use to the electric currents to your face (especially if you use it on high)</li>
            <li>I look much prettier and younger, and I think my facial skin overall is also much smoother.  </li>
            <li>I think you&#x27;ll like it, especially if your over 40 or 50 years old!!</li>
            <li>Only been using for about 2 weeks and every day I can see the old wrinkles vanishing before my eyes!!  </li>
            <li>(I have a very healthy diet) also, unfortunately I failed to take a &amp;#34;before photo&amp;#34; to show you.  </li>
            <li>Be careful NOT to use the bulb under your eyes on anything higher than a 1 or 2 level.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I took pictures from the first day onward to track any progression, but saw absolutely no results in wrinkles, or tightness.</li>
            <li>Significant change in the skin can only be accomplished at least by doubling or tripling its intensity.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li>They went ahead and sent me a new one but did not send back the accessories and informed me the Amazon site is not authorized site.</li>
            <li>I tried everything on the market and didnt anything that really made a difference for very long.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast</li>
            <li>The reviews before my purchase was 50/50 but decided the negative were most likely those expecting a miracle.</li>
            <li>Younger looking than all my children&#x27;s in-laws that are all younger in years than me, thanks to this</li>
            <li>Nothing unusual happened to it to suddenly cause it to suddenly break.</li>
            <li>I got a generic wand but don&#x27;t really like the attachments (fragile)</li>
            <li>Overall I think I will see better results as time goes by or at least I hope to.</li>
            <li>Really made me look younger, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li>MY LAUGH LINES AND LINES AROUND MY EYES ARE MUCH LESS NOTICIABLE.  </li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product, I really notice a difference in the texture and overall appearance of the face and neck.</li>
            <li>It is a great tool for reducing and eliminating wrinkles with no pain or negative secondary effects.&lt;br /&gt;Carlos</li>
            <li>I think people really need to give the Derma Wand enough time to see lasting results.</li>
            <li>I use many expensive beauty products  because my girl and I are photographed very close up on a weekly basis because of our job.</li>
            <li>I decided to go with my gut and follow the contours of my face and neck muscles, always with long, sweeping strokes up, and light down.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about the satisfaction I have with results I&#x27;ve seen so far!  </li>
            <li>Immediately I nearly stopped using it regularly and this continued for the next two weeks as my normal personality flaw had me grousing and making excuses not to use</li>
            <li>24 hours later they were completely gone!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see as much effect, yet, on my face, but those areas were not as loose and wrinkled.  </li>
            <li>If I had paid much less for it, it would have gone right in the trash.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really tried other anti-aging products because I tend to have sensitive skin and did not want to break out.</li>
            <li>For little money, this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li>I HAD, not only the deep lines around my nose and mouth, but sagging skin at my jaw line, the beginnings of a &amp;#34;turkey&amp;#34; neck (thanks to the genes from my Other grandmother) and the skin on my decolletage was looking wrinkly,all now much improved, but,</li>
            <li>This is an advanced radio high frequency beauty teatment to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, puffy eyes, saggy, tired complexion and enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li>High frequency is done with electrodes; electrodes have a gas (such as neon) vacuum sealed in the glass electrode.</li>
            <li>Now it&#x27;s about 4 weeks out, generally use it as directed morning and night.  </li>
            <li>The effectiveness of a cosmetic dermatology tool is also based on general skin health.</li>
            <li>Ihaven&#x27;t had it long enough to really know yet, people say that they see a difference in the depth of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I stay up too late, work too many long hours and don&#x27;t always feel like doing this twice a day -</li>
            <li>At first the sound and feeling was scarey, but i&#x27;m getting use to it.</li>
            <li>Now if you&#x27;re really old and have a lot of wrinkles and look like your face is gonna fall off soon and want an instant miricle face lift...</li>
            <li>I have dealt with adult acne my entire life</li>
            <li>I will be 52 years old in 2 days, though I am told I look much younger..</li>
            <li>The scarring is barely visible now and she has not used it for a month.  </li>
            <li>Not kidding when I say they are barely there anymore.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully my reaction is temporary and I will eventually see similar results to what I get from my professional facials.    </li>
            <li>My old one finally died.  </li>
            <li>Any vegetable oil will actually work, I just prefer grapeseed because it naturally helps build collagen</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope that I see some results in the near future.</li>
            <li>my daughters was noticing the different I am 53 years old</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m big old mom</li>
            <li>so far i can see the results after only a week.</li>
            <li>After nearly three weeks of daily use, I can see no change.</li>
            <li>Two ladies had a bet on how old I was one lady guessed almost 20 years younger.</li>
            <li>&quot; she had to go through several offers on her screen.</li>
            <li>So, my card was charged a total of $18.37 in order to receive the Derma Wand and the Derma Vital skin care products.</li>
            <li>So far my card has only been charged the $18.37 as she stated it would be for the 30 Day trial period, paying just for the tax and shipping of the skin care products.</li>
            <li>For those hesitating because of the price, I would suggest adding up all the money you have already spent on serums, creams and lotions that haven&#x27;t worked very well, as I did.</li>
            <li>I used on facial scars that were years old the wand removed them.</li>
            <li>After using it your skin feels refreshed and alive, this is my second one</li>
            <li>I used it faithfully for six months, twice a day (with my own lotion - theirs is useless).</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, as I was about to use mine today, I dropped it and by my own fault broke the cap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the 3 weeks I noticed no improvements with any of my very fine lines or firming of the skin, my acne did not improve and my skin texture became worse as I now have tiny bumps that consume my face.</li>
            <li>I have only just starting using it, so the actual physical positive outcome of use has yet to be achieved.</li>
            <li>Even though it was obvious I live in Australia, You still sent me derma wand with American electric plug?/&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it takes 2 hours to do your whole face &amp; the results do not last very long at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>While the Derma Wand is must less powerful, I think using it on a daily basis makes up for that!</li>
            <li>I have done a quick pass and spent up to 20 minutes with no real difference in the look with the time difference.  </li>
            <li>The first half of the CD is on YouTube, Derma Wand, Start Here.</li>
            <li>But after talking to her I realized that sick is the new lingo for looking good.  </li>
            <li>I saw some visible results, not as much as some of the claims I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.  </li>
            <li>really want to do every other day to see results</li>
            <li>Of course, I was hoping it would be more dramatic.</li>
            <li>I only used it on him 3 times last week and saw marked improvement.  </li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about 2 weeks now, and can already see a marked tightening of my facial skin.</li>
            <li>far as the Pre-Face treatment is concerned, I finally gave this one a 2nd try.</li>
            <li>My life took on an unexpected curve of events that would last for the next decade plus.  </li>
            <li>I am a 47 year old white female.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the skin will not dry out.</li>
            <li>This happened to me a little at first.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have major crows feet around my eyes yet, but have tiny lines there.</li>
            <li>Typically as women age, their facial muscles age (and begin to weaken) first.</li>
            <li>I was disappointed because I was hopeful this was going to be a great in-home wrinkle treatment for me.</li>
            <li>Seems like 50% of them are happy and the other 50% are unhappy.</li>
            <li>I have been using this every morning (suppose to use it twice a day, but just can&#x27;t seem to find enough time to do this) it only says to use for three minutes but it takes a little longer than that because I feel I need to spend a little more time while I have it out.</li>
            <li>I will come back to review further, so far I do see some results in my face after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>and I could see, for the first time in my life, quite a few wrinkles on my under-eye area.</li>
            <li>While the pamphlet that comes with the derma wand did warn of the possibility of redness or broken capillaries, it never mentioned anything about skin possibly becoming oily and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>The first Derma Wand we ordered arrived dead.  </li>
            <li>And the lotion that came with it was pretty dried out when I received the item.</li>
            <li>You do need to use it pretty much everyday.</li>
            <li>I also started using the Tua Viso Electronic Unit for Facial Gymnastics about 6 weeks ago, which I really like, too, but it is very time consuming, so I have cut down to every other day on that, but the derma wand just takes 5 minutes twice a day, and you are done.</li>
            <li>I thought I saw a little skin tightening at first, but then there were no further effects</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what kind of results I&#x27;m supposed to have in that time frame, so it is hard for me to say if it is working or not.  </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them for very long but so far I can tell some difference</li>
            <li>its working on my undereye dark circles too do not use more than 3-4 on that delicate area please...</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight, but I noticed results, especially around my eyes and mouth, after the first few uses.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t expecting some immediate miracle cure and suddenly look like I was in my 20&#x27;s again upon my first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, only a few fine lines underneath my eyes, but I do have a bit of skin sagging here and there and lines running down on the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li>I was a little hesitant to make this large purchase because the commercials were so &#x27;gimcky&#x27;.</li>
            <li>This really works, this is my second purchase, because the first one I have got broken, it fell.</li>
            <li>For the first few months I used it regularly and definitely saw a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>However, I strongly suspect that the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pictures are fake, as I noticed no change in the appearance of my skin after nearly four weeks.</li>
            <li>Very cheap and quite cheesy.</li>
            <li>So, after two weeks, I decided that $99.00 was too much to pay for so little results.</li>
            <li>If It seems, myne gets to be a little old, I order one before the old one would die on me.</li>
            <li>I am buying from Australia, I would have appreciated knowing that I would need to spend an additional $100 buying a step down transformer in order to use the product here.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s given me a lot more confidence and compliments!!</li>
            <li> Instead of looking like \\&quot;heck\\&quot; and not being able to do anything about it as I did before!!  </li>
            <li> I also have acne which is clearing up very nicely after one week of use.</li>
            <li> they don&#x27;t do business very honestly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product samples were very nice for treating my hands.</li>

            <li> Truly amazing, exceeded all expectations!</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that many wrinkles to begin with but this thing is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Recommend increasing to the highest setting as soon as able for best results.</li>
            <li> Oh, and yes, we love the way these type of devices work, GREAT for acne and fever blister outbreaks!!</li>
            <li> At this point in my life I&#x27;d be happy if the Dermawand&#x27;s effect causes people to comment that I look good for my age.</li>
            <li> What a nice surprise!</li>
            <li> i have been very good about using it--once a day on most days.</li>
            <li> I bought one years ago on TV , loved it .</li>
            <li> it does feel good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good on pimples too, seems to zap (perhaps electrocute) them,</li>
            <li> I loved Derma Wand I´ve been using it for about a month</li>
            <li> My aesthetician couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin looks....  </li>
            <li> It does feel good on the face, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not good breakdown after 1 week</li>
            <li> This is a good product.</li>
            <li> Good.  5.  Years.  </li>
            <li> If so good as they claim</li>
            <li> This company had to pay these people stating this is a good product.  </li>
            <li> which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing the infomericial and then reading all the good reviews on AMAZON.      </li>
            <li> i read some good reviews online, and decided to order it from amazon, knowing that i could return it if i didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> The dermawand is definetly a good buy.</li>
            <li> People keep commenting how good I look and keep asking me if I had lost weight...</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Although it was good at moisturizing, no effect at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother, and  she loved it.</li>
            <li> By example, my grandmother taught me the value good skin care.</li>
            <li> Yet I did not start a good skin-care regime until I was in my 30&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I for one would be delighted to participate in a study, or to buy another one.</li>
            <li> It is good, but there is a lot of room for improvement.</li>
            <li> I thought I could see some good results.</li>
            <li> The one place I have seen good improvement is on my stomach.  </li>
            <li> I loved it</li>
            <li> I figured if I was spending over $100 on something, it would give good results.  </li>
            <li> I was hooked on this wand and loved the oxygen smell.</li>
            <li> Kinda makes me think that something is going on in a good way.....</li>
            <li> Really good for opening eyes.</li>
            <li> GOOD WOULD LIKE TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make Miracles happen, but if you&#x27;re worried you can&#x27;t afford a facelift, and you have the \\&quot;numbers 171\\&quot; in wrinkles between your eyebrows, than this is a good thing for you.  </li>
            <li> I think the Dermawand is a really good product, it just takes time.</li>
            <li> This works good, I also use it any where on my body that may be sore or any where the body feels stressed.</li>
            <li> While it works it is good;</li>
            <li> how good it was, however, until I tried it.  </li>
            <li> It may be a good product if it works as it supposed to</li>
            <li> I bought this and loved it and the tip broke</li>
            <li> Good product!Impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m both relieved and delighted.</li>
            <li> have a good feeling about the outcome.</li>
            <li> I do take care of my skin and use good naural products on my skin.</li>
            <li> And just for the record, I&#x27;m 66, and I must say, I haven&#x27;t felt this good about the way I look in years.</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this product, makes your face feel good!</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product that helps maintain skin quality when used as directed.</li>
            <li> Now I get the joy of trying to get reimbursement, I plan to try again with QVC where you get a better warranty system.</li>
            <li> Hopefully I will keep getting great results...Would Recommend:)</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> ~ get it, use it twice a day, and you will be very glad you did.</li>
            <li> She has been using it for a week or so now and he feels very confident in her one week results.</li>
            <li> most these great reviews must be shills/fakes...</li>
            <li> I have used the Dermawand for two months and I am very pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome and worth the price.</li>
            <li> They make it look very convincing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I&#x27;ve got good ageing genes.</li>
            <li> think using your own beauty skin care product is just as good.</li>
            <li> I love Derma Wand!</li>
            <li> order one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I have had my dermawand for two weeks and love what its doing to my skin!  </li>
            <li> So glad i got a dermawand!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Derma Wand now for over a month, and have already seen phenomenal results!  </li>
            <li> I love the oxygenated smell and what it&#x27;s done for my pores!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I threw it away and bought something much better quality!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad I did!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to use it again today for sure!  </li>
            <li> I am so glad I did!  </li>
            <li> He hates the way the wand feels but endures it as his skin looks MUCH better!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, but had hoped I&#x27;d like my neck a bit more!</li>
            <li> &#x27;s to better aging!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> the best is that it really WORKS!</li>
            <li> Why have I been ignoring this device when I know better!  </li>
            <li> it was an easy install, and it works great.</li>
            <li> in all, I&#x27;m very excited about the way my skins looks!  </li>
            <li> Fine lines have disappeared, and the texture and tone are greatly improved.  </li>
            <li> Look, this doesn&#x27;t life your face miraculously, but I can attest to the amazing change in my skin.</li>
            <li> If you have cystic acne at all, this is amazing.</li>
            <li> Its cheap and works great as a conductor for this product.  </li>
            <li> What an amazing product.</li>
            <li> No person, women or man should be without this amazing repair tool.</li>
            <li> I know this sounds vain, but after about 6 weeks, the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> Its amazing.</li>
            <li> Whereas, Amazon has amazing customer service.  </li>
            <li> amazing.</li>
            <li> The difference is amazing.</li>
            <li> Already after two weeks seeing amazing results.</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but this is so amazing</li>
            <li> but they were not as effective as DermaWand.  </li>
            <li> she really liked it.  </li>
            <li> but it actually feels great and makes your face look great too!</li>
            <li> I am just so thrilled...</li>
            <li> Good  : )</li>
            <li> My face feels nice and tingly afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I began doing my own facials and peels)</li>
            <li> it was smoother and had a nice sheen to it.</li>
            <li> says to do and after a week even my husband looked at me as we were waiting at the airport and said &#x27;you face looks so nice and smooth\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Excellent and fast delivery</li>
            <li> The results are not as spectacular as advertised, but if I see some progress.</li>
            <li> I gave it two stars because it is nicely packaged</li>
            <li> The unit seems to work but it would have been nice to get the products with it.</li>
            <li> I am loving how it minimizes and kills the bacteria with acne.</li>
            <li> but not if you are looking for  Face Lift kind of results.</li>
            <li> really good, but I have to be more concisten.  </li>
            <li> i do use my own moisturizer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not too thrilled about the skin care products that came with it.</li>
            <li> but I kind of like using it</li>
            <li> It was nice to hear from someone else that they noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had some really nice comments on my skin.  </li>
            <li> By the grace of God and some good genes, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, however, I do have some sun (age) spots, sagging in the jowl area and creasing of my eye</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful, amazing, it&#x27;s really works</li>
            <li> because I really liked the stuff</li>
            <li> Would recommend for a nice relaxed awake look.</li>
            <li> I could tell time was catching up with me.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure I need to give it more time before I see any great</li>
            <li> Also, I do not know if you HAVE to use their skin-care products, or if you can use with your own moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use my own skin care products to kept my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> BUT TO BE HONEST</li>
            <li> I WAS HONESTLY GOING TO CANCEL THE ORDER</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and does what it says,  will take awhile though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using the Dermawand with my own moisturizer and applying it twice a day like the booklet suggests.</li>
            <li> so it must be nice</li>
            <li> You will achieve even better results with higher (pharmaseutical grade) serum, check with your dermatologist or an esthetician who has been working with your skin to see which serum would be best for you.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The wand however is my new best friend in the beauty department.</li>
            <li> I find that doing the full face&amp;#34; along with the &amp;#34;Spa exercise&amp;#34; at night and just the full face in the morning works best for me.  </li>
            <li> The question is whether this very mild electric stimulation is good for the skin or damaging it.  </li>
            <li> it is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> On top of it 30 day free trial!!    </li>
            <li> The oxygen part was the one that I liked the most about the Derma Wand but those wrinkles that I had never had</li>
            <li> I use it frequently for my bruises and am very happy to have this device just for this reason.</li>
            <li> My products work more effectively now too.</li>
            <li> It is a lot more effective.</li>
            <li> its amazing, makes my face tighter, smoother and luminous love it</li>
            <li> Your own moisturizer will work much better.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s easy to follow!</li>
            <li> Dermawand arrived very quickly and I started using it immediately!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The dermawand has reduced the very fine lines around my lips, and plumped them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and refreshing but mainly works very good, meaning that my face is getting healthier</li>
            <li> good choice, after several months of use I can say that it is perfect for skin, fine wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I was using coconut and magnesium oil, and while it made my skin beautiful, it wasn&#x27;t doing much for the sag and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> So the expression if it seems to good to be true, listen to that.</li>
            <li> In fact one picture of a lady looked too good to be true.</li>
            <li> You know what they say about the too good to be true?</li>
            <li> I was dubious when I purchased Derma Wand as it sounded too good to be true.</li>
            <li> Just call the phone number listed to order the Derma Wand instead, and you will be fine!</li>
            <li> The enclosed gel product is good to lubricate the skin but dries out really quickly.</li>
            <li> so I just use my own and find it works better for easy gliding over my skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using my derma wand twice a day for six weeks now and see a nice difference in my fine lines and pore size.</li>
            <li> I also use a nubrilliance microderm and love this stuff called BABYFACE Hyaluric Acid that I get on ebay for about $15.</li>
            <li> This did more for me than watching the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it is said that more you use the Derma Wand, the better it works.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using it intensively, according to the instructions booklet and DVD that was supplied with it, and even more than that.</li>
            <li> I have not returned it within 30 days, as I thought I should give it more time to see the results, but I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> How many women can afford it?</li>
            <li> it works better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to think that it&#x27;s working great but can&#x27;t tell too much.  </li>
            <li> I would probably get even better results if I used it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> This I have used safely on my face, throat, hands, fore arms, beneath my arms, chest, thighs and calves of my legs.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe in just two months (of using it 2x a day) how much better my skin looks.  </li>
            <li> How many out there would not be as diligent as I have been?</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> you will love it.</li>
            <li> I dont have many wrinkles anyway...</li>
            <li> I feel like my face seem brighter for sure,  </li>
            <li> so I will review again, and if I don&#x27;t feel free to remind me!  </li>
            <li> There is more to this wand than they promise.  </li>
            <li> He is bald and has a lot of sun damage on top of his head</li>
            <li> Someone commented on how fresh and bright</li>
            <li> but have many others in my arsenal against aging (I am a skin care product junkie..</li>
            <li> I love the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with the results, as I was very nervous about believing it works.</li>
            <li> When I was doing this regularly, my skin did look awesome.  </li>
            <li> Skin tone is more even.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will join those who love it.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks and get lots of compliments about how my face seems to glow..</li>
            <li> Generally more tone to the skin.  </li>
            <li> And using more and more moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I bought another Dermawand this year making sure I have another on hand.</li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> BUT I LOVE THE WAY</li>
            <li> My face feels better after each treatment.  </li>
            <li> but it better than just waiting for my wrinkle cr&amp;egrave;me to work alone..</li>
            <li> I wrote her again afterward because I had one more question - and she ignored me, twice.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I saw raving reviews and a convincing ad.</li>
            <li> I sure with i had gone through Amazon</li>
            <li> I love this machine.  </li>
            <li> After use my face is tighter, my brows lifted and my skin has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> for the most part, that has taken care of my cystic pimples.</li>
            <li> i will be returning this, as my bank account needs this money more than my face does.</li>
            <li> Satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes  these review surveys ask too many questions.  </li>
            <li> Came with everything and everything was top shape except for the product box but that didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I look better now than I did 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> When I use it twice a day as suggested, I see better results at my age.</li>
            <li> I feel more firmness on my skin and somewhat \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I love the way it will lift up the brow line also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be able to start using it twice a day soon.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> taking static shocks, on your face).  </li>
            <li> but once a week at most because I lack the time to do so; however, hope springs eternal and if it stimulates the production of collagen, all is not lost.  </li>
            <li> try more often in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Five</li>
            <li> more words required???&lt;br /&gt;People does not want to make a review...</li>
            <li> I had read many reviews and women</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> I then would wipe off the remaining aloe and use my moisturizer; this works much better with the wand</li>
            <li> I think the magic of this product is hyped.  </li>
            <li> I sure hoped it would work for me.  </li>
            <li> because my wrinkles decrease, I love this product.</li>
            <li> I used it just as I was supposed to and even more after a while of noticing nothing.</li>
            <li> I still love my Dermawand</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased and would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I hope to give it a better review.</li>
            <li> love this product.  </li>
            <li> I made sure the cap was removed, I even tried it at the highest setting......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more than a month that I keep getting charges on my credit card.</li>
            <li> I have never looked better...</li>
            <li> Nothing too overwhelming</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny to feel this good and not have to go under the knife.  </li>
            <li> The area around my eyes is better too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she love love loves her derma wand.</li>
            <li> I am a retired Chemistry teacher, and have made many observations about the product, its quality and capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, 3 minutes twice</li>
            <li> Need to use more often.  </li>
            <li> Just exfoliate with scrubs and peels and your skin will look a lot better.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t believe most things I see on TV because of all the ways u can fudge things with technology now days</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect anything great from this product, but my mom bought it for Christmas for my sister and I.  </li>
            <li> I can see more of a change than when I had it done at the spa once a month.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;shipping and handling&amp;#34; is exorbitant, and so many people are charged for a lot more than the cost of the item, and there is no customer service.  </li>
            <li> I think most Amazon shoppers realize that.....</li>
            <li> I Love this product.</li>
            <li> My face is better than before to use it.</li>
            <li> TO GETTING BETTER RESULTS SOON&lt;</li>
            <li> We all love it.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t been able to use it since.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> And so instead, I would use the Creme de Serum (by: Meaningful Beauty Cindy Crawford).</li>
            <li> This is okay.</li>
            <li> I think it takes more than 5-minutes a day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect magic to happen in 1-3 days coz</li>
            <li> The more I use this, the better my face looks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect magic to happen in 1-3 days coz</li>
            <li> The more I use this, the better my face looks.</li>
            <li> but I do love it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 and don&#x27;t have many lines</li>
            <li> I love this product so so much.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Well, I have no idea if it has helped my appearance, but I darn sure think it does the job the machine is set up to do.</li>
            <li> I am glad to have had the opportunity to buy an OTC appliance like this.</li>
            <li> and I am quite pleased.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work miracles but it does help me to look better.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting device.  </li>
            <li> I am more than pleased with the product..</li>
            <li> I have gotten so many looks and compliments on my skin...</li>
            <li> well I was able to start out on setting 8...</li>
            <li> The customer service department is fantastic!  </li>
            <li> And you know how many of us can&#x27;t resist trying to puncture the cyst with a needle,</li>
            <li> Thanks Derma wand for great product.</li>
            <li> Need more reliability testing and improvements on the product.</li>
            <li> I love it and use it to depuff my eyes and keep finelines around eyes and mouth at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller this time</li>
            <li> giving it one more try because I thought maybe it was the smell making my head explode.  </li>
            <li> This is definatley not to be used alone, much more product than they suggest,.</li>
            <li> started using but tell u better invest  in face workout dvd  than this</li>
            <li> It does sting a bit on the highest level and almost smells like static in the air like when you forget to use fabric softener and your clothes cling together as you pull them apart</li>
            <li> Even though it says that the lifting of the eyebrows only lasts about 3 or 4 hours, I get great results all day!  </li>
            <li> I do wish I&#x27;d ordered it through Amazon, for I&#x27;m nervous that the company will charge me for more product with my Visa card and from all that I read, their customer service is nasty/nonexistent.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I am extremely pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> Think it helps -- need more time</li>
            <li> It seems to make your skin look better than before.  </li>
            <li> It brings more circulation to the skin, tones and brightens it.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I was able to notice some difference in the wrinkles on my face.</li>
            <li> With that said, I am truly pleased with the way this Derma wand product continues to improve my skin.  </li>
            <li> forget to use,  but when i do, does ok job...</li>
            <li> taxes and shipping would be added on top of the agreed upon payment.  </li>
            <li> but more at myself because i fell for just another miracle in a can</li>
            <li> I have had one for many years.  </li>
            <li> and I am pleased with the results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I believe most of the reviews I read on this product were paid for.  </li>
            <li> I found it to work excellently for lifting my upper eye area/lids and firming &amp; tightening the lower eye area as well...</li>
            <li> The skin does not seem to tighten are be firmer or look better.</li>
            <li> The DermaWand worked magic.</li>
            <li> The hardest part is convincing my friends</li>
            <li> Mostly I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; results.  </li>
            <li> With the Derma Wand skin care products,  my skin just feels better, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face sweat.</li>
            <li> However, I am so glad that I did.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, tighter, and more evenly colored.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> I know she&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.....</li>
            <li> My skin looks better.</li>
            <li> I have no doubt that with continued use my appearance will improve even more.</li>
            <li> Started to love it and see a bit of a difference.  </li>
            <li> I love my Derma wand.</li>
            <li> and I feel it does help make look better.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping, lines and wrinkles have improved and my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> If you would like to learn more go to www.skinremodelingdiy.com</li>
            <li> I think the price of this product would be more in the $29.99 price range.</li>
            <li> One thing is for sure.  </li>
            <li> I have found that the Derma Wand makes my skin appear smoother and more supple.</li>
            <li> Having said that, I do love this device although I am buying another brand.</li>
            <li> Time will tell on the wrinkles, but my skin texture and firmness is better after just 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I will keep at it as I think it will improve with more time.</li>
            <li> I confess I use the wand once a day most of the time.insted of twice.  </li>
            <li> It is truly magical.</li>
            <li> i have used derma wand for more than 6 years now.</li>
            <li> Gravity and genetics for the most part</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I NEED TO USE IT MORE - JUST HAVE SO MANY THINGS GOING ON</li>
            <li> Zapping stinging feeling and my skin smells burnt after use...not pleased with this product</li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t think it is that great of a product.</li>
            <li> Bought it for an aunt, shes really pleased with it</li>
            <li> Light bulb moment!  </li>
            <li> love this product and could not be without it for even 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Wish I had better news.  </li>
            <li> Was very excited to get this product.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s pretty amazing to me and reason alone to own it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That was great but my main concern is my face.</li>
            <li> actually it is a very clean smell.</li>
            <li> the manufacturers would design a higher powered unit, I would be delighted to have one.</li>
            <li> My skin is still pretty good, and I&#x27;m basically trying to keep it that way.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty good..</li>
            <li> In the words of my beautiful, young, niece, &amp;#34;that scarf doesn&#x27;t do you any favors</li>
            <li> I urged my mom to buy one and am excited to see her results!  </li>
            <li> I use it MUCH more often as it&#x27;s so easy to just get it and use while watching TV or in bed instead of having to go find a plug.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and feels stimulating, although took a bit to get used to the interesting tingle/spark of static-type pluses.</li>
            <li> Ordered again, arrived ok, worked fine...</li>
            <li> I did a fair amount of research on this product before buying it but a lot of things work great for other people and not me.  </li>
            <li> The wand is easy to use, easy to incorporate into a morning routine, and I quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> my sin tingled and felt a little warm but all and all a very pleasant experince....</li>
            <li> , I can see my skin becoming softer, tighter, shinier and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The derma wand is simple to use and the results are incredible.  </li>
            <li> softening, spots fading, and most made it sound like a miracle wand.</li>
            <li> BUT SO FAR HAPPY</li>
            <li> BUT SO FAR HAPPY WILL KEEP YOU POSTED.  </li>
            <li> I have to say, I&#x27;m happy with the results so far.</li>
            <li> It creates a really nice, fresh smelling ozone smell, and I feel that it did help my skin.</li>
            <li> Good seller, thanks</li>
            <li> The Dermawand is very easy and quick to use</li>
            <li> Arriving ahead of schedule, the Derma Wand is easily one of my most important healh and beauty purchases I have ever made.</li>
            <li> However, for the \\&quot;blurring\\&quot; of the jawline, mild sagging of the upper eyelids, etc., this product is perfect.  </li>
            <li> But I also used a TON of other skincare products with it for best results.  </li>
            <li> but I would like to get another if I knew I would get one that was full strength!</li>
            <li> Shipping and handling costs to replace product comes to more than 25% of original price.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to try the product like mostly everyone else in my age group.</li>
            <li> And it ships very quickly and comes w/ directional dvd and carrying case.</li>
            <li> Because it breaks so easy would  be my guess.</li>
            <li> Great product got it for my mother in law and she is looking younger love how it worked..</li>
            <li> It arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;rocks\\&quot; would surface quicker on my face with easy removal.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and does not take a lot of time.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, just need moisture with it - I&#x27;m using an Olay night creme I had in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use</li>
            <li> However, it is easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> so I can glide the Derma Wand easily.</li>
            <li> so I can glide the Derma Wand easily.</li>
            <li> I find the head (top and sides) clouds up after just a minute or 2, and requires effort to clean.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, and compact.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, painless and</li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon for making returns easy.</li>
            <li> This is why I STRONGLY recommend calling to order the Derma Wand and not ordering from the website.</li>
            <li> i strongly recomend not to buy this product based on my expirience and a cupleof friends that bought it and are returning it</li>
            <li> It not only is a great product to create oxygenation to kill bacteria, but it also helps to minimize puffiness and fine lines around the eye contour area when used with an eye cream and appropriate moisturizer.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect a quickfix here; it&#x27;s not &#x27;abracadabra&#x27;....just like losing weight or becoming financially secure.....</li>
            <li> coz, it doesn&#x27;t let you do soft stroke during tx, my own moisturizer works better:)</li>
            <li> It gave my cheeks a nice blush in the first week, but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> That and a good moisturizer (cocoa butter) have made a huge difference in the anticipated neck &amp;#34;throttle&amp;#34; I antiipated developing in my neck area based on what I saw  in my older cousins and aunts.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Derma Wand for nearly a month now and have gotten many unsolicited compliments on how clean and bright my complexion is.  </li>
            <li> The feeling is fine</li>
            <li> None of the fine lines are gone or softened and&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fit into my schedule.</li>
            <li> Using it on the rest of my face seems to be fine.  </li>
            <li> I have been using a Vitamin C serum from Kiss My Face with the Dermawand, works just fine.</li>
            <li> My fine lines and pores are drastically reduced.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t shrink my pores, didn&#x27;t fade even the finest of fine lines.</li>
            <li> , she loves it and works fine</li>
            <li> Lets just say where it might work on fine lines on your face it does nothing for gravity ie:</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and it helps my skin look more toned.</li>
            <li> This device was not expensive at all, and is very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing a huge difference in my acne.  </li>
            <li> So without that, I cannot accurately comment on the toning part of it.</li>
            <li> AND I SEE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE TEXTURE OF MY FACE AND</li>
            <li> Within 1 week I noticed a HUGE improvemnet in my skin texture on my face and ESPCIALLY my neck..</li>
            <li> and I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> and I got huge complements from all ladies in my party.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> I have noticed  the huge  difference in my complexion and the taughtness of my skin,....</li>
            <li> My pores were huge, I had breakouts, sallow-looking skin, and spots.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have huge expectations for this product, but figured for the price I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> BUT, the sagging skin and huge pores?</li>
            <li> Never used their creams they seemed cheap.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and looks radiant too, but I cannot claim it is because of the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> Makes my lips and skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Which in turn, plumps up cells, which creates filled in lines.</li>
            <li> I am only happy that I have on hand something to use if I ever develop frown lines.</li>
            <li> I think DERMA WAND hoped I didn&#x27;t NOTICE that charge on my account, and rather that I would be suckered into paying for everything on a FREE TRIAL agreement ....</li>
            <li> The light at the end does come on.</li>
            <li> can you tell if it is on besides the light??</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous tool that I will be using for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> The enclosed booklet and instructional video aren&#x27;t as detailed as I would like, but there&#x27;s plenty of information on the internet.  </li>
            <li> as moisturizing makes it not move over my skin smoothly.  </li>
            <li> my eyes are lifted and my skin is showing great results.. who ever said this does not work , does not use it properly.</li>
            <li> I wrote to the developer of the product because she advertises this &amp;#34;feel free to write me&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> My husband uses it (when I gently nudge him) and just one use you can see an amazing transformation.</li>
            <li> I enjoy using it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> It requires more work than advertised, but I don&#x27;t mind, the results are worth it to me.</li>
            <li> my face looks and feels so smooth after using this after 3 days....    </li>
            <li> I love seeing my wrinkles disappear, pores closing, sagging eyelids getting tighter and that fresh smell that stays with me throughout the days I use it.</li>
            <li> I checked to see if I accidentally bumped up the setting because the needle like shocks were even more powerful than the level 5</li>
            <li> great buy for anyone wanting to manage facial wrinkles and sags.</li>
            <li> (More powerful).</li>
            <li> That Infomercial said that I get to try this for 30-days FREE including shipping is FREE but when I checked my credit card they charged me $20.63</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made...</li>
            <li> this is a cheap china manufactured product that stopped working 9 days after amazon warranty expired.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it primarily to help with my hormonal chin acne that I have tried everything under the sun to get rid of.  </li>
            <li> but my skin gets smoothly.</li>
            <li> FYI, I use light lotions instead of the gel the send.</li>
            <li> Please feel free</li>
            <li> I feel fortunate that I don&#x27;t have to go to a clinic to get these treatments.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the convenience of  having &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; treatments at home.</li>
            <li> I felt it was cheaply made for the price.</li>
            <li> Hers was much more powerful and caused redness and pain.  </li>
            <li> I am an RN trained in aesthetic facial procedures &amp; I do feel this is a great home product...</li>
            <li> I have been using the DermaWand for the duration of the 30 day free trial and I am going to keep the product.</li>
            <li> Derma Wand refused to acknowledge return even though the U.S. Post Office has confirmed delivery to Derma Wand and our credit card company has agreed we do not owe for the product.  </li>
            <li> Estheticians do not recommend it, and they will bamboozle you into signing up for a Free Rewards program.</li>
            <li> And with regular use of the Wand they are greatly reduced.</li>
            <li> I also try it with premium quality skin creams instead of the cheap ones that come with the product.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic product.</li>
            <li> My face looks fantastic.</li>
            <li> The Derma Wand promises a great deal of improvement in facial skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews were good , that is the only reason I ordered this product.</li>
            <li> Just start out on a low setting and get ready to see awesome results!!!</li>
            <li> Your better off using a good facial cream</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and have fair skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> absolutely nothing !!!</li>
            <li> I really like it tho.!!!</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews; but this one deserves a review.  </li>
            <li> Very useful.</li>
            <li> I should not have bought the Derma Wand but, as I am a great oxygen fan and use it in different ways (oral oxygen and ozonators), I decided to buy the Derma Wand.&lt;br /&gt;Though it is true that it *temporarily* plumps up and lifts the face, I had a problem with it</li>
            <li> Easy and quick to use, and</li>
            <li> I like using the derma at night it make my face look rivatilized and fresh for the next beautiful day.</li>
            <li> Not as quick and easy as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I never got to use it since I gifted it to my sister who loves it very much.</li>
            <li> The Derma Wand is fast, easy to use and it explains how it works as well as what you should expect...and most of all it delivers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was excited to use the Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li> I am excited to see what results i get after a moth of dedicated usage.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I want to say first off, that I&#x27;m so glad that items like this can be ordered from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Drink plenty of water and eat food that are rich in vitamin a,c and e.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed that many of the pores on my nose were decreasing in size.  </li>
            <li> I am using it daily for 5 minues and the results are remarkable.</li>
            <li> (so one month more consistently) and the pictures I took yesterday BLEW</li>
            <li> (so one month more consistently) and the pictures I took yesterday BLEW</li>
            <li> Jowls not completely gone, but greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li> I have added Life Cell and Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream to my daily regime in addition to the DermaWand and continue to see better and better results!</li>
            <li> Just stick to the original offer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to see the results in another week or two.</li>
            <li> My satisfaction comes from my wife&#x27;s smile!  </li>
            <li> Just zapped one tonight and realized this is worth sharing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid forties and honestly look better than when I was 28.</li>
            <li> But not much on my eye bags..but still good:)</li>
            <li> I am 47 yrs old and although I did not expect any miracles or to look 20 years younger,  I am impressed with the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> wash my face, and use a toner to clean off any residue.</li>
            <li> If you clean the head.</li>
            <li> and I see so many positive changes I will purchase  again, when mine wears out.  </li>
            <li> Wow, am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> Never worked well the highest intensity was nothing special and the lowest wouldn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li> I have large poors and oily skin, for the most part.</li>
            <li> and  I am a true believer now...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as though I ever paid extra for this but to be honest, I don&#x27;t know how effective it really is...  </li>
            <li> SINCE TURNING 40, I&#x27;VE TRIED AT LEAST 13 PRODUCTS OFF OF THE INTERNET, AND THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!  </li>
            <li> It is ok I haven&#x27;t seen much of an improvement</li>
            <li> Sweet.</li>
            <li> You need a computer to watch the full CD.</li>
            <li> and it is not painful.  </li>
            <li> I use it twice a day for about three minutes, and &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34; it is not painful.</li>
            <li> You will love it and everyone will wonder how much you paid to take the wrinkles off your face.</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel stimulated - it really seems to energize my face.</li>
            <li> Forget all the negative reviews, this product is GREAT!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t POSSIBLY be 60!!?&amp;#34; That felt so good.</li>
            <li> really know if it was safe to use.....</li>
            <li> To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used it enough to know if it lends results.  </li>
            <li> but when I compared it with my sister&#x27;s, hers was much stronger and she is getting much better results.  </li>
            <li> I returned it, and Amazon gave me a full refund.  </li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been a nice experience.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the full line of items that come with the one that is advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> But it is worth trying out for the 30 day free trial.</li>
            <li> My skin is in good shape for 43, but I bought this for the starting of crows feet</li>
            <li> The gel supplied with the machine is chock full of suspicious (to me) chemicals.  </li>
            <li> She also explained that today I would have to pay the full tax on the Derma Wand, which came to $8.27 for my state tax.</li>
            <li> Although the produuct construction is good and it does produce a variable controlled tingling sensation, it is soon to tell if the claims of the manufacturer are valid because I have only tried it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> so I know how a true in office machine like this works.</li>
            <li> The sting is not bad.  </li>
            <li> Since it is made out of aloe vera, I thought it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> Since it is made out of aloe vera, I thought it&#x27;s not a bad product.</li>
            <li> And it is important to get the right amount of moisture on the skin for use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a gentle, steady, summer rain. :)</li>
            <li> I did not buy mine through their site--I paid about $60 for mine on Amazon, and for that price I most certainly got my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> but since I&#x27;ve tried other items with \\&quot;great</li>
            <li> It was a waste of good money!  </li>
            <li> I chose a 1 star rating because the first time I used it the derma wand seemed to work fine</li>
            <li> The DW  smooths fine lines and absolutely opens the eyes!</li>
            <li> works just not as quickly as I would like&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Incidentally, works well with people with mild bells palsy.</li>
            <li> I am practically free of wrinkles and, thanks to some excellent facial exercises I have been doing for about three years, my face is firm and nicely toned up.</li>
            <li> It has made me feel more confident and youthful in a short time.</li>
            <li> Lastly, be loyal to the use of this product for skin tightening.</li>
            <li> I use it extensive my around the eyes on max setting with no problems, only great improvement!</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my mild wrinkles, either.</li>
            <li> had to stop, for my skin to heal &amp; under eye mild burning to stop  </li>
            <li> Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> My best to all of you who are in their pursuit of matching their external beauty with their internal beauty, God Bless.</li>
            <li> I´ve been wanting to buy this product for years now, and did´t because i was either pregnant, nursing, pregnant again nursing again and didn´t</li>
            <li> Super service from seller...</li>
            <li> I will say, if you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix or surgical results, this product is not for</li>
            <li> By the end of day 4, the enthusiasm swiftly quickly wears off.</li>
            <li> Received the product quite quickly.</li>
            <li> i think it  mostly killing grams and not really giving u amazing results</li>
            <li> Everything came quickly and fully.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed furrows between my eyebrows in my 30s, but managed to be mostly wrinkle and sag free until about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> and I was quickly beginning to look my age.  </li>
            <li> and  it&#x27;s toned my face, particularly the cheeks and under the chin  and has given me a more youthful appearance.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a smoother more toned look and feel to their skin.</li>
            <li> Since this is time consuming, I would normally do it during my favorite TV show.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles and my face is pretty smooth</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I am very pleased after using for only one week.</li>
            <li> I trust it will be good in the long run after applying it every day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m turning 47 in a couple months and years of too much fun, too much sun, too much sorrow, too much stress, weight fluctuations and neglect of a good skincare regime</li>
            <li> This should be called the magic wand instead, it is fantastic, after a couple of months you can see the difference - this is a product that you cannot live without it because it really helps, your face looks radiant and you notice that the wrinkles specially around the eyes get smoother every time.</li>
            <li> I would say though that you have to be consistent with using it and definitely use a good moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think it works pretty good</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use while watching TV and doesn&#x27;t take too much time.  </li>
            <li> Too soon to have real results but it is easy to use so</li>
            <li> Well when I got it I was pretty excited.</li>
            <li> I am almost 39 years old, look pretty young for my age and figured it would be a great tool to add to my anti aging routine.</li>
            <li> I look younger and more refreshed!</li>
            <li> I originally had a problem with the first product shipped, but they contacted me immediately to correct the problem.  </li>
            <li> was planning to wait to review until I used the device for one month, but saw results so fast!!  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and honestly, I believe it has made my skin look more wrinkled than less.</li>
            <li> So I have to say you will get results quickly, but not miracles right away.  </li>
            <li> Really helpa fine lines, pores.&lt;br /&gt;Tightens skin.</li>
            <li> So far so good, easy to use, and it looks like it will improve my skin after constant use.  </li>
            <li> (I did clean it thoroughly when I first got it and</li>
            <li> In spite of all this, I still sometimes skip my twice a day, but other times, I&#x27;ll do a quick afternoon &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; just because I can&#x27;t believe how good it looks.</li>
            <li> Great product to keep your skin looking firm</li>
            <li> Then it was gone, and my skin really did become perfectly free of blemishes.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t real fast</li>
            <li> results do not seem lasting; perhaps I am too old, LOL</li>
            <li> Anything that is worth it takes time.</li>
            <li> Well worth the cost--</li>
            <li> this is defintly worth the money I use it every day</li>
            <li> and it surely does not compare to the professional treatment you receive in salons and dermatologist offices.</li>
            <li> ......takes to much time suppose to use morning and night,it would be good if you had the time to spare especially in the morning</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel soft,  hopefully helping my moisturizers do a better job.  </li>
            <li> 55 and most people peg me for early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> to be honest, i am quite prone to acne, especially on my chin.</li>
            <li> We use this procedure to help products (like serums, antioxidants) get absorbed into the skin, to help stimulate collagen production, and increase elasticity and tone in the skin.</li>
            <li> Some of the deeper creases at the smile line have softened.</li>
            <li> From all the reviews that I&#x27;ve read, this seems to be rare.  </li>
            <li> I could probably give this more stars if I were not 100 years old, plus I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> and the next day I looked liked</li>
            <li> the laugh lines are fading.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice at-home facial.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 4 weeks now, but thrilled with my results.</li>
            <li> did you finally turn 50?&amp;#34; I just smiled and shook my head</li>
            <li> I will keep you posted on my success...</li>
            <li> It was worth the money</li>
            <li> 1/18/13: I&#x27;m starting to get compliments from friends and acquaintances telling me how nice my skin</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  </li>
            <li> After three weeks, the results are visual - nice to receive complements.</li>
            <li> The massage this product provides leaves your skin feeling fresh and tingling from the increased bloodflow, creating the only true foundation for real, natural beauty: good skin.</li>
            <li> Feeling practically suicidal before I received this item, I can truly say that it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot for those looking for a painless fix.</li>
            <li> I have used it for six weeks and cannot observe any lessening of the crowsfeet around my eyes or lessening of the smile lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It has been the only thing I have had any kind of success with.  </li>
            <li> It was worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> The smell that it emits when using reminds me of fresh outdoor air.  </li>
            <li> All in all, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> face feels plumped and fresh</li>
            <li> I only use it once a day for about 5 minutes, with my own skin moisturizing products.  </li>
            <li> if the lifting didn&#x27;t work the dermawand is worth the price just for what it did for my skin...</li>
            <li> When my 12 year old grand daughter looked at me</li>
            <li> My eyes look fresh and lifted.  </li>
            <li> Had purchased dermawand, best thing I ever did, results are fantastic and unfortunately I broke it and will not hestitate to order another one.  </li>
            <li> But so far I&#x27;m enjoying the Wand.</li>
            <li> This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> You can feel it &#x27;working&amp;#34;, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> I am not a gadget person unless that product is worth the money</li>
            <li> I think the Dermawand is well worth the price from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I very rarely review anything, but I am so thankful that I found this item I felt compelled to share so that others would know that it really does work.  </li>
            <li> On another note, if anyone has experienced firming or toning of any other areas from using this product, namely upper arms or thighs, I would love to know.  </li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to take a chance; I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> The DermaWand was stashed away and forgotten for many years due to life having her way with me as she does for so many.  </li>
            <li> Just this past week, I&#x27;ve received more than a dozen compliments from friends, family and coworkers on how great my skin looks and how young I appear (I&#x27;m 60).  </li>
            <li> Other websites had this rated and it was not given good reviews.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the Derma Wand a try after reading good reviews by other customers.  </li>
            <li> and I need to just use it right twice a day once in the morning and one in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Since I have used Derma wand, I notice I get a twitch in my right eye.  </li>
            <li> You just have to know that it isn&#x27;t going to work miracles right away.</li>
            <li> Results right away.  </li>
            <li> everyone feels the tingle sensation right away&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> That &amp;#34;response&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t sit right with me.  </li>
            <li> After the 1st time used it, I could see the result right away.</li>
            <li> I started to see a difference right away.  </li>
            <li> Right now, I am a work in progress.</li>
            <li> I HOPE I CAN GET IT RIGHT AWAY</li>
            <li> I used the products that came with the wand for the first few days then just went back to my regular day/night creams, added a bit of water when I needed more &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; and to be honest, I am super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> my eye area is lifted and full; my lips are fuller and more luscious &amp; youthful, especially if I use DW with a lip plumper!</li>
            <li> and im hopjng that with daily use effects will ne lomger lastimg very easy to use</li>
            <li> In an hour, I actually feel my eyesight becoming sharper!</li>
            <li> There are so many major health risks that come with RF...</li>
            <li> As with all the procedures like high frequency, galvanic, or light therapy the results are temporary.</li>
            <li> No matter how many facials I have had along with using only oil free products nothing gave me a clear smooth face.    </li>
            <li> Well after using it for a few weeks acne got slightly better, but my skin started to look better in general and the very fine lines around my eyes were practically gone.  </li>
            <li> Your eyes lift,creases go away, &amp; in the morning-I really saw the impact of a true \\&quot;lift\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> There has been no miraculous removal of wrinkles from my face, but my face does look smoother and just better in general.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true this can be very drying to the skin.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed because I really need this kind of item.let&#x27;s hope for the better one.the prize is attractive compare to nu-brilliance</li>
            <li> and I need help to change me a new one free of charge, as does the warranty</li>
            <li> If they come out with a cordless version or if I can trade this in for one, I&#x27;d certainly do that!</li>
            <li> I noticed a plumping right after I used the wand for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this device.......while it lasted, which wasn&#x27;t very long.</li>
            <li> One has to wonder if different companies don&#x27;t pay them to \\&quot;work from home\\&quot; to post nothing but great things about various products.</li>
            <li> My 8 year old daughter has red hair and a fair complexion and tends to pick at her boo boos that take forever to heal.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money at medi-spas getting laser light treatments and peels and facials and this dermawand works better than all of it put together.</li>
            <li> I get good results with the derma-wand using it with Elizabeth Gant&#x27;s anti-aging serums and doing it slightly differnt than the directions.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had kind of dry skin</li>
            <li> think there would be many more happier customers if  this unit was more of a medical device and less of a massager.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And my Marietta lines are less noticeable it is almost a good as a juvederm injection.</li>
            <li> I can say, that when I did use it with my other products I was very pleased.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item and shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I&#x27;m 48 and have never been very responsible when it comes to skin care.  </li>
            <li> The product came very fast.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, but it does seem like its doing something--not sure what yet!!!</li>
            <li> When I get a cyst starting, I put the DermaWand right on the top of where the cyst is, zap it at a setting of 6 or more for a minute a time three times a day, and the cyst quite simply disappears, without scarring or discoloring my skin, and without pain.</li>
            <li> I dark circles under my eyes and many fine lines around my mouth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super easy to use and I plan on continuing because I am definitely getting the results I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> product arrived super fast...and the return was done very fast and professional, it was even picked up at my home, thank you for a super fast service!</li>
            <li> Great product  when it&#x27;s new&lt;br /&gt;2stars after using it a while it hardly works</li>
            <li> At first I thought I might be imagining the improvement - but after catching my reflection in a mirror that I did not know was there, I realized the effects are real, and I will certainly keep using this wand as part of my daily routine.  </li>
            <li> I First saw this derma wand on the FOX Channel.</li>
            <li> I used the Derma Wand twice a day, on a higher dial (#7, it stimulates and shocks the skin) for 1.5 months now.  </li>
            <li> But if you are willing to take the time and continue using it</li>
            <li> IT&#x27;S REAL !</li>
            <li> I am in a full blown battle with them at this time because I fell for their \\&quot;FREE TRIAL\\&quot; ad (info mercial) and they charged not only the $144.95, but they also then charged another $9.95 shipping the day I ordered it.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a year, and it think it really works, keeps the skin tighter and helps with the smile lines</li>
            <li> However, I am on a medication that causes bleeding and some pretty severe bruising.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no change of any kind.</li>
            <li> , I just relaxed &amp; actually used it more, like 3-4 times/week, not timing it, just enjoying the gentle massage, the general benefit which I know for a fact is there (i.e.: research).</li>
            <li> I returned it, the first week, this product does not work</li>
            <li> so he was willing to try it.  </li>
            <li> And speaking of pain, unless you are supersensitive, there is none, even at the higher settings.  </li>
            <li> since my eyebrows are higher so my eyes are brighter.</li>
            <li> Was using it pretty faithfully</li>
            <li> I have been wanting the Derma Wand Kit for many years and finally purchased one.  </li>
            <li> More youthful appearance after only about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The only thing this product does is crisp the top layer of your skin.</li>
            <li> but it did for me which is a first.</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> Since I have monthly facials, I am acquainted with the commercial size machine and how it works.</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and continually get questions about the quality of this item, so I decided to buy it to see how it worked exactly.</li>
            <li> But they make you believe it happens the first use</li>
            <li> I think if you are younger, you will see more results than if you don&#x27;t start it till your 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact there were more wrinkles under my eyes after the initial swelling was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was eager to get started with Dermawand when I saw the infomercial and started using this and started seeing an improvement IMMEDIATELY after my first use.  </li>
            <li> Better to use it 2xs daily.</li>
            <li> I know it works as I told no one I was using it and have received so many compliments and inquiries as to what I am doing to make my skin look so much younger.  </li>
            <li> so it may work better for younger women.</li>
            <li> first off, I was only able to use this product for 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say this product does not work, just why I dislike it and stopped using it after 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Months later, I find that time is still winning with aging effect in spite of faithful use..  </li>
            <li> Maybe for younger skin it works better.  </li>
            <li> I purchased my first Derma Wand Kit about a month ago.  </li>
            <li> Be aware.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps if you stay on top of it.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a rip off, wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> At first my skin looked flushed and it seemed to be working .</li>
            <li> Item as described, I have been using this product daily and love the results.</li>
            <li> Today is the first day of trying this Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> I did exactly what the dvd said</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first impression.</li>
            <li> It truly does show improvement if used consistently.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day exactly as the directions, and nothing.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I was hoping for more improvement on my upper eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> looks(they don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve been using DermaWand), and I am starting to notice more improvement around my eyes.</li>
            <li> you look like you are so pretty now</li>
            <li> I wasnt pretty before she was</li>
            <li> I should do more resource next time</li>
            <li> I could tell a difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> but not the changes that read like the first week or sooner.  </li>
            <li> - we put up with a lot more in the name of &amp;#34;beauty.&amp;#34;  Some reviewers commented that you had to use this on a regular basis; well, of course, you do.  </li>
            <li> you need to be constant to get better results.</li>
            <li> to test and see, I used Hydra Support Cream first then added the Hydra Infusion then Skin Mist.</li>
            <li> today is exactly 30 days from the day I started using Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> I use it on my eyes and above my eyebrows the most</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve skipped it for about 24 hours or so now, and I could tell first thing this morning when looked into the mirror.</li>
            <li> I received the Derma Wand over the weekend, and tried it out first thing Monday.  </li>
            <li> and as far as the popping sound of elecricity goes</li>
            <li> Although it takes a month to see improvement, I feel confident that by following the instructions and reviewing the video several times, I&#x27;ll look better.</li>
            <li> The machine does not hurt and my skin responded well after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> The first 2 weeks</li>
            <li> They also charged  me 60 plus for the first payment and convinitely</li>
            <li> Even the first week I noticed my skin looked healthier and had a glow.</li>
            <li> In fact I didn&#x27;t think I was seeing any lifting at all after the first month until I weighed...</li>
            <li> Dermawand is a great product at least for me.</li>
            <li> Maybe more later.</li>
            <li> First saw this product on TV over a decade ago.  </li>
            <li> My granddaughter was visiting the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> to better aging!has now been two months total</li>
            <li> which is what happened to my first one.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are not going away, or getting better (the wife uses it religiously)....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m  consistent with the use of it  in this way</li>
            <li> intend to continue though, thinking maybe even once a day several times a week is better than nothing at all.</li>
            <li> Not difficult to use..</li>
            <li> I ordered the Derma Wand about two weeks ago by first going to their web site and then calling the phone number listed on the web site.</li>
            <li> She explained that the Derma Vital skin care products automatically come with the Derma Wand offer and were free, except that my credit card would be charged the $9.99 for shipping/processing of the skin care products.</li>
            <li> see below for my first review.</li>
            <li> I have not been consistent in using this product so I will update in a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Saw a difference the first day.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe &amp;#34;nay sayers&amp;#34;, because it really works!</li>
            <li> would say better:  \\&quot;It does electrify like a real short circuit\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing!</li>
            <li> The first day we could see a difference.</li>
            <li> Feels good, skin is firm</li>
            <li> neither good, nor bad...until a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and everyone says how rested and good</li>
            <li> A waste of good money.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would burn my skin, but have quickly moved up to the high settings with no problem.</li>
            <li> It takes much longer if you want to do it right, and you have to do it twice a day.</li>
            <li> I have decided it is a foundational item to have in my beauty kit - not the only answer to every problem, but a key essential, along with a good cleansing/moisturizing routine, exercise, healthy eating, sleep &amp; reducing</li>
            <li> and I had these huge bags that sat at the top of my cheeks one week after I had stopped crying.</li>
            <li> The product is honest to goodnes true but unfortunately, I am lazy to use it.</li>
            <li> It is worth every penny to try this product especially with the 30 day free trial.  </li>
            <li> Feels funny at first, but I really think it has helped my skin.  </li>
            <li> It feels good on your skin after used, almost the same feeling after facial tx @</li>
            <li> already the next day several people said I looked good today.</li>
            <li> The Dermawand works ok in the United States, but does not work very well outside of the US in places that require an adaptor.  </li>
            <li> Thanks you very much.  </li>
            <li> The scar is faintly visible, but if the unit was more powerful it would have more successfully and completely eliminated the puckers in my neck and stretched skin from where my thyroid damaged it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel it has a positive effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to buy the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> However, this device does produce positive results.</li>
            <li> I read positive reviews, but not my experience.  </li>
            <li> that should have been my first clue that this wouldn&#x27;t work, but the lady on there seemed to really perk up her face while using this.</li>
            <li> We got it pretty fast in the mail, no hassle.</li>
            <li> different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Derma Wand obsessively for the first two weeks straight.  </li>
            <li> It really works but you must use it consistently.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet but seems to feel good and will take time to see</li>
            <li> This seems like a good product but it is not magic as some might hope for.  </li>
            <li> So if you still decide to go ahead taking in of all the positive reviews like I did,  make sure you can commit to it EVERY single day twice a day like the instructions call for.</li>
            <li> You will find that it is easy to use and if used properly, it should make a dent in any wrinkle you might have.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this product through Dermawand on TV; received the item very quickly with all the facial products.</li>
            <li> can wait until I see full result in few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It feels good on your face, but I have not had it long enough to see if it will do what it is touted to do.  </li>
            <li> I decided that it certainly couldn&#x27;t hurt,</li>
            <li> no allergic reaction problems, but i tend to get large cystic acne there.</li>
            <li> but I know everyone has a certain skin care regiment that suits them.  </li>
            <li> She says it works and certainly helps the skin</li>
            <li> (my bathroom is large and never steams up)</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy this, again, and recommend it to anyone who asks.</li>
            <li> It also burnt my face in certain areas.</li>
            <li> I had been using pure aloe gel and it does work as well</li>
            <li> followed by  coconut oil (pure &amp; organic), or castor oil (</li>
            <li> I use the wand everyday, I love it!</li>
            <li> At a gathering, no one could believe that I&#x27;m in my slightly over mid 50&#x27;s lol.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use but at the same time, very time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I was super surprised that the lines (not wrinkles, they&#x27;ve been with me my whole life)</li>
            <li> I have a few fine lines and puffiness under my eyes, that is all and the fine lines are just as noticeable today as they were 4 months ago.</li>
            <li> If you stop using it, your muscles won&#x27;t stay nice and tight.</li>
            <li> After the initial reaction &amp; all the drama calmed down, my grand daughter said,  &amp;#34;Nana, your face&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li> The progress makes the deep lines to be less noticeable; I believe my facial skin will look as good as my friend&#x27;s if I continue using it for a year!!!</li>
            <li> The fine lines around the lower eye are almost gone and overall, my skin is tighter around the chin and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> BE REALISTIC!</li>
            <li> Instead I look much older!  </li>
            <li> Made my skin look 5 years older!</li>
            <li> This is one nice little gadget.</li>
            <li> people who said it make them breakout clean the bulb with alcohol pad or something zap the areas with higher setting slightly above the skin surface...</li>
            <li> Only been using this for a few days, but I am happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it !</li>
            <li> It arrived much faster than I anticipated,  as well.</li>
            <li> and I really like it...</li>
            <li> I tried it once or twice and really like how it feels.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time getting ready</li>
            <li> and nothing is happening, nada, absolutely nothing...</li>
            <li> It has really helped the tone of my skin and the crows feet.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Derma wand a couple of years ago, and even though I used it faithfully, I didn&#x27;t really see any results.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, using it caused my bruises to fade much faster, and this in return, prevented the staining.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen results, yet.  </li>
            <li> It gradually (VERY gradually, in my case) smoothed out, improved &amp; appears to be gently restoring the condition of the skin &amp; underlying muscle.</li>
            <li> It is also very relaxing.  </li>
            <li> performed better that expected</li>
            <li> So I guess I really don&#x27;t know if it works...</li>
            <li> my smile lines and brow creases are nearly gone.</li>
            <li> lightening fast</li>
            <li> That is my case, the skin hasn&#x27;t really begun to sag yet (</li>
            <li> This device really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I think the lotion used really matters too.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about how it works yet.  </li>
            <li> haha.  </li>
            <li> I really bought this for entertainment value..</li>
            <li> I have not used this product as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Same feel, smell, sound, and results.</li>
            <li> I really feel I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Intense.</li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> The product works very well.</li>
            <li> It is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really feel like my skin is smoother.</li>
            <li> The lotion that comes with this dries too fast, so I use my grapeseed oil or Argon oil.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it.  </li>
            <li> As much as I wanted to believe it worked, I saw no difference whatsoever.</li>
            <li> I have been using the wand for about 2 weeks straight.  </li>
            <li> so I assume it is working, but will have to continue use to make up my mind on how much it works.</li>
            <li> , I really like the way it makes my face feel and it does seem to make my face feel tighter, it has become a routine for me</li>
            <li> I was very faithful in using it.</li>
            <li> I used this with the Aloe that was included for the 1st 3 minutes massaging my face, I did not like the included aloe, it dries fast and is very sticky</li>
            <li> And I really don’t want that type of lift, I want my collagen restored as I thought this product was supposed to help with.</li>
            <li> Just beginning and works really well.</li>
            <li> I cant really see that it is improving my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think I got much benefit.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I know that there is a lot of controversy regarding if the Dermawand really works.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t until one of my friends at work told me I looked really rested and my wrinkles had soften.</li>
            <li> Simply works fantastic.</li>
            <li> Thanks god.</li>
            <li> For the price I expected more.</li>
            <li> so much Christina Boves for creating the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> One time my eyes was really puffy when I woke up.</li>
            <li> and it is working really well.  </li>
            <li> Really would not reccomend wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a confirmed Amazon shopper, and would never order one of these from the television commercial.  </li>
            <li> Also, if I can just maintain what I have, and then maybe see a bit of improvement, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m really looking for.  </li>
            <li> That is how much stronger</li>
            <li> WORKED REALLY</li>
            <li> BUT IT REALLY DOES WORK FOR REAL</li>
            <li> thanks to my friend who recommend me this product.</li>
            <li> the cream that comes with it dries up to fast.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is doing anything that much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t start thinking much about it until about age 40.  </li>
            <li> It took me a couple weeks to see a real difference in firmness.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it very highly...especially for women my age....</li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t give this a rating because I never even tried it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 60 and have fought cystic acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for me.</li>
            <li> will really work.</li>
            <li> The Baby Quasar did absolutely nothing either.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that my skin DOES feel much firmer.</li>
            <li> I tried it for a month and did not realize how much of a difference in the tone and firmness of my eylids, jawline, and neck until I did not use it for a month.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice much around my mouth though.</li>
            <li> My skin looks much firmer and smoother.</li>
            <li> what did you do?&amp;#34; I told her about the Derma Wand and now she wants one.</li>
            <li> I tried this for three months on my face as directed, and also gave it a try on scars just to see if it really could stimulate collagen in the area.</li>
            <li> What is it really trying to do??</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I had lost 7 pounds and there was no change in my face...and for me that is unusual.</li>
            <li> If your not feeling the tingling sort of buzzing sensation then you are either using too much pressure with the wand against your skin or you used too much product...</li>
            <li> , you looked really sick&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> If you really want to look really &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; in terms of the youth today it works.  </li>
            <li> DermaWand really works.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Nothing, no matter how much I tried, was making a noticeable (to anyone but me</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t take much time.</li>
            <li> it works real well, I like it and will recommend ti to my friends</li>
            <li> Jaw line is much firmer.</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> My face feels so much smoother</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement with wrinkles  </li>
            <li> I NEVER want to be without one and will be a faithful user because the results are REAL.</li>
            <li> REALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> I really like using it</li>
            <li> In fact, I was amazed at how much the Derma Wand helped heal the skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really use the skin care products that came with it, except for the pre-face.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as described AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> Too bad--it worked really well for 5 weeks--</li>
            <li> and they are much plumper.  </li>
            <li> Just started using my derma wand and already see results, not so much on the wrinkles</li>
            <li> I REALLY SHOULD</li>
            <li> Mwife really likes this product</li>
            <li> I so much wanted to believe the hype.</li>
            <li> Also, after 5 minutes of use it doesn&#x27;t have much power.</li>
            <li> but we need to moisturize more, stay young on the outside as well.</li>
            <li> I believe we all have different conditions in aging that make the very same product effective or not.</li>
            <li> I am 67 year old female and have always taken care of my complexion and stopped the sun worship many years ago.  </li>
            <li> I am especially happy about my under jaw and neck area, which was the area I hated the most.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Today, nearly a decade later I am doing better.  </li>
            <li> Like others, I would not order directly from Dermawand - why pay $50 or more extra if you don&#x27;t have to?</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago, but I can honestly say I think it is making a difference.  </li>
            <li> so far so good I can see a difference- take a bit of time everyday</li>
            <li> I have, after two weeks use, noticed a marked improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture, and my adult acne breakouts are much improved!!!  </li>
            <li> not very expensive.</li>
            <li> whole thing about guaranteed money back is bs too because I have the original packaging, receipt &amp; so on &amp; am being told it has been 65 days instead of the stated on receipt 60 days to return</li>
            <li> But as time went by there were other products promising more easier glory, and my Derma Wand got resigned to the &amp;#34;it works but requires dedication&amp;#34; box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the tingly sensation of the DermaWand and find it refreshing and relaxing at the end of a long day after a deep facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> I think I use it better after watching some youtube videos of how other people were using it.  </li>
            <li> Remember to prep your skin with the pre-treatment or any other moisturizer before use, so that the wand glides along your skin better.</li>
            <li> Other than that it make skin look much better.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dermawand for about three weeks, and I actually see a significant firming effect on my neck and jawline, which have been been a concern for some time.</li>
            <li> This is my first negative review but have to be honest.</li>
            <li> great product, gets rid of small wrinkles,lesson deep wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The Pre-Face treatment gets dry so easy on my face, I cannot glide the wand on my face.</li>
            <li> My health suffered and my skin turned older faster than it would have if I hadn&#x27;t went through so much.</li>
            <li> but my pores are smaller and skin generally looks better.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my go-to for those occasional zits that develop before a special event.  </li>
            <li> only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I do not want to suggest it is some kind of single, lighting-strike miracle.</li>
            <li> I am noticing a minor tightening in my neck and jawline area, as well as a smoothing of the light lines and \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot; between my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Then, if after the 30 day trial I decide to keep the Derma Wand, then I would be charged $39.95 for the first real payment plus $14.95 for the shipping/processing for a total of $54.90 for the first of 3 monthly payments.</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t been able to tell much different in the amount of times I have used it, not as regular as recommended</li>
            <li> I love this product as it helps keep the redness down on my skin and my skin feels a lot</li>
            <li> Received az a gift and dedicated way too many hours and hopes for just a minimal improvement but no change whatsoever!!</li>
            <li> pure &amp; organic too) and a few more minutes running the wand over it in circles and upstrokes from mouth to forehead.  </li>
            <li> I feel healthier with my new glow and the bags are gone!  </li>
            <li> New shoes would be nicer!</li>
            <li> MY NEW DRIVERS LICENSE PICTURE TELLS THE WHOLE STORY (JUST GOT IT YESTERDAY)  </li>
            <li> I have been using the DermaWand for about 2 weeks, and have noticed improvement along the jaw line in particular (which was the main reason I purchased the wand).  </li>
            <li> My complaints are mostly with the products/creams that come with the kit -- they&#x27;re OK, but not awesome.  </li>
            <li> I am a lot older than she and have scarring and wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> it to my older daughter to amuse herself with.</li>
            <li> older woman.  </li>
            <li> , I do it longer at night while watching TV before going to sleep and a quick overall after I moisturize in the morning before I apply make-up.  </li>
            <li> bought this item for my wife, she uses it everyday and absolutely loves it, price was about $30 cheaper than at most places too, and it arrived 2 days after placing order.</li>
            <li> It is not an inexpensive beauty tool, and  after 6 months daily use I do not believe it should have burnout that quickly.  </li>
            <li> But costing over $100, I am hoping to get a refund, or better yet, to see if a properly working unit will give me the results claimed, exchange it to see if another unit will last to give me the reduced lines and jowls.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it one star is because it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> That would not be realistic.  </li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re patient enough to use this on a regular basis, you won&#x27;t need to spend a lot more money paying a plastic surgeon.</li>
            <li> I think I was realistic in my expectations.</li>
            <li> and I just love it and after about the 2nd week (using only about 4-5 mins twice a day)</li>
            <li> YouTube has some decent vids, maybe if I continue to get results I&#x27;ll throw up a video.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m an older woman</li>
            <li> I have seen the different though she looks a bit younger :)</li>
            <li> I use it for blemishes, facial massage, and more recently to promote healing of a skin injury.</li>
            <li> Since I haven&#x27;t used it THAT long, I cannot comment on the long term benefits but the instant benefits are remarkable.  </li>
            <li> The prod does give you a fast mini face lift--&amp; over time -WOW-!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised!</li>
            <li> Highly suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used it on the high settings...</li>
            <li> I do not use indirect high frequency, so the Dermawand suits me well as it is compact and portable.</li>
            <li> We do a procedure called high frequency in our spa, derma wand is a high frequency machine.</li>
            <li> I use a high setting everywhere except upper-eye area under brows.</li>
            <li> I did this (not noticing that I was not supposed to go as high as I did)</li>
            <li> After reading about the radio high frequency being put into your body with the use of this, I opted to return it and valued my health versus having wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly...</li>
            <li> I have been using it twice a day on the high setting for approx.</li>
            <li> So  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this treatment.</li>
            <li> and I really do not have high hopes that it will improve my fine lines I have.</li>
            <li> DermaWand has given me a whole new look and a new beginning,  I will tell anyone who is considering getting a DermaWand to  do it.  </li>
            <li> but I am going to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles so was looking for a little improvement.</li>
            <li> Do Not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> They told me to email Derma Wand directly and, surprise!!, no response.</li>
            <li> Wow! Believe!</li>
            <li> I just got &#x27;carded&#x27; this weekend by a club security guard who suspected I was under 21 years old!!</li>
            <li> It makes the skin feel better as in softer and maybe a little firmer, but has not reduced any wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the instructions don&#x27;t mention you have to CLEAN THE CLEAR HEAD WITH EVERY USE.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product that already has made major changes in my skin after only about a month of use.  </li>
            <li> ....I might edit my rating down the line, but this item, and the reasonable price, is just fine with me.  </li>
            <li> and wow it really works.</li>
            <li> It was never dropped, always stored in its case in a clean, dry cabinet, never exposed to even a steamy room</li>
            <li> On my young son&#x27;s face... it really does help with skin breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Dermawand for what could could have cost thousands by a professional.</li>
            <li> After just a few uses they were noticeably better.</li>
            <li> but I just haven&#x27;t had a lot of time since you are supposed to use it only with a freshly cleaned face and time</li>
            <li> My wife is extremely satisfied with the results after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and I  love the effects on my face</li>
            <li> as with most stuff like this it was a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> My skin is much more firm than it use to be.  </li>
            <li> I got it for my double chin, pores, and laugh lines..</li>
            <li> Worth the price if you are starting to notice some sagging of the jaw and neckline and don&#x27;t want to do anything drastic like plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> The deep laugh lines I had</li>
            <li> I´ll comment in a few more months and see if I´m getting younger!haha</li>
            <li> I had open heart surgery and have to take blood thinners for the rest of my life so for me to have any kind of face lift surgeries was completely out of the question and through this has aged me faster</li>
            <li> Normally, it would take me 30-45 minutes each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it makes me look almost normal again.  </li>
            <li> did&#x27;t think it was worth the money, so I sent it back</li>
            <li> but the key to any success is to keep using it.</li>
            <li> If only for this reason this product is worth it for me.</li>
            <li> I am 60 years of age and have been around the &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; a few times, had many facials, etc.</li>
            <li> Its easy to use but just makes getting ready take a little longer everyday.&lt;br /&gt;5/31/14-</li>
            <li> My jaw line looks smoother and my color is better (not so pale).</li>
            <li> The evening treatment will take me about 30 minutes and my face and neck feel very soft, look brighter, and the few lines I do have appearing better.  </li>
            <li> But I stopped using is for a month - and did notice a slip right back.</li>
            <li> if I can return it I would send it right back.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t done much for one of the deep creases next to my mouth yet, but I was so glad it put my eyes back to practically normal.  </li>
            <li> Also, the travel case that comes with it seems to be a little small for the wand and cord to fit into -- kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li> I get acne cysts occasionally and if I catch the bump fast, I can keep it from getting large and developing a head.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t live without it</li>
            <li> When I was inspecting my NEW Derma Wand</li>
            <li> I have to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> If the dermawand breaks, you have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> In any event a new wand was sent to me by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping the one I purchased is just defective and when I exchange it the new one does something.</li>
            <li> and I decided that the lines were just going to be something I would have to live with.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find a new one</li>
            <li> and you don´t live in US</li>
            <li> I thought for some reason, I was buying this from Amazon not from a guy in New York.</li>
            <li> Item came new, but did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Can I use this in New Zealand</li>
            <li> but New Zealand has 240V) ??</li>
            <li> Broke it and so bought this new one.  </li>
            <li> When I really set down to do it, I spend more than 5 minutes because I have several areas that need the work.</li>
            <li> you really have to do it more than 5 minutes that is the only down fall</li>
            <li> Although i have tried other similar devices including derma needle roller, D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct, and even Tria age-defying Lasor, i found Derma Wand being the most beneficial and economical facial tool.  </li>
            <li> She is addicted and wants one of her own now.</li>
            <li> I have seen no real change since using this daily, but I will continue using it in the event it takes more time to show results.</li>
            <li> What I disliked was the facial gel it came with because I felt it didn&#x27;t moisturize as I would have liked</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t see much difference, if any and no one has said anything about me looking any younger as seen in the ads.  </li>
            <li> I mainly purchased it to help clear up my acne.</li>
            <li> I decided that I spent the money, it was working some, and unless I truly gave it a fair trial, I had wasted my money (again).  </li>
            <li> GIve me a professional product even if it cost a few bucks more...</li>
            <li> also have a little bit of freckles under on my cheeks and they are becoming lighter .&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li> Very clear instructions.</li>
            <li> I was very clear with the CS rep</li>
            <li> They must be very old.  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m just very sensitive</li>
            <li> The product is Just OK, seen a very little change after a month.</li>
            <li> I have a more even tone, my age spots are fading, albiet, slowly and everything seems more lifted and a little tighter.  </li>
            <li> It gives the exact results as a larger direct high frequency unit would.  </li>
            <li> so the wand did not glide smoothly over my face unless I used a ton of it and then the buzzing sound made from the wand was hardly noticeable which made me believe it was not working properly.</li>
            <li> However, after trying the &#x27;at home&#x27; version, far from the smooth texture I experience after my professional facial, I found that it caused mild breakouts and generally my skin looked rough and blotchy.    </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> The first two I used diligently on a daily basis and noticed immediate effects.  </li>
            <li> and hopefully this third one does not die on me like the the first two.</li>
            <li> BUT... I bought the thing and actually tried it and like so many other \\&quot;anti-aging</li>
            <li> WOW !</li>
            <li> My pores are shrinking, eye brows are higher (just like on the commercial), and my skins is noticeably tighter.  </li>
            <li> All I am saying is look into other reviewer&#x27;s posts, and research on different sites to make sure you are getting a quality product that does what it claims, or does something at all.</li>
            <li> After getting a pretty deep bruise, I decided to see what the derma wand could do .</li>
            <li> After the first time I used it, the next morning I could see a difference in my face.</li>
            <li> the first wand stopped working, I called customer service and after submitting proof of purchase to them, I was allowed to mail the wand back to their shipping division in GA at my expense.  </li>
            <li> within minutes of using it the first time my pores were smaller.</li>
            <li> This works, but you have to be consistent in using it to maintain tightening of the facial and jawline muscles, and to keep the neckline from sagging.</li>
            <li> My face feels tighter, looks clearer and the fine lines are getting less noticable.  </li>
            <li> Who&#x27;s the youngest looking 60 year old of all - ME!</li>
            <li> Got my derma wand today I was so excited to begin using this only to have the instructions in spanish</li>
            <li> Pleasantly surprised at how well it works!</li>
            <li> I think the first one I purchased had a stronger current.</li>
            <li> I was religious about using it twice a day and followed the directions exactly.</li>
            <li> 30 days and for the past week I have been noticing more improvement.</li>
            <li> I saw results the first time I used the DermaWand way back then.  </li>
            <li> The result is that the wand will only revert to the very highest setting!  </li>
            <li> When I first started using it, my face got very red, even on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Also other products come with diferent wands, which will get you more specific results,</li>
            <li> I also removed other scars that were more recent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know yet what the exact results will be because I have only had it for a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> the shocks of this product are a little strong</li>
            <li> I rated with high marks due to quick delivery; not on the product yet.  </li>
            <li> Wow, I love this little gadget!</li>
            <li> But, one dermawand costs as much as one facial with high frequency electrode</li>
            <li> but this is very effective and it helps to retain my results from the Pelleve at a dramatic fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> I use clean and clear detoxyfying facial scrub with microbeads while in the shower, moisturize with Cetaphil cream and for nighttime: I use Cetaphil skin cleanser, moisturize with organic shea butter, then use dermawand especially under my chin to prevent that skin from sagging.</li>
            <li> I can only assume there was a manufacturing defect, and the component that allows you to change the power setting suddenly shorted to full power all the time, regardless of the dial setting.</li>
            <li> What it claims about getting rid of zits, making pores smaller, diminishing fine lines, making the skin firmer, etc...that&#x27;s all true (at least in my case).</li>
            <li> I did drop the first one and broke the glass end, but immediately purchased my second one because I wanted to complete scar removal.</li>
            <li> And so I try to keep the wand DOWN on my face by going back &amp; forth, mostly stroking upward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have had my Derma Wand for a few day and have used it for the past four days, and am happy, so far, with what I am seeing.  </li>
            <li> I see a slight lifting effect above my eyes, though I think this is going to improve with more time.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a special laser or light that comes out and fixes your problems.</li>
            <li> a little one popped up, and now two huge cystic ones as well.</li>
            <li> I retuned this product because the little light didn&#x27;t stay on.</li>
            <li> Bought this with the best of hopes because of all the positive reviews just to try it long enough to find it totally useless and too long to return it.</li>
            <li> that I did not want to order anything extra or be charged anything extra and that is exactly what she gave me!  </li>
            <li> Dermawand is a high frequency electrode, the gas does release a smell and this is normal, it works just them same as the spa machines.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect it to do anything for wrinkles, but I thought at the very least, maybe my skin appearance would look better.</li>
            <li> The improvement is clearly shown in two weeks.  </li>
            <li> Clearly the sent me a used wand.</li>
            <li> It does stimulate the skin with out pulling or stretching so clearly does increase blood supply to the surface.</li>
            <li> My chin today is absolutely clear.  </li>
            <li> The derma wand has helped to clear up my skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> the instructions are clear.</li>
            <li> She said it paid for itself as far as her skin condition.</li>
            <li> After reviews (most of the negative) save your money &amp; get juvaderm injections or somethin.</li>
            <li> We could still hear the buzzing sound but there was not light and no zap.  </li>
            <li> My laughing line looked like tiny mustaches on my face; I was very self-conscious about it.  </li>
            <li> I am young but I have used it on my friends mom and even she has noticed a diffrence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that slathering on any lotion (lots and lots) completely eliminates the \\&quot;sting\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> BUT RITERATING , SO FAR NO DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> I really wanted to work on the deep line between my eyes and around my lips.</li>
            <li> I will judge for myself, but I find it very suspicious that all of those who gave it 5 stars and rave reviews only have 5 stars to give every product they review.</li>
            <li> I will not help to fade the old blood staining however.</li>
            <li> I am 36y old</li>
            <li> I bought it, used it religiously for about 6 weeks, and really saw no difference.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been too busy to use this 2x a day, probably used it twice a day 6 days and used it another 6 times once per day.</li>
            <li> The rash is smaller and doesn&#x27;t itch as much.  </li>
            <li> I do it twice a day while I watch TV so it doesn&#x27;t really take any extra time.</li>
            <li> He 63 and is always complaining that he looks old</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one week now, twice a day for about 6 minutes per application, and I was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my whole face with a vitamin c serum to get it deep into my pores...works well!</li>
            <li> The bags under my eyes are noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One unexpected perk, it also heals acne</li>
            <li> It is not going to tighten skin for someone who is young.</li>
            <li> Would not waste $100.00 ever again.</li>
            <li> And even if it did, the skin damage would far outweigh that temporary benefit.  </li>
            <li> I am 67 years old</li>
            <li> a Christian woman that absolutely dont want people to get cheated out of their money.</li>
            <li> People are always surprised to learn I am 67 years old.  </li>
            <li> However you do need to keep using it, maybe not as frequently</li>
            <li> I am 50 years old</li>
            <li> My personal opinion is that effectiveness of this product really depends on how your skin is built.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a difference except for looking slightly younger.</li>
            <li> and I can really see a big difference.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who accumulate fat on my face..even though I am not overweight (well maybe a tad) and only eat whole foods, no alcohol or junk food.</li>
            <li> I am very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> So far no results.  </li>
            <li> However I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say this product wouldn&#x27;t work on anyone.</li>
            <li> So far I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference</li>
            <li> I got busy and missed the 30 day return time frame</li>
            <li> 75 years old and taking the age and wrinkles off the neck and face.</li>
            <li> It took around 20 minutes to complete all of the suggested exercises.</li>
            <li> BUY DIRECTLY FROM DERMAWAND.  </li>
            <li> I called Dermawand to get it fixed</li>
            <li> Because I did not buy it directly from them they will not replace it.  </li>
            <li> They told me that they do not repair, they replace and since I did not buy directly from Dermawand there is no replacement.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I wake up and my skin is so soft</li>
            <li> The skin under my eyes has tightened up and the puffiness is almost completely gone.  </li>
            <li> So far it is not working as stated.</li>
            <li> I shall try to get some information from the Licensd Beauty  Professional.</li>
            <li> However, while Clairns really did help clear up what had always been mediocre skin and made it look nice, the clock DID continue to tick</li>
            <li> Used religiously twice a day for two months but didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> I use this to stop blemishes before they mature to the surface of the skin and it works.</li>
            <li> I will be 40 years old this month.  </li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and bought this product based on a dermatologist recommendation on The Dr. Oz Show.  </li>
            <li> If this thing really did what it says then Doctors that do cosmetic surgery and facial fillers would go out of business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 38 years old</li>
            <li> I was taking a picture and comparing it to my old style</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 years old, so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles from my Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li> I tried all kinds of creams and things about 15 years ago to deal with my droopy eyelids (REAL droopy), and finally gave in and had eyelid surgery on them.  </li>
            <li> let alone direct exposure to water.</li>
            <li> maybe it is to early...</li>
            <li> So far my face doesn&#x27;t react to it.</li>
            <li> The skin on my eyes had dropped so far that I was being looked at like a \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; everywhere</li>
            <li> told to contact derma wand directly.</li>
            <li> So far I have the wand for over a month</li>
            <li> I am a 62 old grandmother...</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was packaged professionally</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my -45 year old-</li>
            <li> The FREE S&amp;H was not free - I was charged $9.95 and they sent no invoice or instructional dvd with the product.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to see how far it will go to work on my skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using it in my late 40&#x27;s just to bring more circulation to my face.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised to see that it worked.</li>
            <li> Most of the negative reviews I have read seemed like people did not give it the time it takes for the collagen under the skin to be renewed.</li>
            <li> over a year, and one day realized that I looked old.  </li>
            <li> , Everyone wants instant results.....</li>
            <li> I have observe real tightening in the skin on my face when used regularly.</li>
            <li> Shortly after purchase, bulb broke, now the company wants $25 to replace.</li>
            <li> She said I looked all glommed up and young.</li>
            <li> my 70 year old aunt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am almost 42 years old and am just beginning to see the signs of aging on my face.</li>
            <li> The biggest difference I seen so far is the bags under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I also was complemented yesterday day on how I look young for my age.</li>
            <li> My skin can be sensitive.</li>
            <li> I just turned 46 yrs old.</li>
            <li> SO FAR I HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN FIRMING AND</li>
            <li> I am almost 60 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it at least twice a day, sometimes more.</li>
            <li> My face and neck feel so soft and have begun to look youthful.</li>
            <li> People remark when they learn how old I am</li>
            <li> Amazon.com recommends contacting them directly for warranty support - emailed them 7 times now and they have not bothered to respond.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month twice daily for 3 minutes each session as instructed and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.....</li>
            <li> I have since returned it for a refund...maybe 30 days isn&#x27;t enough to really show noticable changes and they should offer a 90 day trial instead.  </li>
            <li> Three months of use, twice a day is just not in my busy schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will keep it but am marginal on the results so far after about a month.</li>
            <li> Before I go in to the offer and what you receive and the cost, I just wanted to say that I am 49 years old.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old.</li>
            <li> Smoker prune lips are scarred and can&#x27;t be fixed by this.  </li>
            <li> So far I like it.</li>
            <li> Completely misleading.</li>
            <li> I am 34 year old no face lift</li>
            <li> but no results so far.  </li>
            <li> OLD AND FAMILY FRIENDS  </li>
            <li> takes time, but boy, it does get rid of wrinkles, and really smoothes the deep ones somewhat.  </li>
            <li> I look old and nothing changed.</li>
            <li> My daughters skin is actually smooth and she has had no more new bumps pop up.</li>
            <li> Due to the severity of these side effects, I have permanent staining on my arms from the blood not being absorbed fast enough.</li>
            <li> I thought that it was unlikely I would use it more than a couple time due to the many steps and convoluted instructions.  </li>
            <li> Also, it is small and easy to store.</li>
            <li> I use the wand directly on it and believe me when I say it either goes away completely or when the pimple does surface, it is small and goes away quickly!  </li>
            <li> We have filed complaints with their Customer Service, New York BBB, Corporate Headquarters and the Consumer Protection Division for the State of New York,</li>
            <li> Will continue to use for a few more weeks, if it get worse or I don&#x27;t get more positive results, I will chalk it up to my own stupidity and never purchase another so call age defying miracle again and learn to except my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I do not think it is strong enough to have the effect shown on the TV demo&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;age 64 with previous face lift</li>
            <li> If you want to know how it will feel, smell and work look up a local spa in your area that offers high frequency and go get a procedure done with the electrode.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re buying the Professional Grade Portable High Frequency D&#x27;arsonval Facial Device.  </li>
            <li> but really if I see no difference in the future it will be rated 2 stars (didn&#x27;t like it)and of course if it proves what is stated in the article it will get a hands down 5.  </li>
            <li> Time in particular, as the daily treatment takes a lot of time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to look younger, I just don&#x27;t want to look older than I feel.</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time the day before my husband and I went out for dinner and was shocked when I looked in the mirror and saw how good my skin looked...and yes it was just after one use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually one the main ingredients in their pre-face treatment anyway.</li>
            <li> So far I am out a non-refundable $14.95 processing fee &amp; should have no other charges.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to adapt to the smell, but the results proclaimed are true.</li>
            <li> highest setting except for right under the eyes which I go no higher with than a 4.</li>
            <li> You have to get use to the electric currents to your face (especially if you use it on high)</li>
            <li> I look much prettier and younger, and I think my facial skin overall is also much smoother.  </li>
            <li> I think you&#x27;ll like it, especially if your over 40 or 50 years old!!</li>
            <li> Only been using for about 2 weeks and every day I can see the old wrinkles vanishing before my eyes!!  </li>
            <li> (I have a very healthy diet) also, unfortunately I failed to take a &amp;#34;before photo&amp;#34; to show you.  </li>
            <li> Be careful NOT to use the bulb under your eyes on anything higher than a 1 or 2 level.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I took pictures from the first day onward to track any progression, but saw absolutely no results in wrinkles, or tightness.</li>
            <li> Significant change in the skin can only be accomplished at least by doubling or tripling its intensity.&lt;br /&gt;As</li>
            <li> They went ahead and sent me a new one but did not send back the accessories and informed me the Amazon site is not authorized site.</li>
            <li> I tried everything on the market and didnt anything that really made a difference for very long.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast</li>
            <li> The reviews before my purchase was 50/50 but decided the negative were most likely those expecting a miracle.</li>
            <li> Younger looking than all my children&#x27;s in-laws that are all younger in years than me, thanks to this</li>
            <li> Nothing unusual happened to it to suddenly cause it to suddenly break.</li>
            <li> I got a generic wand but don&#x27;t really like the attachments (fragile)</li>
            <li> Overall I think I will see better results as time goes by or at least I hope to.</li>
            <li> Really made me look younger, especially around the eyes.</li>
            <li> MY LAUGH LINES AND LINES AROUND MY EYES ARE MUCH LESS NOTICIABLE.  </li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, I really notice a difference in the texture and overall appearance of the face and neck.</li>
            <li> It is a great tool for reducing and eliminating wrinkles with no pain or negative secondary effects.&lt;br /&gt;Carlos</li>
            <li> I think people really need to give the Derma Wand enough time to see lasting results.</li>
            <li> I use many expensive beauty products  because my girl and I are photographed very close up on a weekly basis because of our job.</li>
            <li> I decided to go with my gut and follow the contours of my face and neck muscles, always with long, sweeping strokes up, and light down.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about the satisfaction I have with results I&#x27;ve seen so far!  </li>
            <li> Immediately I nearly stopped using it regularly and this continued for the next two weeks as my normal personality flaw had me grousing and making excuses not to use</li>
            <li> 24 hours later they were completely gone!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see as much effect, yet, on my face, but those areas were not as loose and wrinkled.  </li>
            <li> If I had paid much less for it, it would have gone right in the trash.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really tried other anti-aging products because I tend to have sensitive skin and did not want to break out.</li>
            <li> For little money, this is totally worth it.</li>
            <li> I HAD, not only the deep lines around my nose and mouth, but sagging skin at my jaw line, the beginnings of a &amp;#34;turkey&amp;#34; neck (thanks to the genes from my Other grandmother) and the skin on my decolletage was looking wrinkly,all now much improved, but,</li>
            <li> This is an advanced radio high frequency beauty teatment to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, puffy eyes, saggy, tired complexion and enlarged pores.  </li>
            <li> High frequency is done with electrodes; electrodes have a gas (such as neon) vacuum sealed in the glass electrode.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s about 4 weeks out, generally use it as directed morning and night.  </li>
            <li> The effectiveness of a cosmetic dermatology tool is also based on general skin health.</li>
            <li> Ihaven&#x27;t had it long enough to really know yet, people say that they see a difference in the depth of the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I stay up too late, work too many long hours and don&#x27;t always feel like doing this twice a day -</li>
            <li> At first the sound and feeling was scarey, but i&#x27;m getting use to it.</li>
            <li> Now if you&#x27;re really old and have a lot of wrinkles and look like your face is gonna fall off soon and want an instant miricle face lift...</li>
            <li> I have dealt with adult acne my entire life</li>
            <li> I will be 52 years old in 2 days, though I am told I look much younger..</li>
            <li> The scarring is barely visible now and she has not used it for a month.  </li>
            <li> Not kidding when I say they are barely there anymore.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully my reaction is temporary and I will eventually see similar results to what I get from my professional facials.    </li>
            <li> My old one finally died.  </li>
            <li> Any vegetable oil will actually work, I just prefer grapeseed because it naturally helps build collagen</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope that I see some results in the near future.</li>
            <li> my daughters was noticing the different I am 53 years old</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m big old mom</li>
            <li> so far i can see the results after only a week.</li>
            <li> After nearly three weeks of daily use, I can see no change.</li>
            <li> Two ladies had a bet on how old I was one lady guessed almost 20 years younger.</li>
            <li> &quot; she had to go through several offers on her screen.</li>
            <li> So, my card was charged a total of $18.37 in order to receive the Derma Wand and the Derma Vital skin care products.</li>
            <li> So far my card has only been charged the $18.37 as she stated it would be for the 30 Day trial period, paying just for the tax and shipping of the skin care products.</li>
            <li> For those hesitating because of the price, I would suggest adding up all the money you have already spent on serums, creams and lotions that haven&#x27;t worked very well, as I did.</li>
            <li> I used on facial scars that were years old the wand removed them.</li>
            <li> After using it your skin feels refreshed and alive, this is my second one</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully for six months, twice a day (with my own lotion - theirs is useless).</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, as I was about to use mine today, I dropped it and by my own fault broke the cap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the 3 weeks I noticed no improvements with any of my very fine lines or firming of the skin, my acne did not improve and my skin texture became worse as I now have tiny bumps that consume my face.</li>
            <li> I have only just starting using it, so the actual physical positive outcome of use has yet to be achieved.</li>
            <li> Even though it was obvious I live in Australia, You still sent me derma wand with American electric plug?/&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it takes 2 hours to do your whole face &amp; the results do not last very long at all.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> While the Derma Wand is must less powerful, I think using it on a daily basis makes up for that!</li>
            <li> I have done a quick pass and spent up to 20 minutes with no real difference in the look with the time difference.  </li>
            <li> The first half of the CD is on YouTube, Derma Wand, Start Here.</li>
            <li> But after talking to her I realized that sick is the new lingo for looking good.  </li>
            <li> I saw some visible results, not as much as some of the claims I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> really want to do every other day to see results</li>
            <li> Of course, I was hoping it would be more dramatic.</li>
            <li> I only used it on him 3 times last week and saw marked improvement.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 2 weeks now, and can already see a marked tightening of my facial skin.</li>
            <li> far as the Pre-Face treatment is concerned, I finally gave this one a 2nd try.</li>
            <li> My life took on an unexpected curve of events that would last for the next decade plus.  </li>
            <li> I am a 47 year old white female.</li>
            <li> Therefore, the skin will not dry out.</li>
            <li> This happened to me a little at first.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have major crows feet around my eyes yet, but have tiny lines there.</li>
            <li> Typically as women age, their facial muscles age (and begin to weaken) first.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed because I was hopeful this was going to be a great in-home wrinkle treatment for me.</li>
            <li> Seems like 50% of them are happy and the other 50% are unhappy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every morning (suppose to use it twice a day, but just can&#x27;t seem to find enough time to do this) it only says to use for three minutes but it takes a little longer than that because I feel I need to spend a little more time while I have it out.</li>
            <li> I will come back to review further, so far I do see some results in my face after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> and I could see, for the first time in my life, quite a few wrinkles on my under-eye area.</li>
            <li> While the pamphlet that comes with the derma wand did warn of the possibility of redness or broken capillaries, it never mentioned anything about skin possibly becoming oily and prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> The first Derma Wand we ordered arrived dead.  </li>
            <li> And the lotion that came with it was pretty dried out when I received the item.</li>
            <li> You do need to use it pretty much everyday.</li>
            <li> I also started using the Tua Viso Electronic Unit for Facial Gymnastics about 6 weeks ago, which I really like, too, but it is very time consuming, so I have cut down to every other day on that, but the derma wand just takes 5 minutes twice a day, and you are done.</li>
            <li> I thought I saw a little skin tightening at first, but then there were no further effects</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what kind of results I&#x27;m supposed to have in that time frame, so it is hard for me to say if it is working or not.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them for very long but so far I can tell some difference</li>
            <li> its working on my undereye dark circles too do not use more than 3-4 on that delicate area please...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight, but I noticed results, especially around my eyes and mouth, after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t expecting some immediate miracle cure and suddenly look like I was in my 20&#x27;s again upon my first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, only a few fine lines underneath my eyes, but I do have a bit of skin sagging here and there and lines running down on the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to make this large purchase because the commercials were so &#x27;gimcky&#x27;.</li>
            <li> This really works, this is my second purchase, because the first one I have got broken, it fell.</li>
            <li> For the first few months I used it regularly and definitely saw a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> However, I strongly suspect that the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pictures are fake, as I noticed no change in the appearance of my skin after nearly four weeks.</li>
            <li> Very cheap and quite cheesy.</li>
            <li> So, after two weeks, I decided that $99.00 was too much to pay for so little results.</li>
            <li> If It seems, myne gets to be a little old, I order one before the old one would die on me.</li>
            <li> I am buying from Australia, I would have appreciated knowing that I would need to spend an additional $100 buying a step down transformer in order to use the product here.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have very little as far as wrinkles go ( I recently had a car accident &amp; the officer called me in as early 30&#x27;s, whoot!</li>
            <li> Christine is always available to answer my emails and usually in a day or less.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s due, use it with the proper products, and have patience, you may just end up as addicted and in love as</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s due, use it with the proper products, and have patience, you may just end up as addicted and in love as</li>
            <li> The weight I lost was due to a busy schedule but after seeing that my face isn&#x27;t sagging after the loss I don&#x27;t feel the need to put it back on...</li>
            <li> People who&#x27;s skin is more wrinkled and aged looking might not achieve dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Dermawand is very durable and pretty tough to break and does deliver results!</li>
            <li> going to the gym every other day is a must for those wanting to stay young.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Recently a friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen it at least 15 years told me I looked exactly the same!</li>
            <li> for the wand itself, I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks, and I&#x27;m not sure if I can see any real difference yet, but I like the idea of being proactive about my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any changes, will report when enough time has gone by.</li>
            <li> i purchased the derma wand on-line and have been sadly disappointed with the results, the only thing that seems to do any good</li>
            <li> I do know yet how it will work, i have not used the dermwant for very long, i hope to see some difference in the short future.</li>
            <li> after 6 weeks I&#x27;m not sure how much difference it has made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to hurt as much as it did me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s used it long enough to see a difference in wrinkles yet though.</li>
            <li> I think the derma wand works but have not used the product long enough to notice any substantial result yet.</li>
            <li> I used it long enough to get any results.</li>
            <li> It now only works on the lowest setting, and who knows for how long.  </li>
            <li> I am waiting to see how long it will last.</li>
            <li> When I called dermawand to return their item on their 1 year warrenty apparently it is not valid even though  it was included in my shipment from them.</li>
            <li> long as I had the essential moisturizers on my skin while using the DermaWand,&lt;br /&gt;my skin would withstand the heat from the &amp;#34;light therapy&amp;#34; (which feels like&lt;</li>
            <li> In the long run, I think it will prevent further sagging and wrinkles and</li>
            <li> Maybe did not give it long enough.</li>
            <li> oh they just didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see the results</li>
            <li> I havent  had it long enough to tell.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the changes are not as drastic as they show in the advertisements nor are they long lasting</li>
            <li> Not a bad product, but maybe not a great one.</li>
            <li> I have 3 kids and after the 3rd baby, the skin on my stomach was left kinda loose.  </li>
            <li> The professional machines go down three layers so you get the maximum results.  </li>
            <li> no major results. .</li>
            <li> It was a fairly simple return; however it took a very long time to get my money returned to my acct.</li>
            <li> and it does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> it sure doesn&#x27;t have any bad effects so far.</li>
            <li> Only way I could correct the dry face issue was by exfoliating repeatedly for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I felt it only made my skin dry</li>
            <li> Then when I FINALLY found alleged customer service, they told me I was way outside of the time to return even though</li>
            <li> quick delivery, broken bottle inside.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the product for a few days, but haven&#x27;t had a single new outbreak.  </li>
            <li> Two on the other side are barely visible.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first with a new product</li>
            <li> using this product helps to tighten loose skin , especially that turkey neck , i don&#x27;t see it anymore, thank goodness</li>
            <li> Slight lifting of eye lids and notice my dark circles under my eyes are much lighter.  </li>
            <li> The electric action is not effective enough to actually penetrate your facial muscles and provide a temporary lift.</li>
            <li> the diffrence is subtle at first, but with continued use you can notice a drasic change.</li>
            <li> Only the first day there was slight reddening showing increased circulation but no rejuvenation, no lessening of small lines, jowls still hanging there.  </li>
            <li> The only thing you can look forward to after using this is a very very dry face.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my wrinkles, but I am getting a little used to using it..</li>
            <li> This will NOT cure you and solve your problems only create more wrinkles for stressing over why its not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with this company for the major misleading of this product and scamming on people.</li>
            <li> This may sound weird</li>
            <li> but it just made aging that much more depressing.  </li>
            <li> I use cocoa butter or coconut oil as the emollient for the wand to go smoothly over my face instead of the expensive creams that come with the wand.</li>
            <li> so if you&#x27;re prone to cold sores, make sure you don&#x27;t over use it and maybe ask your physician for an Rx for acyclovir.</li>
            <li> At least from my experience, it was an investment that has paid off very well.  </li>
            <li> I also NEVER run the wand from the outside of the bottom of my eye to the nose, always go the opposite direction (out and up) as heading towards the nose seemed to make my dark circles darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about that long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 Years Old with a few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Came with no DVD, the astringent was so old and dried out it wouldn&#x27;t work in their machine.</li>
            <li> Seriously, I really expected it to last longer than a couple months!</li>
            <li> A complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> It becomes something that you do faster with each time you use it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to take a long time at all</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long, but it already seems to be working.</li>
            <li> It was obviously returned by the packaging and there was even an empty plastic bag that was suppose to have face products I think.  </li>
            <li> How long am I supposed to use it in order to feel the sensation they say I am supposed to feel?  </li>
            <li> Their excuse - the \\&quot;backlog\\&quot; of complaints.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long..</li>
            <li> Using this product religiously but not a whole lot of changes.</li>
            <li> With the derma wand, it only addresses the surface of the skin so the results, if any, are minimal.  </li>
            <li> Added some microdermabrasion (at home because they even charge the staff at the surgeon&#x27;s office) and bingo, my acne is clearing and my skin is looking nicer than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> It took weeks for me to receive the product, but thy go based on when they allegedly sent the product, not when you actually receive it.</li>
            <li> Derma wand takes too long.</li>
            <li> I had read up on radio frequency and knew that even when the treatment were given by professionals that the initial results were only temporary and that permanent results didn&#x27;t usually occur until the 3rd month and sometimes even longer and sometimes required extra treatments</li>
            <li> but after much trouble with the Dermavital site thru Amazon I had to go to DermaWand directly.  </li>
            <li> It took me a few days before I could watch the instructional video, so I really have been using it less than 2 weeks, and it took a while to get it worked into my routine even once a day,</li>
            <li> Right now I am not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> I have not seen visible changes, but I confess I have been not consistent with daily treatment.</li>
            <li> I have been using oxygen products and I know different types of skin problems may appear as toxins start leaving the body due to oxygen purification.</li>
            <li> Directions say set a low levels due to getting used to the sensation of tingling.</li>
            <li> The negative reviews that complained their faces turned red even on the lowest setting is true, but it also states in the instruction booklet it might.</li>
            <li> I haven´t noticed any major changes with wrinkles,  but it is not magic, it has only been a month...</li>
            <li> I have only had it a little while, but it seems to give a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; to the brow area, so that eye shadow does not look creased (I am 50, and I have that crepy look to upper eyelid area that I cannot figure out how to get rid of).  </li>
            <li> had looked at other similar products...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember them being specific about any other &amp;#34;disorders&amp;#34; in the booklet.  </li>
            <li> My major concern are the lines on the side of my mouth and a little sagging that started on my jawline.  </li>
            <li> I returned a DermaWand due to its breaking after only 2 mos.</li>
            <li> It takes at least one month to clear up as the acne already formed under the skin not visible to the naked eye wont go away over night</li>
            <li> You can put on all the moisturizer in the world and you will still face an extremely dry face.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have dry spots on areas of my face.  </li>
            <li> I found my skin getting dry had to use a lot of face cream which I never did before.  </li>
            <li> but it makes mine have really dry places and scabs</li>
            <li> in one week there was a dramatic reduction in my smile lines.</li>
            <li> I read through the pamplet prior to using it, and did a few of the extra treatments that were suggested in the pamplet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the payment issues which seem to have plaqued everyone onntop of the disappointment of time spent hoping.</li>
            <li> Though only having used a few weeks, I notice a different in my skin tone, including the backs of my hands, lips, and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.  </li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical about purchasing the wand, but, what the heck, it only cost $100, worth the try.  </li>
            <li> I only use it a few minutes as per the instructions and only once a day and not every day.</li>
            <li> I do not live in the US and bought a derma wand</li>
            <li> It says it can take a few weeks before you see major results.</li>
            <li> The little crows feet lines are now barely visible.  </li>
            <li> However, my skin has broken out my whole life and it is pretty rare for me to get bad breakouts anymore.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I look ten years younger, but I certainly feel my face looks less tired and has a fresher look.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think wrinkles are less deep yet, but less noticeable to general improvement.</li>
            <li> There is not one single difference on my face.</li>
            <li> I have read every single comment @</li>
            <li> Like most of the reviews say, the products that come with it are less than worthless, but I saw results in about 3 days, so decided to keep it because I also read about the hassle of the return process and decided to return it and buy from Amazon, just wasn&#x27;t worth a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did however notice that my skin was starting to lift, but only for a few hours and a very little non noticeable lift only noticed because you could see tiny skin ripples by my ears.</li>
            <li> This is the same concept as the expensive radio frequency machines used by dermatologist, however, the frequency is so low that there is no comparison to the real deal.  </li>
            <li> Wrinkled forehead, crow&#x27;s feet, saggy upper eyelids, dark under eyes, beginnings of jowls, marionette lines and smoker lines around my lips.</li>
            <li> but so far cant tell the difference :/</li>
            <li> This is one of the least expensive ways to make your face and neck look younger, give you more confidence, and keep everyone guessing as to your age.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve smelled a lot worse, and that&#x27;s the way the electrical thing smells, whether through Dermawand or a much pricier cosmetic procedure!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it would work on someone with a lot of sagging and loose skin.</li>
            <li> I actually took down some of the photos from then.  </li>
            <li> but then it would not turn back down to a lower setting after I turned it to the highest setting</li>
            <li> I have read other reviews describing the smoothness achieved after using the Derma Wand, but I also note that the persons claiming those achievements also use other facial treatments (heaps of moisturizers, etc.)</li>
            <li> Her age spots were starting to fade slightly and her complexion was brighter over all.  </li>
            <li> Overall I think there is less sagginess to my face.  </li>
            <li> I am 49 and have small lines, jowls are starting, and eyelids are starting to droop, all family traits.  </li>
            <li> Not only has it improved the texture of my skin, but my eyelids are less droopy, my jowls almost gone and</li>
            <li> from previous reviews, a moisturizer was key.  </li>
            <li> You can buy a book for facial exercises that shows you how to use your fingertips to push up your eyebrows and get the same result if not better.</li>
            <li> This wand is helping circulate oxygen as evidenced by the smaller pores, less acne and helps the lymphatic system around the eyes drain.</li>
            <li> It definitely softened lines and I noticed my lip area lifted and my lips are slightly plumper.  </li>
            <li> I am using this wand less than recommended, only once in the AM and on a lower setting than I can be using, but I do see some difference after using it for 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> that would have been nice...but not realistic....</li>
            <li> &quot; My reasons are the same, that being that I believe you can get this device for less money than the device&#x27;s home site asks.</li>
            <li> Not sure about the billing just sent back last week.  </li>
            <li> It made my sikn very dry.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and next to impossible to return even with a \\&quot;free trial\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I had minimal wrinkles, but they were starting, among with a slight face sag in the jaw area.</li>
            <li> but if you keep using it for at least 4 weeks no new acne will form and your face will start to clear up....</li>
            <li> The DermaWand was forgotten to collect dust somewhere as I developed several serious health issues due to all the stress.  </li>
            <li> Current seems weak compared to my old one...</li>
            <li> Within a few days I could already see a slight change and after two months I look ten years younger!</li>
            <li> I was a very limited sun worshiper and never smoked.  </li>
            <li> It can burn you a little bit, but not if you pay CLOSE ATTENTION to the instructions, will check in later, after I have used it a couple months</li>
            <li> i was a little taken back by the reviews some people gave but thought if it did not work</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only out a little over a hundred.  </li>
            <li> I use coconut oil and add a little Frankenscence essential oil.</li>
            <li> I bought mine directly from Dermawand which I wouldn&#x27;t recomend as you can skip the HARD SELL here on amazon that the  Dermawand customer service has to push.</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on for a couple years now and when I&#x27;m not busy being a new &#x27;mom&#x27;, I try very hard to make it a part of my weekly skincare routine.  </li>
            <li> I will need to do some more research on the \\&quot;acne cosmetica\\&quot; and how the Derman Wand will work after a painful extraction (of course I will wait til I heal from the extraction before using the DM).</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product even though my friend&#x27;s face looked 20 yrs younger than her real age.  </li>
            <li> I do not own this product but when I used to frequent the spa(before</li>
            <li> finding the time to use it at least twice a day is more difficult than I thought</li>
            <li> My aged face is making progress</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will continue using it, and I only used it a few weeks</li>
            <li> I, too, have had a few pimples, and my skin seems oilier, but it possibly can have something to do with the face products I use.</li>
            <li> It is convenient, only taking a few minutes in the morning and at night.  </li>
            <li> It is just as I expected and started at the lowest number to get used to.  </li>
            <li> It did wonders for the scarring, but not much for the wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a few days, my daughter, who hadn&#x27;t seen me in about 3 days, said I looked younger.</li>
            <li> my big problem area is heavy eyelids.</li>
            <li> Did not come with the pink bag or any bag.</li>
            <li> Not happy with their very deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks</li>
            <li> Be careful or you will get a returned Derma Wand like I got.  </li>
            <li> but I think I&#x27;d have to use this 30 minutes a day every day to see any remote finding.</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for a few months..</li>
            <li> everything was wet, instruction couldn&#x27;t be read.</li>
            <li> I see instant results now after using just a few minutes of this.</li>
            <li> I see instant results now after using just a few minutes of this.</li>
            <li> Please be careful if you want to buy one of these</li>
            <li> I have spent hundred of dollars on products and gadgets until I read about the Derma Wand online.  </li>
            <li> Never really take the time to use it...</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product and definitely do not trust this company.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t waste my money on a second one to try again.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I could only afford to go a few times a year.  </li>
            <li> I am 45 and my skin is not very wrinkled to begin with.</li>
            <li> I must of aged 25 years overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has only been a few weeks</li>
            <li> THE ONE THING I AM CURIOUS AND</li>
            <li> JUST CURIOUS.  </li>
            <li> I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and this product has aged me about 10 years.  </li>
            <li> The compliments have begun just within a few short weeks of using this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks</li>
            <li> I used it faithfully for 2 months and noticed nothing big waste of money</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or especially your money!</li>
            <li> I know it works when used (regularly or not so much).</li>
            <li> so I just went back to using it again and the &#x27;glow&#x27; slowly came back.</li>
            <li> I think the lines above my lips are slowly softening cand that was the key reason I bought it.</li>
            <li> I have a residual scar and loose skin from the swelling of my neck due to an inflamed thyroid which was removed in 2011.</li>
            <li> Here is why,   D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct is less expensive than Derma Wand but</li>
            <li> The down time is just too long, i gave up.   </li>
            <li> I am now starting to see some improvement with the expression lines running from my nose to mouth and the slight folds are tightening up and smoothing out too!</li>
            <li> And by young I mean someone without aged (beginning to sag) skin.</li>
            <li> reviews\\&quot; I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that I&#x27;ve wasted my money on another product that just plain doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> The furrow between my brows is less noticeable, but the lite creasing or wrinkles under the eyes are now more defined and noticeable, have to say that made me very angry.</li>
            <li> Due to a family emergency, I haven&#x27;t been faithful with twice a day, yet, my laugh lines have noticeably decreased and even disappeared in areas!</li>
            <li> I am looking forward to seeing the long term results with the hope of saving me addition money and down time from other procedures.  </li>
            <li> it does exactly what it says it does - my pores are looking smaller and the lines around my nose/grin lines are slowly disappearing!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derma Wand for a few days and as skeptical as I was at first, I do see it making my pores smaller, smoother skin texture,and firmness and</li>
            <li> but let me tell you, since using this to zap my cold sores at first tingle, I have only had one that materialized.  </li>
            <li> So I pulled out the Derma Wand and have used it nearly every day for the past few months.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but it was money well spent</li>
            <li> Under my eyes were enormously puffy and it took a few days for the swelling to go down.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am sensitive to radio waves and it caused a slight dull headache after use</li>
            <li> And finally, my eyelids, which were rather droopy, look less heavy, and the puffiness under my eyes has lessened.</li>
            <li> Prior to the use of the Derma Wand I was getting at least one bump every single day.  </li>
            <li> I was just comparing pictures the other day</li>
            <li> I tried other products in the market</li>
            <li> Other than the fact that it broke</li>
            <li> It also works on other parts of the body like your stomach for women who have had children.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try every other day and see what happens.</li>
            <li> I have had to realize no cream or any other product that can be used at home</li>
            <li> Broke after only a few uses!</li>
            <li> breakouts other reviewers complain about did not scare me.</li>
            <li> The product works as long as you keep using it everyday....</li>
            <li> Not worth the money spent.</li>
            <li> After all, part of the advertising for this product is that it works well on other areas of the body as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small investment for potentially what you may get.</li>
            <li> The other eye lid is extremely droopy and don&#x27;t know that anything will work on it other than surgery.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, follow the instructions!</li>
            <li> If you are not consistent, you will not see results.</li>
            <li> and it proceeded to burn and the zapping was extremely unbearable</li>
            <li> Other areas are improving also.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed, more at myself for believing, then in anything else.</li>
            <li> [...] I also read other comments in Amazon.com reviews of Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> and therefore the wrinkles seemed even more noticable :(  </li>
            <li> This past Christmas one of my relatives was amazed at how I look 10 years younger!</li>
            <li> I agree with one other poster who said, \\&quot;Do not buy it from DermaWand.\\</li>
            <li> What a drag!  </li>
            <li> I had a small problem and they could not do enough to help.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s youthful glow due to entering peri-menopause.</li>
            <li> I did notice small improvements after two weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey for such small results...</li>
            <li> I have tried 2  other  skin care systems..</li>
            <li> OTHER PRODUCTS YOU CAN USE WITH THIS</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t been religious about using my Derma Wand over the past 15 years.....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have bad wrinkles, but it needs to help a little more.</li>
            <li> If their commercial advertisement is true and it gives your skin O3, OZONE, instead of O2 regular oxygen gas, these people obviously have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about, and what horrible product they have created.</li>
            <li> Not noticing any anti-aging results yet in that short of a time, I was at least noticing an improvement in my complexion to encourage me to try harder to get the evening use routine started.</li>
            <li> Same sensation, same pain behind the eyes.</li>
            <li> I have bought so many products over the years just to be let down and disappointed but this wand works for me.    </li>
            <li> Sorry I could not say anything positive....</li>
            <li> I am learning how to improve the pores, it even helps with a odd acne condition I have, where these white small bumps \\&quot;acne cosmetica\\&quot; is lessened.</li>
            <li> I noticed however that other reviewers reported similar experiences, so at least I&#x27;m not alone.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked at how quickly I saw results!  </li>
            <li> but I use it up to 15 on highest setting concentrating on large pores around nose and any random breakouts.</li>
            <li> but i couldn&#x27;t find any info on that claim or maybe i didn&#x27;t look hard enough.</li>
            <li> Now it hardly even gets red and it fades almost immediately.</li>
            <li> and I suspect the light might do as much as the little shocking aspect,  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and was really hoping to see results but unfortunate</li>
            <li> Simply not worth the time to me.</li>
            <li> At least 5 times a week, 15 minutes daily I faithfully use it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> and I got the 3 lines on my forehead and the crows feet on the corner of my eyes as well as dark rings and wrinkles under the eyes.</li>
            <li> Still have wrinkles and dark spots did nothing.</li>
            <li> We brush our teeth and wash our faces at least once a day, why would this be any different.  </li>
            <li> not worth bothering with.</li>
            <li> I have seen some negative reviews about being charged for extra things.</li>
            <li> This product came broken without complete instructions.  </li>
            <li> I used this product for a few months with absolutely no signs of a difference.</li>
            <li> Still looking old and tired but recovering.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s already breaking down.  </li>
            <li> THE BAGS UNDER MY EYES ARE GOING DOWN.  </li>
            <li> they have never let me down.</li>
            <li> Here are my reasons: it helps break down the bacteria in acne, it does increase collagen on my skin, it does tighten the pores and creates a toned and uplifted look.</li>
            <li> The puffiness around my eyes have gone down</li>
            <li> The circles around my eyes have gone down.</li>
            <li> Other than that, if I used this around my face and accidentally lift  the wand a little, I feel that zap feeling</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything from Perricone (expensive and disappointed), to Murad (pricey, some results) to Meaningful Beauty, LIghtstim (too passive), Flexaway (too sensitive gag reflex, hard for me to do everyday, but works), facial exercises (works</li>
            <li> Owned mine less than 30 days bumped the tip and bulb broke.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works although the effects are subtle and take some time to be noticeable.  </li>
            <li> I have already noticed less puffiness around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> The lines around my mouth are less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> My skin is tighter, I get less than a quarter of the acne.</li>
            <li> I did notice a slight change around the corners of my mouth and lips.</li>
            <li> Just to add more I had deep  creases between my eyes along with the jowl lines around my mouth that I just hated!!!  </li>
            <li> I tried it in LESS than 30 days &amp; call to return it.  </li>
            <li> Have noticed my skin does appear smoother and a slight lift in my one eyelid.</li>
            <li> I definitely would give it a go&amp;#34; if you are serious about diminishing lines on your face.</li>
            <li> Purchased 9/7/2014 in less the two months the wand does not turn on anymore.  </li>
            <li> , i even masage for half our and did not get rid of acne at all,,maybe</li>
            <li> My forehead lines are almost gone, my under eye area has improved an my face sag has slightly improved.  </li>
            <li> The bags and puffiness around my eyes are much less.</li>
            <li> Now, people are beginning to look less threatened when I walk into a room.  </li>
            <li> Looked like item was repackaged from previous sale</li>
            <li> Please put Derma Wand in subject line</li>
            <li> After using it over a month, one to two times a day, my wrinkles are definitely less severe (I&#x27;m 55).</li>
            <li> It appears less \\&quot;saggy\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The DermaWand products are not good, not worth the extra $90!</li>
            <li> However, I developed a stye on one of my eyes and cold sores on my lips within two weeks of starting treatments.</li>
            <li> This unit is replacement the previous one fell and the tip broke.</li>
            <li> I felt my skin getting loose and saggy, but have very few wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I know a bunch of people hate the idea of plastic surgery, but sometimes that&#x27;s the only way to deal with pretty extreme issues.  </li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks,so it is really not fair for me to give it a star rating.  </li>
            <li> This is a rip off that is not true what they say on this video</li>
            <li> Skeptically purchased the DermaWand and have never been happier as I have already been absolutely ASTONISHED at the results from just a few days useage!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether my unit was not clean</li>
            <li> or reading, as it can get pretty boring, and I think the 5 minutes suggested by the manual probably won&#x27;t have nearly as much effect as 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I would suggest not wasting your money or time on this little gizmo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the other people that reviewed this item were paid to do so or if the reviews are \\&quot;planted\\&quot;</li>
            <li> so I guess I was looking for a little help.</li>
            <li> I have these little rocks that keep surfacing on my face.</li>
            <li> and I like a little bit at night anyway.</li>
            <li> I have had mine for about 6 years and it is starting to get weak as they do.  </li>
            <li> I had hoped for a little change at least&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
            <li> See a little improvements</li>
            <li> It does take a little to get used to</li>
            <li> I find that it is a little beneficial around the eyes but not the rest of the face and neck.</li>
            <li> I will say this though, it will help you A LITTLE BIT.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the Derma Wand that counts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little booklet says do this 5 minutes a day.</li>
            <li> It does seem to help with acne a little too.</li>
            <li> This little wand works.</li>
            <li> The highest setting (9) was the only setting that worked so weakly as if it was setting 1.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dermawand for little over a month now</li>
            <li> you give this little machine</li>
            <li> you give this little machine</li>
            <li> I was not very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> BIG waste of money!!!.</li>
            <li> Just have to be careful not to drop it on hard surface</li>
            <li> been using for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and I don&#x27;t see any results at all.</li>
            <li> A waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> So I had it for a few weeeks, I have not seen majo improvement or I</li>
            <li> My mom got me the Derma Wand a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> As I said before, I do believe that some reviews are a sham.  </li>
            <li> It had lotion on the bulb end and the cap was missing.</li>
            <li> I used it a few  times and now it sits in my bathroom cabinet where it has been for months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had blemishes,scars and uneven skin tone....</li>
            <li> I used it everyday for 30 days</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and  money this has been.</li>
            <li> Mom used this everyday for 3 months and didn&#x27;t see a difference ...</li>
            <li> I will update in a few weeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am sold on this product and will continue to use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> BUYERS BEWARE!!!It is a waste of your money</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> In watching the silly commercial back now...I see at least one womans &amp;#34; after &amp;#34;  pic, is not even a photograph,  </li>
            <li> It appears another client, same deal with sketch or poorly altered photo.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> I have seen the difference in my skin in just a few weeks</li>
            <li> Have been using the wand for a few weeks now</li>
            <li> You do have to use it awhile (a few weeks) before you begin to notice, but it does work.  </li>
            <li> I called the help line and was told to use it for longer period of time on my trouble spots and that didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> I feel like I wasted my money in buying this product.</li>
            <li> I know it stated this is used round the world for trreatments, but who goes to the spa for $100 treatment twice a day as this is recommending to use.  </li>
            <li> It was missing all the products that were to come with the unit.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.  </li>
            <li> Used this product everyday .</li>
            <li> For my face, they were a waste.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> give you the effect of lifting but is temporary,, it did nothing on my acne,,, not recomended, wasted of money</li>
            <li> Within just a few days the lines were disappearing, and now after three weeks they are reduced, I would say, about 60%.  </li>
            <li> I returned this product after using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> since I&#x27;ve started using the Derma Wand 3 days ago all of these items have decreased 50% in only 3 days!</li>
            <li> I e-mailed the creator of the wand to ask a few questions and</li>
            <li> It did not work and parts were missing.</li>
            <li> This is a waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> it should not have stopped working just because I had (with care) stored it away in a drawer for a few months.</li>
            <li> I received my Derma Wand a few days ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it, almost everyday, for about 5 weeks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; gadgets.</li>
            <li> I wasted my money on this product.</li>
            <li> A few years ago my skin lost</li>
            <li> i wasted my money</li>
            <li> With a broken heart and dreams that died back in 2006 I lost all sight of caring about myself.  </li>
            <li> I found that DermaWand a few months ago cleaning out closets.</li>
            <li> And it makes my skin itch, splotch and burn if I use it everyday, or if I do not wash it off after using it.  </li>
            <li> It worked for four months and is now dead.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> I do not always use it twice a day or everyday</li>
            <li> I have had the derma wand for a few weeks now and will continue to use for a while longer, if still no results will stop</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I think I may have wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> I use it everyday</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> It explains little, it is vague and it left me searching for other answers.</li>
            <li> I try to at least use mine every other day.</li>
            <li> I would say that a person who needs extreme correction would do well to just save her money and get at least a mini-facelift.  </li>
            <li> I doubt there&#x27;s going to be a dramatic &amp;#34;face lift&amp;#34; here.... The technology is spot on but not strong enough.</li>
            <li> and although I can see a bit of a lift with my eyes, I do not get the dramatic effect the models get on the commercial.</li>
            <li> as they claim, why only a 30 day warranty?&lt;br /&gt;The astringent I believe is what gives minor results to desperate people.</li>
            <li> I can see a very slight improvement but, not what I was hoping for.  </li>
            <li> brow furrows are lessened, I can see more of my eyelid between lash &amp; crease, my crow&#x27;s feet (including a horrible vertical line from side sleeping running down my cheek) are fainter.  </li>
            <li> brow furrows are lessened, I can see more of my eyelid between lash &amp; crease, my crow&#x27;s feet (including a horrible vertical line from side sleeping running down my cheek) are fainter.  </li>
            <li> No more little lines and fissures</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a number of serums, creams and lotions that claim to firm the skin, and have seen really very little effect.  </li>
            <li> I woke up and my eyes had dropped an extra half an inch again and made me start to look scary again.  </li>
            <li> Plus the pre-treatment serum was half empty and the pump was broken.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 16 with pretty bad acne that has been seen by a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> I have reserved a star because its a plug-in product and usually these electrical devices have a way of shorting out after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> This product is not very effective.</li>
            <li> If you experiencing dry skin after using derma wand, apply a thin layer of vitamin a with e oil by Derma e before the treatment.</li>
            <li> Total and complete crap......</li>
            <li> Temporarily raises the eyebrow very little.</li>
            <li> Not sure if the wiring became defective.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if its working.  </li>
            <li> I bought it cause I started to notice some small wrinkles and sagging on my face.</li>
            <li> ALREADY 80% GONE IN JUST A FEW WEEKS !</li>
            <li> and I can see a small improvement in my skin texture and lines.</li>
            <li> BTW - not sure how to rate this item, yet,</li>
            <li> I like it but need to remember to keep using it everyday!</li>
            <li> small machine head...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m like a anti-aging junkie and did a ton of research of inexpensive ways to get the same results as having injections/fillers or expensive trips to the salon.  </li>
            <li> I have never tried any type of products in the past for this procedure..</li>
            <li> so I am anxiously awaiting for those &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; results.. eye brow lift, etc.  </li>
            <li> I see no changes even with small wrinkles after a couple months of treatment.  </li>
            <li> After close examination I discovered that all this does is apply a small electrical shock to your skin.</li>
            <li> Please dont waste your money!  </li>
            <li> But it stays red like a lite sunburn, some said their face broke out, unfortunately mine did as well.</li>
            <li> and I had to waist unbelievable amount of time on a phone with the customer service.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this works.</li>
            <li> not sure why)</li>
            <li> I am not sure it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not sure whether the treatment will long-term.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if its going to work for me.</li>
            <li> A small card or poster to put by your mirror to start would help.  </li>
            <li> You can adjust the current, so you aren&#x27;t too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The skin under my chin has tightened up with no more sag.  </li>
            <li> i believe this will save me a lot of money on all sorts of creams and potions that I waste money on because I see no results then just stop using it!</li>
            <li> The faint lines between my brows are faded, and I have no crows feet or facial</li>
            <li> The changes I´ve noticed for this past month has been in the texture and brightness of my skin.</li>
            <li> Not totally sure if it works.</li>
            <li> In the past I have had Thermage, and Pelleve treatments with favorable results.</li>
            <li> Been using this now for the past two months and can see a diiference.  </li>
            <li> I have not told anyone I&#x27;m using it for the past 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sure...</li>
            <li> not sure what it would be.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of stress these past years and this device may have saved my skin.  </li>
            <li> and supposedly I was past the allowable time to return it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what this does to your skin</li>
            <li> Around 2004 (not sure on date) but definately before 2005.  </li>
            <li> Usually twice per day for around 10 minutes in the morning and 25 or so at night.  </li>
            <li> they look like small varicose veins)</li>
            <li> So it really does work on my face, but does anyone know why it&#x27;s making me sick?</li>
            <li> think it is expensive but if it lasts a long time and works</li>
            <li> It started out twice a day, but lately I&#x27;m getting lazy with it, and skipping using it.  </li>
            <li> (It is scary how long my aging face seemed to be becoming!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (It is scary how long my aging face seemed to be becoming!)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very disappointingly, when back to my regular routine, the unit was still giving me painful shocks instead of the level I had been getting for the past week at the same settings.</li>
            <li> I like to think that the wand is working, but it&#x27;s hard to know whether it is or is not my imagination.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to notice the changes in your skin because you look at yourself every day.</li>
            <li> etc., which hardly ever works.</li>
            <li> I noticed that when I stopped using derma wand for a while, my skin looked dull</li>
            <li> Divorce hit hard.</li>
            <li> I think this works, it&#x27;s hard to postively say.</li>
            <li> Hard to tell whether it&#x27;s working or not.  </li>
            <li> I am not an expert, so hard to say.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect miracles but just a little something!!</li>
            <li> I bought my Derma Wand kit a little over a month ago and what a difference!!  </li>
            <li> So disappointed that all I got in return for the high price was damaged skin and aggrivation.</li>
            <li> I am in my late 50s.  </li>
            <li> my complex is</li>
            <li> I would give it no stars, but I had to choose at least 1.</li>
            <li> The instruction book is confusing.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for at least some improvement.</li>
            <li> it actually gets ride of cold sores too....  </li>
            <li> Always with anything, use moderation, common sense and read the instructions as well as safety precautions.</li>
            <li> but I was 4 days late.</li>
            <li> I wondered if there was something about my hair being wet that increased the conductivity, though I felt this was unlikely since there were no warnings about anything at all causing a change in performance.</li>
            <li> but as I age, I am committing to using it every day at least once a day and perhaps try in the AM and at bedtime.  </li>
            <li> You have to be patient and use it at least twice a day to begin with, faithfully.</li>
            <li> but it was such a disappointment like others is just a scam it don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The lines around my mouth are at least 50% reduced</li>
            <li> The lines around my mouth are at least 50% reduced</li>
            <li> But I was getting a bit desperate as jowls were suddenly emerging and a jaw line disappearing</li>
            <li> It works at least for me .</li>
            <li> My wife loves her Christmas gift, after a slow start she is now using twice a day and sees the wrinkles fading, and loves the face message.</li>
            <li> The results are slow, but after having used this for about 6 weeks, noticed an improvement in my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product but very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I think this wand does do some something for the skin, altho it does it slowly.  </li>
            <li> I wear very little if any make-up too!</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> No more crows feet!</li>
            <li> Do not expect dramatic or miraculous changes to your face after a few treatments.</li>
            <li> Beginning with a serious illness that almost killed me in 2005 and continuing with the sudden and tragic death of my mother in 2006</li>
            <li> I still lift them a bit, but now I can relax without being afraid I look angry and very, very old.  </li>
            <li> I am very anxious to try it out.  </li>
            <li> I convinced my sister to buy it and the result is very small on her.</li>
            <li> I just watched the commercial and its ridiculous!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously, radio frequency?  </li>
            <li> and I already notice a subtle change in the tightness of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I saw my sister and even though I was seeing subtle changes in pictures, she noticed nothing</li>
            <li> Well, despite the bad reviews about dealing with the co. - can&#x27;t say about that, b/c I didn&#x27;t return it - but to comment on the actual product?</li>
            <li> I know it says to use this product for 6 weeks to see improvement especially if you do not have bad wrinkles or saggy skin, but</li>
            <li> I dont like to give low rate or bad review, but i dont wanna lie either.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not good with routine.</li>
            <li> So they end up pilling up and then require extraction which in my personal experience has been painful and costly and they just return again.</li>
            <li> No good doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Just started using so not fair of me to give a completed rating</li>
            <li> The products that come with the derma wand are not good.</li>
            <li> I have around my eyes as I have been unable to find any cream that does anything to get rid of them, so they have been a waste of money in my opinion</li>
            <li> I agree that the PreFace is not a good product.</li>
            <li> but stupid is as stupid does so mostly my fault for believing stupidness...</li>
            <li> It may even have worked if it wasn&#x27;t such a shoddy crap</li>
            <li> I tried it exactly as directed and the sensation was horrible.</li>
            <li> She had one but was getting weak after a year usage.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Lastly as soon as it touches my fact it stinks!  </li>
            <li> That and the neck lines and those are very very hard to change.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product!!  </li>
            <li> I realized that I was stupid for buying a product for $100 thinking it will cure all my facial problems.</li>
            <li> Very overpriced customer service is terrible.</li>
            <li> It does brighten up tired looking eyes.</li>
            <li> My skepticism was unnecessary.</li>
            <li> I use aquaphor (behind the counter at the pharmacy).</li>
            <li> I had to stop as I felt like this product was making my skin texture worse</li>
            <li> The steps were complicated and confusing.  </li>
            <li> that in of itself will dehydrate the skin can cause it to look even worse.</li>
            <li> I have been looking into Ultherapy but not happy with the expense.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully morning and evening per the dvd for weeks and did not notice any difference; in fact I thought I looked worse, so I gave up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the derma wand now for approximately six weeks.</li>
            <li> things I&#x27;m not happy about are the skin care products and the SURPRISE charges they did on my credit card.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy about this.</li>
            <li> It has poor quality.</li>
            <li> and I do not see any difference after using the DermaWand twice a day for approximately 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> but, alas, nothing.</li>
            <li> Made the wrinkles worse.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work my skin looks worse after using this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all with product</li>
            <li> I took before pictures it looks worse.</li>
            <li> I was really broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m addicted to the Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m addicted to the Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li> It said if you have ANY skin disorders like broken capillaries,</li>
            <li> It burns and it made my wrinkles under my eyes and around my mouth worse.</li>
            <li> That tells me the company is poorly managed.</li>
            <li> Even if this is a mistake, then the creators dont have any clue what chemistry is, how stupid theyve made themselves look, and how obvious it is that this product is crap and there is no real science behind it anyways.</li>
            <li> Too bad, as the product works, but not worth the headache in dealing with the Amazon site or DermaWand company.</li>
            <li> Have been using it with not much results,:(</li>
            <li> For me, the result isn&#x27;t as dramatic as his.</li>
            <li> so this might be why the change was so dramatic  on me.</li>
            <li> They said continue using the treatment, spots should be lightened after being darken, but sorry, my skin became so ugly with no positive results.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste YOUR HARD EARN MONEY!!!!</li>
            <li> If you suffer with cold sores you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> The creams/lotions/internal meds used to treat it are harsh, and in the case of Accutane, very dangerous.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately after a year the product stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Dont get me wrong</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a terrible feeling when you are 42 to have very big cystic acne!  </li>
            <li> maybe ill e-mail them one day and see if they tell me anything about that.</li>
            <li> It was scary.</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it does work, and i dont even use it every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was extremely difficult to return the product</li>
            <li> Do NOT order this product from Derma Wand, you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> Not happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had weird puffiness under my eyes for a while now.  </li>
            <li> Given the cost of the unit itself, I thought that this was a cheesy way of handling customer complaints.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;These wands are relatively expensive  and in my opinion they should have a life span longer than that of a child&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li> Well the CD was broken when I got it!..</li>
            <li> I felt the zapping feeling to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They provide skin creams that make up for the dehydration, but the wand which you pay $200 for is useless.  </li>
            <li> I was unable to use it twice a day as recommended but did use it diligently every night.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to say, but I won&#x27;t be buying products like this through Amazon again.</li>
            <li> Sorry to say ladies, no noticeable difference what so ever.</li>
            <li> Problem is that it has a wrong plug for Finland - need to go and find an adapter somewhere.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the Dermawand - however -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve considered for years what to do about my saggy eyebrows:  if I don&#x27;t intentionally hold them up, I look angry.  </li>
            <li> I thought about some cosmetic procedure, but I knew any of those would be way too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but I have a pacemaker, and cannot use as it could kill me.</li>
            <li> Well needless to say she scared me.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m lousy about sticking with and takes forever..</li>
            <li> Their products are too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Sorry to say.  </li>
            <li> Seriously, I don&#x27;t want to be without this for even a day!!  </li>
            <li> I had a small cyst on my neck that I hated.</li>
            <li> I have never been one to use expensive products on my face and always very skeptical of products like this</li>
            <li> at least!!!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made me break out really badly.  </li>
            <li> They hurts like crazy and each one lasts for weeks.  </li>
            <li> I cover all my skin in rows (like cutting grass with a lawn mower) leaving no area untreated (except tender eye-lids.)  </li>
            <li> It has been inconvenient to use as I don&#x27;t want to take the  time.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically to treat my cold sores as recommended by a friend.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid to even keep using it at this point.</li>
            <li> But others online insisted that it worked on their acne, and I was desperate, so I tried it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been leary of plastic surgery and the thought of someone cutting on my face terrifies me.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;instructional video&amp;#34; put out by the company stinks.  </li>
            <li> To my disappointment, there was no difference.</li>
            <li> I admit that I find the results disappointing.</li>
            <li> It dried up my face very nasty...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she went crazy when she got it</li>
            <li> the sparks zap on you like crazy, even into your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Derma Wand STINKS.</li>
            <li> But in reality it just stinks.</li>
            <li> needless to say i wasn&#x27;t gonna use it!</li>
            <li> I found it unpleasant</li>
            <li> Rude &amp; horrible!!!!!</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> Are you serious?!!!</li>
            <li> There is an odor of ozone, it isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Bad information and direction.</li>
            <li> My bad choice.</li>
            <li> Too bad, they have pictures on the box of people who look like the derma wand worked miracles.</li>
            <li> I never take it off because my face sags so badly.</li>
            <li> I had read a couple of bad reviews and thought</li>
            <li> It caused terrible pain behind my eyes.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked.</li>
            <li> But disappointed in the strength of this one...</li>
            <li> improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am disappointed with the Derma Wand.  </li>
            <li> I am disappointed.  </li>
            <li> what a bummer :(</li>
            <li> this product is just a knock off of the real expensive wands that they use in the spas.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this item.</li>

            <li> This product is worthless to me.</li>

            <li> ) difference in these jowls that have added 10 years and that I hate.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> been using for a few months. I can definitely see results. I&#x27;m in my mid forties and honestly look better than when I was 28. I was just comparing pictures the other day Wow! I will definitely will use the dermawand for the rest of my life. I also use a nubrilliance microderm and love this stuff called BABYFACE Hyaluric Acid that I get on ebay for about $15. going to the gym every other day is a must for those wanting to stay young. When I tell people my age they are in disbelief  I have to actually show them my I.D.</li>
            <li> Use it often and you&#x27;ll see great results !</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this on Amazon! I bought one years ago on TV , loved it . I accidentally dropped it and stepped on the bulb and broke it . Now I found out it can be replaced . About the product : it works! It works wonders ! It is already starting to lift the sagging areas of my face . Before when I had one , people kept commenting on how my face looked younger . I highly recommend it ! It arrived much faster than I anticipated,  as well. 👍 + 5 stars !!</li>
            <li> At 63 I started using my Dermawand religiously.  That and a good moisturizer (cocoa butter) have made a huge difference in the anticipated neck &amp;#34;throttle&amp;#34; I antiipated developing in my neck area based on what I saw  in my older cousins and aunts.  I think I use it better after watching some youtube videos of how other people were using it.  This did more for me than watching the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently a friend whom I hadn&#x27;t seen it at least 15 years told me I looked exactly the same!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks, but it does seem like its doing something--not sure what yet!!!</li>
            <li> I First saw this derma wand on the FOX Channel. Carol Ault was demonstrating it...she was 50/50 on what she thought.She had some skin issue that she had cleared up with the derma wand. But she wasn&#x27;t convinced it would help with wrinkles as they claimed. She said it paid for itself as far as her skin condition. So I bought one and I really like it...I used it daily for awhile..but as someone else claimed it&#x27;s time consuming to do daily, especially 2 &#x27; s a day.I had a small cyst on my neck that I hated. I used the derma wand on it and over some weeks it disappeared!  Never used their creams they seemed cheap. It&#x27;s worth the money!</li>
            <li> I would suggest not wasting your money or time on this little gizmo. Very cheap and quite cheesy. I sent it back asap.</li>
            <li> I have been using my derma wand twice a day for six weeks now and see a nice difference in my fine lines and pore size. Will continue to use this as part of my grooming routine.</li>
            <li> I used it just like the Instructions said. Did nothing at all showed no improvement  on any part of my face or neck</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now, and I don&#x27;t see any results at all. it is said that more you use the Derma Wand, the better it works. So I&#x27;ve been using it intensively, according to the instructions booklet and DVD that was supplied with it, and even more than that. I am 44, and I am blessed with great skin. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, only a few fine lines underneath my eyes, but I do have a bit of skin sagging here and there and lines running down on the sides of my mouth. Derma Wand claims it can deal with both the sagging and the lines around the mouth. Well, it didn&#x27;t make the slightest difference, even after months of intensive use. I have read other reviews describing the smoothness achieved after using the Derma Wand, but I also note that the persons claiming those achievements also use other facial treatments (heaps of moisturizers, etc.) My face feels smooth and looks radiant too, but I cannot claim it is because of the Derma Wand. It is so as a result of my daily treatment with Olay Regenerist, and Elite Serum around the eyes. I have not seen any improvement in my skin appearance since using Derma Wand. I have not returned it within 30 days, as I thought I should give it more time to see the results, but I would not recommend it to anyone. A waste of time and money. Time in particular, as the daily treatment takes a lot of time. Going through the entire procedure that is recommended does not take only 2-3 minutes as it is claimed. It takes much longer if you want to do it right, and you have to do it twice a day. How many women can afford it?</li>
            <li> Would not recommend this product. After reviews (most of the negative) save your money &amp; get juvaderm injections or somethin.</li>
            <li> This should be called the magic wand instead, it is fantastic, after a couple of months you can see the difference - this is a product that you cannot live without it because it really helps, your face looks radiant and you notice that the wrinkles specially around the eyes get smoother every time.</li>
            <li> So I had it for a few weeeks, I have not seen majo improvement or I dont know if I notice any improvement yet. I have been using it once a day. I got to say that it does help with zits. If I see a zit I use the wand on it will help reduce redness.</li>
            <li> I admit I need to get back into my routine of using it regularly it does feel good and I need to just use it right twice a day once in the morning and one in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE WITH USING IT.</li>
            <li> This is my third purchase of DermaWand.  The first two I used diligently on a daily basis and noticed immediate effects.  Unfortunately after a year the product stopped working.  Not sure if the wiring became defective.  I bought a second one and had the same results.  I tried other products in the market but they were not as effective as DermaWand.  So I will try the latter again and hopefully this third one does not die on me like the the first two.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my Mom who is 54 with forehead wrinkles and age spots on her face.  She used it faithfully twice a day for about 3 weeks then it stopped working while she was using it.  We could still hear the buzzing sound but there was not light and no zap.  So we returned it to Amazon and got a refund without issue.  Other than the fact that it broke she really liked it.  I tried it once or twice and really like how it feels.  Her age spots were starting to fade slightly and her complexion was brighter over all.  I don&#x27;t think she&#x27;s used it long enough to see a difference in wrinkles yet though.</li>
            <li> Not sure if its working.  Seems to minimize the eye bags. But need to keep using it. It says it can take a few weeks before you see major results. I&#x27;ve been using it for about that long.  So time will tell.</li>
            <li> I REALLY love this product, makes your face feel good! You have to get use to the electric currents to your face (especially if you use it on high) but it actually feels great and makes your face look great too! I would recommend it to anyone, woman OR man!  P.S. It&#x27;s good on pimples too, seems to zap (perhaps electrocute) them, LOL!</li>
            <li> The creams/lotions that came with it have solidified.  They must be very old.  The instructions are in Spanish, only.  There is no &amp;#34;seller&amp;#34; info to contact so I cannot even write or speak with anyone.</li>
            <li> I loved Derma Wand I´ve been using it for about a month and wow it really works. I didnt get the treatment thats why Im giving a 3 stars only, Im talking to the person in charge because I want the treatment I payed for.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this product even though my friend&#x27;s face looked 20 yrs younger than her real age.  I finally bought myself one and I tried on the back of my hands.  Oh, boy!  The improvement is clearly shown in two weeks.  My aged face is making progress (I have a very healthy diet) also, unfortunately I failed to take a &amp;#34;before photo&amp;#34; to show you.  My laughing line looked like tiny mustaches on my face; I was very self-conscious about it.  No make up can fill those deep lines and I don&#x27;t want to use chemical on my face.  I used the Derma Wand twice a day, on a higher dial (#7, it stimulates and shocks the skin) for 1.5 months now.  The progress makes the deep lines to be less noticeable; I believe my facial skin will look as good as my friend&#x27;s if I continue using it for a year!!!</li>
            <li> This really works, this is my second purchase, because the first one I have got broken, it fell. So I purchased another one and I can&#x27;t live without it; use it twice a week and viola...works really great to my 46 y/o sagging skin around face and neck and sometimes on my elbow too. Well recommended and I have been using this for 3 yrs now.</li>
            <li> I ordered this item and shipping was very fast. i read the instructions with CD  and religiously follow. As it is not battery operated item you have to plug in so there should not be any reason for loosing its power But it happened and also in some parts it hurts.i send the message to customer care But all in vain. nobody contact me may be  the reason is I buy from Amazon not from them! Anyway I returned this item and waiting for my refund. I am disappointed because I really need this kind of item.let&#x27;s hope for the better one.the prize is attractive compare to nu-brilliance but i wish it should work the way they said.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it and swears by it</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for those who want to minimize their pores, control their acne and get rid of whiteheads and blackheads -- this product worked for me.</li>
            <li> works just not as quickly as I would like&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like to spend a lot of time getting ready&lt;br /&gt;for the day so I don&#x27;t always use it. I may use it&lt;br /&gt;once or twice a week instead of daily in the beginning&lt;br /&gt;I think it is expensive but if it lasts a long time and works&lt;br /&gt;then it will balance out eventually</li>
            <li> results do not seem lasting; perhaps I am too old, LOL</li>
            <li> This product came broken without complete instructions.  Now I get the joy of trying to get reimbursement, I plan to try again with QVC where you get a better warranty system.</li>
            <li> I love Derma Wand! Makes my lips and skin feel smooth. If I get a pimple it&#x27;s almost gone by the next day. I try to at least use mine every other day.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see any changes, will report when enough time has gone by.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I bought it cause I started to notice some small wrinkles and sagging on my face. You can definitely notice a diffrence! Dont get me wrong the diffrence is subtle at first, but with continued use you can notice a drasic change. I am young but I have used it on my friends mom and even she has noticed a diffrence. She is addicted and wants one of her own now. Also if you use it with wrinkle cream instead of lotion it works better. Now if you&#x27;re really old and have a lot of wrinkles and look like your face is gonna fall off soon and want an instant miricle face lift... THIS ISN&#x27;T FOR YOU! BE REALISTIC! Anything that is worth it takes time. But if you are willing to take the time and continue using it I think this is a great product and a great gift. It also works on other parts of the body like your stomach for women who have had children. And it ships very quickly and comes w/ directional dvd and carrying case.</li>
            <li> Used it for a month and didn&#x27;t see any results. It appears it made my lines worse.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t throw your money away.</li>
            <li> It only worked for a short period of time and then nothing....</li>
            <li> I have dealt with adult acne my entire life and I often say I feel like a teenager with zits... it&#x27;s a terrible feeling when you are 42 to have very big cystic acne!  They hurts like crazy and each one lasts for weeks.  My mom got me the Derma Wand a few years ago.  I never took it our of the box until 2 months ago.  I have been using every day and I see an incredible improvement.  When I feel a big pimple coming on I use the wand directly on it and believe me when I say it either goes away completely or when the pimple does surface, it is small and goes away quickly!  I have never been one to use expensive products on my face and always very skeptical of products like this but man am I kicking myself for not using it when I got it!  I am seeing a huge difference in my acne.  By the way, I have been using it on my crow&#x27;s feet and I beginning to see a difference there too!</li>
            <li> Hey Galls and boys.&lt;br /&gt;I wished I knew about this device sooner. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 days and believe it or not, I can see my skin becoming softer, tighter, shinier and firmer.&lt;br /&gt;I can wait until I see full result in few more weeks.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a little bit of freckles under on my cheeks and they are becoming lighter .&lt;br /&gt;thank you Deram Wand</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I think the derma wand works but have not used the product long enough to notice any substantial result yet.</li>
            <li> Very overpriced customer service is terrible. Owned mine less than 30 days bumped the tip and bulb broke. Now they want me to pay to ship it back and give them another $25.00 to replace, because bulb is not under warranty. Wonder why??? Because it breaks so easy would  be my guess. So I have over $100.00 invested in something  that cannot be used. BIG waste of money!!!. Cannot rate the products results because it broke before  I used it long enough to get any results.</li>
            <li> Even though it was obvious I live in Australia, You still sent me derma wand with American electric plug?/&lt;br /&gt;I have had to go searching for adapator to meet australian standards.. very annoying indeed.&lt;br /&gt;plus I had to spend another $29.00 to get  it working.</li>
            <li> This product definitely works although the effects are subtle and take some time to be noticeable.  I have been using the DermaWand for about 2 weeks, and have noticed improvement along the jaw line in particular (which was the main reason I purchased the wand).  I would say that a person who needs extreme correction would do well to just save her money and get at least a mini-facelift.  Those jowls, etc. are not going to be totally gone unless they are surgically removed.  However, for the \\&quot;blurring\\&quot; of the jawline, mild sagging of the upper eyelids, etc., this product is perfect.  At first I thought I might be imagining the improvement - but after catching my reflection in a mirror that I did not know was there, I realized the effects are real, and I will certainly keep using this wand as part of my daily routine.  The skin care products are not things I will re-order.  My skin broke out and I found the pre-face to be drying.  The wand however is my new best friend in the beauty department.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the Derma Wand for about 2 years now.  I&#x27;ve found that slathering on any lotion (lots and lots) completely eliminates the \\&quot;sting\\&quot;.  I&#x27;d like to think that it&#x27;s working great but can&#x27;t tell too much.  However, my skin has broken out my whole life and it is pretty rare for me to get bad breakouts anymore.  I use it about twice a month.  Now that I&#x27;m getting deeper wrinkles I&#x27;m going to try every other day and see what happens.</li>
            <li> Since I have used Derma wand, I notice I get a twitch in my right eye.  I don&#x27;t think I will continue using it, and I only used it a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the other people that reviewed this item were paid to do so or if the reviews are \\&quot;planted\\&quot; BUT... I bought the thing and actually tried it and like so many other \\&quot;anti-aging devices\\&quot; this one should be bypassed!  I&#x27;ve used it over a month now and nothing is happening, nada, absolutely nothing... but since I&#x27;ve tried other items with \\&quot;great reviews\\&quot; I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that I&#x27;ve wasted my money on another product that just plain doesn&#x27;t work... oh well...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have that many wrinkles to begin with but this thing is awesome.  It has really helped the tone of my skin and the crows feet.  I urged my mom to buy one and am excited to see her results!  I would use this with whatever skin care you already use and not the product they send it with.</li>
            <li> I have not seen visible changes, but I confess I have been not consistent with daily treatment. I trust it will be good in the long run after applying it every day</li>
            <li> Have been using this at night for about eight years.  I would probably get even better results if I used it twice a day.  I think it has helped &amp;#34;delay&amp;#34; the inevitable wrinkles.  I am in my late 50s.  I have had to realize no cream or any other product that can be used at home will turn back the hands of time, but I do think you can keep a lot at bay.</li>
            <li> Have been using it with not much results,:(</li>
            <li> TWO AGE SPOTS ON MY FORHEAD ALREADY 80% GONE IN JUST A FEW WEEKS !&lt;br /&gt; WOW ! IT&#x27;S REAL !</li>
            <li> USING THIS FOR 1.5 MONTHS NOW &amp; I DON&#x27;T SEE ANY DIFFERENCE. I AM USING IT ON SETTING 7-8. tHE BOOKLET SAYS 12 WEEKS SO I&#x27;LL STICK IT OUT. BUT RITERATING , SO FAR NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL  &amp;  I AM USING FOR APPROX 8 MINUTES EACH TIME PERHAPS LONGER.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for a year now. Yet, I was highly impressed from day one. When I looked at the reviews given by Dr Oz,  that is what impressed me, also. Dr Oz gave this device a thumbs up. My skin glows. The springy elasticity of the skin is what I noticed, too using this product. The stimulation on the molecular level beneath the skin with the radio wave frequency moves nutrients and oxygen about for cellular feeding. Which in turn, plumps up cells, which creates filled in lines. I use olive oil smoothed over my skin as this adds a lipid or a fat on the surface of the skin, which the radio frequency pulsing presses into the deeper skin layer for lubricating. Therefore, the skin will not dry out. So, instead the skin gets a deep massage and moisturizing. This I have used safely on my face, throat, hands, fore arms, beneath my arms, chest, thighs and calves of my legs.  I Am Highly Impressed ~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 Years Old with a few wrinkles. I really wanted to work on the deep line between my eyes and around my lips. After a month of using it I have noticed a difference in appearance. I use it twice a day and only set the Dermawand around 4. Hopefully I will keep getting great results...Would Recommend:)</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t see things happening with this product as promised.</li>
            <li> I hope il work for me</li>
            <li> did not see results as shown</li>
            <li> I have been using it about a week and I can see a small improvement in my skin texture and lines.</li>
            <li> This may sound weird but whenever my eyesight was failing me, I use the product (setting 4) and run it over my eyes. I know I know, you&#x27;re not supposed to do that. In an hour, I actually feel my eyesight becoming sharper! The product is honest to goodnes true but unfortunately, I am lazy to use it. I am only happy that I have on hand something to use if I ever develop frown lines. Incidentally, works well with people with mild bells palsy. Used it on my hubby (3x a day) with the highest setting and the lopsided face was gone in 2 months.</li>
            <li> Great product to keep your skin looking firm</li>
            <li> I very rarely write reviews; but this one deserves a review.  I can&#x27;t believe in just two months (of using it 2x a day) how much better my skin looks.  My pores are shrinking, eye brows are higher (just like on the commercial), and my skins is noticeably tighter.  My aesthetician couldn&#x27;t believe how good my skin looks....  Well worth the cost--order one, you&#x27;ll be glad you did!</li>
            <li> I cannot properly rate this item as it came with only Spanish instructions and I am English speaking.</li>
            <li> I want to mention, if you are going to buy this kit DO NOT BUY IT FROM DERMA WAND. I am in a full blown battle with them at this time because I fell for their \\&quot;FREE TRIAL\\&quot; ad (info mercial) and they charged not only the $144.95, but they also then charged another $9.95 shipping the day I ordered it. The AGREEMENT was that the ** $144.95 be charged ONLY IF I DECIDED TO KEEP THIS UNIT AFTER A 30 day \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; TRIAL.**  What you just read is only the beginning. Beyond that, I have made 11 calls to DERMA WAND over a 1 week time frame in efforts to get the $144.95  (which was not supposed to be charged) actually removed from my credit card account. This all started on 1/14/12  ... and as I write this, after 5 total hours on the phone and over 15 phone calls and 2 chat sessions with my credit card Co., both DERMA WAND&#x27;s charges are STILL on my account. The thing is, a dispute can take up to 30 days to be removed according to my credit card Co., so even tho DERMA WAND states they removed the charges, they are still there. I hope to get this all resolved, it will just take a TON OF TIME, time that  NONE of us have these days!  What bothers me is I feel there was a bit of scamming going on. I think DERMA WAND hoped I didn&#x27;t NOTICE that charge on my account, and rather that I would be suckered into paying for everything on a FREE TRIAL agreement .... How many out there would not be as diligent as I have been? Just 2 hours battling this issue today, and it&#x27;s my day off! NEVER AGAIN!  BTW - not sure how to rate this item, yet, so I gave it a 3. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet .... hope to some day, thru AMAZON! It is CHEAPER HERE ANYWAY!</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product from another site and later found the reviews for it. they weren&#x27;t very good. I will judge for myself, but I find it very suspicious that all of those who gave it 5 stars and rave reviews only have 5 stars to give every product they review. One has to wonder if different companies don&#x27;t pay them to \\&quot;work from home\\&quot; to post nothing but great things about various products. Highly suspicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update 12/12/13  I used this product for a few months with absolutely no signs of a difference. I came across it recently and threw it out, it was wasting space. As I said before, I do believe that some reviews are a sham.  All I am saying is look into other reviewer&#x27;s posts, and research on different sites to make sure you are getting a quality product that does what it claims, or does something at all. Other websites had this rated and it was not given good reviews. Something doesn&#x27;t add up!</li>
            <li> Broke after only a few uses!</li>
            <li> i bought the derma wand and returned it without using it because i read a warning from the state of california on the instructions that said that the product could cause cancer and birth defects because of the chemicals it uses....needless to say i wasn&#x27;t gonna use it! i went to the official derma wand website but i couldn&#x27;t find any info on that claim or maybe i didn&#x27;t look hard enough. maybe ill e-mail them one day and see if they tell me anything about that.</li>
            <li> Havent tried it as of yet. Got it delivered today, Saturday. When I was inspecting my NEW Derma Wand It had lotion on the bulb end and the cap was missing. Clearly the sent me a used wand.I have to wait till Monday for customer service. Right now I am not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> this is defintly worth the money I use it every day</li>
            <li> I really liked this device.......while it lasted, which wasn&#x27;t very long. It creates a really nice, fresh smelling ozone smell, and I feel that it did help my skin. But I only got a chance to use it about 8 times before it broke.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a year, and it think it really works, keeps the skin tighter and helps with the smile lines</li>
            <li> I am practically free of wrinkles and, thanks to some excellent facial exercises I have been doing for about three years, my face is firm and nicely toned up. I should not have bought the Derma Wand but, as I am a great oxygen fan and use it in different ways (oral oxygen and ozonators), I decided to buy the Derma Wand.&lt;br /&gt;Though it is true that it *temporarily* plumps up and lifts the face, I had a problem with it and I could see, for the first time in my life, quite a few wrinkles on my under-eye area. The Derma Wand puffed up my face and what used to be very tiny, almost invisible expression marks turned into visible under-eye area wrinkles. It was scary. I had to wait about three days for the wrinkles to go away.&lt;br /&gt;The breakouts other reviewers complain about did not scare me. I have been using oxygen products and I know different types of skin problems may appear as toxins start leaving the body due to oxygen purification. The oxygen part was the one that I liked the most about the Derma Wand but those wrinkles that I had never had were the reason why I returned the Derma Wand for a refund. (The facial cream that came with the Derma Wand was so second-rate that I tried it once and never used it again. Cannot understand why it was included in the kit).</li>
            <li> I have been using the dermawand for 10 days now.  I have already noticed less puffiness around my eyes.  Overall I think there is less sagginess to my face.  I will continue to use it and hope to see further results.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t really pleased with this product. It does brighten up tired looking eyes. I wasn&#x27;t happy about the smell it gives off while in usage, it kindda gave me a headache. I don&#x27;t think it lives up to it standards and it surely does not compare to the professional treatment you receive in salons and dermatologist offices. I used it a few  times and now it sits in my bathroom cabinet where it has been for months.</li>
            <li> I bought the Derma wand a couple of years ago, and even though I used it faithfully, I didn&#x27;t really see any results. However, I am on a medication that causes bleeding and some pretty severe bruising. Due to the severity of these side effects, I have permanent staining on my arms from the blood not being absorbed fast enough. After getting a pretty deep bruise, I decided to see what the derma wand could do . To my surprise, using it caused my bruises to fade much faster, and this in return, prevented the staining. I use it frequently for my bruises and am very happy to have this device just for this reason. I will not help to fade the old blood staining however.</li>
            <li> I think it is a deceiving product.  There is absolutely no change of any kind. I didn&#x27;t expect miracles but just a little something!!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really seen results, yet.  It does feel good on the face, though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over 9 months and I am very happy with the results.  The fine lines around the lower eye are almost gone and overall, my skin is tighter around the chin and face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for 5 to 8 minutes every night, and have not been relifious about it, but ther has been a definite tightening of the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have the time, it works on your upper arms too, I jsut wish it came with a larger size.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for a few weeks and it&#x27;s already breaking down.  It now only works on the lowest setting, and who knows for how long.  It may even have worked if it wasn&#x27;t such a shoddy crap chinese made electronic device.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Great product got it for my mother in law and she is looking younger love how it worked..</li>
            <li> using this product helps to tighten loose skin , especially that turkey neck , i don&#x27;t see it anymore, thank goodness</li>
            <li> اشتريته وخرب علي&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not good breakdown after 1 week</li>
            <li> I started using it july 30th I had blemishes,scars and uneven skin tone....I tried everything ..trust me I am just so thrilled...people who said it make them breakout clean the bulb with alcohol pad or something zap the areas with higher setting slightly above the skin surface...It takes at least one month to clear up as the acne already formed under the skin not visible to the naked eye wont go away over night but if you keep using it for at least 4 weeks no new acne will form and your face will start to clear up....its working on my undereye dark circles too do not use more than 3-4 on that delicate area please...I used it everyday for 30 days and  I am a true believer now...IT WORKS!!!!!!!! IT ROCKS.....!!!!You will not see difference overnight please stick with it you will love it.And  wrinkles  soften do not go away but I am telling you after one month use only so lets see..I dont have many wrinkles anyway...I am 36y old</li>
            <li> Well, despite the bad reviews about dealing with the co. - can&#x27;t say about that, b/c I didn&#x27;t return it - but to comment on the actual product? This is a good product. Here&#x27;s what happened to me. I bought it, used it religiously for about 6 weeks, and really saw no difference. So I put it in the drawer &amp; gradually forgot about dealing with it. When I finally did get around to returning it, the time-frame to do so had expired. Damn! So I thought I might as well continue using it &amp; see what happens, what the heck, I&#x27;m stuck with the thing. I decided that it certainly couldn&#x27;t hurt, b/c I had researched microcurrent technology &amp; it is a legitimate effect, they did not make that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, guess what? B/c the pressure was off to search for a great &amp; immediate result, I just relaxed &amp; actually used it more, like 3-4 times/week, not timing it, just enjoying the gentle massage, the general benefit which I know for a fact is there (i.e.: research). I now am seeing a difference, no question. It gradually (VERY gradually, in my case) smoothed out, improved &amp; appears to be gently restoring the condition of the skin &amp; underlying muscle. I have decided it is a foundational item to have in my beauty kit - not the only answer to every problem, but a key essential, along with a good cleansing/moisturizing routine, exercise, healthy eating, sleep &amp; reducing stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I do not want to suggest it is some kind of single, lighting-strike miracle. It&#x27;s more like a gentle, steady, summer rain. :)</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve been too busy to use this 2x a day, probably used it twice a day 6 days and used it another 6 times once per day. after 3 wks i was thinking of sending it back when i went to cover an age spot and realized it was 90% gone! so i decided to keep it and see what else it will help. also, dermawand is cheaper at amazon.</li>
            <li> been using it every day for 2 weeks...haven&#x27;t seen any change yet but plan to give it another month or so before I pass judgement</li>
            <li> I returned it, the first week, this product does not work</li>
            <li> Just got it. Directions say set a low levels due to getting used to the sensation of tingling. This one does no tingling even at highest level. I wonder if it is working at all. The light at the end does come on. Don&#x27;t feel any heat either .How can you tell if it is on besides the light??</li>
            <li> Really helpa fine lines, pores.&lt;br /&gt;Tightens skin.</li>
            <li> I have seen no real change since using this daily, but I will continue using it in the event it takes more time to show results.</li>
            <li> I just got this, used it last night and this morning....  I feel like my face seem brighter for sure,  and I used it for the bags under my eyes....and that helped a lot!  thank goodness.  so I will review again, and if I don&#x27;t feel free to remind me!  I used it on the high settings...didn&#x27;t screw around with the lower settings.</li>
            <li> This is the second Dermawand I have purchased.... But disappointed in the strength of this one... Current seems weak compared to my old one... Sorry I could not say anything positive.... Maybe I got a lemon</li>
            <li> worked great for what I needed it for.  Very useful.</li>
            <li> There is more to this wand than they promise.  I am 49 and have small lines, jowls are starting, and eyelids are starting to droop, all family traits.  My eyelids do not respond like the commercial but the puffiness is improving.  I also have acne which is clearing up very nicely after one week of use. Scarring is fading, pores are getting smaller, lines are diminishing. It has also diminished redness and evened out skin tone. I have a nervous rash on my scalp that is improving.  The rash is smaller and doesn&#x27;t itch as much.  I also have a pinched nerve in my neck that causes pain in my shoulders and tightening of neck muscles.  The treatment on my neck eliminates the pain in my shoulders and the muscle pain has greatly diminished. I was not expecting relief of that chronic pain.  I would keep using it for that even if nothing else worked but it all works.  It is also very relaxing.  I do it twice a day while I watch TV so it doesn&#x27;t really take any extra time. My husband noticed a difference the 1st day. He 63 and is always complaining that he looks old so he was willing to try it.  His face is responding even faster than mine.  His sagging chin tightened dramatically, skin tone improved, and lines are not as deep.  He is bald and has a lot of sun damage on top of his head so I am using it there too.  The spots are fading.  I only used it on him 3 times last week and saw marked improvement.  My 8 year old daughter has red hair and a fair complexion and tends to pick at her boo boos that take forever to heal.  I noticed that the freckles are fading and her boo boos are healing quicker plus she loves the relaxation part too.  This is a fabulous tool that I will be using for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> performed better that expected</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle, but it definitely DOES make a difference.  I have been using the Derma Wand for nearly a month now and have gotten many unsolicited compliments on how clean and bright my complexion is.  Since I haven&#x27;t used it THAT long, I cannot comment on the long term benefits but the instant benefits are remarkable.  I use it once a day, sometimes twice, 5-6 times a week.  I am noticing a minor tightening in my neck and jawline area, as well as a smoothing of the light lines and \\&quot;11&#x27;s\\&quot; between my eyes.  So I have to say you will get results quickly, but not miracles right away.  It is something you have to keep up with.  My complaints are mostly with the products/creams that come with the kit -- they&#x27;re OK, but not awesome.  Also, the travel case that comes with it seems to be a little small for the wand and cord to fit into -- kind of a pain.  And speaking of pain, unless you are supersensitive, there is none, even at the higher settings.  The enclosed booklet and instructional video aren&#x27;t as detailed as I would like, but there&#x27;s plenty of information on the internet.  I would recommend this product to anybody who does not want or cannot afford spa/doctor treatments.  Bottom line:  It works.</li>
            <li> The product works as long as you keep using it everyday.... I like it but need to remember to keep using it everyday!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for one week now, twice a day for about 6 minutes per application, and I was pleasantly surprised.  Someone commented on how fresh and bright my complex is and I&#x27;m 45.  That prompted me to write this review.  I have reserved a star because its a plug-in product and usually these electrical devices have a way of shorting out after a few uses.  I am waiting to see how long it will last. Remember to prep your skin with the pre-treatment or any other moisturizer before use, so that the wand glides along your skin better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been just 2 weeks... but I think it&#x27;s gonna be great  since my eyebrows are higher so my eyes are brighter. Good  : )</li>
            <li> My wife loves her Christmas gift, after a slow start she is now using twice a day and sees the wrinkles fading, and loves the face message.</li>
            <li> I purchased and received my derma wand 2-3 weeks ago. I read through the pamplet prior to using it, and did a few of the extra treatments that were suggested in the pamplet. I saw immediate results in the diminshing of my forehead wrinkles and my eyes were lifted immediately, though the effects lasted temporarily. With each use I notice my wrinkles and the bags under my eyes are diminishing, my pores are shrinking, and my skin is firmer. I, too, have had a few pimples, and my skin seems oilier, but it possibly can have something to do with the face products I use. I alternate between Principal Secrets and Reviva&#x27;s products.. but have many others in my arsenal against aging (I am a skin care product junkie.. hehe).&lt;br /&gt;  I will be 52 years old in 2 days, though I am told I look much younger.. (It may just be people trying to stroke my ego, as well.. hehe) I also started using the Tua Viso Electronic Unit for Facial Gymnastics about 6 weeks ago, which I really like, too, but it is very time consuming, so I have cut down to every other day on that, but the derma wand just takes 5 minutes twice a day, and you are done. Great product!</li>
            <li> No results  - used a lot of time and no changes. Worst is that after 31 days of using it the bulb went out. The warranty expired 1 day ago! I am so upset that I spend $116 on this. A replacement bulb is $25. What a waste of time and  money this has been.</li>
            <li> Mom used this everyday for 3 months and didn&#x27;t see a difference ...</li>
            <li> sent back......small machine head...I WOULD NOT recommend this...pricey also......takes to much time suppose to use morning and night,it would be good if you had the time to spare especially in the morning</li>
            <li> The Derma Wand Kit is wonderful. It has made me feel more confident and youthful in a short time. It smoothies out wrinkles and even reduces pimples. I would not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love the Derma Wand. I truly believe  it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased Derma Wand. This is probable the best purchase I have ever made. It WORKS!! I am so happy with the results, as I was very nervous about believing it works. The prod does give you a fast mini face lift--&amp; over time -WOW-! Your eyes lift,creases go away, &amp; in the morning-I really saw the impact of a true \\&quot;lift\\&quot;.  I recommend this product.  Mar P</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician, and I use the Dermawand in my practice.  It gives the exact results as a larger direct high frequency unit would.  I do not use indirect high frequency, so the Dermawand suits me well as it is compact and portable.</li>
            <li> Súper. Good.  5.  Years.  Take off.</li>
            <li> Came with no DVD, the astringent was so old and dried out it wouldn&#x27;t work in their machine. All made in Red China. If so good as they claim and  it takes a while to see results, as they claim, why only a 30 day warranty?&lt;br /&gt;The astringent I believe is what gives minor results to desperate people. Reminds me of the hair growing laser machines which now come with minoxidal, any hair grown is the minoxidal, not the laser machine.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day on my face and on the back of my legs for cellulite. On my face I used the highest setting, got no results. I also used it on highest setting on the back of my legs. There I actually did see improvement. Cellulite was not as obvious. I only tried it on my legs because the instructions stated cellulite could also be treated with derma wand. That was great but my main concern is my face.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Derma Wand for a week. For this reason I am only giving It four stars.  It makes my face feel soft,  hopefully helping my moisturizers do a better job.  It is convenient, only taking a few minutes in the morning and at night.  The sting is not bad.  My face feels nice and tingly afterwards.  This is the only product of this type that I have tried.  I felt my skin getting loose and saggy, but have very few wrinkles.  Hopefully this will help tone my skin over time.  I will update in a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;The ordering process with Amazon is great.  It arrived very quickly.  This is a great way to shop.</li>
            <li> I do not own this product but when I used to frequent the spa(before I began doing my own facials and peels) my aethetician would use this on my face to kill the bacteria post extractions.    It&#x27;s not as though I ever paid extra for this but to be honest, I don&#x27;t know how effective it really is...  I never had break-outs afterwards.  But....then again--I have never had break-outs after a facial/peel treatment prior to using the wand.  &gt;&gt;shrugs&lt;&lt;   I trust the folks at my spa and I know that they know what they&#x27;re doing and for that I&#x27;ll give the wand 3.5 stars---but I guess I just don&#x27;t see the big deal.</li>
            <li> Well when I got it I was pretty excited. Was using it pretty faithfully and then it all but died. Seriously, I really expected it to last longer than a couple months! So I guess I really don&#x27;t know if it works... bummer!</li>
            <li> I have a recurring rash around my mouth, especially when Im stressed out...the rx cream wasnt helping so I thought &amp;#34;What the heck, I&#x27;ll try zapping it with the dermawand&amp;#34;...gone the next morning. Its great on blemishes. I have 2 teenage daughters that zap their spots with it. I use it on my whole face with a vitamin c serum to get it deep into my pores...works well!</li>
            <li> I have used this off and on for a couple years now and when I&#x27;m not busy being a new &#x27;mom&#x27;, I try very hard to make it a part of my weekly skincare routine.  When I was doing this regularly, my skin did look awesome.  But I also used a TON of other skincare products with it for best results.  I&#x27;m like a anti-aging junkie and did a ton of research of inexpensive ways to get the same results as having injections/fillers or expensive trips to the salon.  I can say, that when I did use it with my other products I was very pleased.  Now if only I can get back to using it twice a week!</li>
            <li> I would give it no stars, but I had to choose at least 1. If you ever hear of anyone talking about the DermaWand, turn around and run.</li>
            <li> I have had my dermawand for two weeks and love what its doing to my skin!  The lines around my mouth are less noticeable.  Skin tone is more even.  Pores are much smaller.  So glad i got a dermawand!</li>
            <li> I have been wanting the Derma Wand Kit for many years and finally purchased one.  It is just as I expected and started at the lowest number to get used to.  It is like a &amp;#34;zappy&amp;#34; feeling and I am now on #4, gradually increasing my level.  I have noticed a change already in my skin tone but only been using it for a couple of weeks.  I personally don&#x27;t like the gel it comes with.. as moisturizing makes it not move over my skin smoothly.  I have never tried any type of products in the past for this procedure..so I am anxiously awaiting for those &amp;#34;commercial&amp;#34; results.. eye brow lift, etc.  I know it will take time and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I did a fair amount of research on this product before buying it but a lot of things work great for other people and not me.  My skepticism was unnecessary. This is one nice little gadget. Not only has it improved the texture of my skin, but my eyelids are less droopy, my jowls almost gone and my smile lines and brow creases are nearly gone. The bags under my eyes are noticeably improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One unexpected perk, it also heals acne lightening fast - I can see an immediate reduction in swelling. I get acne cysts occasionally and if I catch the bump fast, I can keep it from getting large and developing a head.  That&#x27;s pretty amazing to me and reason alone to own it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it with Oz Naturals Vitamin C serum. My skin doesn&#x27;t handle moisturizers without breaking out so I am not adding a moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will join those who love it.  Oh, I&#x27;m 55 and most people peg me for early 40&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Look, this doesn&#x27;t life your face miraculously, but I can attest to the amazing change in my skin. My skin is tighter, I get less than a quarter of the acne. I SO wish I had this as a teenager!!!!! If you have cystic acne at all, this is amazing. As soon as you feel the start of one, zap it. It is gone and improving within a day. I used it faithfully for six months, twice a day (with my own lotion - theirs is useless). I did notice a firmer neck and mouth area. But as I read on about them I learned some things. It is not going to tighten skin for someone who is young. And by young I mean someone without aged (beginning to sag) skin. It does not tone facial muscle, but rather tightens skin. Typically as women age, their facial muscles age (and begin to weaken) first. That is my case, the skin hasn&#x27;t really begun to sag yet (but I know it&#x27;s coming.) So without that, I cannot accurately comment on the toning part of it. There is an odor of ozone, it isn&#x27;t bad.The zapping doesn&#x27;t hurt and it only took me three days to climb up to maximum power - which you need for results. I read reports of it making people break out a bit. This happened to me a little at first. I believe that the intial use drives oils and potential pimples to the surface. It happened for about three days after a about the same number of days in use. Then it was gone, and my skin really did become perfectly free of blemishes. Lastly, be loyal to the use of this product for skin tightening. I did notice a slight change around the corners of my mouth and lips. But I stopped using is for a month - and did notice a slip right back. Using it to zap and prevent acne - works. That should be done as often as you need it.</li>
            <li> A ce jour, je ne vois pas de différence dans ma peau.  Peut-être qu&#x27;avec le temps...&lt;br /&gt;Up till now, I dont see any difference with my skin. Maybe in fews weeks, shall I see it...</li>
            <li> I see no changes even with small wrinkles after a couple months of treatment.  Would not waste $100.00 ever again.</li>
            <li> Used as directed, excess drying and did not see any results. Returned for a refund.</li>
            <li> have not seen any change yet after a month</li>
            <li> Boy I see a enormous change. my eyes are lifted and my skin is showing great results.. who ever said this does not work , does not use it properly. Cheers!</li>
            <li> It was a waste of good money!  The product is way over rated and over priced  The cream supplied with it does not work.</li>
            <li> It takes a little while to adapt to the smell, but the results proclaimed are true. I love the way my skin looks and get lots of compliments about how my face seems to glow..I highly recommend it to anyone wanting a smoother more toned look and feel to their skin.</li>
            <li> I was wrong. It does not do what it says it will.  I could see if the wrinkles were deep but I do not have deep wrinkles and therefore I thought it would work.</li>
            <li> The results are slow, but after having used this for about 6 weeks, noticed an improvement in my skin tone.  The stimulation is &amp;#34;picky&amp;#34; feeling, yet tolerable.  Recommend increasing to the highest setting as soon as able for best results. Always apply a moisturizing cr&amp;egrave;me before using the product.  Did decrease some lines, but I also found some face moisturizing products that have worked well with it.</li>
            <li> It has done wonders for het lines and wrinkles.  Generally more tone to the skin.  More youthful appearance after only about 6 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1MFKU65QOTJWM]]Independent study of the Dermawand. This device really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000ICRDSW Derma Wand Kit]]</li>
            <li> great product....it helps a lot lifting the eyebrows plus the puffiness under the eyes... use it every day and see great results.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s garbage. A complete waste of my money. This does NOT lift your face or face skin in any way. The only thing you can look forward to after using this is a very very dry face. You can put on all the moisturizer in the world and you will still face an extremely dry face. Only way I could correct the dry face issue was by exfoliating repeatedly for a couple weeks. And using more and more moisturizer. The only thing this product does is crisp the top layer of your skin. This is NOT a special laser or light that comes out and fixes your problems. After close examination I discovered that all this does is apply a small electrical shock to your skin. When you run it across your face all your doing is applying electricity, in turn, damaging your skin. The electric action is not effective enough to actually penetrate your facial muscles and provide a temporary lift. And even if it did, the skin damage would far outweigh that temporary benefit.  I&#x27;m 41 and starting to experience the visual effects of aging so I guess I was looking for a little help. So disappointed that all I got in return for the high price was damaged skin and aggrivation.</li>
            <li> I bought the Dermawand Dec. 2013, and I have used it for a year.  I am 67 years old and I look ten years younger. My husband and children are amazed on how it has worked. I bought another Dermawand this year making sure I have another on hand. I bought the Dermawand from their site. This product takes time for you to see a difference. This is an awesome product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Sorry but we need to moisturize more, stay young on the outside as well.Feels good, skin is firm even tone ...guys manscape &amp; keep up with Wat your girl/ guy found you* that&#x27;s key</li>
            <li> This is the worst thing I have ever purchased!  So disappointed in this thing they call the Derma wand! Please dont waste your money!  I have used it faithfully  for two weeks no difference in my face at all! Instead I look much older!  This company had to pay these people stating this is a good product.  Im a Christian woman that absolutely dont want people to get cheated out of their money.</li>
            <li> The derma wand is simple to use and the results are incredible.  Just follow the well written instructions and start on a low setting and it has worked great.</li>
            <li> i ALWAYS READ REVIEWS BEFORE I PURCHASE A PRODUCT, BUT I HAVE NEVER WRITTEN ONE BEFORE.  I PURCHASED THIS PRODUCT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE REVIEWS ON THIS SITE AND I&#x27;M SO GLAD THAT I DID.  I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THE DERMAWAND FOR 2 WEEKS NOW AND I SEE A HUGE DIFFERENCE IN THE TEXTURE OF MY FACE AND THE BAGS UNDER MY EYES ARE GOING DOWN.  I HAVEN&#x27;T NOTICED THE WRINKLES GOING AWAY YET, BUT I LOVE THE WAY MY FACE IS LOOKING.  MY NEW DRIVERS LICENSE PICTURE TELLS THE WHOLE STORY (JUST GOT IT YESTERDAY)  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!! SINCE TURNING 40, I&#x27;VE TRIED AT LEAST 13 PRODUCTS OFF OF THE INTERNET, AND THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER PURCHASED!  THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> I bought the wand because my daughter had severe scarring from acne.  The wand did wonders for it.  The scarring is barely visible now and she has not used it for a month.  I decided to see what it would do for me.  I am a lot older than she and have scarring and wrinkles.  It did wonders for the scarring, but not much for the wrinkles.  I think it just matters what you are buying it for.  I did notice that my skin cancer spot (that was trying to come back) stopped pussing up again... which is a good thing.  I think the lotion used really matters too.  I use aquaphor (behind the counter at the pharmacy).</li>
            <li> I like to think that the wand is working, but it&#x27;s hard to know whether it is or is not my imagination. After using it for a few days, my daughter, who hadn&#x27;t seen me in about 3 days, said I looked younger. I didn&#x27;t tell her I had been using the wand. She just volunteered, &amp;#34;You look younger!&amp;#34; Her comment makes me think it might be working. Of course, I was hoping it would be more dramatic.</li>
            <li> Great face stimulator</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know much about how it works yet.  Only just received it and just starting to use it.  Give me a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It is ok I haven&#x27;t seen much of an improvement</li>
            <li> Do NOT buy this product. Made my skin look 5 years older! Gave wrinkles where I had none, increased those I did have. My skin looks saggy whereas it did not before using it. Worst decision I ever made!</li>
            <li> This wand works great--does what it says.  Reduces wrinkles and smooths the skin.  Works great on blemishes as well.  But dont use it on the highest setting if your prone to marks.  Other than that it make skin look much better.</li>
            <li> Great product  when it&#x27;s new&lt;br /&gt;2stars after using it a while it hardly works</li>
            <li> Not worth the money spent. Save your money!</li>
            <li> I have been getting facials over a year o try to improve my complextion. I tried everything on the market and didnt anything that really made a difference for very long. I have these little rocks that keep surfacing on my face. No matter how many facials I have had along with using only oil free products nothing gave me a clear smooth face.    I noticed tha the lady who did my facial would roll this electrod ball on my face at the end of the facial.  So I did some research online and found info about the Derma Wand.  I got it on Amazon for $99 + no shipping which was cheaper than continuing to have facials done. On top of it 30 day free trial!!    After the first time I used it, the next morning I could see a difference in my face. It was not lumpy looking anymore it was smoother and had a nice sheen to it. The \\&quot;rocks\\&quot; would surface quicker on my face with easy removal.  I used it all over my face like the booklet says to do and after a week even my husband looked at me as we were waiting at the airport and said &#x27;you face looks so nice and smooth\\&quot;.  Just to add more I had deep  creases between my eyes along with the jowl lines around my mouth that I just hated!!!  Not kidding when I say they are barely there anymore.  It may not work for everyone but it did for me which is a first. I have bought so many products over the years just to be let down and disappointed but this wand works for me.    It is worth every penny to try this product especially with the 30 day free trial.  I am sold on this product and will continue to use it everyday.  By the way I am 53 and feel beautiful again because of the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> Was very excited to get this product.  It is easy to use and does not take a lot of time.  I have been using it in the morning and at night.  I can see a very slight improvement but, not what I was hoping for.  I will continue to use it for another 4 weeks and see if there is noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am disappointed with the Derma Wand.  I do not think it is strong enough to have the effect shown on the TV demo&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;age 64 with previous face lift</li>
            <li> I just placed my order earlier this week and viola...it&#x27;s here and it&#x27;s only Friday.  I am very anxious to try it out.  I have to wait until I remove all my makeup tonight though; haha.  Just wondering...I have oily skin, do you have to use a moisturizer in order for it to glide over the face?  Help and please let me know.  Thanks!  PS - I rated with high marks due to quick delivery; not on the product yet.  In time, I will update.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing the infomericial and then reading all the good reviews on AMAZON.      Since I have monthly facials, I am acquainted with the commercial size machine and how it works. However, after trying the &#x27;at home&#x27; version, far from the smooth texture I experience after my professional facial, I found that it caused mild breakouts and generally my skin looked rough and blotchy.    While the pamphlet that comes with the derma wand did warn of the possibility of redness or broken capillaries, it never mentioned anything about skin possibly becoming oily and prone to breakouts. I noticed however that other reviewers reported similar experiences, so at least I&#x27;m not alone.  I&#x27;ve decided therefore to take a chance and establish a regular routine.  Hopefully my reaction is temporary and I will eventually see similar results to what I get from my professional facials.    On another note, if anyone has experienced firming or toning of any other areas from using this product, namely upper arms or thighs, I would love to know.  After all, part of the advertising for this product is that it works well on other areas of the body as well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product.  My face feels better after each treatment.  I have only just starting using it, so the actual physical positive outcome of use has yet to be achieved.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to Derma Wand by a friend and after seeing the improvement in her skin, I purchased one for myself. I have only been using it for about 2 weeks now, and can already see a marked tightening of my facial skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money at medi-spas getting laser light treatments and peels and facials and this dermawand works better than all of it put together. I use it ONLY on the max setting, for about 30 minutes once a day. I use it extensive my around the eyes on max setting with no problems, only great improvement! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 months like this and I swear, it&#x27;s taken off 5-10 years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My machine broke after a couple of months and they replaced it but it promptly broke again.</li>
            <li> I saw the ads on tv..I watched the you tube videos of this before I bought it.i got my derma wand today and I took a picture of my face with no make up.i used it like they said to and I could feel it working..im giving it a month an im going to take another picture cause I know its going to take a while to see results but it better than just waiting for my wrinkle cr&amp;egrave;me to work alone..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. BUYERS BEWARE!!!It is a waste of your money</li>
            <li> I wrote to the developer of the product because she advertises this &amp;#34;feel free to write me&amp;#34; thing.  She answered me ONLY when I was considering purchasing the product.  I wrote her again afterward because I had one more question - and she ignored me, twice.  No need to acknowledge the customer once the purchase is made, I guess. That doesn&#x27;t bode well with me.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as advertised</li>
            <li> I bought it because I saw raving reviews and a convincing ad. Never worked well the highest intensity was nothing special and the lowest wouldn&#x27;t even work</li>
            <li> The one thing I will say about Dermawand is... they don&#x27;t do business very honestly. They had an offer to make payments over several months. The next thing I know there is a charge of $275.40 taken out of my bank account. When I tried to reach the company I didn&#x27;t get anywhere. I sure with i had gone through Amazon they have never let me down.</li>
            <li> My old one finally died.  It worked for eight years.  I love this machine.  People are always surprised to learn I am 67 years old.  They think I am in my mid-40s.  Sweet.</li>
            <li> I feel it has a positive effect on my skin. After use my face is tighter, my brows lifted and my skin has a healthy glow.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use with any retinol products. Of course that wasn&#x27;t mentioned in any descriptions. Pay close attention to reviews.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it does work, and i dont even use it every day. my big problem area is heavy eyelids. After just a few uses they were noticeably better. However you do need to keep using it, maybe not as frequently but there is required upkeep. (its not surgery) . Very happy with results.</li>
            <li> Ihaven&#x27;t had it long enough to really know yet, people say that they see a difference in the depth of the wrinkles.  Probably another 2 weeks and I will know</li>
            <li> i bought this after seeing an infomercial. that should have been my first clue that this wouldn&#x27;t work, but the lady on there seemed to really perk up her face while using this. i read some good reviews online, and decided to order it from amazon, knowing that i could return it if i didn&#x27;t like it. i have been very good about using it--once a day on most days. well, recently my chin acne looks like i&#x27;ve been pelted by shrapnel. it&#x27;s awful. to be honest, i am quite prone to acne, especially on my chin. no allergic reaction problems, but i tend to get large cystic acne there. i am on daily oral medication for it, as well as a nightly topical. for the most part, that has taken care of my cystic pimples. after using this machine for several weeks, nothing was happening. neither good, nor bad...until a few days ago. a little one popped up, and now two huge cystic ones as well. this is no coincidence. this is directly related to this machine. i have been gradually going up a notch because nothing was happening, but i guess my chin doesn&#x27;t like a level 5. it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my mild wrinkles, either. i will be returning this, as my bank account needs this money more than my face does.</li>
            <li> Satisfied.  Product performance met expectations. Sometimes  these review surveys ask too many questions.  In order to get this review in, I had to filibuster like a politician.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my mom since hers broke. Came with everything and everything was top shape except for the product box but that didn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> I really bought this for entertainment value.. Any over the counter topical treatements are basically ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it to my older daughter to amuse herself with.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product as much as I thought I would. The smell is very unpleasant. The feeling is fine but I just haven&#x27;t had a lot of time since you are supposed to use it only with a freshly cleaned face and time is scarce in the morning.</li>
            <li> Within 1 week I noticed a HUGE improvemnet in my skin texture on my face and ESPCIALLY my neck..I use it 2 times a day ..once in the am and once before I go to bed.. 5 mins is all it takes..I cant wait to see the differance in a month...</li>
            <li> I am an esthetician and continually get questions about the quality of this item, so I decided to buy it to see how it worked exactly. We do a procedure called high frequency in our spa, derma wand is a high frequency machine. High frequency is done with electrodes; electrodes have a gas (such as neon) vacuum sealed in the glass electrode. We use this procedure to help products (like serums, antioxidants) get absorbed into the skin, to help stimulate collagen production, and increase elasticity and tone in the skin. Dermawand is a high frequency electrode, the gas does release a smell and this is normal, it works just them same as the spa machines. The machine appears to run at the same levels of intensity as the spa machines. Same feel, smell, sound, and results. As with all the procedures like high frequency, galvanic, or light therapy the results are temporary. But, one dermawand costs as much as one facial with high frequency electrode added to it. And you can use dermawand as often as needed to achieve and maintain the results desired. If you want to know how it will feel, smell and work look up a local spa in your area that offers high frequency and go get a procedure done with the electrode. The dermawand is definetly a good buy. You will achieve even better results with higher (pharmaseutical grade) serum, check with your dermatologist or an esthetician who has been working with your skin to see which serum would be best for you.</li>
            <li> I am not at all happy with this item. I really feel I will be returning it.</li>
            <li> Since using Derma Wand I see a difference in wrinkles.Firmer skin!!</li>
            <li> For little money, this is totally worth it. Don&#x27;t expect miracle and it may take longer than you want. I am 50 years old and I&#x27;ve been using this for last 4 years. I look better now than I did 10 years ago. I actually took down some of the photos from then.  My personal opinion is that effectiveness of this product really depends on how your skin is built. My husband uses it (when I gently nudge him) and just one use you can see an amazing transformation. For me, the result isn&#x27;t as dramatic as his. I convinced my sister to buy it and the result is very small on her. It&#x27;s a small investment for potentially what you may get. You could be like my husband! His face look just like the video you see for the product.</li>
            <li> My wife is extremely satisfied with the results after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> The reviews before my purchase was 50/50 but decided the negative were most likely those expecting a miracle. I&#x27;d also seen the infomercials as well and on HSN. Although I have been only using for three days I realize the infomercials were somewhat smoke and mirrors. The negative reviews that complained their faces turned red even on the lowest setting is true, but it also states in the instruction booklet it might. But it stays red like a lite sunburn, some said their face broke out, unfortunately mine did as well. Looks like acne, which I haven&#x27;t had since my teens. The lifting of the brow like you see in the infomercials does not happen, and I have used a total of 6 times now. But they make you believe it happens the first use, it has not lifted at all. The furrow between my brows is less noticeable, but the lite creasing or wrinkles under the eyes are now more defined and noticeable, have to say that made me very angry. So the expression if it seems to good to be true, listen to that. Will continue to use for a few more weeks, if it get worse or I don&#x27;t get more positive results, I will chalk it up to my own stupidity and never purchase another so call age defying miracle again and learn to except my wrinkles. I&#x27;m almost 60 and my friends have not fared as well as I have so I should count my blessings.</li>
            <li> I tried it in LESS than 30 days &amp; call to return it.  Customer service said that it got deliver on the 3rd or 4th to the Post Office but it didn&#x27;t come to my house til the 7th!!!! I could not return a product that did NOTHING for me because of the time it got to the Post Office and NOT MY HOUSE!!!! Rude &amp; horrible!!!!! Don&#x27;t waste YOUR HARD EARN MONEY!!!! Terrible customer service also!!!!!!!  Get the word out!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in my wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 and have been using this produce for about a month.  Have noticed my skin does appear smoother and a slight lift in my one eyelid. The other eye lid is extremely droopy and don&#x27;t know that anything will work on it other than surgery. Some of the deeper creases at the smile line have softened. I think the skin care creams that come with the derma wand are garbage. I use Boots No. 7 Intense. Its cheap and works great as a conductor for this product.  I will keep using it and would recommend it to others.  You just have to know that it isn&#x27;t going to work miracles right away. When I use it twice a day as suggested, I see better results at my age. I think if you are younger, you will see more results than if you don&#x27;t start it till your 60&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I dont see that it is doing anything form me but I am going to give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> Really like this. I enjoy using it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt. I haven&#x27;t seen too much of a difference except for looking slightly younger. Fresher face. Did not come with the pink bag or any bag.</li>
            <li> Returned. Did not do what it was sold as. I saw no difference in my wrinkles or skin tone after using for 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Using dermawand didn&#x27;t do anything for me. As a matter of fact there were more wrinkles under my eyes after the initial swelling was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was extremely difficult to return the product and I had to waist unbelievable amount of time on a phone with the customer service. Not only this, but a couple of weeks after I got the the dermawand itself, they sent a box with over a $100 of cosmetics that I did not order. I am still dealing with the customer service to get my money back.&amp;#34;Investigation&amp;#34; that they started about that shipment is still not completed 10 days after.</li>
            <li> I was excited to use the Derma Wand.  I watched all the videos and was using it daily.  Unfortunately, it made me break out really badly.  From all the reviews that I&#x27;ve read, this seems to be rare.  I was disappointed because I was hopeful this was going to be a great in-home wrinkle treatment for me.</li>
            <li> Received az a gift and dedicated way too many hours and hopes for just a minimal improvement but no change whatsoever!! In watching the silly commercial back now...I see at least one womans &amp;#34; after &amp;#34;  pic, is not even a photograph,  it&#x27;s a sketch!  Check it out ...older woman.  It appears another client, same deal with sketch or poorly altered photo. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t have to deal with the payment issues which seem to have plaqued everyone onntop of the disappointment of time spent hoping.</li>
            <li> This product did not work as stated, zero visible results. The manufacture states reduces visible line and lifts the skin, this claim was not what I experienced.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this product ~ it delivers what it claims.  No plastic surgery needed to tighten up your skin ~ get it, use it twice a day, and you will be very glad you did.</li>
            <li> I just know, if I use daily there will be a big difference!  pores much smaller after 1st use &amp; diff. in jowls!!</li>
            <li> Bought two of these, one for mom and one for myself.  Haven&#x27;t used them for very long but so far I can tell some difference so I&#x27;d say they are a terrific age defying device.  They do not work over night.  You have to keep using the Derma Wand daily to see the effects, and you will if you stay with it.</li>
            <li> The product works very well. I feel more firmness on my skin and somewhat \\&quot;refreshed\\&quot;. I have been following my regimen religiously, and I intend to continue doing so. I am pleased with the purchase!!!</li>
            <li> It was recommended by several estheticians in the skin care industry to invest in this product to help minimize breakouts.  I have been using the Derma Wand now for over a month, and have already seen phenomenal results!  It not only is a great product to create oxygenation to kill bacteria, but it also helps to minimize puffiness and fine lines around the eye contour area when used with an eye cream and appropriate moisturizer.    I would recommend this product to anyone!    C Patterson  Atlanta, GA</li>
            <li> I get good results with the derma-wand using it with Elizabeth Gant&#x27;s anti-aging serums and doing it slightly differnt than the directions. It requires more work than advertised, but I don&#x27;t mind, the results are worth it to me. (the directed way did not work with me)&lt;br /&gt;I use it once, or twice, a day. I cover all my skin in rows (like cutting grass with a lawn mower) leaving no area untreated (except tender eye-lids.)  I use a high setting everywhere except upper-eye area under brows.</li>
            <li> I use this twice daily and I can really see a big difference.  I would tell anyone to purchase it and see the results themselves. I love the way it will lift up the brow line also.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get this to get rid of wrinkles..I don&#x27;t have that problem. My problem was of a double chin in the jowl area....I&#x27;m one of those people who accumulate fat on my face..even though I am not overweight (well maybe a tad) and only eat whole foods, no alcohol or junk food. I also exercise regularly. I was eager to get started with Dermawand when I saw the infomercial and started using this and started seeing an improvement IMMEDIATELY after my first use.  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and I  love the effects on my face People keep commenting how good I look and keep asking me if I had lost weight...nope it&#x27;s Derma Wand!</li>
            <li> The bulb fizzled out within 6 months. When I called dermawand to return their item on their 1 year warrenty apparently it is not valid even though  it was included in my shipment from them. The customer service rep said I had to call amazon.</li>
            <li> Wow, I love this little gadget! It is better than I expected. I really feel like my skin is smoother. I am very pleasantly surprised. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Oh how I love my derma wand!! I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. Due to a family emergency, I haven&#x27;t been faithful with twice a day, yet, my laugh lines have noticeably decreased and even disappeared in areas! The texture of my skin has improved and my neck doesn&#x27;t have sagging! My eyes still need work, but they didn&#x27;t get the way they were overnight! I love the oxygenated smell and what it&#x27;s done for my pores! No more crows feet! I&#x27;ll be able to start using it twice a day soon. At a gathering, no one could believe that I&#x27;m in my slightly over mid 50&#x27;s lol. It&#x27;s given me a lot more confidence and compliments!! I wear very little if any make-up too! I don&#x27;t need to hide under it!&lt;br /&gt; The lotion that comes with this dries too fast, so I use my grapeseed oil or Argon oil. Any vegetable oil will actually work, I just prefer grapeseed because it naturally helps build collagen and I like a little bit at night anyway. The instruction book is confusing. The first half of the CD is on YouTube, Derma Wand, Start Here. That&#x27;s easy to follow! You need a computer to watch the full CD. You&#x27;ll be happy with this! I am!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t wait to see the change in six months! I took a before picture!</li>
            <li> So far no results.  Have used for several weeks and so far not much of a change.  Was hoping for at least some improvement. Don&#x27;t have that many wrinkles so was looking for a little improvement.</li>
            <li> Caution on this product. I believe we all have different conditions in aging that make the very same product effective or not. For me it did not work at all. However I wouldn&#x27;t go so far as to say this product wouldn&#x27;t work on anyone.</li>
            <li> I love it and I use it every day and I see so many positive changes I will purchase  again, when mine wears out.  Thank you.  Excellent and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I was not very satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.  I haven&#x27;t really used it.  It has been inconvenient to use as I don&#x27;t want to take the  time.  Not sure if this works.</li>
            <li> Received this two days ago and have used it 3 times.  After the first use I noticed a difference with my eyelids, they don&#x27;t look as saggy or puffy as usual.  Really Simple to use and it is not painful.  Cannot wait to see what effect it will have on my appearance in a couple of months,😜</li>
            <li> I can see results. Better to use it 2xs daily.</li>
            <li> I purchased this specifically to treat my cold sores as recommended by a friend.  I cannot make claims as to the skincare as I do not use it for that but let me tell you, since using this to zap my cold sores at first tingle, I have only had one that materialized.  I was away from home when it started but by the next day I used it and it was gone in 3 days, with no blister, scab or bleeding.  If you suffer with cold sores you know what I mean.  I have had mine for about 6 years and it is starting to get weak as they do.  I am purchasing another today.</li>
            <li> I gave this a try for almost 4 months, twice a day. As much as I wanted to believe it worked, I saw no difference whatsoever. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> .....I&#x27;m unsure if it&#x27;s not using the products supplied with the kit.  But, I&lt;br /&gt;thought from previous reviews, a moisturizer was key.  So, I had my own&lt;br /&gt;under-eye Vitamin E moisturizer and Retinol Night Cream/Day Cream&lt;br /&gt;moisturizers.  When I combined these with the Derma-Vital post-cream/&lt;br /&gt;spray, my skin would break-out w/ a pimple (here...or there).  So, I figured&lt;br /&gt;as long as I had the essential moisturizers on my skin while using the DermaWand,&lt;br /&gt;my skin would withstand the heat from the &amp;#34;light therapy&amp;#34; (which feels like&lt;br /&gt;someone taking static shocks, on your face).  I guess I can try this, again.....since&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop, for my skin to heal &amp; under eye mild burning to stop  I still wonder&lt;br /&gt;if it&#x27;s the level I had it on (I reverted from a level 3 under my eyes.....to a 2......&lt;br /&gt;but, now I&#x27;m gonna try a 1.  I also used a level 8, for the rest of my face....).....then,&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try a lower setting.  If not, then I&#x27;m just gonna do a skin peel.  My under-eye&lt;br /&gt;puffiness is still here.</li>
            <li> as with most stuff like this it was a waste of money.  I&#x27;m going to start putting all the money I would use to buy junk like this in a facelift fund starting NOW</li>
            <li> I have been using the wand for about 2 weeks straight.  So far I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve noticed any difference and I haven&#x27;t gotten any external feedback either.  I will continue to use in the hopes of seeing a noticeable change.</li>
            <li> This is an advanced radio high frequency beauty teatment to reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, puffy eyes, saggy, tired complexion and enlarged pores.  It purifies, oxygenates, stimulates and rejuvenates.  I know it works as I told no one I was using it and have received so many compliments and inquiries as to what I am doing to make my skin look so much younger.  I use it twice a day for about three minutes, and &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34; it is not painful. This is one of the least expensive ways to make your face and neck look younger, give you more confidence, and keep everyone guessing as to your age.  This is a product for everyone.</li>
            <li> I have seen the difference in my skin in just a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the dermawand since 1998 and NEVER want to be without one. If It seems, myne gets to be a little old, I order one before the old one would die on me. What an amazing product. No person, women or man should be without this amazing repair tool.</li>
            <li> I have been using this every morning (suppose to use it twice a day, but just can&#x27;t seem to find enough time to do this) it only says to use for three minutes but it takes a little longer than that because I feel I need to spend a little more time while I have it out. It makes my skin tingle and I do feel tighter skin so I assume it is working, but will have to continue use to make up my mind on how much it works. Its easy to use but just makes getting ready take a little longer everyday.&lt;br /&gt;5/31/14- Have been using the wand for a few weeks now, I really like the way it makes my face feel and it does seem to make my face feel tighter, it has become a routine for me and I don&#x27;t even think about it anymore, its just something that I do after I wash my face. It becomes something that you do faster with each time you use it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to take a long time at all (I still only use it in the AM, just can&#x27;t seem to be bothered to use it at night ?? not sure why)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this from the manufacturer, agreed for $140 for product then charged me $99.00 for shipping . The product is Just OK, seen a very little change after a month. Bought it off their TV promo..Not happy with their very deceptive advertising.</li>
            <li> I could probably give this more stars if I were not 100 years old, plus I don&#x27;t use it but once a week at most because I lack the time to do so; however, hope springs eternal and if it stimulates the production of collagen, all is not lost.  You will find that it is easy to use and if used properly, it should make a dent in any wrinkle you might have.  I definitely would give it a go&amp;#34; if you are serious about diminishing lines on your face.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long, but it already seems to be working. Just be careful, follow the instructions! It can burn you a little bit, but not if you pay CLOSE ATTENTION to the instructions, will check in later, after I have used it a couple months</li>
            <li> I am not sure it works or not.&lt;br /&gt;I try more often in the future.&lt;br /&gt;Five more words required???&lt;br /&gt;People does not want to make a review...</li>
            <li> The results are not as spectacular as advertised, but if I see some progress. The problem I have is that the DermaWand is damage. I have not been dropped, nor has it received any abuse. It has a one year warranty and I need help to change me a new one free of charge, as does the warranty</li>
            <li> I love this product! I just received it about a week ago and was waiting to see results before writing a review. The Derma Wand is fast, easy to use and it explains how it works as well as what you should expect...and most of all it delivers. I am almost 39 years old, look pretty young for my age and figured it would be a great tool to add to my anti aging routine.What I disliked was the facial gel it came with because I felt it didn&#x27;t moisturize as I would have liked but it&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t a problem, I use my anti aging moisturizer in conjunction with the Derma Wand instead.  Now the current issue I had were blackheads on my nose regardless of my cleansing and facial mask routine, there were several dots that weren&#x27;t going away unless extracted. I must say, the Derma Wand is taking care of it! Just noticed this morning my blackheads are gone, my skin feels firmer and radiant. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I got busy and missed the 30 day return time frame or I would have sent mine back. I had read many reviews and women&lt;br /&gt;talked of lines softening, spots fading, and most made it sound like a miracle wand. I have used mine 2 -3 times a&lt;br /&gt;day on the highest setting for 6 weeks and see no results at all. None of the fine lines are gone or softened and&lt;br /&gt;I had a couple of spots and they are the same. I had a friend take my pics and also look and she doesn&#x27;t see a&lt;br /&gt;bit of change either. I am in my 50&#x27;s so it may work better for younger women. I had hoped for a little change at least&lt;br /&gt;for the cost, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I did notice that my sagging jaw line tightened up, my pores did look smaller, and my face looked firmer.  You do have to use it awhile (a few weeks) before you begin to notice, but it does work.  Be careful NOT to use the bulb under your eyes on anything higher than a 1 or 2 level.  I did this (not noticing that I was not supposed to go as high as I did) and the next day I looked liked someone had beaten me!!  Under my eyes were enormously puffy and it took a few days for the swelling to go down.  Great product though!</li>
            <li> Customer service is severely lacking. Bad information and direction. Forget about money back guarantee, it&#x27;s non existent even if directions are followed to the letter. Do NOT order this product from Derma Wand, you will be sorry. Read another review&lt;br /&gt;that Derma Wand sent collections after them after the item was returned for not working.  Beware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks but I can already see an improvement under my chin. Working on jawline now and expecting it to tighten up, too. Easy to use, just need moisture with it - I&#x27;m using an Olay night creme I had in my cabinet. I like using the wand while I&#x27;m watching TV.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin look rested.  Not sure whether the treatment will long-term.  I like to use it before I go out.</li>
            <li> I used Derma Wand for 5 months, morning and night, but didn&#x27;t see any difference in wrinkles or skin tone. I was very faithful in using it. I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and was really hoping to see results but unfortunate didn&#x27;t. I called the help line and was told to use it for longer period of time on my trouble spots and that didn&#x27;t work either. I feel like I wasted my money in buying this product.</li>
            <li> Ive not seen any results as of yet. Ive been using it twice a day since I got it. Not sure if its going to work for me.</li>
            <li> Good product. No results yet, but I&#x27;m hopeful!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derma Wand for a few days and as skeptical as I was at first, I do see it making my pores smaller, smoother skin texture,and firmness and the laugh lines are fading.  Since everyone has a different skin type, results could be vastly different from one person to the next, but for me, it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Results right away.  5 minutes every morning and night.  75 years old and taking the age and wrinkles off the neck and face. Even sagging skin. Love it.  Daughter at 52 is using it and its doing wonders even on her much younger skin.  You will love it and everyone will wonder how much you paid to take the wrinkles off your face.</li>
            <li> first off, I was only able to use this product for 3 weeks, so I can&#x27;t say this product does not work, just why I dislike it and stopped using it after 3 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the 3 weeks I used it twice a day, as directed. It took around 20 minutes to complete all of the suggested exercises. I used this with the Aloe that was included for the 1st 3 minutes massaging my face, I did not like the included aloe, it dries fast and is very sticky so the wand did not glide smoothly over my face unless I used a ton of it and then the buzzing sound made from the wand was hardly noticeable which made me believe it was not working properly. I then would wipe off the remaining aloe and use my moisturizer; this works much better with the wand and you could actually feel and hear the zapping from the wand. The zapping was not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the 3 weeks I noticed no improvements with any of my very fine lines or firming of the skin, my acne did not improve and my skin texture became worse as I now have tiny bumps that consume my face. I did however notice that my skin was starting to lift, but only for a few hours and a very little non noticeable lift only noticed because you could see tiny skin ripples by my ears. And I really don’t want that type of lift, I want my collagen restored as I thought this product was supposed to help with. I know it says to use this product for 6 weeks to see improvement especially if you do not have bad wrinkles or saggy skin, but I had to stop as I felt like this product was making my skin texture worse and I really do not have high hopes that it will improve my fine lines I have. I have now started to see a Dermatologist and having chemical peels done to improve my acne and hopefully rid my face of these tiny bumps that consume it now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I wish I would have saved my money and used it toward treatments that will work for me.</li>
            <li> I think the magic of this product is hyped.  I tried it for a month.  It did nothing for me.</li>
            <li> Have wrinkles and sagging skin, have used religiously with no results. This is my first negative review but have to be honest.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROMA AMAZON. BUY DIRECTLY FROM DERMAWAND.  I purchased this production in September 2013.  It broke yesterday - April 16, 2014 and will no longer work.  I called Dermawand to get it fixed - It was out of warranty in November 2013.  They told me to call Amazon.  I called Amazon and they referred me back to Dermawand.  Because I did not buy it directly from them they will not replace it.  I asked not for replacement, but that I would pay for repairs.  They told me that they do not repair, they replace and since I did not buy directly from Dermawand there is no replacement.  I have to buy a new one.  SO DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM AMAZON.  If the dermawand breaks, you have to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I sure hoped it would work for me.  Months later, I find that time is still winning with aging effect in spite of faithful use..  I tried what they show on TV with the lift to the eyebrows.  Doesn&#x27;t do a thing.  Maybe for younger skin it works better.  I&#x27;m in my early 60&#x27;s. I am disappointed.  I gave it two stars because it is nicely packaged and I could have gotten a refund, but I chose to keep trying and hoping for a result.  My bad choice.</li>
            <li> See a little improvements</li>
            <li> I have been giving myself treatments for a week.I know nothing is going to improve in one week but I do feel a different in my skin.It does take a little to get used to but now that I do it daily after my shower before bedtime.Its become a ritual. I am excited to see what results i get after a moth of dedicated usage.</li>
            <li> Just beginning and works really well. My problem is keeping on schedule (am improving on that). Give it a try,,,</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Derma Wand Kit about a month ago.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it, it actually worked, so I ordered another kit to give to a friend as a gift.</li>
            <li> I returned the Derma Wand kit and would not even give it a one star.  After reading about the radio high frequency being put into your body with the use of this, I opted to return it and valued my health versus having wrinkles.  I know it stated this is used round the world for trreatments, but who goes to the spa for $100 treatment twice a day as this is recommending to use.  It even stated about possible interference with your radio or tv and I decided this was not something I wanted to use.  Sorry Derma  Wand, but this is just my opinion!!!</li>
            <li> Be careful or you will get a returned Derma Wand like I got.  It was obviously returned by the packaging and there was even an empty plastic bag that was suppose to have face products I think.  The unit seems to work but it would have been nice to get the products with it.</li>
            <li> The wand is easy to use, easy to incorporate into a morning routine, and I quite satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product. It was a fairly simple return; however it took a very long time to get my money returned to my acct. The company also charged me $19.95 for cream that I didn&#x27;t ordered after I cancelled. They again sent out another charge and jar of this cream without my consent. Be aware.</li>
            <li> It does not work, very disappointed  I thought this product will work</li>
            <li> worthless.  Used it for a month and felt some electric but I think I&#x27;d have to use this 30 minutes a day every day to see any remote finding.</li>
            <li> This is great,I use it every day.  Feels funny at first, but I really think it has helped my skin.  After I use it I moisturizer my skin and always spray with mineral water.  My husband has noticed the difference too!</li>
            <li> The steps were complicated and confusing.  A small card or poster to put by your mirror to start would help.  I thought that it was unlikely I would use it more than a couple time due to the many steps and convoluted instructions.  Simply not worth the time to me.</li>
            <li> I did not feel as if it was doing the job that I wanted it to do.</li>
            <li> the shocks of this product are a little strong but I wong because my wrinkles decrease, I love this product.</li>
            <li> It was missing all the products that were to come with the unit.  Not happy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had weird puffiness under my eyes for a while now.  I&#x27;ve tried Botox, fillers and even puff-be-gone cremes and gels.  Nothing has made them go away until I started using Derma Wand.  I love the way it makes my skin feel stimulated - it really seems to energize my face. I feel healthier with my new glow and the bags are gone!  I&#x27;d highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> This did nothing for me. I used it just as I was supposed to and even more after a while of noticing nothing. It might work for some but was a hit and miss for me.</li>
            <li> It definitely helps if you stay on top of it.  If you miss a session, it will show on your face.</li>
            <li> I have to say I like using this after sleeping all night I wake up and my skin is so soft&lt;br /&gt;update 4-14-16:  I still love my Dermawand my skin is tone and texture is even and I no longer have dry spots on areas of my face.  I would buy another one if something happened to mine.</li>
            <li> I started using it about a month ago.  My skin is much more firm than it use to be.  You have to follow the directions when using this type of product.  Within 2 days, I had it turned up to the max.  If you faithfully use it daily, you will see results. i was a little taken back by the reviews some people gave but thought if it did not work I&#x27;m only out a little over a hundred.  I&#x27;m glad I purchased and would purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I like it, but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting the results I wanted.  It&#x27;s easy to use but at the same time, very time consuming.  Think I may pay the money to go and get some quicker results.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to buy the Derma Wand.It&#x27;s been a month of using it, with no changes to my face. not even smaller pores. I really didn&#x27;t expect it to do anything for wrinkles, but I thought at the very least, maybe my skin appearance would look better. Also, the DVD that came with it, didn&#x27;t work, so I looked it up online, for instructions.</li>
            <li> I cant really see that it is improving my skin. I have used it for two months.  I will keep using it.  I hope to give it a better review.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t see any difference. Don&#x27;t think I got much benefit. Kind of a rip off, wish I hadn&#x27;t spent the money on it.</li>
            <li> Although it was good at moisturizing, no effect at all.  Waste of money.  I wish I had not missed the return date.</li>
            <li> I have used this twice a day for 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use and see if I can notice a difference after a month.</li>
            <li> So far so good but I have only used it about a week. I had a lot of sun damage after a trip to the beach.  My skin has already improved.</li>
            <li> Only been using this for a few days, but I am happy with it.  I think it is working.</li>
            <li> I have used this product over the last couple of months and I like the short term results that I achieved.  Indeed, I purchased a second hand held to keep at another house. love this product.  There appears to be a problem with the quality of the handhelds, as they seem to burn out rapidly..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the first wand stopped working, I called customer service and after submitting proof of purchase to them, I was allowed to mail the wand back to their shipping division in GA at my expense.  In addition, Dermawand charged me $25 in advance for the &#x27;convenience&#x27; of returning the hand held, presumably to cover their shipping and handling charges.  Given the cost of the unit itself, I thought that this was a cheesy way of handling customer complaints.  In any event a new wand was sent to me by the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning I had a SECOND one of these wands stop working.  I am now faced with the prospect of bearing the cost of having this wand replaced or just taking the decision to ditch the wand and finding some alternative to such products..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These wands are relatively expensive  and in my opinion they should have a life span longer than that of a child&#x27;s toy.</li>
            <li> Not very happy with this purchase.  Still have time to return/exchange it and I&#x27;m going to.&lt;br /&gt;According to the instruction manual and DVD included with this, you are supposed to feel a tingle sensation.  I feel no tingle sensation whatsoever.  I made sure the cap was removed, I even tried it at the highest setting......no tingle.  I emailed DermaWand customer service twice before receiving a response, a response of which was simply &#x27;not everyone feels the tingle sensation right away&#x27;.  That &amp;#34;response&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t sit right with me.  How long am I supposed to use it in order to feel the sensation they say I am supposed to feel?  I definitely want to give this product a chance, so I&#x27;m hoping the one I purchased is just defective and when I exchange it the new one does something.</li>
            <li> This thing worked for 1 week then quit. Do Not waste your money!!</li>
            <li> Used this product everyday . At first my skin looked flushed and it seemed to be working . Still after 30 days , I see no reduced wrinkles and lines . I knew it wouldn&#x27;t remove them , but after reading the reviews I thought it would help diminish the looks of them. Most of the reviews were good , that is the only reason I ordered this product. I will continue using this product just to see of any improvements. Very disappointed up to this point in time.</li>
            <li> Well the CD was broken when I got it!..but ive seen reviews on YouTube! And I have only used it three times and notice improvments!..I got it for my double chin, pores, and laugh lines..and I think its great! But not much on my eye bags..but still good:)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work and next to impossible to return even with a \\&quot;free trial\\&quot;. It&#x27;s more than a month that I keep getting charges on my credit card. Their excuse - the \\&quot;backlog\\&quot; of complaints.</li>
            <li> Very PLEASED and HAPPY with my Derma Wand!!! it does exactly what it says it does - my pores are looking smaller and the lines around my nose/grin lines are slowly disappearing!!! Great buy and if you choose to buy this you will not be unhappy!!!</li>
            <li> Forget all the negative reviews, this product is GREAT! Just start out on a low setting and get ready to see awesome results!!!</li>
            <li> I do know yet how it will work, i have not used the dermwant for very long, i hope to see some difference in the short future.</li>
            <li> The Dermawand kit is in excellent condition as the arrived and service.  Thanks you very much.  I recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> crow&#x27;s feet and wrinkles...haven&#x27;t seen a difference. but, I have seen a difference in my pores. within minutes of using it the first time my pores were smaller. so, smaller pores is an A+ for me. --- I read lots of reviews on this product. one thing you have to remember, each person is different and their skin will react differently. no difference in wrinkles for me, but, a big difference in the size of my pores!</li>
            <li> I used it religiously for a few months.. I thought I saw a little skin tightening at first, but then there were no further effects and I stopped using it at all.  They ought to allow refunds after six months, when you have had time to see if it  works or not.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my mother, and  she loved it. We got it pretty fast in the mail, no hassle. She has been using it for a week or so now and he feels very confident in her one week results. A boost of engery</li>
            <li> Seriously, radio frequency?  There are so many major health risks that come with RF... I can&#x27;t believe they were allowed to get this pattened.</li>
            <li> Though only having used a few weeks, I notice a different in my skin tone, including the backs of my hands, lips, and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.  I don&#x27;t think wrinkles are less deep yet, but less noticeable to general improvement. Easy to use and fit into my schedule.</li>
            <li> Well... I cannot believe how great this product is... I am from the Caribbean and ordered this product because of its reviews...    I have never looked better... my face looks and feels so smooth after using this after 3 days....    Acne breakouts subside and flatten....    I am going to buy another one just to put in storage.. in-case they stop production on this...    I have never used a product like this.. it actually gets ride of cold sores too....  I will never have acne breakout again..    blessings</li>
            <li> It does not tighten your skin like advertised. When you use it to push up your eybrows and forehead, it is the same as using your finger tips. You can buy a book for facial exercises that shows you how to use your fingertips to push up your eyebrows and get the same result if not better. Anyway, I took pictures from the first day onward to track any progression, but saw absolutely no results in wrinkles, or tightness. It did improve my pimple situation, but that&#x27;s all. I still use it every once in a while for skin imperfections. Very disappointing product.</li>
            <li> This works, but you have to be consistent in using it to maintain tightening of the facial and jawline muscles, and to keep the neckline from sagging. You can adjust the current, so you aren&#x27;t too uncomfortable. I recommend starting on a lower setting and building up your tolerance. It does sting a bit if you aren&#x27;t used to it, as it is using electrical current to stimulate your facial muscles to contract. If you are not consistent, you will not see results. If you stop using it, your muscles won&#x27;t stay nice and tight. Don&#x27;t expect it to work overnight, but I noticed results, especially around my eyes and mouth, after the first few uses. Worth the price if you are starting to notice some sagging of the jaw and neckline and don&#x27;t want to do anything drastic like plastic surgery. I don&#x27;t know how it would work on someone with a lot of sagging and loose skin. I&#x27;m using it to prevent that from happening. I also use it with hyaluronic acid serum with vitamin c and sometimes with vitamin e. It&#x27;s a nice at-home facial.</li>
            <li> been using 2 months every day.  no results seen!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought my Derma Wand kit a little over a month ago and what a difference!!  I&#x27;m 59 and I&#x27;ve always had kind of dry skin so I deal with wrinkles.  Nothing too overwhelming but it just made aging that much more depressing.  I saw the Derma Wand commercial and decided to try it.  Wow, am I glad I did!  The deep laugh lines I had are all but gone, the lines around my mouth are too.  The skin under my chin has tightened up with no more sag.  The skin under my eyes has tightened up and the puffiness is almost completely gone.  I can&#x27;t say enough about the satisfaction I have with results I&#x27;ve seen so far!  It is worth every penny to feel this good and not have to go under the knife.  I would say though that you have to be consistent with using it and definitely use a good moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve found that I prefer my Mary Kay products but I know everyone has a certain skin care regiment that suits them.  I wish I had invented it...</li>
            <li> Item as described, I have been using this product daily and love the results. Would recommend this to others.Quick shipment.</li>
            <li> Today is the first day of trying this Derma Wand. So far it is not working as stated.I feel no tingleling nor do I feel it is working,as started ithe instruction book.    I shall try to get some information from the Licensd Beauty  Professional. Juanita</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I was very skeptical. I am 47 yrs old and although I did not expect any miracles or to look 20 years younger,  I am impressed with the Derma Wand. My face feels tighter, looks clearer and the fine lines are getting less noticable.  My neck as well.  It is simple to use and I am happy that i purchased it. I have only been using it for about 4 weeks now, but thrilled with my results.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it long..will write a comment later after I use it for a while..will have to see the results</li>
            <li> Who&#x27;s the youngest looking 60 year old of all - ME! Younger looking than all my children&#x27;s in-laws that are all younger in years than me, thanks to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my Derma Wand from the infomercial - I wish I had bought it from Amazon. Like most of the reviews say, the products that come with it are less than worthless, but I saw results in about 3 days, so decided to keep it because I also read about the hassle of the return process and decided to return it and buy from Amazon, just wasn&#x27;t worth a few bucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not good with routine. I stay up too late, work too many long hours and don&#x27;t always feel like doing this twice a day - and sometimes I don&#x27;t. Yet, I can&#x27;t stop looking at myself in the mirror. I know this sounds vain, but after about 6 weeks, the results are amazing. The &amp;#34;marionette&amp;#34; lines around my nose and mouth have almost disappeared and I see reductions in the deep lines around my forehead. The area around my eyes is better too. In spite of all this, I still sometimes skip my twice a day, but other times, I&#x27;ll do a quick afternoon &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; just because I can&#x27;t believe how good it looks. When I really set down to do it, I spend more than 5 minutes because I have several areas that need the work. I HAD, not only the deep lines around my nose and mouth, but sagging skin at my jaw line, the beginnings of a &amp;#34;turkey&amp;#34; neck (thanks to the genes from my Other grandmother) and the skin on my decolletage was looking wrinkly,all now much improved, but, this is why I sometimes do my &amp;#34;quickies&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I&#x27;ve got good ageing genes. By example, my grandmother taught me the value good skin care. She still had beautiful skin at the age of 90 - my mom, did not care about her skin, and it shows. Yet I did not start a good skin-care regime until I was in my 30&#x27;s and I still use the same product, Clairns. However, while Clairns really did help clear up what had always been mediocre skin and made it look nice, the clock DID continue to tick and I decided that the lines were just going to be something I would have to live with. NOT ANYMORE! The firmer, plumper look of younger looking skin is a reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I almost named my post &amp;#34;Addictive&amp;#34; because once you start seeing the results, it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a side story: I recently had my 60th birthday. After dinner, my husband and I joined our neighbors on their front porch for a glass of wine. My neighbor asked which birthday it was and I just replied, &amp;#34;a big one&amp;#34;. She said, &amp;#34;ahh, one with a zero on the end?&amp;#34; Then laughing she said, &amp;#34;What, did you finally turn 50?&amp;#34; I just smiled and shook my head no. Her mouth dropped open and she said, &amp;#34;but you can&#x27;t POSSIBLY be 60!!?&amp;#34; That felt so good.</li>
            <li> I know that there is a lot of controversy regarding if the Dermawand really works.  I have been using it for a couple of weeks and I already notice a subtle change in the tightness of my skin.  I am going to continue to use it.  It is a hassle to stop and use it every night but if I didn&#x27;t think it was helping, I would not bother.  In the long run, I think it will prevent further sagging and wrinkles and its helping what I already have.</li>
            <li> Dermawand arrived very quickly and I started using it immediately! I definitely notice a difference...i believe this will save me a lot of money on all sorts of creams and potions that I waste money on because I see no results then just stop using it! I will keep you posted on my success...</li>
            <li> Results began to show in 5 days. My products work more effectively now too. I will use this faithfuly. Yes</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she love love loves her derma wand. She uses it all the time and every time I get an imperfection my mom is like use the derma wand.</li>
            <li> I chose a 1 star rating because the first time I used it the derma wand seemed to work fine but then it would not turn back down to a lower setting after I turned it to the highest setting and it proceeded to burn and the zapping was extremely unbearable so no I would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it! My husband can even tell the difference when I use it!</li>
            <li> Using this product religiously but not a whole lot of changes.</li>
            <li> I purchased my dermawand in November 2012, from Amazon. At least 5 times a week, 15 minutes daily I faithfully use it. I am a retired Chemistry teacher, and have made many observations about the product, its quality and capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, 3 minutes twice daily does nothing. You might as well not even bother if you follow the directions given.&lt;br /&gt;The product samples were very nice for treating my hands. For my face, they were a waste. The glass-tipped sensor always got all icked up, and had to be cleaned after regular use with alcohol to get rid of the sludge which hinders its effectiveness. NOWHERE does it state that this must be done.&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face, and use a toner to clean off any residue. The skin is damp, and the dermawand works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;The dermawand has reduced the very fine lines around my lips, and plumped them. It has reduced the redness leftover from my multiple laser surgeries for a port wine stain birthmark which I had done back in the 1990s. It has faded the scar that resulted when my son accidentally bumped the scab off postprocedure.&lt;br /&gt;I have eliminated all but three skin tags from one side of my neck. Two on the other side are barely visible. The faint lines between my brows are faded, and I have no crows feet or facial lining.&lt;br /&gt;I wish there was a model with twice the power. I have a residual scar and loose skin from the swelling of my neck due to an inflamed thyroid which was removed in 2011. The scar is faintly visible, but if the unit was more powerful it would have more successfully and completely eliminated the puckers in my neck and stretched skin from where my thyroid damaged it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing the unit cannot do for me is to stimulate collagen growth under my eyes, where there are hollows that began to appear after my thyroid surgery and worsened after I was diagnosed with cancer in June 2012. The darkness was eliminated, but I still have the hollows there.&lt;br /&gt;If the manufacturers would design a higher powered unit, I would be delighted to have one. It is of my opinion that if I was not putting in the time every night after I shower, and just dinked around with this 6 minutes a day, it would do nothing. Significant change in the skin can only be accomplished at least by doubling or tripling its intensity.&lt;br /&gt;As for products, I alternate between the Peter Thomas Roth line, and whatever I have on the dressing table--Roc, Booth (from Target), Loreal. I use the product AFTER I work with the dermawand.&lt;br /&gt;I think there would be many more happier customers if  this unit was more of a medical device and less of a massager.&lt;br /&gt;If the makers decide to upgrade this product I for one would be delighted to participate in a study, or to buy another one. It is good, but there is a lot of room for improvement. I did not buy mine through their site--I paid about $60 for mine on Amazon, and for that price I most certainly got my money&#x27;s worth. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have used it once every night for about 5 to 10 minutes. I thought I could see some good results. It wasn&#x27;t until one of my friends at work told me I looked really rested and my wrinkles had soften. That&#x27;s all it took they wanted to know how I did it. Try it you can always return it but I think you will be happy.</li>
            <li> I use this twice a day and so far I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t see a difference</li>
            <li> I am very much impressed with this product. Here are my reasons: it helps break down the bacteria in acne, it does increase collagen on my skin, it does tighten the pores and creates a toned and uplifted look. Always with anything, use moderation, common sense and read the instructions as well as safety precautions. I am loving how it minimizes and kills the bacteria with acne. I am learning how to improve the pores, it even helps with a odd acne condition I have, where these white small bumps \\&quot;acne cosmetica\\&quot; is lessened. Those white bumps grow from underneath the skin and for some unexplainable reason are not turned over every night as they should. So they end up pilling up and then require extraction which in my personal experience has been painful and costly and they just return again. This wand is helping circulate oxygen as evidenced by the smaller pores, less acne and helps the lymphatic system around the eyes drain. I will need to do some more research on the \\&quot;acne cosmetica\\&quot; and how the Derman Wand will work after a painful extraction (of course I will wait til I heal from the extraction before using the DM). Don&#x27;t forget, stress is one of the biggies for wrinkles and sun damage. My best to all of you who are in their pursuit of matching their external beauty with their internal beauty, God Bless.</li>
            <li> I bought this and 3-4 months later it would not go above the 1 setting! I emailed Amazon (that was the seller). They told me to email Derma Wand directly and, surprise!!, no response. I threw it away and bought something much better quality!</li>
            <li> I´ve been wanting to buy this product for years now, and did´t because i was either pregnant, nursing, pregnant again nursing again and didn´t really know if it was safe to use..... Finally i bought it for christmas, and have been using it twice a day for a month. The changes I´ve noticed for this past month has been in the texture and brightness of my skin. It is definetaly \\&quot;healthier looking\\&quot;. I haven´t noticed any major changes with wrinkles,  but it is not magic, it has only been a month...I´ll comment in a few more months and see if I´m getting younger!haha</li>
            <li> I felt the zapping feeling to be uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Simply works fantastic. The system on this requires me to have a minimum number of wods. There is just not a lot you can say about this except great.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied with this product!!  I did exactly what the dvd said and I do not show any improvement!!</li>
            <li> No good doesn&#x27;t work. Piece of junk. Don&#x27;t buy save ur money. Gonna try to get mine back if possible</li>
            <li> To be fair, I haven&#x27;t used it enough to know if it lends results.  Will get back to you.</li>
            <li> Not totally sure if it works. Used religiously twice a day for two months but didn&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> The first Derma Wand we ordered arrived dead.  Returned without hassle from Amazon!  Ordered again, arrived ok, worked fine... for 5 days then it lost 99% of it&#x27;s power for no reason what so ever. Never dropped or any abuse at all.  We&#x27;re buying the Professional Grade Portable High Frequency D&#x27;arsonval Facial Device.  DONE with Derma Wand, would have left zero stars if we could!!  Oh, and yes, we love the way these type of devices work, GREAT for acne and fever blister outbreaks!!</li>
            <li> Does not work. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> It was a gift but she loves it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my Derma-wand.  I love seeing my wrinkles disappear, pores closing, sagging eyelids getting tighter and that fresh smell that stays with me throughout the days I use it.</li>
            <li> I tried for 3 weeks, and I didn&#x27;t see any change.</li>
            <li> rubbish! they also sent everything to me in spanish</li>
            <li> Derma wand didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I plan to return it but I was 4 days late. Save you money!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Need to use more often.  I am now a slacker.</li>
            <li> like it if I would use it</li>
            <li> This is the same concept as the expensive radio frequency machines used by dermatologist, however, the frequency is so low that there is no comparison to the real deal.  The professional machines go down three layers so you get the maximum results.  With the derma wand, it only addresses the surface of the skin so the results, if any, are minimal.  I find that it is a little beneficial around the eyes but not the rest of the face and neck.</li>
            <li> This is a good product! I would use it every day if it was CORDLESS. I am using the NuFace device now instead. I would like to use both but find if it&#x27;s cordless I use it MUCH more often as it&#x27;s so easy to just get it and use while watching TV or in bed instead of having to go find a plug. If they come out with a cordless version or if I can trade this in for one, I&#x27;d certainly do that!</li>
            <li> I returned this product because I had a similar product already.</li>
            <li> Got my derma wand today I was so excited to begin using this only to have the instructions in spanish what a bummer :( what am I to do with this now ? I need it in English. I am very disappointed so I am giving it a 3 until I receive the instruction</li>
            <li> stop working 3 months after purchase</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and refreshing but mainly works very good, meaning that my face is getting healthier</li>
            <li> It feels good on your skin after used, almost the same feeling after facial tx @ the derm clinic. It takes dedication to do it  twice a day, &amp; the gel pre tx I don&#x27;t like it coz, it doesn&#x27;t let you do soft stroke during tx, my own moisturizer works better:)</li>
            <li> I use this to stop blemishes before they mature to the surface of the skin and it works. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles or crows feet so I can&#x27;t speak on how well they work on those cosmetic issues.</li>
            <li> Purchased 9/7/2014 in less the two months the wand does not turn on anymore.  Amazon&#x27;s 30 day return policy prevents me from replacing the wand.  Extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> this product is just a knock off of the real expensive wands that they use in the spas.  It hasnt worked at all</li>
            <li> This piece of junk made my skin look all dehydrated and wrinkled after using it for a month! When I received it, I got a dvd that was defective and didn&#x27;t work. I called them and the said they&#x27;d send another one. They never did.  If you THINK about it, the wand emits electric energy that zaps the skin.. that in of itself will dehydrate the skin can cause it to look even worse. They provide skin creams that make up for the dehydration, but the wand which you pay $200 for is useless.  Save your money. Just exfoliate with scrubs and peels and your skin will look a lot better.</li>
            <li> Been using the derma wand for about three weeks now lifting effects last about two hours and im hopjng that with daily use effects will ne lomger lastimg very easy to use</li>
            <li> I have acne and some wrinkle, i used everyday faithfully for 2 months straight and did not work at all, i even masage for half our and did not get rid of acne at all,,maybe give you the effect of lifting but is temporary,, it did nothing on my acne,,, not recomended, wasted of money</li>
            <li> I have been using the derma wand for about 3 weeks now.  There has been no miraculous removal of wrinkles from my face, but my face does look smoother and just better in general.  I will be 40 years old this month.  The one place I have seen good improvement is on my stomach.  I have 3 kids and after the 3rd baby, the skin on my stomach was left kinda loose.  My youngest is 3 now and no creams, lotions, sit-ups, etc has helped to tighten the skin on my stomach.  I started using derma want on it and have noticed some improvement, the skin is starting to tighten up.</li>
            <li> I was rather skeptical about purchasing the wand, but, what the heck, it only cost $100, worth the try.  After all, the surgeon&#x27;s estimate to surgically correct the problem was over $4,000.  Within 3 weeks of daily use, a very deep wrinkle under my eye improved about 75%.  That wrinkle was the reason I purchased the wand, so I am a very happy lady. Other areas are improving also.  This purchase is one of the best I have made in my life.  I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I wouldn&#x27;t be experiencing it myself.</li>
            <li> My wife says it Works well for her. Thanks god.</li>
            <li> I like it.  I saw some visible results, not as much as some of the claims I&#x27;ve seen in other reviews.  It definitely softened lines and I noticed my lip area lifted and my lips are slightly plumper.  I can&#x27;t say I saw any difference in my jowl area.  You have to be faithful to it.  I&#x27;m using it twice a day, I do it longer at night while watching TV before going to sleep and a quick overall after I moisturize in the morning before I apply make-up.  The results don&#x27;t last if you stop.  I didn&#x27;t like the moisturizer that came with it so I just use my own and find it works better for easy gliding over my skin.  Overall I think it works pretty good and I would recommend it but not if you are looking for  Face Lift kind of results.</li>
            <li> Used according to directions. Did nothing. Would not buy again. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My wife seems to be very happy with this product.  Happy wife &#x3D; Happy life</li>
            <li> I am 67 year old female and have always taken care of my complexion and stopped the sun worship many years ago.  In the past I have had Thermage, and Pelleve treatments with favorable results. I have been looking into Ultherapy but not happy with the expense.&lt;br /&gt;I have had my Derma Wand for a few day and have used it for the past four days, and am happy, so far, with what I am seeing.  I find that doing the full face&amp;#34; along with the &amp;#34;Spa exercise&amp;#34; at night and just the full face in the morning works best for me.  The evening treatment will take me about 30 minutes and my face and neck feel very soft, look brighter, and the few lines I do have appearing better.  I am looking forward to seeing the long term results with the hope of saving me addition money and down time from other procedures.  I believe that having &amp;#34;patients&amp;#34; will be my best friend with the Derma Wand.</li>
            <li> wonderful, use it all the time</li>
            <li> I am 47 years old and bought this product based on a dermatologist recommendation on The Dr. Oz Show.  She said it would help nasal-labial lines (the lines that run from the outside corner of the nose to the outside of the lips).  I use Dr. Perricone&#x27;s products and they have been wonderful for my skin but nothing has helped these deepening lines.  I was shocked at how quickly I saw results!  Within just a few days the lines were disappearing, and now after three weeks they are reduced, I would say, about 60%.  I was super surprised that the lines (not wrinkles, they&#x27;ve been with me my whole life) under my lower eyelids were reduced about 80%.  The only place the wand has not worked is in lifting my upper eyebrow/eye area over one eye, but I think it is because the muscles are sagging there, not the skin.  Easy and quick to use, and I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Slight lifting of eye lids and notice my dark circles under my eyes are much lighter.  I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I loved it but when I compared it with my sister&#x27;s, hers was much stronger and she is getting much better results.  I had to return mine but I would like to get another if I knew I would get one that was full strength!</li>
            <li> great product, gets rid of small wrinkles,lesson deep wrinkles. Improves pores making them smaller. Helps get rid of acne.improves the appearance of your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first impression. It made a difference on my skin after a week.  I may give it 5 stars later on.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about 3 weeks,so it is really not fair for me to give it a star rating.  I use it twice a day as directed.  I&#x27;m not sure what kind of results I&#x27;m supposed to have in that time frame, so it is hard for me to say if it is working or not.  I really can&#x27;t see much difference, if any and no one has said anything about me looking any younger as seen in the ads.  I&#x27;ll keep using it and hope that I see some results in the near future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for 4 months. There is not one single difference on my face. I have a few fine lines and puffiness under my eyes, that is all and the fine lines are just as noticeable today as they were 4 months ago. I will say this though, it will help you A LITTLE BIT. I do notice that after using it in the morning under my eyes, the puffiness gets smaller but does NOT go away. It never goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I realized that I was stupid for buying a product for $100 thinking it will cure all my facial problems. If this thing really did what it says then Doctors that do cosmetic surgery and facial fillers would go out of business. If you want to get rid of facial problems then you have to go to the Doctor and pay $$. This will NOT cure you and solve your problems only create more wrinkles for stressing over why its not working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with this company for the major misleading of this product and scamming on people. I now know why people are saying the 5 star ratings must be people who are being paid to promote this product. I understand those accusations now.</li>
            <li> It truly does show improvement if used consistently. I love it</li>
            <li> Just received it two Days ago Can&#x27;t wait to see how the results are in a week.</li>
            <li> Went through all of this for friggin 60 days.....absolutely nothing !!! most these great reviews must be shills/fakes...</li>
            <li> In a week I saw results (En una semana vi resultados).&lt;br /&gt;It is of the best purchases I could do (Es de las mejores compras que he podido hacer).</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product.  I ignored the varying reviews and ordered it.  I figured if I was spending over $100 on something, it would give good results.  No, it didn&#x27;t.  I used it twice a day exactly as the directions, and nothing.  I returned it, and Amazon gave me a full refund.  I am disappointed, more at myself for believing, then in anything else.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a while seems to make skin tighter.. But wouldn&#x27;t totally rely on it.</li>
            <li> I returned this product after using it for a few weeks I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my skin. Your better off using a good facial cream</li>
            <li> She says it works and certainly helps the skin but the effect appears to be skin deep.  Not a bad product, but maybe not a great one.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product. For the price I expected more. Doesn&#x27;t seem to work. Would not recommend to others. Not worth the price.</li>
            <li> Been using this now for the past two months and can see a diiference.  Will report later in about six months.</li>
            <li> after 6 weeks I&#x27;m not sure how much difference it has made.  I will continue to use it twice a day because I do see some improvement around my eyes and on the sides of my mouth and my pores do seem smaller.  It works great on healing blemishes, makes them go away after just a couple of treatments and it has gotten rid of almost all blackheads.  It was worth the money but I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because I was hoping for more improvement on my upper eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update 1/18/13: I&#x27;m starting to get compliments from friends and acquaintances telling me how nice my skin looks(they don&#x27;t know I&#x27;ve been using DermaWand), and I am starting to notice more improvement around my eyes. I&#x27;m 56, a younger looking 56 but 56 is 56.  One comment was my skin was glowing! Changing my review to 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have used it for 3 days now and I can already see the results happening. Its amazing. I&#x27;m 38 years old and I got the 3 lines on my forehead and the crows feet on the corner of my eyes as well as dark rings and wrinkles under the eyes. since I&#x27;ve started using the Derma Wand 3 days ago all of these items have decreased 50% in only 3 days! Thank u so much Christina Boves for creating the Derma Wand. I had open heart surgery and have to take blood thinners for the rest of my life so for me to have any kind of face lift surgeries was completely out of the question and through this has aged me faster so all hope was gone until now. I don&#x27;t believe most things I see on TV because of all the ways u can fudge things with technology now days but I thought I would try this one item to see and I&#x27;m so glad I did! Thank u and I will tell everyone I know to buy this product. In the End all I can say is Thank You again and Wow! Believe!</li>
            <li> I was hooked on this wand and loved the oxygen smell. One time my eyes was really puffy when I woke up. I used the Derma Wand for ten minutes and I saw a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I tried the product every day twice a day.... but I didn&#x27;t see any results at all! It made my sikn very dry. Super service from seller...product arrived super fast...and the return was done very fast and professional, it was even picked up at my home, thank you for a super fast service!</li>
            <li> I used this product faithfully morning and evening per the dvd for weeks and did not notice any difference; in fact I thought I looked worse, so I gave up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed!  Have been using the wand morning and evening for about a month and haven&#x27;t seen any noticeable difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> bought this item for my wife, she uses it everyday and absolutely loves it, price was about $30 cheaper than at most places too, and it arrived 2 days after placing order.</li>
            <li> I could really begin to see a difference in my face after using the Derma Wand for a few weeks.  I was unable to use it twice a day as recommended but did use it diligently every night.  Imagine my dismay when after having used it once daily for six months and having the bulb burned out. It is not an inexpensive beauty tool, and  after 6 months daily use I do not believe it should have burnout that quickly.  The bulb is not covered in any warranty.Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I am soon to be 52. I was a very limited sun worshiper and never smoked.  I had minimal wrinkles, but they were starting, among with a slight face sag in the jaw area. I am on week three and it is working really well.  I can see a difference.  My forehead lines are almost gone, my under eye area has improved an my face sag has slightly improved.  Yes, as it promises...my eyes are lifted!  Consistency is the key here.  I will update in 6 weeks!  So far I love it! I look younger and more refreshed!</li>
            <li> Works with continued use.</li>
            <li> you know I pulled this by April every 3 weeks I was taking a picture and comparing it to my old style my daughters was noticing the different I am 53 years old and I&#x27;m big old mom you look like you are so pretty now I told my you I wasnt pretty before she was know I noticed that you taking care of your skin</li>
            <li> This is an exceptional product that helps maintain skin quality when used as directed.</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully using it for 32 days...and cannot tell yet...even with before and after photos.  I use it for 15 minutes morning and evening....at least!!!</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect anything great from this product, but my mom bought it for Christmas for my sister and I.  I can tell a it is doing something because I stopped using my Murad line eraser.  I think it&#x27;s worth a try.  I can see more of a change than when I had it done at the spa once a month.</li>
            <li> Derma Wand dryed out my skin on face even while using the moisturizers. Scary!!! Really would not reccomend wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks.There are no changes yet.The instructions  says it takes 4-6 wks for a noticable change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 67 years old, so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles from my Derma Wand.  I want to say first off, that I&#x27;m so glad that items like this can be ordered from Amazon.  I&#x27;m a confirmed Amazon shopper, and would never order one of these from the television commercial.  The &amp;#34;shipping and handling&amp;#34; is exorbitant, and so many people are charged for a lot more than the cost of the item, and there is no customer service.  Whereas, Amazon has amazing customer service.  I think most Amazon shoppers realize that.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the wand itself, I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks, and I&#x27;m not sure if I can see any real difference yet, but I like the idea of being proactive about my face and neck.  Also, if I can just maintain what I have, and then maybe see a bit of improvement, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;m really looking for.  Just going thru the routine helps me with cleaning and moisturizing, which I might tend to skip once in a while. I like the gentle &amp;#34;zapping&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;: that a few people mention is practically non existent. Kinda makes me think that something is going on in a good way.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....I might edit my rating down the line, but this item, and the reasonable price, is just fine with me.  I tried all kinds of creams and things about 15 years ago to deal with my droopy eyelids (REAL droopy), and finally gave in and had eyelid surgery on them.  I know a bunch of people hate the idea of plastic surgery, but sometimes that&#x27;s the only way to deal with pretty extreme issues.  So I&#x27;m not looking for a miracle.  My skin is still pretty good, and I&#x27;m basically trying to keep it that way.  So far, it&#x27;s been a nice experience.</li>
            <li> Not as good as advertised! I should do more resource next time I&#x27;m buying anything! New shoes would be nicer!</li>
            <li> I received my wand a couple of weeks ago. It took me a few days before I could watch the instructional video, so I really have been using it less than 2 weeks, and it took a while to get it worked into my routine even once a day, let alone the twice recommended. But the last several days, I was using it every morning until yesterday. Not noticing any anti-aging results yet in that short of a time, I was at least noticing an improvement in my complexion to encourage me to try harder to get the evening use routine started. I got out of the shower after working out Monday night, and tried to use the wand. The result was literally shocking. It hurt as if I were intentionally trying to electrocute myself. I checked to see if I accidentally bumped up the setting because the needle like shocks were even more powerful than the level 5 I had worked myself up to on my cheeks. No, it was still set on the number 1 setting recommended for around the eyes. I wondered if there was something about my hair being wet that increased the conductivity, though I felt this was unlikely since there were no warnings about anything at all causing a change in performance. I put it away until the next morning. Very disappointingly, when back to my regular routine, the unit was still giving me painful shocks instead of the level I had been getting for the past week at the same settings. I couldn&#x27;t even use the number 1 setting on my cheeks that were used to level 5. That is how much stronger the pulses we that the unit was suddenly putting out. The unit was well taken care of. It was never dropped, always stored in its case in a clean, dry cabinet, never exposed to even a steamy room (my bathroom is large and never steams up) let alone direct exposure to water. Nothing unusual happened to it to suddenly cause it to suddenly break. I can only assume there was a manufacturing defect, and the component that allows you to change the power setting suddenly shorted to full power all the time, regardless of the dial setting. If I had paid much less for it, it would have gone right in the trash. But costing over $100, I am hoping to get a refund, or better yet, to see if a properly working unit will give me the results claimed, exchange it to see if another unit will last to give me the reduced lines and jowls.</li>
            <li> I am using this wand less than recommended, only once in the AM and on a lower setting than I can be using, but I do see some difference after using it for 2 weeks.  My skin has a brighter glow and things seem to be firmer. However, I would not recommend using around the eyes.  Within 15-20 minutes after using the wand around my eyes, my vision would go blurry, my eyes would ache immediately and itch several hours later.  Using it on the rest of my face seems to be fine.  I e-mailed the creator of the wand to ask a few questions and she immediately (the same day) e-mailed me back.  I was very surprised!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am sensitive to radio waves and it caused a slight dull headache after use so I was leary of continuing use although I did notice a tightening sensation.</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, my skin looks great! I Love this product.The bags and puffiness around my eyes are much less.It is easy to use and I don&#x27;t mind using it twice a day!</li>
            <li> I love this product as it helps keep the redness down on my skin and my skin feels a lot smoother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janine</li>
            <li> I am in Australia and I spend all that money on the Derma wand kit and didn&#x27;t get the plugs I need to use it in Australia</li>
            <li> This is very nice. I like it very much. My face is better than before to use it.</li>
            <li> Use in am/pm. After three weeks, the results are visual - nice to receive complements.</li>
            <li> WORKED REALLY WELL UNTIL GLASS TIP SHATTERED AND REPLACEMENT TIP NOT AN OPTION BUT IT REALLY DOES WORK FOR REAL</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works like it claims to work because I don&#x27;t use it on a daily basis. However, it is easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> Really good for opening eyes. ..takes away puffiness. ..has helped to reduce the look of deep wrinkle at jowls line...</li>
            <li> GOOD WOULD LIKE TO ORDER ANOTHER ONE AS A GIFT.&lt;br /&gt;LOOKING FORWARD TO GETTING BETTER RESULTS SOON&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU FOR</li>
            <li> At first the sound and feeling was scarey, but i&#x27;m getting use to it. Me and my teenage daughter use it for our skin care needs. It isn&#x27;tas relaxing as I thouht it would be,but can tell a difference since we&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I bought total 4 Derma Wand Kits for me, my mom and my sisters. We all love it. It works great. After the 1st time used it, I could see the result right away. I just tried it twice. Hope after two weeks, my wrinkles will reduce.</li>
            <li> I retuned this product because the little light didn&#x27;t stay on. It blinked on and off. And the lotion that came with it was pretty dried out when I received the item. I tried to use but it didn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I could tell a difference the first time I used it.  I have told my friends about it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t  see it has done anything. I have used it as directed. I had hoped and looked but see no difference. The only thing I notice is my face peeled and broke out some. Still have wrinkles and dark spots did nothing. Did no lifting at all. The eyebrow lift in DVD is a joke.</li>
            <li> Used twice a day for a month, no difference. Maybe did not give it long enough. Of course everyones results are different.</li>
            <li> just have not seen any changes yet that is not to say it does not work maybe it is to early...but not the changes that read like the first week or sooner.  I am sticking with it twice a day and will rate it again later.</li>
            <li> Arriving ahead of schedule, the Derma Wand is easily one of my most important healh and beauty purchases I have ever made. I have used it in conjunction with the book, &amp;#34;Facial Fitness&amp;#34; by Patricia Goroway, which outlines the musculature of the skin on the face and neck. This allows me to use the book as a guideline for following the naural contours of the face and neck with the Derma Wand. The massage this product provides leaves your skin feeling fresh and tingling from the increased bloodflow, creating the only true foundation for real, natural beauty: good skin. You will not be disappointed with this item.</li>
            <li> I suspect this product would be absolutely excellent if I was very consistent in using it!!  great buy for anyone wanting to manage facial wrinkles and sags.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is supposed to hurt as much as it did me. I found it unpleasant and I haven&#x27;t been able to use it since. Its like being zapped over and over again! Not very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product faithfully for a month and have not seen any difference in the appearance of my skin.  Very disappointing!!</li>
            <li> I order this item in Feb and three weeks later when I received the item I was totally unsatisfied with it . It did not work and parts were missing. I went online and requested a return. I printed the return label and posted back the Item which I had to pay for the postage. it is over three weeks now and I have not heard anything yet, no confirmation and no refund yet. I really disappointed with the service.&lt;br /&gt;So please contact the seller - Dermawand and ask them what happened to my refund.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reza Assadi</li>
            <li> I received it earlier than noted. I just started using it, can&#x27;t wait to see the results. I will followup in a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;Patricia</li>
            <li> After reading other reviews, I wasn&#x27;t sure I wanted to take a chance; I&#x27;m glad I did.  This seems to work.  I noticed a plumping right after I used the wand for the first time.  Yes, there&#x27;s a crackling noise and an ozone-y smell - we put up with a lot more in the name of &amp;#34;beauty.&amp;#34;  Some reviewers commented that you had to use this on a regular basis; well, of course, you do.  We brush our teeth and wash our faces at least once a day, why would this be any different.  It&#x27;s easy to use while watching TV and doesn&#x27;t take too much time.  Plus, it&#x27;s a heck of a bargain compared to injections and surgery.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Best results....better than an spa. you need to be constant to get better results. thanks to my friend who recommend me this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using dermawand for about a year now.  I&#x27;ve seen results, my children say I look ten years younger.  The wrinkles from my forehead have disappeared.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Followed instructions to the letter - after 4 weeks haven&#x27;nt noticed an improvement.  Of course it took a lot longer than 4 weeks to get this way!  Jury is still out on this one!</li>
            <li> really good, but I have to be more concisten.  I really like it tho.!!!</li>
            <li> I had a Derma Wand (European version). I couldn&#x27;t find a new one i Europe so I bought one from the US. It is a lot more effective. (More powerful). I&#x27;m really pleased.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 3 weeks and honestly, I believe it has made my skin look more wrinkled than less. I am afraid to even keep using it at this point.</li>
            <li> crap, you have to use it like a million times a day</li>
            <li> Have been using it night and morning for two months, it does not work.</li>
            <li> quick delivery, broken bottle inside. everything was wet, instruction couldn&#x27;t be read. went on line for that. could not return it even if i wanted to, all paper work was destroyed. have been using it, but do not see a difference at all. will keep trying since i have it anyways.  i do use my own moisturizer. the cream that comes with it dries up to fast.</li>
            <li> Could not tell any difference . Feels like just a light/ joke.</li>
            <li> I am 57 years old and have fair skin. I have sun damage with wrinkles around the eyes, and face.  I&#x27;ve been using the derma wand now for approximately six weeks. I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvement. The instructions stated to take before pictures so I did. The wand kit came with a dvd and I followed the demonstration and used the wand diligently twice a day. Too bad, they have pictures on the box of people who look like the derma wand worked miracles. In fact one picture of a lady looked too good to be true. You know what they say about the too good to be true? The only reason I give it one star is because it arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My aesthetician reco&#x27;d this for use in between appointments. Pleasantly surprised at how well it works! I use it with a facial antibacterial serum.</li>
            <li> Product does not work.  The DVD supplied with the product doesn&#x27;t work either. I&#x27;ve used as instructed in pamplet and have seen no difference in my skin. I plan to return the product.</li>
            <li> Helpful but  you have to moisturize before and after.I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> I have read every single comment @ [...] I also read other comments in Amazon.com reviews of Derma Wand. Seems like 50% of them are happy and the other 50% are unhappy. I just received my Derma Wand on June 18, 2013. I started using it the NEXT day. I took a picture BEFORE I used the Derma Wand, just so I can see the difference. After 5 days of use of Derma Wand, I see the difference. I notice that my neck looks and feel tighter. The lines on my forehead seems to disappear a bit. The puffiness around my eyes have gone down 30%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m not too thrilled about the skin care products that came with it. The Pre-Face treatment gets dry so easy on my face, I cannot glide the wand on my face. Plus, it burns on my face! So forget this. And so instead, I would use the Creme de Serum (by: Meaningful Beauty Cindy Crawford). I sometimes use the Firming Serum (ibid) and Antioxindant Day Creme (ibid) together BEFORE I glide the wand on my face and it seems to work. This helps absorbs the serum on my face. I like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to test and see, I used Hydra Support Cream first then added the Hydra Infusion then Skin Mist. This is okay. But I wouldn&#x27;t stick to these beauty skin care products. So far my face doesn&#x27;t react to it. I have a very sensitive skin. So since these skin care products came with it, I&#x27;ll use it till it&#x27;s gone. But the Pre-Face is goner! This is a waste of product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think using your own beauty skin care product is just as good. It&#x27;s the Derma Wand that counts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little booklet says do this 5 minutes a day. I think it takes more than 5-minutes a day. After counting 5-6 stroke from each part of my face...do you think this will only take 5-minutes? So why did they say that on the booklet I have no idea! To me 5 minutes of using the Derma Wand is just a warming up. I used between 1-3 dial around my eyes. And I used between 3-9 around my neck and face. The best part of the Derma Wand is when I used it on my neck, I feel that tingly feeling and it feels good. Under my chin also, I can feel the tingly feeling. Other than that, if I used this around my face and accidentally lift  the wand a little, I feel that zap feeling and I don&#x27;t like it. And so I try to keep the wand DOWN on my face by going back &amp; forth, mostly stroking upward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people got burned using the Derma Wand. How did that happen? And they claim they only use the number #1 dial. I used up to #9 and it doesn&#x27;t burn me at all. So I think all the report is inaccurate or this Derma Wand is NOT for everyone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far so good. If I have to rate this product, it&#x27;s a 3-star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some things I&#x27;m not happy about are the skin care products and the SURPRISE charges they did on my credit card. That Infomercial said that I get to try this for 30-days FREE including shipping is FREE but when I checked my credit card they charged me $20.63 and I dunno what the heck this is. Is this the shipping and handling? A company that doesn&#x27;t stick by their word is a doomed company. I&#x27;m not happy about this. You guys should stick by your words!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I will update here after my 30-days use of this, see what happens!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 19, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So today is exactly 30 days from the day I started using Derma Wand. Like I said, I took the BEFORE and AFTER photo. I have notice a difference on my face. The bags under my eyes have dissipated. My neck looked tightened. The circles around my eyes have gone down. Even my freckles got lightened. All my pimples are gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Derma Wand 2x a day, 7 days a week. I used 1-3 dial around my eyes and 3-9 dial on my face and neck. Since this is time consuming, I would normally do it during my favorite TV show. I do longer than just 5 minutes a day. Normally, it would take me 30-45 minutes each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the Pre-Face treatment is concerned, I finally gave this one a 2nd try. But, I have to keep putting this the moment it dries up on my face so I can glide the Derma Wand easily. I might as well keep using this till it&#x27;s gone. But after it&#x27;s gone, I am not reordering any of this. Since it is made out of aloe vera, I thought it&#x27;s not a bad product. But this stuff you can always get at Walmart. So I don&#x27;t have to reorder this from Derma Wand company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I can say about the Derma Wand is, this is not for everyone. But it works for me! Don&#x27;t expect magic to happen in 1-3 days coz it can take time before you see some results. Everyone is different. Anyway, I will keep using this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 20, 2013&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still using Derma Wand as of today. I am using it twice a day. Once in the morning. And once in the evening. Like I said before, it sometimes bores me to keep looking myself in front of the mirror standing. And so I sit in front of the TV and use Derma Wand on my face. I see instant results now after using just a few minutes of this. So far so good. The more I use this, the better my face looks. Will see a year from now if I am still using this. I hope so. But I wanna keep you guys up-to-date. I rate this a 4-star.d, I finally gave this one a 2nd try. But, I have to keep putting this the moment it dries up on my face so I can glide the Derma Wand easily. I might as well keep using this till it&#x27;s gone.

            <li> Not sure yet but seems to feel good and will take time to see</li>
            <li> did not make any change</li>
            <li> This product is cheaply made... it should not have stopped working just because I had (with care) stored it away in a drawer for a few months. If you&#x27;ve got one of these, keep using it until it &#x27;dies&#x27;, and it will.  There is, obviously, a &#x27;shelf&#x27; life, when not in use.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this product but very disappointed. I tried it exactly as directed and the sensation was horrible. It caused terrible pain behind my eyes.  I waited a day and tried it again the following day. Same sensation, same pain behind the eyes. I don&#x27;t know if the unit was perhaps faulty or I&#x27;m just very sensitive but I had to return this item.</li>
            <li> I do not live in the US and bought a derma wand and it stop working at the second time I was going to use it. It has poor quality. Please be careful if you want to buy one of these and you don´t live in US</li>
            <li> Feeling practically suicidal before I received this item, I can truly say that it is worth every penny.  It doesn&#x27;t make Miracles happen, but if you&#x27;re worried you can&#x27;t afford a facelift, and you have the \\&quot;numbers 171\\&quot; in wrinkles between your eyebrows, than this is a good thing for you.  I use it on my eyes and above my eyebrows the most and it makes me look almost normal again.  It hasn&#x27;t done much for one of the deep creases next to my mouth yet, but I was so glad it put my eyes back to practically normal.  The skin on my eyes had dropped so far that I was being looked at like a \\&quot;suspect\\&quot; everywhere I went.  Now, people are beginning to look less threatened when I walk into a room.  It literally changed my life!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so.  It started out twice a day, but lately I&#x27;m getting lazy with it, and skipping using it.  I&#x27;ve skipped it for about 24 hours or so now, and I could tell first thing this morning when looked into the mirror. I woke up and my eyes had dropped an extra half an inch again and made me start to look scary again.  I&#x27;ll have to use it again today for sure!  It&#x27;s nice to have an option!!  Instead of looking like \\&quot;heck\\&quot; and not being able to do anything about it as I did before!!  I think you&#x27;ll like it, especially if your over 40 or 50 years old!!</li>
            <li> I had great hopes that this would work as a friend of mine had one and it definitely worked for her - in a matter of minutes.  So, after two weeks, I decided that $99.00 was too much to pay for so little results.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good product but it is not magic as some might hope for.  I don&#x27;t know if it is doing anything that much but I kind of like using it and I suspect the light might do as much as the little shocking aspect,  It does stimulate the skin with out pulling or stretching so clearly does increase blood supply to the surface.</li>
            <li> Well after reading numerous reviews and being mezmerized by the infomercials, I decided to buy the Dermawand.  I mainly purchased it to help clear up my acne. I am 44 and have hormonal acne.  I bought my Dermawand on Ebay so I got it cheaper but without product. Well after using it for a few weeks acne got slightly better, but my skin started to look better in general and the very fine lines around my eyes were practically gone.  Here&#x27;s the kicker..... I went to see my mom about a month after I started using the Dermawand.  She actually accused me of getting derma fillers around my mouth and forehead.  I do work for a plastic surgeon and have access to these treatments, but have never done the fillers (they don&#x27;t last, and can look unatural so what&#x27;s the point). I have been using a Vitamin C serum from Kiss My Face with the Dermawand, works just fine. Added some microdermabrasion (at home because they even charge the staff at the surgeon&#x27;s office) and bingo, my acne is clearing and my skin is looking nicer than it has in a long time. I think the Dermawand is a really good product, it just takes time. It&#x27;s hard to notice the changes in your skin because you look at yourself every day. It was nice to hear from someone else that they noticed a difference. I will continue to use the Dermawand.</li>
            <li> Arrived and did not work. Looked like item was repackaged from previous sale</li>
            <li> I am 65 and I do not see any difference after using the DermaWand twice a day for approximately 3 weeks.  I do not recommend it.  I did not receive the full line of items that come with the one that is advertised on TV.</li>
            <li> I have not told anyone I&#x27;m using it for the past 2 months.  I&#x27;ve had some really nice comments on my skin.  Still not telling anyone but I do love it.  I&#x27;m 58 and don&#x27;t have many lines but the ones I do have I see alittle going away.  It&#x27;s worth a shot for those looking for a painless fix.</li>
            <li> This works good, I also use it any where on my body that may be sore or any where the body feels stressed.</li>
            <li> This product is worthless to me. I have used it for six weeks and cannot observe any lessening of the crowsfeet around my eyes or lessening of the smile lines around my mouth. I was made to understand that I should see favorable results by now but, alas, nothing. I hope it works for others but, at age 57, it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty good..no major results. .</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in just one week after use.</li>
            <li> I received my Derma Wand a few days ago. I thought for some reason, I was buying this from Amazon not from a guy in New York. I believe he sold me a returned one. He did NOT include a DVD, instructions or the stand. Plus the pre-treatment serum was half empty and the pump was broken. Perhaps I&#x27;m NOT supposed to believe the product details listed when they sell you the product. I tried contacting him, but he has yet to respond. I will NOT be purchasing from Adam S. in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s still too soon to say if Derma Wand works. I like to think that it is, but I suspect this wand is used so I don&#x27;t know how much prior usage it went through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sorry to say, but I won&#x27;t be buying products like this through Amazon again.</li>
            <li> I felt it only made my skin dry and therefore the wrinkles seemed even more noticable :(  I think it might work well for someone with acne though.</li>
            <li> this is a cheap china manufactured product that stopped working 9 days after amazon warranty expired.  told to contact derma wand directly. returned derma wand for replacement. Shipping and handling costs to replace product comes to more than 25% of original price.  Big rip off</li>
            <li> I love this product so so much.&lt;br /&gt;I had a party 3 days after I started using it and I got huge complements from all ladies in my party.&lt;br /&gt;They all went to buy it !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE LOVE LOVE IT</li>
            <li> I got &amp;#34;rubber band neck&amp;#34; from my thyroid condition and this worked wonders for it.</li>
            <li> so far so good I can see a difference- take a bit of time everyday</li>
            <li> i purchased the derma wand on-line and have been sadly disappointed with the results, the only thing that seems to do any good what so ever is the cream.</li>
            <li> I LIKE this Derma-Wand. The only thing is the instructions don&#x27;t mention you have to CLEAN THE CLEAR HEAD WITH EVERY USE. I find the head (top and sides) clouds up after just a minute or 2, and requires effort to clean. I&#x27;ve had mine for 7 months now. I had to write this after seeing the customer service  comments being left as product &#x27;Reviews&#x27;. And it&#x27;s like folks expect instant miracles and to return everything that doesn&#x27;t do that. Well, I have no idea if it has helped my appearance, but I darn sure think it does the job the machine is set up to do. If you clean the head. Thank you, Derma Wand. I am glad to have had the opportunity to buy an OTC appliance like this.</li>
            <li> This wand is amazing! I cannot believe the difference in my skin! It has taken years off of my skin... This past Christmas one of my relatives was amazed at how I look 10 years younger! I recommend this to anyone who listens!</li>
            <li> I very rarely review anything, but I am so thankful that I found this item I felt compelled to share so that others would know that it really does work.  I purchased it primarily to help with my hormonal chin acne that I have tried everything under the sun to get rid of.  I have spent hundred of dollars on products and gadgets until I read about the Derma Wand online.  It isn&#x27;t advertised for this use, but I am here to say, it works!  I received the Derma Wand over the weekend, and tried it out first thing Monday.  I had two persistent blemishes that I treated in the evening and by the next morning, they were all but gone.  I have only been using the product for a few days, but haven&#x27;t had a single new outbreak.  And trust me.  Prior to the use of the Derma Wand I was getting at least one bump every single day.  My chin today is absolutely clear.  I can only believe this will improve with continued use.  I am also using the Derma Wand on the rest of my face and there is a noticeable difference in my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this online, I immediately thought...cheesy infomercial product.  But others online insisted that it worked on their acne, and I was desperate, so I tried it.  I am so glad I did!  It has been the only thing I have had any kind of success with.  It was worth every penny.  I would have paid double!</li>
            <li> The item worked like it was suppose to, but I didn&#x27;t the zapping feeling and I only had it on setting 3. Also it seemed to aggravate a scar I have on my face and I don&#x27;t want to do that. I would like to return it.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, I&#x27;m 48 and have never been very responsible when it comes to skin care.  I didn&#x27;t start thinking much about it until about age 40.  I grew up on the east coast of Florida, about 10 miles from the beach, so I&#x27;ve always been a sun worshiper.  By the grace of God and some good genes, I don&#x27;t have many wrinkles, however, I do have some sun (age) spots, sagging in the jowl area and creasing of my eye lids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I watched the infomercial for this product for months and read all the reviews before deciding to buy it.  I&#x27;ve always been leary of plastic surgery and the thought of someone cutting on my face terrifies me.  I&#x27;ve been using it, almost everyday, for about 5 weeks and I am quite pleased.  I will say, if you&#x27;re looking for a quick fix or surgical results, this product is not for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very excited about the way my skins looks!  I have a more even tone, my age spots are fading, albiet, slowly and everything seems more lifted and a little tighter.  I will continue to use my \\&quot;wand\\&quot; religously, because it works, you just have to keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and would recommend it to anyone.  If this one should break, I&#x27;m buying another one.</li>
            <li> Item came new, but did nothing for me. I used it twice daily as instructed and have had no change at all. I know instructions said it can take longer but did not want to risk losing my refund.</li>
            <li> This product works great..I love it I can tell the changes in my skin</li>
            <li> It works, but it came with an owners Manuel with Spanish only, i sent an email and requested the correct manual I got no response.</li>
            <li> Very very disappointed in the Dermawand. So far I have the wand for over a month and I see no difference by using this product. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> When reading face product reviews, I always like to know the age range of the reviewer. It helps me get a truer understanding. So with that being said, I am 55. I was so excited to try the product like mostly everyone else in my age group. Sorry to say ladies, no noticeable difference what so ever. Faithfully did what it said to do, Got out my reading glasses and magnifying glass in hopes for seeing some visible signs of improvement. So if you still decide to go ahead taking in of all the positive reviews like I did,  make sure you can commit to it EVERY single day twice a day like the instructions call for. By the end of day 4, the enthusiasm swiftly quickly wears off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for 4 weeks.  I believe my skin looks healthier but no difference made on crows feet.</li>
            <li> Received the product quite quickly. Problem is that it has a wrong plug for Finland - need to go and find an adapter somewhere. So the product has not yet been used.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased. It&#x27;s quick and it helps my skin look more toned. It won&#x27;t work miracles but it does help me to look better. I think the first one I purchased had a stronger current. It took me a couple weeks to see a real difference in firmness. You do need to use it pretty much everyday. I only use it in the evenings.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting device.  I have only had it a little while, but it seems to give a &amp;#34;lift&amp;#34; to the brow area, so that eye shadow does not look creased (I am 50, and I have that crepy look to upper eyelid area that I cannot figure out how to get rid of).  I am going to continue using this, and think it will also help with lips--you can actually run it over the lips like a lip stick, as well as the creasing that appears around the corners of the mouth.  This device was not expensive at all, and is very easy to use.  Also, it is small and easy to store.</li>
            <li> While we haven&#x27;t used the product for enough time&lt;br /&gt;to evaluate its effects (only a week), I wish to note&lt;br /&gt;that Scott, in their Customer Service department worked&lt;br /&gt;diligently and virtually immediately to get us a replacement device&lt;br /&gt;when we received one that was suboptimal. Scott&#x27;s contact at Derma Wand is:&lt;br /&gt;0n32gkj7365wkjl@marketplace.amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;Five Stars for this Customer Service Effort.&lt;br /&gt;DM - Baltimore</li>
            <li> I am a 62 old grandmother...and I didn&#x27;t want to look 20 again..lol..that would have been nice...but not realistic....but i was wanting to look the best  I could for my age...and even tho I have only had my dermawand..for a week...I have used it several times...I have noticed  the huge  difference in my complexion and the taughtness of my skin,....I am more than pleased with the product..I would recommend it very highly...especially for women my age....I have gotten so many looks and compliments on my skin...&lt;br /&gt;  and as far as the popping sound of elecricity goes....lol....well I was able to start out on setting 8...my sin tingled and felt a little warm but all and all a very pleasant experince....thank you dermawand....</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time, was as described</li>
            <li> its amazing, makes my face tighter, smoother and luminous love it</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the Dermawand - however - I have, after two weeks use, noticed a marked improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture, and my adult acne breakouts are much improved!!!  The Dermawand is very easy and quick to use once you get the hang of it - and it DOES work!  I would recommend it to anyone, and purchase again for myself!</li>
            <li> Piece of crap.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The customer service department is fantastic!  I originally had a problem with the first product shipped, but they contacted me immediately to correct the problem.  Although it takes a month to see improvement, I feel confident that by following the instructions and reviewing the video several times, I&#x27;ll look better. The machine does not hurt and my skin responded well after the first treatment.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my wife about 4 months ago.&lt;br /&gt;She did&#x27;t think it was worth the money, so I sent it back&lt;br /&gt;for a refund. To this day; I have still not received my&lt;br /&gt;refund. I would not recommend this product to anyone.&lt;br /&gt;As for the money. I decided to let them keep it. They will&lt;br /&gt;probably need it for court costs.</li>
            <li> Not sure... Never really take the time to use it... Guess I need to make time.</li>
            <li> so far i can see the results after only a week.</li>
            <li> I started using the Derma Wand immediately!  I am really happy with the results!  I use an exfoliant along with the daily regimine of using the Derma Wand!  My fine lines and pores are drastically reduced.  The smell that it emits when using reminds me of fresh outdoor air.  It was a totally good buy!</li>
            <li> It was broke when I got it, so I never got to try it.  I tried to get a replacement, but for some reason, they could not so I just returned it and got a refund.  I really couldn&#x27;t give this a rating because I never even tried it.</li>
            <li> I agree with one other poster who said, \\&quot;Do not buy it from DermaWand.\\&quot; My reasons are the same, that being that I believe you can get this device for less money than the device&#x27;s home site asks. However, this device does produce positive results. They are not permanent, you have to keep up the wand&#x27;s use. But use it with any slippery gel, and you&#x27;ll get lifted results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell you, though, there&#x27;s a use that DermaWand is foolish NOT to advertise: It is WONDERFUL for cystic acne. I&#x27;m 60 and have fought cystic acne my whole life. The creams/lotions/internal meds used to treat it are harsh, and in the case of Accutane, very dangerous. When I get a cyst starting, I put the DermaWand right on the top of where the cyst is, zap it at a setting of 6 or more for a minute a time three times a day, and the cyst quite simply disappears, without scarring or discoloring my skin, and without pain. And you know how many of us can&#x27;t resist trying to puncture the cyst with a needle, etc., which hardly ever works. The DermaWand is a MIRACLE for acne, and I stand by it as I&#x27;ve used it for years. IT WORKS!</li>
            <li> I use the wand everyday, I love it! Will recommend it to my friends. Thanks Derma wand for great product.</li>
            <li> Derma wand helps plump up the skin it give it a healthier glow.  I didn&#x27;t see any improvement in wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This is the second wand purchased and they only lasted 4 weeks to 6 weeks using it as directed. While it works it is good; but then they just quit working with no damage to the unit. Need more reliability testing and improvements on the product.</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd time I have ordered this item (different sellers). I broke my last one.  You have to keep the safty cover on when not using it.  I love it and use it to depuff my eyes and keep finelines around eyes and mouth at bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller this time wasn&#x27;t real fast but it didn&#x27;t take too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was packaged professionally</li>
            <li> So far so good, easy to use, and it looks like it will improve my skin after constant use.  Very clear instructions.</li>
            <li> Truly amazing, exceeded all expectations! But I&#x27;m only telling  my closest friends. This product worked like gang busters for me.</li>
            <li> This used to be around $100.00 on Amazon.  $289.00 is nuts! I got a generic wand but don&#x27;t really like the attachments (fragile) but it does work and none of the attachments have broke. Derma wand just looked easier to use but not at this price.</li>
            <li> I decided to give the Derma Wand a try after reading good reviews by other customers.  I had no idea how good it was, however, until I tried it.  This is a fantastic product that already has made major changes in my skin after only about a month of use.  Fine lines have disappeared, and the texture and tone are greatly improved.  My jawline also appears a bit lifted, although one should not expect similar results to a facelift.  That would not be realistic.  All in all, well worth the cost.</li>
            <li> I used the Derma Wand every day for almost 30 days and didn&#x27;t see any result.  I didn&#x27;t mind the prickly feeling, even at the highest control.  I was hoping to see something but got nothing.  Only the first day there was slight reddening showing increased circulation but no rejuvenation, no lessening of small lines, jowls still hanging there.  I&#x27;m saving for something like a feather lift now. Well, what should I expect at age 65?    Thanks to Amazon I got my refund the day they received the item back.  Never a problem with Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 43 yrs.old and have been using derma wand since Jan. 2002. It didn&#x27;t work overnight but if you&#x27;re patient enough to use this on a regular basis, you won&#x27;t need to spend a lot more money paying a plastic surgeon. When I tell people my age, they always say that I look like I&#x27;m 10 years or so younger (just wish you could see me...). What it claims about getting rid of zits, making pores smaller, diminishing fine lines, making the skin firmer, etc...that&#x27;s all true (at least in my case). I don&#x27;t even have crow&#x27;s feet. I use skin care products that work for my skin type (combination)- for daytime: I use clean and clear detoxyfying facial scrub with microbeads while in the shower, moisturize with Cetaphil cream and for nighttime: I use Cetaphil skin cleanser, moisturize with organic shea butter, then use dermawand especially under my chin to prevent that skin from sagging. Oh, don&#x27;t forget to exfoliate 1-2x/week (I use buf-puff) or that neutrogena skin rejuvenator with cleansing pads. Drink plenty of water and eat food that are rich in vitamin a,c and e. I noticed that when I stopped using derma wand for a while, my skin looked dull so I just went back to using it again and the &#x27;glow&#x27; slowly came back. Incorporate derma wand use with your skin care regimen and you will see results over time. It works for me .... so hopefully it works for you too....Don&#x27;t expect a quickfix here; it&#x27;s not &#x27;abracadabra&#x27;....just like losing weight or becoming financially secure.....it takes time!</li>
            <li> I immediately noticed a difference in my skin after only using one time, I also ended up with a massive headache.  Used it again the next day thinking the headache was a coincidence; MIGRAINE.  Day three giving it one more try because I thought maybe it was the smell making my head explode.  Put cotton in my nose and proceeded to use the wand.  Again a headache.  So it really does work on my face, but does anyone know why it&#x27;s making me sick?</li>
            <li> I bought it a month ago, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I get my skin lifting but my skin gets smoothly.</li>
            <li> I used the stupid thing for almost two months before returning it. I was religious about using it twice a day and followed the directions exactly. It did absolutely nothing for me. Didn&#x27;t shrink my pores, didn&#x27;t fade even the finest of fine lines. It gave my cheeks a nice blush in the first week, but that&#x27;s it. It does seem to help with acne a little too. Seems like nothing short of dermal injections and plastic surgery will really work. The Baby Quasar did absolutely nothing either. Don&#x27;t waste your money on these \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; gadgets. None of them seem to work.</li>
            <li> This is definatley not to be used alone, much more product than they suggest,. not sure what it would be.  I would like to know what the lady on the infomerical used besides a lot of make up for the commerical.  By all means you need to use it for a longer period of time than suggested even  to get the eye brow lift and it does not last very long.  I have done a quick pass and spent up to 20 minutes with no real difference in the look with the time difference.  Have not seen a reduction in the lines around my eyes (crows feet) mouth, forehead, between the eyes.  I was hoping this would work and I could avoid the microdermabraision treatements.  Real disappointment</li>
            <li> This little wand works. I purchased this because my -45 year old- face started looking 45. I dark circles under my eyes and many fine lines around my mouth. After 2 days of use, my daughter asked what I was doing to my face because I didn&#x27;t look so &amp;#34;old&amp;#34;. I didn&#x27;t tell her but the only thing I started using was the derma wand. I&#x27;m not trying to look younger, I just don&#x27;t want to look older than I feel. FYI, I use light lotions instead of the gel the send.</li>
            <li> started using but tell u better invest  in face workout dvd  than this i think it  mostly killing grams and not really giving u amazing results</li>
            <li> great product. face feels plumped and fresh</li>
            <li> Dermawand has no lasting effects. Ten minutes after you use it, your face looks the same. The FREE S&amp;H was not free - I was charged $9.95 and they sent no invoice or instructional dvd with the product. It took weeks for me to receive the product, but thy go based on when they allegedly sent the product, not when you actually receive it. You have to HUNT to find a number where you can talk to someone about sending the product back. The place where you order the product does not respond when you send emails to return the product. Then when I FINALLY found alleged customer service, they told me I was way outside of the time to return even though, I was within the thirty days of its actual arrive and within 10 days of the date they were counting. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product and definitely do not trust this company.</li>
            <li> Just started using so not fair of me to give a completed rating but I do feel for the short time of about 1 month I see some improvement in my neck and eyes. I have only been using it one time per day. It does sting a bit on the highest level and almost smells like static in the air like when you forget to use fabric softener and your clothes cling together as you pull them apart there is that scent. Overall I think I will see better results as time goes by or at least I hope to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve considered for years what to do about my saggy eyebrows:  if I don&#x27;t intentionally hold them up, I look angry.  What a drag!  I&#x27;m 68.  I thought about some cosmetic procedure, but I knew any of those would be way too expensive for me. I was leery of any infomercial product, but the 30-day trial offer got my interest. Everything came quickly and fully.  I didn&#x27;t even open any of the lotions, etc., though, for fear I&#x27;d be returning the wand.  Now it&#x27;s about 4 weeks out, generally use it as directed morning and night.  Even though it says that the lifting of the eyebrows only lasts about 3 or 4 hours, I get great results all day!  I still lift them a bit, but now I can relax without being afraid I look angry and very, very old.  I look much prettier and younger, and I think my facial skin overall is also much smoother.  I use Burt&#x27;s Bees lotions.  Smell?  Pahleese.  I&#x27;ve smelled a lot worse, and that&#x27;s the way the electrical thing smells, whether through Dermawand or a much pricier cosmetic procedure!  I do wish I&#x27;d ordered it through Amazon, for I&#x27;m nervous that the company will charge me for more product with my Visa card and from all that I read, their customer service is nasty/nonexistent.  So, I have my fingers crossed.  I will check to see if I can order replacement bulbs for when mine goes (all bulbs die in time) through Amazon.  Seriously, I don&#x27;t want to be without this for even a day!!  Compared to the alternative (cosmetic treatments) this is a STEAL!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Derma Wand since Christmas. The first thing I noticed that many of the pores on my nose were decreasing in size.  I have noticed that my skin DOES feel much firmer. I can see a difference in the way my face looks, period!!! My profile seems to be improving.  I will continue to use this and see what else happens.  On my young son&#x27;s face... it really does help with skin breakouts.  He hates the way the wand feels but endures it as his skin looks MUCH better! The Derma Wand company is terrific!  I had a small problem and they could not do enough to help. Christine is always available to answer my emails and usually in a day or less.This lady has given me hints to help with my progress.  All in all, I am extremely pleased with this product.  I can not wait to see how far it will go to work on my skin.  I would certainly buy this, again, and recommend it to anyone who asks.Please feel free to e mail me if you have any questions. Please put Derma Wand in subject line so I will notice your mail  e mail is :  linda.stearns.photo@live.com</li>
            <li> The Item was identical to factory bag I removed it was an easy install, and it works great. I would recommend it as a replacement bag.</li>
            <li> The product arrived faulty. The highest setting (9) was the only setting that worked so weakly as if it was setting 1.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully Amazon refunded my money within a day and without any hassle. It may be a good product if it works as it supposed to but I won&#x27;t waste my money on a second one to try again.</li>
            <li> The derma want .......I only use once a day and it is working as promised.....I plan to continue its use</li>
            <li> Think it helps -- need more time</li>
            <li> I am sorry, but I have a pacemaker, and cannot use as it could kill me. I wanted to return, but cannot get my return, have asked several times and no luck.  PLEASE PLEASE RESPOND!</li>
            <li> It seems to make your skin look better than before.  Don&#x27;t expect to look like you has plastic surgery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine about 12 years and it works great. I keep it in the same leather pouch it came in.  I keep the cap on, too.  I don&#x27;t want to break this wonderful device! I only use it a few minutes as per the instructions and only once a day and not every day. I used it sporadically but as I age, I am committing to using it every day at least once a day and perhaps try in the AM and at bedtime.  It&#x27;s so easy to use! It does wonders for the skin.  I don&#x27;t use any products.  Now I&#x27;ll try using coconut oil or Virgin Olive oil.  The DW  smooths fine lines and absolutely opens the eyes! I started using it in my late 40&#x27;s just to bring more circulation to my face.  I don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles and my face is pretty smooth so maybe it&#x27;s because of the Derma Wand.  People say I don&#x27;t look my age.  I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of stress these past years and this device may have saved my skin.  It brings more circulation to the skin, tones and brightens it.  I feel fortunate that I don&#x27;t have to go to a clinic to get these treatments.  I enjoy the convenience of  having &amp;#34;free&amp;#34; treatments at home.</li>
            <li> One of my mistakes.  Don&#x27;t use, don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t had a chance to try this yet.  I want to watch the video before I try it, but time has been scarce.</li>
            <li> Made the wrinkles worse.</li>
            <li> This product does increase firmness of your skin wherever you use it. I tried it for a month and did not realize how much of a difference in the tone and firmness of my eylids, jawline, and neck until I did not use it for a month. I am using it daily for 5 minues and the results are remarkable. If it breaks, I will buy another.</li>
            <li> Fantastic! I use it everyday and everyone says how rested and good I look!</li>
            <li> I returned it. I felt it was cheaply made for the price. Not what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once on a low setting and already the next day several people said I looked good today. I can only attribute it to using this product. I&#x27;m looking forward to sseing the results as I increase the power and use it on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful, amazing, it&#x27;s really works</li>
            <li> I was able to notice some difference in the wrinkles on my face. Didn&#x27;t notice much around my mouth though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a paid spokesman and I have nothing to win or lose regarding this review.  With that said, I am truly pleased with the way this Derma wand product continues to improve my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it x6weeks.  The first 2 weeks I broke out with bumps, but I figured it was toxins coming out and kept on using it.  Just this past week, I&#x27;ve received more than a dozen compliments from friends, family and coworkers on how great my skin looks and how young I appear (I&#x27;m 60).  I recommend it highly... but the key to any success is to keep using it. PS FYI: I use cocoa butter or coconut oil as the emollient for the wand to go smoothly over my face instead of the expensive creams that come with the wand.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Derma Wand for a month now and have seen a big difference! My skin looks much firmer and smoother. My sister saw me last week and said &amp;#34;You look younger, what did you do?&amp;#34; I told her about the Derma Wand and now she wants one. Would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> finding the time to use it at least twice a day is more difficult than I thought</li>
            <li> forget to use,  but when i do, does ok job...</li>
            <li> It give your skin a shiner look and helps to improve  and reduced aging lines. You HAVE to use it  every day</li>
            <li> After using it over a month, one to two times a day, my wrinkles are definitely less severe (I&#x27;m 55). I use coconut oil and add a little Frankenscence essential oil. I was worried that it would burn my skin, but have quickly moved up to the high settings with no problem.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions but I did not like the way it felt even on the lowest settings. I found my skin getting dry had to use a lot of face cream which I never did before.  No results found with me.</li>
            <li> Does a wonderful job at softening your skin and gives a youthful appearance but for deeper wrinkles you&lt;br /&gt;would really want to do every other day to see results</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work my skin looks worse after using this product.  I tried to return it after using it three weeks and supposedly I was past the allowable time to return it. They also charged  me 60 plus for the first payment and convinitely forgot to mention taxes and shipping would be added on top of the agreed upon payment.  Would not deal with this company again.&lt;br /&gt;Tina&lt;br /&gt;Canada</li>
            <li> After nearly three weeks of daily use, I can see no change. I didn&#x27;t expect a miracle, but had hoped I&#x27;d like my neck a bit more!</li>
            <li> I tried this for three months on my face as directed, and also gave it a try on scars just to see if it really could stimulate collagen in the area. I saw no change any where or how I used it. I think those that see a change are just visualizing what that want or expect to see.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy at all with product but more at myself because i fell for just another miracle in a can so to speak ...waste of money and time ...would like to send back. Don&#x27;t get it at all how others claimed to see a difference ...did lose some eyebrow from it ...didnt see that one coming either  ..but stupid is as stupid does so mostly my fault for believing stupidness...lol  what was I thinking radio waves lol</li>
            <li> I bought this and loved it and the tip broke and I called, e-mailed them, and sent it back to them wanting a replacement. I really loved it! It works wonders! But, I have never heard one peep out of them and so I am out $100. and can not get them to act like they a business! I am very disappointed in the company</li>
            <li> amazing. I was surprised to see that it worked.</li>
            <li> I have used the Dermawand for two months and I am very pleased with the result. I started out using it twice a day, but now I use it once in the morning. Even the first week I noticed my skin looked healthier and had a glow. As the weeks went by, I could definitely see a lifting of my eyelids and overall firmness of skin. I am especially happy about my under jaw and neck area, which was the area I hated the most. My chin line is definitely tighter. My over all skin is tauter. I can&#x27;t say I look ten years younger, but I certainly feel my face looks less tired and has a fresher look. I am ordering an extra bulb in case mine goes out. I don&#x27;t want to miss a day without it. I just wish this had been invented when I was younger. You have to be patient and use it at least twice a day to begin with, faithfully. Most of the negative reviews I have read seemed like people did not give it the time it takes for the collagen under the skin to be renewed.</li>
            <li> I have had one for many years.  I stopped using it for a while.....over a year, and one day realized that I looked old.  My pores were huge, I had breakouts, sallow-looking skin, and spots.  So I pulled out the Derma Wand and have used it nearly every day for the past few months. I only use it once a day for about 5 minutes, with my own skin moisturizing products.  I started to see a difference right away.  The bags and circles under my eyes are reduced, as well as having fewer breakouts and smaller pores.  The lines on my face are also reduced.  I used to pay an aesthetician big $$ to have this done.  Hers was much more powerful and caused redness and pain.  I could only afford to go a few times a year.  While the Derma Wand is must less powerful, I think using it on a daily basis makes up for that!</li>
            <li> I have been using it with no results. I wasted my money on this product. I took before pictures it looks worse.</li>
            <li> Derma wand takes too long. It also burnt my face in certain areas. What is it really trying to do??</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference in my skin but I will keep using it &amp; see how it works out.</li>
            <li> does not work..save your money , wish l never purchased this thing, can l get my money back?  no results what so ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Dermawand for little over a month now and I am pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off...the lifting...I think I was realistic in my expectations. I had read up on radio frequency and knew that even when the treatment were given by professionals that the initial results were only temporary and that permanent results didn&#x27;t usually occur until the 3rd month and sometimes even longer and sometimes required extra treatments so I wasn&#x27;t expecting some immediate miracle cure and suddenly look like I was in my 20&#x27;s again upon my first few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In fact I didn&#x27;t think I was seeing any lifting at all after the first month until I weighed...I had lost 7 pounds and there was no change in my face...and for me that is unusual. I purposely put on weight ( about 10 pounds in the last 7 years) after I reached my forties just so I would look younger in the face. I never take it off because my face sags so badly. The weight I lost was due to a busy schedule but after seeing that my face isn&#x27;t sagging after the loss I don&#x27;t feel the need to put it back on...very pleased with the results. Need to add that I use it twice a day for almost an hour on the face and the neck...highest setting except for right under the eyes which I go no higher with than a 4. Also want to add that it tightens the skin...not the muscles. I&#x27;ve heard that the Susan Sommers Facemaster helps for tightening muscles although I have not used it...just wanted to add it here for an option. Personally, I use facial exercises...a combination of Facial Yoga and Debra Crowley&#x27;s FlexEffect...great for firming the face and with the Dermawand the skin around the muscles is tighter as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if the lifting didn&#x27;t work the dermawand is worth the price just for what it did for my skin...and this was an immediate result. A few years ago my skin lost it&#x27;s youthful glow due to entering peri-menopause. For a while Oil of Olay carried a product (their foam) that gave me back that glow but they soon phased it out and it&#x27;s replacement cream didn&#x27;t give me the same results...the dermawand did. I used it for the first time the day before my husband and I went out for dinner and was shocked when I looked in the mirror and saw how good my skin looked...and yes it was just after one use and I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything at that point...my youthful glow was back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had looked at other similar products...some have extra wands and attachments...I prefer the simplicity of this one...just plug it in and start gliding it over your face. The one drawback was the price of the pre-face treatment(hence the 4 rather than the 5 because I really liked the stuff but the bottle isn&#x27;t that big and it&#x27;s $30)...I use 100% glycerin oil instead. It&#x27;s actually one the main ingredients in their pre-face treatment anyway. I had been using pure aloe gel and it does work as well but my personal preference is the glycerin...it doesn&#x27;t dry out as fast so I don&#x27;t have to re-apply before I&#x27;m through. Dermawand is a great product at least for me. When I wear this one out I intend to buy another.</li>
            <li> It feels good on your face, but I have not had it long enough to see if it will do what it is touted to do.  Maybe more later.</li>
            <li> I believe most of the reviews I read on this product were paid for.  This product does NOT work.  I had read a couple of bad reviews and thought oh they just didn&#x27;t use it long enough to see the results, Everyone wants instant results.....I used it every day for 2 months.  I could see no difference.  A waste of good money.</li>
            <li> I guess if you believe this works it does but it did nothing for me what so ever. not worth bothering with.</li>
            <li> I like using the derma at night it make my face look rivatilized and fresh for the next beautiful day.</li>
            <li> I think this wand does do some something for the skin, altho it does it slowly.  Not too bad in all!  Would recommend for a nice relaxed awake look.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what this does to your skin but it makes mine have really dry places and scabs</li>
            <li> I purchased this product through Dermawand on TV; received the item very quickly with all the facial products. I found it to work excellently for lifting my upper eye area/lids and firming &amp; tightening the lower eye area as well...I really am impressed! I am an RN trained in aesthetic facial procedures &amp; I do feel this is a great home product...my eye area is lifted and full; my lips are fuller and more luscious &amp; youthful, especially if I use DW with a lip plumper! If your not feeling the tingling sort of buzzing sensation then you are either using too much pressure with the wand against your skin or you used too much product...it takes a bit of time to find the best technique to get the maximum tingle/electrical buzz feeling. The only comment I&#x27;d make is that if you over use it you can provoke a herpes/cold sore outbreak as with any radio frequency or laser treatment...so if you&#x27;re prone to cold sores, make sure you don&#x27;t over use it and maybe ask your physician for an Rx for acyclovir. Good product!Impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum 10/2013: I have found using this product can be drying/dehydrating to the skin...I believe this is why it works well on pimples.</li>
            <li> Jury is still out. The products that come with the derma wand are not good. Your own moisturizer will work much better. I&#x27;ll stick with it though.</li>
            <li> After over 2 weeks I can tell zero results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true this can be very drying to the skin. However... When trying to kill a zit or reduce pore size and oiliness that&#x27;s excellent. I have observe real tightening in the skin on my face when used regularly. I doubt there&#x27;s going to be a dramatic &amp;#34;face lift&amp;#34; here.... The technology is spot on but not strong enough. I have had this product for several months and use it 3-4 times a week. Recommended time is 2 min but I use it up to 15 on highest setting concentrating on large pores around nose and any random breakouts.</li>
            <li> I have been using the DermaWand for the duration of the 30 day free trial and I am going to keep the product. I think it works great. I have noticed improvement in my skin tone since I began using it. It does not work overnight. I have been using it twice a day on the high setting for approx. 30 days and for the past week I have been noticing more improvement. I am 45 and my skin is not very wrinkled to begin with. People who&#x27;s skin is more wrinkled and aged looking might not achieve dramatic results. But it is worth trying out for the 30 day free trial.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have huge expectations for this product, but figured for the price I would give it a try. I used the products that came with the wand for the first few days then just went back to my regular day/night creams, added a bit of water when I needed more &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34; and to be honest, I am super happy with the results. My skin is in good shape for 43, but I bought this for the starting of crows feet I have around my eyes as I have been unable to find any cream that does anything to get rid of them, so they have been a waste of money in my opinion and I figured at worst this product would sit in my cupboard. I have used it for about 3 weeks now and I just love it and after about the 2nd week (using only about 4-5 mins twice a day) my skin is really great looking. It has definitely helped out around the eyes and my skin just seems clearer and brighter. It&#x27;s super easy to use and I plan on continuing because I am definitely getting the results I had hoped for.</li>
            <li> Instructions in the package are only in Spanish ??&lt;br /&gt;I had to find an English instructions video on youtube</li>
            <li> The Derma Wand works. You will not see results instantly. I did notice small improvements after two weeks of daily use. The only problem is its not durable at all. Shortly after purchase, bulb broke, now the company wants $25 to replace. A bit pricey for such small results...</li>
            <li> I will come back to review further, so far I do see some results in my face after only a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> My wife ordered the Derma Wand, did nothing as claimed.  She called and got authorization to return which she did.  Derma Wand refused to acknowledge return even though the U.S. Post Office has confirmed delivery to Derma Wand and our credit card company has agreed we do not owe for the product.  Derma Wand now threatening to turn the account over to a collection agency to make us pay even the product was returned in accordance with their procedures.  Unless you want a fight on your hands and/or your credit rating damaged, do not do business with this company.  Customer Service has not cooperated.  We have filed complaints with their Customer Service, New York BBB, Corporate Headquarters and the Consumer Protection Division for the State of New York,</li>
            <li> I bought this product so exited to try it but it was such a disappointment like others is just a scam it don&#x27;t work i wasted my money</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get any results from using this device.</li>
            <li> It  burn my skin, I  have two brown spots on one of my cheeks. I do know what to do now, it left a scar. I do not&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to work. I think I pitch one of these before.  The skin does not seem to tighten are be firmer or look better.</li>
            <li> First saw this product on TV over a decade ago.  Around 2004 (not sure on date) but definately before 2005.  I was in search of the perfect skin care &amp; cosmetic line.  I could tell time was catching up with me.  I saw results the first time I used the DermaWand way back then.  My brows were lifted and my face looked rested.  It was visibly firmer &amp; tighter.  The DermaWand worked magic. I stopped using the DermaWand shortly after I began using it though.  My life took on an unexpected curve of events that would last for the next decade plus.  Beginning with a serious illness that almost killed me in 2005 and continuing with the sudden and tragic death of my mother in 2006 I was really broken. Before I could catch my breath, my marriage of 23 years was over.  Divorce hit hard. All my dreams had fallen apart at the seams.  The next 10 years took it&#x27;s toll on me. My health suffered and my skin turned older faster than it would have if I hadn&#x27;t went through so much. The DermaWand was stashed away and forgotten for many years due to life having her way with me as she does for so many.  Taking care of myself became a bottom priority.  With a broken heart and dreams that died back in 2006 I lost all sight of caring about myself.  The DermaWand was forgotten to collect dust somewhere as I developed several serious health issues due to all the stress.  I must of aged 25 years overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, nearly a decade later I am doing better.  Still looking old and tired but recovering. I found that DermaWand a few months ago cleaning out closets. I took it out &amp; cleaned off the dust.  I decided to try it again.  My granddaughter was visiting the first time I used it.  I only did one side of my face. I wanted to see if my granddaughter would notice.  When my 12 year old grand daughter looked at me I wasn&#x27;t expecting the reactio I got from her.  She screamed. Well needless to say she scared me.  I reacted with an echo scream back.  She wasn&#x27;t expecting my reaction either &amp; she screamed again.  After the initial reaction &amp; all the drama calmed down, my grand daughter said,  &amp;#34;Nana, your face&amp;#34;!! I replied, &amp;#34;Is it that bad?&amp;#34;  That is when she said &amp;#34;Nana, you looked really sick&amp;#34;  Oh my gosh....I thought the worst.  But after talking to her I realized that sick is the new lingo for looking good.  She said I looked all glommed up and young. What a great compliment from the mouth of a babe.  I now feel likeI look on the outside matches what I feel on the inside of my heart. I am happy. Also about to be 65 in three weeks.  DermaWand has given me a whole new look and a new beginning,  I will tell anyone who is considering getting a DermaWand to  do it.  If you really want to look really &amp;#34;sick&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; in terms of the youth today it works.  I will tell you it has tightened my turkey neck, lifted my jowls and sagging lines around my mouth.  My elevens are gone.  My eyes look fresh and lifted.  The hardest part is convincing my friends I am not keeping secrets and went out and had work done.  DermaWand really works.  It has changed my life.</li>
            <li> Hello fellow anti-aging fighters!  I&#x27;m turning 47 in a couple months and years of too much fun, too much sun, too much sorrow, too much stress, weight fluctuations and neglect of a good skincare regime has taken a toll.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I developed furrows between my eyebrows in my 30s, but managed to be mostly wrinkle and sag free until about 5 years ago.  Then, oh my!  Wrinkled forehead, crow&#x27;s feet, saggy upper eyelids, dark under eyes, beginnings of jowls, marionette lines and smoker lines around my lips. Not to mention the neck attempting to fall into my shirt.  In the words of my beautiful, young, niece, &amp;#34;that scarf doesn&#x27;t do you any favors Aunt T.&amp;#34;  Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried everything from Perricone (expensive and disappointed), to Murad (pricey, some results) to Meaningful Beauty, LIghtstim (too passive), Flexaway (too sensitive gag reflex, hard for me to do everyday, but works), facial exercises (works but I&#x27;m lousy about sticking with and takes forever..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal, Oil of Olay, Nutrisse, Almay, Burt&#x27;s Bees, I&#x27;ve tried them all.  Mostly I&#x27;ve gotten &amp;#34;some&amp;#34; results.  But rarely great (though Mercola all Organic was awesome, just can&#x27;t afford it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year I&#x27;ve noticed my face (literally) falling.  I would look in the mirror and see my grandmother, and my 70 year old aunt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing, no matter how much I tried, was making a noticeable (to anyone but me) difference in these jowls that have added 10 years and that I hate.  Well, nothing until the Derma Wand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not paid by DW, I just want to share something that is working for me!  This is what I am finding over my initial 2 months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The &amp;#34;instructional video&amp;#34; put out by the company stinks.  It explains little, it is vague and it left me searching for other answers. YouTube has some decent vids, maybe if I continue to get results I&#x27;ll throw up a video.  I decided to go with my gut and follow the contours of my face and neck muscles, always with long, sweeping strokes up, and light down.  I also NEVER run the wand from the outside of the bottom of my eye to the nose, always go the opposite direction (out and up) as heading towards the nose seemed to make my dark circles darker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  The gel supplied with the machine is chock full of suspicious (to me) chemicals.  And it makes my skin itch, splotch and burn if I use it everyday, or if I do not wash it off after using it.  I&#x27;ve been using my Murad Serum, or a Vitamin C serum, followed by  coconut oil (pure &amp; organic), or castor oil (pure &amp; organic too) and a few more minutes running the wand over it in circles and upstrokes from mouth to forehead.  I&#x27;m here today to find some hyaluronic acid serums as recommended by others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It takes longer than 15 minutes, especially in the beginning.  However, I realized that my wrinkles and sag took decades to form, so expecting anything to work immediately, and in seconds, is delusional.  I have to exercise my gut to keep it in shape, why would my face be any different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Derma Wand obsessively for the first two weeks straight.  Usually twice per day for around 10 minutes in the morning and 25 or so at night.  I was using coconut and magnesium oil, and while it made my skin beautiful, it wasn&#x27;t doing much for the sag and wrinkles.  I went online and found that the OIL was stopping the conductivity, so I switched to an oil-free serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I saw my sister and even though I was seeing subtle changes in pictures, she noticed nothing and I was devastated!  Immediately I nearly stopped using it regularly and this continued for the next two weeks as my normal personality flaw had me grousing and making excuses not to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the month mark I decided that I spent the money, it was working some, and unless I truly gave it a fair trial, I had wasted my money (again).  Back to once a day thoroughly, and a second time if time allows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ithas now been two months total (so one month more consistently) and the pictures I took yesterday BLEW ME AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brow furrows are lessened, I can see more of my eyelid between lash &amp; crease, my crow&#x27;s feet (including a horrible vertical line from side sleeping running down my cheek) are fainter.  The lines around my mouth are at least 50% reduced and my lips are plumper - noticeably younger looking! My jowls have noticeably shrunk, my neck is noticeably tighter and the entire shape of my face is returning to the younger woman I used to know!  (It is scary how long my aging face seemed to be becoming!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, I&#x27;m addicted to the Derma Wand.  I&#x27;m going to keep at it and will come back to let you all know how it&#x27;s going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you give this little machine it&#x27;s due, use it with the proper products, and have patience, you may just end up as addicted and in love as I am!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s to better aging!has now been two months total (so one month more consistently) and the pictures I took yesterday BLEW ME AWAY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My brow furrows are lessened, I can see more of my eyelid between lash &amp; crease, my crow&#x27;s feet (including a horrible vertical line from side sleeping running down my cheek) are fainter.

            <li> I took a before picture before using my derma wand. After 6 weeks of use I took an after picture. To my disappointment, there was no difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my, Derma Wand skin care system, for just over 1month. I can already see a difference in my skin. The lines around my mouth aren&#x27;t as pronounced as they were, and my eyelids aren&#x27;t as baggie.&lt;br /&gt;  I have tried 2  other  skin care systems.. They made my face sweat and the creams ran in my eyes, so I quit using them. The one product ,I only used 1 time. With the Derma Wand skin care products,  my skin just feels better, and it doesn&#x27;t make my face sweat. I can&#x27;t tell anything is on my face, it&#x27;s so light.&lt;br /&gt;  I belong to the PREFERRED BEAUTY CLUB, so I won&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> NO STARS, did noting for me at all.  Not sure about the billing just sent back last week.  Fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> Had purchased dermawand, best thing I ever did, results are fantastic and unfortunately I broke it and will not hestitate to order another one.  Just have to be careful not to drop it on hard surface which is what happened to my first one.</li>
            <li> The lift it has given my eyes is great!  I will recommend it to my friends and family.  Love it!</li>
            <li> Love it! It really works but you must use it consistently. Doesn&#x27;t hurt, doesn&#x27;t take much time. Really made me look younger, especially around the eyes. Tightens up your skin and makes it feel firmer to the touch. I was skeptical at first, but it was money well spent and I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Can I use this in New Zealand (I see this is 110V but New Zealand has 240V) ??</li>
            <li> it works real well, I like it and will recommend ti to my friends the only problem was the DVD that came with it does not work.</li>
            <li> I was dubious when I purchased Derma Wand as it sounded too good to be true. But I was getting a bit desperate as jowls were suddenly emerging and a jaw line disappearing and I was quickly beginning to look my age.  So I ordered this and after 2 weeks I saw a difference.  I take a film acting class and I was seeing the difference on film over a course of weeks.  It&#x27;s now been 4 months and it has taken 5 years off and I&#x27;m not kidding.  Jaw line is much firmer. Jowls not completely gone, but greatly reduced.  So  I highly recommend it. At least from my experience, it was an investment that has paid off very well.  I&#x27;m both relieved and delighted.</li>
            <li> Have only been using it for 4 days so I&#x27;m sure I need to give it more time before I see any great changes.&lt;br /&gt;I also thought another product to apply after the treatment was going tò be included.</li>
            <li> Received unit dec 16th. Was given as a christmas present. It worked for four months and is now dead. 30 day warranty? Really? Dont waste your money</li>
            <li> Do not purchase this product! Estheticians do not recommend it, and they will bamboozle you into signing up for a Free Rewards program. When I cancelled the product, I assumed I was cancelling the entire purchase. But No! The rewards program needs to be cancelled separately. I ended up getting charged $24.95 and they DO NOT offer refunds. BUYER BEWARE!!!</li>
            <li> I recently (April 2014) purchased the Derma Wand Kit.  When it arrived &amp; I read the enclosed information. It said if you have ANY skin disorders like broken capillaries, (I do- they look like small varicose veins) you cannot use the Derma Wand.  I don&#x27;t remember them being specific about any other &amp;#34;disorders&amp;#34; in the booklet.  What else would fall into this category??  Maybe the customer rep would tell you over the phone, I don&#x27;t know.  So far I am out a non-refundable $14.95 processing fee &amp; should have no other charges.  I returned it about one week after receiving it.  Also, I do not know if you HAVE to use their skin-care products, or if you can use with your own moisturizer.  Ask the rep if you call!!!  Their products are too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> I dont like to give low rate or bad review, but i dont wanna lie either. Unfirtunately for me, this derma wand didnt work at all. I used 3 weeks every day, 2 times a day and nothing changed. I can not recommend this product :-(</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to make this large purchase because the commercials were so &#x27;gimcky&#x27;. However, I am so glad that I did. I am almost 42 years old and am just beginning to see the signs of aging on my face. I haven&#x27;t really tried other anti-aging products because I tend to have sensitive skin and did not want to break out. After a couple of weeks of regular use of the Derma Wand, I noticed a big difference. My skin is smoother, tighter, and more evenly colored. My face pores also appear to be minimized. I just got &#x27;carded&#x27; this weekend by a club security guard who suspected I was under 21 years old!! That had to be the ultimate compliment and I will definitely continue my Derma Wand use. Although a bit costly, it is one-time investment that actually works! I highly recommend. By the way, I didn&#x27;t use the lotion that came with the product....I use Palmer&#x27;s Face Milk.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just been using this a couple weeks. The biggest difference I seen so far is the bags under my eyes. If only for this reason this product is worth it for me. It&#x27;s a constant battle. And with regular use of the Wand they are greatly reduced. My skin feels healthier and shinier. As for the sagging I&#x27;ve not noticed a big difference. But it hasn&#x27;t been 6 weeks yet. But so far I&#x27;m enjoying the Wand.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet. I have been using the product for 4 weeks I suppose I have to use it for 6 weeks to see changes</li>
            <li> Too soon to have real results but it is easy to use so have a good feeling about the outcome.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product. In recent years Ive had some issues with skin problems.The derma wand has helped to clear up my skin almost immediately.  My face feels so much smoother and I&#x27;ve noticed the deep lines in my forehead and mouth are shrinking. I would recommend this product to anyone, in fact, I have.  I just ordered one for my girlfriend.  I know she&#x27;s going to love it.</li>
            <li> I just started using my derma wand. I have used it about three days. I can tell a difference already.  My face looks lifted. And my Marietta lines are less noticeable it is almost a good as a juvederm injection. My eyes have lifted some. I was shocked. I also was complemented yesterday day on how I look young for my age. Two ladies had a bet on how old I was one lady guessed almost 20 years younger. I love it! I do take care of my skin and use good naural products on my skin. I can&#x27;t to see my 30 day results. I have not used the products that came with the kit. My skin can be sensitive.</li>
            <li> I feel the tingle of the wand on my skin that makes you hope it is doing something,  but not results.It has only been a few weeks so hopefully it will soon show a difference.</li>
            <li> Bought it mid September 2012, never got dropped / anything but suddenly quit working last week. Called their customer service, without asking question to diagnose what the problem it might be, she just said, it&#x27;s the bulb and that is not covered under warranty. You have to ship the unit back to us &amp; pay $25 for the bulb plus $9.99 for us to ship back the unit to you. NOT EVEN 3 MONTHS!!! And they said they have 10 years warranty, on WHAT? It could be the electrical item in the unit, who knows? But without even diagnosing they just said it&#x27;s the part that isn&#x27;t covered under warranty. What A Warranty. Totally disappointed,!</li>
            <li> The Dermawand works ok in the United States, but does not work very well outside of the US in places that require an adaptor.  i have tried to use the wand in Germany and in South Africa.  The result is that the wand will only revert to the very highest setting!  This is not feasible for someone who travels.</li>
            <li> If you use it as instructed it works...</li>
            <li> Great price and product!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, so I can&#x27;t say whether I like it or not or whether it&#x27;s doing what it promises or not.</li>
            <li> I bought the derma Wand considering all the mixed reviews and I have to say.. the texture of my skin has greatly improved. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now.  I haven&#x27;t seen much improvement with wrinkles  and although I can see a bit of a lift with my eyes, I do not get the dramatic effect the models get on the commercial.</li>
            <li> Total and complete crap......</li>
            <li> The product came very fast.  I really love this product. I just turned 46 yrs old. I started using it as soon as I got it.  I like the way it works on the under eye.  I do not always use it twice a day or everyday but it works great.  I use my own skin care products to kept my skin hydrated.  This product is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT FROM THE COMMERCIAL THEN READ THE REVIEWS AND THOUGH OH MY GOSH WHAT HAVE I BOUGHT.  BUT TO BE HONEST SO FAR I HAVE SEEN A DIFFERENCE IN FIRMING AND MY LAUGH LINES AND LINES AROUND MY EYES ARE MUCH LESS NOTICIABLE.  THE ONE THING I AM CURIOUS AND IF SOMEONE CAN LET ME KNOW IS THERE OTHER PRODUCTS YOU CAN USE WITH THIS OR IS IT ONLY THEIR PRODUCTS?  THE LOTION YOU PUT ON BEFORE USING THE WAND CAN IT BE ANOTHER PRODUCT?  JUST CURIOUS.  BUT SO FAR HAPPY I WAS HONESTLY GOING TO CANCEL THE ORDER BUT SO FAR HAPPY WILL KEEP YOU POSTED.  WISH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT THROUGH AMAZON THOUGH, IT IS CHEAPER HERE!</li>
            <li> It works at least for me . It does smell like ozone when you use it but it is not an offensive smell actually it is a very clean smell. I like it and my friends have noticed my lines have diminished that is a good thing!!</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are not going away, or getting better (the wife uses it religiously).... but she does say the pores on her skins, especially her nose are smaller from it. So maybe it does something....</li>
            <li> good choice, after several months of use I can say that it is perfect for skin, fine wrinkles. Good seller, thanks</li>
            <li> I was skeptical Let &#x27;s say I bought just prove to my sister she was scammed.  But after starting to use the wand after 2 months I started see a change. I like it.</li>
            <li> This product was awful!  It burns and it made my wrinkles under my eyes and around my mouth worse. I followed the instructions to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and this product has aged me about 10 years.  I would never recommend this product.</li>
            <li> you really have to do it more than 5 minutes that is the only down fall but it works</li>
            <li> I am almost 60 years old. I used the derma wand twice daily.  In the evening, i use it  to apply my skin serum and night cream. in one week there was a dramatic reduction in my smile lines. I had a pet die recently and I had these huge bags that sat at the top of my cheeks one week after I had stopped crying. Since the derma wand helps to improve circulation, I applied it to the bags....24 hours later they were completely gone! I love this thing.....just wish that the tip was bigger so I could use it elsewhere on my body!</li>
            <li> Broke on my second use!! Do not buy!!</li>
            <li> Bought the product, it has made no difference that I can tell in my appearance. I use it twice a day for anywhere from five minutes to ten minutes. I have had the derma wand for a few weeks now and will continue to use for a while longer, if still no results will stop</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the DermaWand four weeks now.I&#x27;ve been using it at least twice a day, sometimes more. When I first started using it, my face got very red, even on the lowest setting. It stayed red for quite a while. After about two weeks, I noticed the redness faded sooner. Now it hardly even gets red and it fades almost immediately. As for the effectiveness of the DermaWand, it seems to be working. My skin looks better. It appears less \\&quot;saggy\\&quot;. My jaw line looks smoother and my color is better (not so pale). And finally, my eyelids, which were rather droopy, look less heavy, and the puffiness under my eyes has lessened. I have to say, I&#x27;m happy with the results so far. I have no doubt that with continued use my appearance will improve even more. And just for the record, I&#x27;m 66, and I must say, I haven&#x27;t felt this good about the way I look in years.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first with a new product however, I was so happy to have purchased this product. The Derma Wand provided its goal over and above all expectations! My face and neck feel so soft and have begun to look youthful. The compliments have begun just within a few short weeks of using this product. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! I use it twice a day, morning and night, for 15 minutes each,concentrating on the deep lines. I&#x27;m  consistent with the use of it  in this way and  it&#x27;s toned my face, particularly the cheeks and under the chin  and has given me a more youthful appearance. Within a few days I could already see a slight change and after two months I look ten years younger! People remark when they learn how old I am but I&#x27;m an older woman so this might be why the change was so dramatic  on me.</li>
            <li> Purchased a Derma Wand - the unit is now faulty. Amazon.com recommends contacting them directly for warranty support - emailed them 7 times now and they have not bothered to respond. Shocking service, do not expect any support from this company.</li>
            <li> when used constantly it does work; this ws gift for friend after I used for 3 months... checked with her and she is very happy</li>
            <li> Started to love it and see a bit of a difference.  Wand quit working 45 days later.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month twice daily for 3 minutes each session as instructed and it did absolutely nothing for my skin.....I even used the skin care products with it.  I have since returned it for a refund...maybe 30 days isn&#x27;t enough to really show noticable changes and they should offer a 90 day trial instead.  I see several 5 star ratings so it must work for some people so I would say give it a try....it&#x27;s definitely resonably priced.</li>
            <li> I liked the concept of Derma Wand.  It is easy to use, and compact.  I intend to keep on trying it, although, I&#x27;m not such a creature of habit that I faithfully use in twice a day.  Three months of use, twice a day is just not in my busy schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to continue though, thinking maybe even once a day several times a week is better than nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I will keep it but am marginal on the results so far after about a month. I read one review from a 65 year old--my age--and I agree. Our lines are much different that the 50 somethings and 40 somethings using this. I continue to wonder if my wand is actually working properly. I never got a smell. I do hear that buzzing noise when I move it around. I think the lines above my lips are slowly softening cand that was the key reason I bought it. That and the neck lines and those are very very hard to change. I agree that the PreFace is not a good product. Sticky. And it is important to get the right amount of moisture on the skin for use. I admit that I find the results disappointing.</li>
            <li> I love my Derma wand. didn&#x27;t take any time before I can see the difference in some of the deeper lines I have been using it on. It also has let my skin looking fresher.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product, I really notice a difference in the texture and overall appearance of the face and neck. It is a great tool for reducing and eliminating wrinkles with no pain or negative secondary effects.&lt;br /&gt;Carlos B.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice and does what it says,  will take awhile though</li>
            <li> Are you serious?!!! Do NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. I just watched the commercial and its ridiculous!!! If their commercial advertisement is true and it gives your skin O3, OZONE, instead of O2 regular oxygen gas, these people obviously have no idea what they&#x27;re talking about, and what horrible product they have created. Does anyone know how harmful ozone is to your cells and respiratory system? Even if this is a mistake, then the creators dont have any clue what chemistry is, how stupid theyve made themselves look, and how obvious it is that this product is crap and there is no real science behind it anyways. If anything this product will age you. Please for the sake of your health.  Do. Not. Purchase.</li>
            <li> Skeptically purchased the DermaWand and have never been happier as I have already been absolutely ASTONISHED at the results from just a few days useage! I NEVER want to be without one and will be a faithful user because the results are REAL. I have added Life Cell and Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream to my daily regime in addition to the DermaWand and continue to see better and better results! I love the tingly sensation of the DermaWand and find it refreshing and relaxing at the end of a long day after a deep facial cleansing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and feels stimulating, although took a bit to get used to the interesting tingle/spark of static-type pluses.</li>
            <li> My mom loves it. I bought it for her as a present. I have seen the different though she looks a bit younger :)</li>
            <li> GREAT, I CANT BELIEVE IT REALLY WORKS WELL</li>
            <li> I have been faithfully using this product for 2 months now and can see no improvement.  I think I may have wasted my money.  Does not do what they claim it should do.</li>
            <li> After 3 1/2 weeks of using the Derma Wand, I see no difference.  As this is a short amount of time and I am optimistic, I will continue use.  I have not told anyone that I am doing this and I feel that my friends will be the judge if they state how great I look. LOL! We can all hope. At this time I will rate this 3 stars (it&#x27;s o.k.) but really if I see no difference in the future it will be rated 2 stars (didn&#x27;t like it)and of course if it proves what is stated in the article it will get a hands down 5.  Age 59.</li>
            <li> This is my second one. .I Love it!</li>
            <li> It dried up my face very nasty...if I can return it I would send it right back. No difference&lt;br /&gt;Was seen</li>
            <li> broke. Had to return it</li>
            <li> I guess I should take a &#x27;before&#x27; photo and report back in six months. I&#x27;m using the Dermawand with my own moisturizer and applying it twice a day like the booklet suggests. I&#x27;ve seen the before-and-after pix while I was researching prior to purchase and I didn&#x27;t detect any photoretouching. At this point in my life I&#x27;d be happy if the Dermawand&#x27;s effect causes people to comment that I look good for my age. Right now, I am a work in progress.</li>
            <li> I think this works, it&#x27;s hard to postively say. You can feel it &#x27;working&amp;#34;, I think it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
            <li> My wife just begin to use it and it will be lying if I give a rating of this item. Amazon should know this and answer according with the item one buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;regards</li>
            <li> This is my second Derma Wand.  I really like using it and I feel it does help make look better.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my mom and she went crazy when she got it, she loves it and works fine</li>
            <li> Used this for several months, and noticed no change at all to my skin. Then I accidentally bumped it against the coffee table and the glass tip shattered.</li>
            <li> It seems to be helping, lines and wrinkles have improved and my eyes look better.</li>
            <li> I have owned my Derma Wand for about 8 years. It does temporarily lift, which I believe with extended use would be beneficial. I use it for blemishes, facial massage, and more recently to promote healing of a skin injury. In fact, I was amazed at how much the Derma Wand helped heal the skin. Unfortunately, as I was about to use mine today, I dropped it and by my own fault broke the cap. I am reordering. The effectiveness of a cosmetic dermatology tool is also based on general skin health. If you would like to learn more go to www.skinremodelingdiy.com</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few weeks but I like it a lot.  Know it has helped.</li>
            <li> I like it a lot. I think it is working.</li>
            <li> This product is not very effective. I can do the very same thing with a facial mask for about the cost of ($4.00). I am not a gadget person unless that product is worth the money and I trust that it will give results as advertised. This kit doesn&#x27;t do that, in my opinion.  I am 60 years of age and have been around the &amp;#34;block&amp;#34; a few times, had many facials, etc. GIve me a professional product even if it cost a few bucks more...I think the price of this product would be more in the $29.99 price range.</li>
            <li> I havent  had it long enough to tell. i bought it for th acne i have but so far cant tell the difference :/</li>
            <li> Hard to tell whether it&#x27;s working or not.  It definitely creates a bit of electric &amp;#34;buzz&amp;#34; that tingles upon touch.  The question is whether this very mild electric stimulation is good for the skin or damaging it.  I am not an expert, so hard to say.  One thing is for sure.  If this thing does work, it&#x27;s over a long-term.  Do not expect dramatic or miraculous changes to your face after a few treatments.</li>
            <li> Undecided about this product.  Not as quick and easy as advertised.  Not difficult to use..but there are numerous patterns they recommend you do twice a day.  Doing them all takes about 20 minutes.  Time is the issue for me resulting in the 2 star rating.</li>
            <li> I would not reccomend, this product to anyone. The solutions caused  my skin  to breakout. I was very  disappointed with  the product.</li>
            <li> I ordered one and received three</li>
            <li> I ordered the Derma Wand about two weeks ago by first going to their web site and then calling the phone number listed on the web site. It only took one week to receive! I would recommend calling and speaking to a customer service representative in order to ask questions and understand the offer. Before I go in to the offer and what you receive and the cost, I just wanted to say that I am 49 years old. I have large poors and oily skin, for the most part. I don&#x27;t have major crows feet around my eyes yet, but have tiny lines there. My major concern are the lines on the side of my mouth and a little sagging that started on my jawline.  I also have some expression lines across my forhead. I have been using my Derma Wand faithfully, twice a day for a week now. I find it invigorating. I have found that the Derma Wand makes my skin appear smoother and more supple. I am now starting to see some improvement with the expression lines running from my nose to mouth and the slight folds are tightening up and smoothing out too! I see a slight lifting effect above my eyes, though I think this is going to improve with more time. All-in-all, I am very pleased after using for only one week. I think people really need to give the Derma Wand enough time to see lasting results. Results are cumulative over time, as your muscles \\&quot;remember\\&quot; their tone after using the Derma Wand each time. I actually look forward to using it, especially before I put on my make up. I don&#x27;t really use the skin care products that came with it, except for the pre-face. Now for the cost. I have seen some negative reviews about being charged for extra things. This is why I STRONGLY recommend calling to order the Derma Wand and not ordering from the website. I called and spoke to a CS representative and told her I did not want to buy or be charged for anything extra. She explained to me that as part of the ordering \\&quot;process,\\&quot; she had to go through several offers on her screen. So each time an offer came up, I declined. I even declined the extended warranty. Then she told me to say \\&quot;Yes\\&quot; when the order for just the Derma Wand came up and only the Derma Wand. She explained that the Derma Vital skin care products automatically come with the Derma Wand offer and were free, except that my credit card would be charged the $9.99 for shipping/processing of the skin care products. She also explained that today I would have to pay the full tax on the Derma Wand, which came to $8.27 for my state tax. So, my card was charged a total of $18.37 in order to receive the Derma Wand and the Derma Vital skin care products. Then, if after the 30 day trial I decide to keep the Derma Wand, then I would be charged $39.95 for the first real payment plus $14.95 for the shipping/processing for a total of $54.90 for the first of 3 monthly payments. Then the next two monthy payments would just be for the $39.95. So far my card has only been charged the $18.37 as she stated it would be for the 30 Day trial period, paying just for the tax and shipping of the skin care products. I was very clear with the CS rep that I did not want to order anything extra or be charged anything extra and that is exactly what she gave me!  So, If you order on line at their website, you might get hung up on extra screens wanting you to buy extra products. Just call the phone number listed to order the Derma Wand instead, and you will be fine! All products offered on \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; want you to buy extra things. Just stick to the original offer and you won&#x27;t be charged anything else. The Derma Wand is a very good beauty and skin care device. You just have to use it faithfully and you will begin to see results!!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping as described AAAAA+++++</li>
            <li> Happy with my derma wand</li>
            <li> I bought mine directly from Dermawand which I wouldn&#x27;t recomend as you can skip the HARD SELL here on amazon that the  Dermawand customer service has to push. The DermaWand products are not good, not worth the extra $90! Having said that, I do love this device although I am buying another brand. Dermawand is very durable and pretty tough to break and does deliver results! But, I want the hair comb attachment on another product bc this is definately working!!! Also other products come with diferent wands, which will get you more specific results, acne/blemish over night cure BTW! Skin tightening.. I also use a PMD Microderabrasion device and the Silk Skin products as well as serums and GREAT Moisturizer.. And it&#x27;s working on my arms, legs and decolete&#x27; and scars from surgery!  I am 55 and had a health battle which resulted in premature aging of my skin, but, as of a month into using dermawand, I am getting compliments that I wasn&#x27;t getting prior!! Hope that helps!</li>
            <li> Time will tell on the wrinkles, but my skin texture and firmness is better after just 2 weeks.  I will keep at it as I think it will improve with more time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this treatment. However, I developed a stye on one of my eyes and cold sores on my lips within two weeks of starting treatments. I don&#x27;t know whether my unit was not clean (I did clean it thoroughly when I first got it and each time I used it) or whether my body reacted against it, but I had to send it back. Amazon honored their money-back guarantee with no questions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 58 years old. I had lost the luster and glow in my skin. My jaw line had started to drop and around my eyes were crow feet also my eye  lids had started to sag. I&#x27;ve been using this for a month. already seen a different in my over all skin tone, a lift to my jaw and eye area.</li>
            <li> It makes the skin feel better as in softer and maybe a little firmer, but has not reduced any wrinkles. Temporarily raises the eyebrow very little. I don&#x27;t have bad wrinkles, but it needs to help a little more. I use it one to two times a day. I plan to keep using it to see if time will make a difference.</li>
            <li> Tripped the circuit in my bathroom and stopped working.  Manufacturer refuses to help or send another because I bought from Amazon  Too bad--it worked really well for 5 weeks--see below for my first review. Product 5 stars, manufacturer 0 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was planning to wait to review until I used the device for one month, but saw results so fast!!  At age 54 my lips haved smoothed and plumped up to what they looked like at 24.  No more little lines and fissures and they are much plumper.  I use a lip cream with the dermawand. Important--I never smoked.  Smoker prune lips are scarred and can&#x27;t be fixed by this.  The little crows feet lines are now barely visible.  I confess I use the wand once a day most of the time.insted of twice.  I also try it with premium quality skin creams instead of the cheap ones that come with the product.  The enclosed gel product is good to lubricate the skin but dries out really quickly. I apply to one section of my face and neck at a time and use specific eye cream around my eyes. I purchased as a doubter but seeing is believing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for years.  Broke it and so bought this new one.  They definitely improved the model a lot.  The cap is great.  I recommend this product.  I have had acne for 14 years and when I bother to use this I always see results.  It is truly magical.</li>
            <li> Hi, there!&lt;br /&gt;As I am buying from Australia, I would have appreciated knowing that I would need to spend an additional $100 buying a step down transformer in order to use the product here.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
            <li> i have used derma wand for more than 6 years now. Although i have tried other similar devices including derma needle roller, D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct, and even Tria age-defying Lasor, i found Derma Wand being the most beneficial and economical facial tool.  Here is why,   D&#x27;arsonval High frequency direct is less expensive than Derma Wand but the sparks zap on you like crazy, even into your eyes.  Tria age-defying lasor  darkens age spots and sun spots. They said continue using the treatment, spots should be lightened after being darken, but sorry, my skin became so ugly with no positive results.  The down time is just too long, i gave up.   If you experiencing dry skin after using derma wand, apply a thin layer of vitamin a with e oil by Derma e before the treatment. You can also use a facial steamer to steam your face afterwards,</li>
            <li> This is only a temporary review. I have not been consistent in using this product so I will update in a couple of months. So far I like it. it is very easy to use. the instructions are clear. no adverse side effects. does not hurt at all. not very expensive. does not suck up your time like applying a facial mask. I have not seen any results but I have not used it but 2x a week. I plan to use it every day then see what happens.</li>
            <li> Lets just say where it might work on fine lines on your face it does nothing for gravity ie: turkey neck and droopy eyelids</li>
            <li> this does not work don&#x27;t buy it I used it faithfully for 2 months and noticed nothing big waste of money</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use it. Saw a difference the first day. Don&#x27;t believe &amp;#34;nay sayers&amp;#34;, because it really works! Very happy with seller!</li>
            <li> Used it religiously for 2 weeks. No change in my skin. Maybe it is made for younger women who are just starting to get wrinkles.</li>
            <li> it is the product i wanted.</li>
            <li> I use for several months and saw no improvement</li>
            <li> What a nice surprise! I have tried quite a number of serums, creams and lotions that claim to firm the skin, and have seen really very little effect.  I have been using the Dermawand for about three weeks, and I actually see a significant firming effect on my neck and jawline, which have been been a concern for some time. I don&#x27;t see as much effect, yet, on my face, but those areas were not as loose and wrinkled.  I think the Dermawand is well worth the price from Amazon. Like others, I would not order directly from Dermawand - why pay $50 or more extra if you don&#x27;t have to? Like others, I would also arrange to use the device while watching TV. or reading, as it can get pretty boring, and I think the 5 minutes suggested by the manual probably won&#x27;t have nearly as much effect as 30 minutes. For those hesitating because of the price, I would suggest adding up all the money you have already spent on serums, creams and lotions that haven&#x27;t worked very well, as I did. Compared to that, the Dermawand is a bargain.</li>
            <li> I read positive reviews, but not my experience.  Sorry to say.  Gravity and genetics for the most part I think.</li>
            <li> Just started using my derma wand and already see results, not so much on the wrinkles yet but my pores are smaller and skin generally looks better.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product. I used on facial scars that were years old the wand removed them. My face looks fantastic. The difference is amazing. I also removed other scars that were more recent. They were easier to remove. The creams softened my skin and aided removal. This product is awesome and worth the price. I did drop the first one and broke the glass end, but immediately purchased my second one because I wanted to complete scar removal. Thanks Dermawand for what could could have cost thousands by a professional.</li>
            <li> It was delivered in a timely manner and the product was in perfect condition. I use it everyday and I love it. I don&#x27;t know yet what the exact results will be because I have only had it for a couple of weeks. But I do seem to already notice some improvements.</li>
            <li> I returned a DermaWand due to its breaking after only 2 mos. Wonderful product but after much trouble with the Dermavital site thru Amazon I had to go to DermaWand directly.  I even ordered a second product as it takes up to 4 weeks for replacement.  I am now told that the warranty is not covered by DermaWand except thru their site.  They went ahead and sent me a new one but did not send back the accessories and informed me the Amazon site is not authorized site. Completely misleading. Too bad, as the product works, but not worth the headache in dealing with the Amazon site or DermaWand company.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it much but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I NEED TO USE IT MORE - JUST HAVE SO MANY THINGS GOING ON I DON&#x27;T SEEM TO FIND THE TIME TO USE IT.  I REALLY SHOULD</li>
            <li> Zapping stinging feeling and my skin smells burnt after use...not pleased with this product</li>
            <li> I never got to use it since I gifted it to my sister who loves it very much.</li>
            <li> This unit is replacement the previous one fell and the tip broke. My wife has used it for about 3 years and she loves it. Results can vary from person to person. But her coworkers have also noticed the change. This is not the fountain of youth but every bit helps.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not working and it&#x27;s been 6 weeks.....lesson learned</li>
            <li> Bought this with the best of hopes because of all the positive reviews just to try it long enough to find it totally useless and too long to return it. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Wife used it some but did not see any difference, sits in a drawer now.</li>
            <li> happy with the product</li>
            <li> This product does work you just need to use it daily. Be patient and you will see results.</li>
            <li> I just got dermawand and uesd it on my face. Dermawand do&#x27;s not work on my face . I am 34 year old no face lift</li>
            <li> Already after two weeks seeing amazing results.</li>
            <li> I just got this a few days ago, but I can honestly say I think it is making a difference.  I&#x27;m excited to see the results in another week or two.</li>
            <li> My Derma Wand Kit arrived today and the Instructions are in Spanish only. That tells me the company is poorly managed. I hope the products works.</li>
            <li> I like the product but the changes are not as drastic as they show in the advertisements nor are they long lasting but I still like it. it sure doesn&#x27;t have any bad effects so far.</li>
            <li> I have only been using the Derma Wand for about three weeks, so this may be a premature review.  I have been faithfully using it twice a day, as the directions tell me but no results so far.  None.  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;I have read that it takes time so I will keep the faith and keep using it. Would I buy it again?  Probably not at this point.</li>
            <li> I tried the Derma Wand after my Tuo Viso machine broke (after 5 years) &amp; I did not have the money to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;The Derma Wand STINKS. It has a very low frequency on it &amp; only 1 distribution point (Tuo Viso has 2) it takes 2 hours to do your whole face &amp; the results do not last very long at all.&lt;br /&gt;The whole thing about guaranteed money back is bs too because I have the original packaging, receipt &amp; so on &amp; am being told it has been 65 days instead of the stated on receipt 60 days to return &amp; I am stuck with it.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use it because I have it but I really don&#x27;t think it is that great of a product.</li>
            <li> Returned. Did nothing.</li>
            <li> I BEEN USING THIS DERMAWAND FOR ABOUT 8 MONTHS AND THE RESULTS IS AWESOME... I&#x27;M 61 YRS. OLD AND FAMILY FRIENDS  ALL THINK I HAD A FACE LIFT.. THE PRODUCT IS THE BEST OF THE BEST..&lt;br /&gt; I WAS USING IT AFTER MY MORNING SHOWER LIKE I ALWAYS DO AND I DROPPED IT AND THE BLUB (toning tip)GLASS BROKE ... I WAS SO UPSET CALLED HSN AND QVC AND THEY DIDNT HAVE IT.. SO I KEPT THE DERMWAND BOOKLET THAT CAME WITH IT AND LOOKED FOR THIER SITE. THEN THOUGHT OF AMAZON AND LOW AND BEHOLD I FOUND IT!!!! I WAS SO HAPPY... I&#x27;M GOING TO ODER ME ANOTHER I HOPE I CAN GET IT RIGHT AWAY..&lt;br /&gt;  I ALSO USE THIS DERMAWAND ON MT UPPER ARMS AND IT IS DOING WONDERS ON MY SAGGY ARMS...</li>
            <li> My satisfaction comes from my wife&#x27;s smile!  She had one but was getting weak after a year usage.&lt;br /&gt;I look at her when she electrifies herself!  And I get so scared.&lt;br /&gt;She says \\&quot;It works like a charm\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;She would say better:  \\&quot;It does electrify like a real short circuit\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;But honestly she is so happy, I am happy too!</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  This did absolutely nothing! And I used this faithfully, twice a day, for a month. Saw no difference in tone, tightening, or wrinkle lines. I give them credit for their commercials on T.V. They make it look very convincing.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or especially your money!</li>
            <li> Bought it for an aunt, shes really pleased with it so it must be nice</li>
            <li> I just received this three or four days ago, started using it immediately.  I have already noticed a visible change in my face and neck...this is a WONDERFUL product.  Easy to use, painless and the best is that it really WORKS!</li>
            <li> I NEVER GOT TO USE IT....I just ordered it as I saw it...AND IT WAS ALL IN SPANISH...DID NOT KNOW THAT!...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I haven&#x27;t been religious about using my Derma Wand over the past 15 years..... For the first few months I used it regularly and definitely saw a difference in my skin. But as time went by there were other products promising more easier glory, and my Derma Wand got resigned to the &amp;#34;it works but requires dedication&amp;#34; box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it&#x27;s my go-to for those occasional zits that develop before a special event.  A 45 second zap and that zit-to-be retreats!  Just zapped one tonight and realized this is worth sharing! Light bulb moment!  Why have I been ignoring this device when I know better!  This infuses your skin with vitality. Yes there&#x27;s an ozone smell but the change to your skin is amazing!  I know it works when used (regularly or not so much). This is a keeper which is why I still keep it on hand.  Note to self: keep using regularly!</li>
            <li> I really haven&#x27;t been able to tell much different in the amount of times I have used it, not as regular as recommended</li>
            <li> I have never written a review before but this is so amazing, I had to. I am a 47 year old white female. My daughter is 16 with pretty bad acne that has been seen by a dermatologist. I use many expensive beauty products  because my girl and I are photographed very close up on a weekly basis because of our job. We followed the directions and use it twice a day, increasing the level each time. We are at day 5. It said we should notice improvement in a week. The first day we could see a difference.My daughters skin is actually smooth and she has had no more new bumps pop up. The redness in the acne has improved greatly. I have very little as far as wrinkles go ( I recently had a car accident &amp; the officer called me in as early 30&#x27;s, whoot! lol) BUT, the sagging skin and huge pores? No product has helped with that until now. I also noticed that the whiteheads on my chin have just..vanished. Poof! I always check independent reviews &amp; I noticed this product has about a 70% approval rating. I also wonder if the people making reviews are paid, I&#x27;m not. Not everything works for everybody but the mirror don&#x27;t lie and it worked on both of us so I feel confidant in recommending this product.</li>
            <li> Mwife really likes this product and I wish we would have taken a before and after photo.  IT WORKS  !!!!!!</li>
            <li> After using it your skin feels refreshed and alive, this is my second one and it does make a difference in my skins appearance.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use along with my derma rolling.</li>
            <li> takes time, but boy, it does get rid of wrinkles, and really smoothes the deep ones somewhat.  Like it a lot</li>
            <li> The Derma Wand promises a great deal of improvement in facial skin. I so much wanted to believe the hype. However, I strongly suspect that the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;after&amp;#34; pictures are fake, as I noticed no change in the appearance of my skin after nearly four weeks. I returned the product yesterday for refund. Kudos to Amazon for making returns easy.</li>
            <li> I think it helps but does not give the results as shown in TV advertisement.  Will keep using to see if continued use helps.</li>
            <li> Only been using for about 2 weeks and every day I can see the old wrinkles vanishing before my eyes!!  (and around my eyes)!&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and could not be without it for even 1 day.&lt;br /&gt;thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> Although the produuct construction is good and it does produce a variable controlled tingling sensation, it is soon to tell if the claims of the manufacturer are valid because I have only tried it for a couple of weeks. But I am committed to tryinng it for a sunstantial time to see if it actualy works.</li>
            <li> Have been using it for a couple of weeks for 15-30 mins a night at almost highest setting.  I got nothing.  I look old and nothing changed. I&#x27;m 54 and look 54.  I have marionette lines and they have not diminished at all.  Also, after 5 minutes of use it doesn&#x27;t have much power. My return &amp;#34;window&amp;#34; has expired but if it hadn&#x27;t I would return.  Another thing is my DVD doesn&#x27;t work.  Lastly as soon as it touches my fact it stinks!  They &amp;#34;sell&amp;#34; it as your skin is oxygenating, yey!  But in reality it just stinks. Wish I had better news.  If anything changes I&#x27;ll update.</li>
            <li> So far I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my wrinkles, but I am getting a little used to using it..</li>
            <li> I have tried Pelleve so I know how a true in office machine like this works. You have to be diligent  but this is very effective and it helps to retain my results from the Pelleve at a dramatic fraction of the price!</li>
            <li> This is a rip off that is not true what they say on this video i strongly recomend not to buy this product based on my expirience and a cupleof friends that bought it and are returning it, please don&#x27;t make the same mistake i made by buying this unusefull product.</li>
