            <li>I have tried most products and this one is a good one.</li>
            <li>Water soluble, nice aroma.</li>
            <li>Holds hair nicely.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully without adding any kind greasiness or shininess to your hair; it just looks natural.</li>
            <li>This product is really nice but works better on finer or chemically relaxed hair textures.  </li>
            <li>I bought this by pure luck at some closeout of a beauty salon but always go out of my way to buy this and happy</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product.</li>
            <li>Not nasty like you expect for say hair gel.</li>
            <li>It smells like coconut and pineapple which I don&#x27;t love, but don&#x27;t mind either.</li>

            <li>I have been using d:fi for years and love it.</li>
            <li>It does an ok job, but nothing to rave home about.</li>

            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I tried Vilain Golddiger/Silver Fox, Style Sexy hair</li>
            <li>Great product reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Well satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>It holds ok and leaves flakes.</li>
            <li>This is the best product ever for my short hair.  </li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I first tried this at my sisters and loved it.</li>
            <li>and it smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li>I read the glowing reviews of this product here on Amazon, decided to give it a shot since I was looking for a new hair look, and it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>Holds better, smells like Christmas, and washes out easy.</li>
            <li>Gives enough control for the day and smells great (kind of like candy).</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Easy ordering, Shipping and delivery.  </li>
            <li>Extremely easy to use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to mold your hair to whatever you want and it keeps its shape.</li>
            <li>and I can easily recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>- I have a decent thickness and good body</li>
            <li>My beautician used this product (I normally won&#x27;t let her put in anything) and it looked good all day</li>
            <li>best mens hair gel hands down.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium-length hair that doesn&#x27;t cooperate.</li>
            <li>Great product at a price that beats salon pricing big time!</li>
            <li>Fantastic product.</li>
            <li>.. use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  Light and tropical-ish.</li>
            <li>Smells like chemicals and it&#x27;s filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic solution for men.</li>
            <li>Besides the fact the product lets you do whatever you want to your hair, it smells fantastic.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and the price was low.  </li>
            <li>Itâ€™s light, creamy, and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a light smell</li>
            <li>Avoid the cheap stuff...</li>
            <li>product: In moderation it leaves my hair natural without shine and a good hold that looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>It makes your hair stay fresh throughout the whole day and it even smells good.</li>
            <li>Good wax, not shiny or sticky, looks natural.</li>
            <li>This molding cream is best applied for me when hair is very slightly damp.</li>
            <li>The original &amp;#34;Pliable&amp;#34; version was great for me, I don&#x27;t know if it is the same product still.</li>
            <li>7 hold/7 shine prior to this and this one is amazing!</li>
            <li>I really enjoy using this and since the material is pretty strong, I have been using one bottle for a while now.</li>
            <li>I apply wet and it looks great when dries.</li>
            <li>, this is a great creme (I actually thought it was a wax when I first got it</li>
            <li>And if I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair the following day it still looks good -</li>
            <li>I definitely am not a hair stylist expert but for my hair this works well and give a strong hold and it is easy to use too!</li>
            <li>It goes far, smells great (kind of a tropical, coconut/fruit like smell), and it styles even the shortest of hair without being overly hard like gel.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Well worth the premium $.</li>
            <li>This has been a gamechanger for me.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a comparable product with better hold, shine and ESPECIALLY smell, take a look at the Light Wax in place of this.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite gel that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Most of my old products either didn&#x27;t hold well or caused flakes whenever my hair was touched.  </li>
            <li>This one is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>Only other kind that I&#x27;ve found to work better is Bumble Bumble, however this is a better price</li>
            <li>Not too shiny if you use the right amount.  </li>
            <li>I tried American Crew Forming Cream and while it is very easy to apply, it does not hold my hair up off my forehead</li>
            <li>I have very straight hair</li>
            <li>The d:struct is absolutely amazing for my new style and smells better than the green.</li>
            <li>Came in promptly but not the exact product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This is a better smelling version of American Crew&#x27;s Forming Cream.</li>
            <li>and I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to use, very affordable, and has a long shelf life.</li>
            <li>the smell is light and fresh, not heavy and perfume like many other men&#x27;s hair products.</li>
            <li>I have baby fine hair with a couple of cowlicks that this product wasn&#x27;t able to tame.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores, even though it is an American Crew product - although it seems I am seeing it more and more lately.</li>
            <li>I thought this would be a great hair gel from the ratings, but it is unfortunately not a good hair gel.</li>
            <li>Acts more like a low hold gel with high shine.</li>
            <li>Still works really well, mainly on dry or very very lightly damp hair.</li>
            <li>and I knew that it would mix better than my hair being dry.  </li>
            <li>My (fine blonde) hair&#x27;s now to my chin.</li>
            <li>I have fine, bone-straight Asian hair and a medium-short hair length (shorter than a bob, longer than a boy-cut).  </li>
            <li>Works great for my thin and shortish (2-3&amp;#34; hair).</li>
            <li>I actually intended on buying the light wax by D;fi, but bought this on accident.</li>
            <li>This product does the job very well</li>
            <li>I use this product to style and hold and it works very well, even adding volume.</li>
            <li>My hair: Straight and thick&lt;br</li>
            <li>Purchased this for family member who absolutely loves it....</li>
            <li>This product works really well for spiking hair and hold.  </li>
            <li>This one is really bang for the buck.</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I would have expected a bit more...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasing either.</li>
            <li>This smells like coconut, and creates a nice, firm hold for your hair.</li>
            <li>It is less sticky then the Spiker, and very easy to mold and manipulate.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair that will go flat unless I do a lot to it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been leery of hair products my entire life, because my hair is pretty fine and most hair product tends to be very heavy, greasy, and weighs down hair more than supporting it.  </li>
            <li>All other products I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many), lasts for an hour.  </li>
            <li>Its a sticky creme, that requires very little to be effective.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it is nowhere near the light wax in any area, and while good, will not be purchased again.</li>
            <li>and it is substantially better than any previous product i have used.  </li>
            <li>and I bought this product to mainly give texture and movement to my hair.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this particular item seemed more liquid than previously used product.</li>
            <li>This is a decent hair product.</li>
            <li>The picture did say medium but the write up said high.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>High recommendations here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll order the high shine version.  </li>
            <li>This product really does the trick to  style your hair while keeping it soft</li>
            <li>I have been using American Crew Fiber for a long time and have been pleased with the results</li>
            <li>With different amounts of heat and water in your hair you can pretty much style anyway</li>
            <li>It has a pina colada scent and doesn&#x27;t smell like a normal hair product.</li>
            <li>Only use a little and you can style perfectly without it looking greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li>and I am able to shape it without it being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a particular product from American Crew D. I thought I found the exact product based on the picture shown&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li>but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something new.</li>
            <li>- I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with fine hair as it will pull you hair down.</li>
            <li>I did not use very much about enough to give the inside tip of my finger.  </li>
            <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy to me, like wax or other products, and it molds and shapes at the same time.</li>
            <li>and it basically looks, feels, and behaves exactly like American Crew Forming Cream.</li>
            <li>because you only need a tiny bit for a full head of shorter hair.</li>
            <li>my hair is always soft, not stiff.</li>
            <li>Just natural.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy feeling in the hair and does not make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li>Hair stays soft but still styled.</li>
            <li>I use Dove molding cream or Old Spice now, I like both of those.</li>
            <li>Holy crap, this stuff is great!</li>
            <li>I have used this particular product for 10 years - starting back when it was in a white jar with a light blue lid.</li>
            <li>AC suddenly changed the consistency of the cream to a much looser thickness (like make-up remover) while making the new lid totally dumb with a &amp;#34;scratch and sniff love scene&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li>You only need a small dab, and run it most along the tips of your hair.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, it&#x27;s hard to start over.  </li>
            <li>I used it wet on clean hair and blow dry - then often will use it (sparingly) to hold the shape.</li>
            <li>This cream will hold your hair where you want it while keeping the natural sheen of freshly washed and dried hair.</li>
            <li>Even on mornings when my hair and I are equally tired, after a little d:fi, my coif looks spectacular!</li>
            <li>I dab a tiny amount on my fingertips after I take a shower, work it into my wet hair, and boom, the hair does exactly what I want without being too shiny and crunchy.  </li>
            <li>A little odd all it takes to finish off am easy hair style.  </li>
            <li>It is not heavy and lasts all day long.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Itâ€™s light, creamy, and non-greasy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a light smell</li>
            <li> Avoid the cheap stuff...</li>
            <li> product: In moderation it leaves my hair natural without shine and a good hold that looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li> It makes your hair stay fresh throughout the whole day and it even smells good.</li>
            <li> Good wax, not shiny or sticky, looks natural.</li>
            <li> This molding cream is best applied for me when hair is very slightly damp.</li>
            <li> The original &amp;#34;Pliable&amp;#34; version was great for me, I don&#x27;t know if it is the same product still.</li>
            <li> 7 hold/7 shine prior to this and this one is amazing!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this and since the material is pretty strong, I have been using one bottle for a while now.</li>
            <li> I apply wet and it looks great when dries.</li>
            <li> , this is a great creme (I actually thought it was a wax when I first got it</li>
            <li> And if I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair the following day it still looks good -</li>
            <li> I definitely am not a hair stylist expert but for my hair this works well and give a strong hold and it is easy to use too!</li>
            <li> It goes far, smells great (kind of a tropical, coconut/fruit like smell), and it styles even the shortest of hair without being overly hard like gel.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Well worth the premium $.</li>
            <li> This has been a gamechanger for me.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a comparable product with better hold, shine and ESPECIALLY smell, take a look at the Light Wax in place of this.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite gel that I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Most of my old products either didn&#x27;t hold well or caused flakes whenever my hair was touched.  </li>
            <li> This one is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> Only other kind that I&#x27;ve found to work better is Bumble Bumble, however this is a better price</li>
            <li> Not too shiny if you use the right amount.  </li>
            <li> I tried American Crew Forming Cream and while it is very easy to apply, it does not hold my hair up off my forehead</li>
            <li> I have very straight hair</li>
            <li> The d:struct is absolutely amazing for my new style and smells better than the green.</li>
            <li> Came in promptly but not the exact product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is a better smelling version of American Crew&#x27;s Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> and I tried it for the first time.  </li>
            <li> It is very easy to use, very affordable, and has a long shelf life.</li>
            <li> the smell is light and fresh, not heavy and perfume like many other men&#x27;s hair products.</li>
            <li> I have baby fine hair with a couple of cowlicks that this product wasn&#x27;t able to tame.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores, even though it is an American Crew product - although it seems I am seeing it more and more lately.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great hair gel from the ratings, but it is unfortunately not a good hair gel.</li>
            <li> Acts more like a low hold gel with high shine.</li>
            <li> Still works really well, mainly on dry or very very lightly damp hair.</li>
            <li> and I knew that it would mix better than my hair being dry.  </li>
            <li> My (fine blonde) hair&#x27;s now to my chin.</li>
            <li> I have fine, bone-straight Asian hair and a medium-short hair length (shorter than a bob, longer than a boy-cut).  </li>
            <li> Works great for my thin and shortish (2-3&amp;#34; hair).</li>
            <li> I actually intended on buying the light wax by D;fi, but bought this on accident.</li>
            <li> This product does the job very well</li>
            <li> I use this product to style and hold and it works very well, even adding volume.</li>
            <li> My hair: Straight and thick&lt;br</li>
            <li> Purchased this for family member who absolutely loves it....</li>
            <li> This product works really well for spiking hair and hold.  </li>
            <li> This one is really bang for the buck.</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I would have expected a bit more...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasing either.</li>
            <li> This smells like coconut, and creates a nice, firm hold for your hair.</li>
            <li> It is less sticky then the Spiker, and very easy to mold and manipulate.</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that will go flat unless I do a lot to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been leery of hair products my entire life, because my hair is pretty fine and most hair product tends to be very heavy, greasy, and weighs down hair more than supporting it.  </li>
            <li> All other products I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many), lasts for an hour.  </li>
            <li> Its a sticky creme, that requires very little to be effective.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it is nowhere near the light wax in any area, and while good, will not be purchased again.</li>
            <li> and it is substantially better than any previous product i have used.  </li>
            <li> and I bought this product to mainly give texture and movement to my hair.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this particular item seemed more liquid than previously used product.</li>
            <li> This is a decent hair product.</li>
            <li> The picture did say medium but the write up said high.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> High recommendations here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll order the high shine version.  </li>
            <li> This product really does the trick to  style your hair while keeping it soft</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew Fiber for a long time and have been pleased with the results</li>
            <li> With different amounts of heat and water in your hair you can pretty much style anyway</li>
            <li> It has a pina colada scent and doesn&#x27;t smell like a normal hair product.</li>
            <li> Only use a little and you can style perfectly without it looking greasy or stiff.</li>
            <li> and I am able to shape it without it being stiff or sticky.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a particular product from American Crew D. I thought I found the exact product based on the picture shown&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something new.</li>
            <li> - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with fine hair as it will pull you hair down.</li>
            <li> I did not use very much about enough to give the inside tip of my finger.  </li>
            <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy to me, like wax or other products, and it molds and shapes at the same time.</li>
            <li> and it basically looks, feels, and behaves exactly like American Crew Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> because you only need a tiny bit for a full head of shorter hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is always soft, not stiff.</li>
            <li> Just natural.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy feeling in the hair and does not make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Hair stays soft but still styled.</li>
            <li> I use Dove molding cream or Old Spice now, I like both of those.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this stuff is great!</li>
            <li> I have used this particular product for 10 years - starting back when it was in a white jar with a light blue lid.</li>
            <li> AC suddenly changed the consistency of the cream to a much looser thickness (like make-up remover) while making the new lid totally dumb with a &amp;#34;scratch and sniff love scene&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> You only need a small dab, and run it most along the tips of your hair.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, it&#x27;s hard to start over.  </li>
            <li> I used it wet on clean hair and blow dry - then often will use it (sparingly) to hold the shape.</li>
            <li> This cream will hold your hair where you want it while keeping the natural sheen of freshly washed and dried hair.</li>
            <li> Even on mornings when my hair and I are equally tired, after a little d:fi, my coif looks spectacular!</li>
            <li> I dab a tiny amount on my fingertips after I take a shower, work it into my wet hair, and boom, the hair does exactly what I want without being too shiny and crunchy.  </li>
            <li> A little odd all it takes to finish off am easy hair style.  </li>
            <li> It is not heavy and lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> Not dusty or slick looking.  </li>
            <li> Great hold for thick hair without turning my hair into a shell or a mess of silly putty</li>
            <li> so I was a little surprised)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a delicate balance though, of not putting too much at the roots, so my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy.</li>
            <li> It holds all day long without that gooey look that some products can have.</li>
            <li> It lasts long and is not crunchy at all.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Even easier if your hair is a tiny bit damp or your hands are a bit wet.  </li>
            <li> If you have really thick and course hair or non-relaxed African American hair, you may need to mix this with the molding wax to get your hair to really lay down.</li>
            <li> It will be sticking around for a long time!</li>
            <li> issue:  Dry climate increases the hold 10x</li>
            <li> I used to blow dry and use three products on it.</li>
            <li> but was disappointed because the original description said high hold</li>
            <li> The typical celebrity asian hair you see where it&#x27;s either spiked or really long</li>
            <li> I will be using this stuff for a while, and this one little jar will last me a long part of that while too.  </li>
            <li> I believe this is a hydro-gel that actually *soaks up* water when applied, which takes slightly damp hair and dries it so it is manageable.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect to do crazy styles that require strong amounts of antigravity hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a lot of thick, straight black hair.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend has short hair and uses this stuff too - I have a hard time keeping enough around for myself.</li>
            <li> This one actually makes my hair color look dull and it also makes my head itch, but that could just be my personal reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> The only hair gel that actually styles my hair the way i want it styled without it having to be hard and greasy.  </li>
            <li> This product works great for forming spikes, wisps and getting those nasty cowlicks to cooperate!</li>
            <li> The creme never dries so your hair looks wet or greasy all day.</li>
            <li> The product I used when my hair was really short, made it too stiff and &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; as my hair grew.  </li>
            <li> Not strong enough to hold hair up at all</li>
            <li> A little bit, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> (I have about 4 inch long hair) and it leaves my hair feeling a little clumpy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> but I was looking to experiment with other products.</li>
            <li> and this allows me to add texture / pieces, slick it back, spike it, or add &amp;#34;dry volume&amp;#34; as I just decided to call</li>
            <li> Usually purchase the larger size, but could not keep it in my carry on luggage due to its size (and I never check bags)</li>
            <li> I usually like to mold my hair when slightly wet and then once dry run my fingers through my hair a couple times for a non molded look.</li>
            <li> My only negative comment would be the price....</li>
            <li> So while it&#x27;s not thick to go through, it can actually make you look crazy towards your co-workers.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and essentially looks like Bart Simpson and fuzzy without anything in it.</li>
            <li> Do you hate that greasy, oily look from most gels?</li>
            <li> Anyways, I was disappointed in this product because it was exactly like another American Crew product and because the hold is not very strong.</li>
            <li> I would compare it to something that cost&#x27;s half the price.</li>
            <li> I like this product to give a little control without looking like there&#x27;s glue in my hair.</li>
            <li> It does what it supposed to do...gives hair lift and holds it in place, but it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that does NOT make my hair look dirty or greasy later in the day.  </li>
            <li> Since my barber introduced me to the stuff a few years ago, it&#x27;s all I use.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on the hair and spikes the hair without it looking stiff.</li>
            <li> Its creamy so doesnt feel sticky or leave your hair stiff</li>
            <li> I usually use the &#x27;green&#x27; lid d:</li>
            <li> A small container lasts a few minutes</li>
            <li> I have a bad habit of constantly brushing my hair with my fingers throughout the day and it actually continues to keep its hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like most everything about this product but have been consistently disappointed by its ability to hold my hair in place over time, even just off of my forehead, and unfortunately that is the point.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to rub it in your hands so hard.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this product</li>
            <li> Not a good product, it doesn&#x27;t act as it says it does.</li>
            <li> Holds my hair perfectly, not too stiff.</li>
            <li> I am trying it out but not very impressed by it.</li>
            <li> Not great for reworking</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin hair that curls.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and this molding cream just makes me look unkempt.</li>
            <li> Not quite as bad as, say, Axe or some other Chrenobyl-derived concoction, but still noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product isn&#x27;t terrible and smells decent.</li>
            <li> I have found that, to save money on a typical day, I use a Wal-mart &amp;#34;9&amp;#34; gel as a base and then apply this gel as a finish.</li>
            <li> Ehh, I&#x27;m not impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> If I&#x27;m doing something wrong, please let me know in a comment</li>
            <li> Whether or not parabens are carcinogenic is up for debate, of course - though I&#x27;m choosing to be wary and will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I have always shied away from hair products because they all ended up making my hair look greasy or dirty sooner after applying.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll become the guy with crazy hair.</li>
            <li> It has a coconut smell which isn&#x27;t so bad.  </li>
            <li> The creme runs off on to your forehead through the day which is annoying.</li>
            <li> but with a terrible perfume reserved for fragrance offenders.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Best hair product I have ever used, it is very matte and holds your hair in place- we have gone through tubs and tubs of this stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my personal go-to hair product. I have used this particular product for 10 years - starting back when it was in a white jar with a light blue lid. It&#x27;s not always easy to find in stores, even though it is an American Crew product - although it seems I am seeing it more and more lately. Well worth the money. It goes far, smells great (kind of a tropical, coconut/fruit like smell), and it styles even the shortest of hair without being overly hard like gel. I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t feel or look greasy to me, like wax or other products, and it molds and shapes at the same time. I only use this product now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using d:fi d:struct for years. IT&#x27;s the only product I use in my short hair... the smell is light and fresh, not heavy and perfume like many other men&#x27;s hair products. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair sticky... my hair is always soft, not stiff. If this product is ever discontinued I&#x27;m going to have to buy several cases!</li>
            <li> Good product but was disappointed because the original description said high hold and I received medium hold. The picture did say medium but the write up said high. I use the product but don&#x27;t know if I would repurchase m</li>
            <li> Works well.  Smells great.  Not too shiny if you use the right amount.  My girlfriend has short hair and uses this stuff too - I have a hard time keeping enough around for myself.</li>
            <li> Holy crap, this stuff is great! A little bit, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This is a great gel that I&#x27;ve been using for years.  It holds all day long without that gooey look that some products can have.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product. This smells like coconut, and creates a nice, firm hold for your hair.</li>
            <li> I have tried most products and this one is a good one. It provides great hold, washes out easily, is easy to work with and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Works great for my thin and shortish (2-3&amp;#34; hair). Gives enough control for the day and smells great (kind of like candy). It&#x27;s not a paste so you don&#x27;t have to rub it in your hands so hard. Easy to apply. However, it can be a bit greasy. Not great for reworking</li>
            <li> Great product at a price that beats salon pricing big time!</li>
            <li> Not strong enough to hold hair up at all</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding this product so when I found it on line and cheaper than at the Salon I was happy</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for 3 years and it is substantially better than any previous product i have used.  Its a sticky creme, that requires very little to be effective.  It lasts long and is not crunchy at all.  Hair still moves, but has added structure.  If you are looking for the strength of a gel, but the texture of a creme and no crunchiness, this is your product.  Not dusty or slick looking.  Just natural.  Well worth the premium $.</li>
            <li> I buy two at a time when I get these so I never run out. Fantastic product. I have thick hair and essentially looks like Bart Simpson and fuzzy without anything in it. This keeps things in place and looks great. I apply wet and it looks great when dries. Not nasty like you expect for say hair gel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been leery of hair products my entire life, because my hair is pretty fine and most hair product tends to be very heavy, greasy, and weighs down hair more than supporting it.  I read the glowing reviews of this product here on Amazon, decided to give it a shot since I was looking for a new hair look, and it&#x27;s been great.  I dab a tiny amount on my fingertips after I take a shower, work it into my wet hair, and boom, the hair does exactly what I want without being too shiny and crunchy.  This has been a gamechanger for me.  I will be using this stuff for a while, and this one little jar will last me a long part of that while too.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I have been using American Crew Fiber for a long time and have been pleased with the results but I was looking to experiment with other products. I tried American Crew Forming Cream and while it is very easy to apply, it does not hold my hair up off my forehead (I have about 4 inch long hair) and it leaves my hair feeling a little clumpy. Then I tried D:fi D:struct and it basically looks, feels, and behaves exactly like American Crew Forming Cream. I don&#x27;t understand why American Crew would make two products that seem identical. Anyways, I was disappointed in this product because it was exactly like another American Crew product and because the hold is not very strong.</li>
            <li> I have always shied away from hair products because they all ended up making my hair look greasy or dirty sooner after applying.  My beautician used this product (I normally won&#x27;t let her put in anything) and it looked good all day so I decided to try.  This is the only product that does NOT make my hair look dirty or greasy later in the day.  And if I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair the following day it still looks good - no build up.  I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time.  works great for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been growing out a pixie-cut.  My (fine blonde) hair&#x27;s now to my chin. The product I used when my hair was really short, made it too stiff and &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; as my hair grew.  I like this product to give a little control without looking like there&#x27;s glue in my hair. There&#x27;s a delicate balance though, of not putting too much at the roots, so my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy. A little goes a long way.  It smells like coconut and pineapple which I don&#x27;t love, but don&#x27;t mind either.</li>
            <li> STICKY and Gooey on hands - and great on hair!</li>
            <li> I actually intended on buying the light wax by D;fi, but bought this on accident. It&#x27;s got great hold, a good smell and is easy to apply. Unfortunately, it is nowhere near the light wax in any area, and while good, will not be purchased again. If you&#x27;re looking for a comparable product with better hold, shine and ESPECIALLY smell, take a look at the Light Wax in place of this.</li>
            <li> Has good hold and not greasy. I usually like to mold my hair when slightly wet and then once dry run my fingers through my hair a couple times for a non molded look. This product does the job very well</li>
            <li> Do you hate that greasy, oily look from most gels? Me too. This cream will hold your hair where you want it while keeping the natural sheen of freshly washed and dried hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a particular product from American Crew D. I thought I found the exact product based on the picture shown&lt;br /&gt;on the site. Came in promptly but not the exact product. I am trying it out but not very impressed by it.</li>
            <li> Never received it and supplier didn&#x27;t care, buy they kept my money!!  Bought this stuff locally, been using this product for 15 years. AC suddenly changed the consistency of the cream to a much looser thickness (like make-up remover) while making the new lid totally dumb with a &amp;#34;scratch and sniff love scene&amp;#34;.  Product now doesn&#x27;t hold like it used to.  Why change a perfect thing?</li>
            <li> A little odd all it takes to finish off am easy hair style.  Great scent. My go to favorite.</li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite gel that I have ever bought. It is less sticky then the Spiker, and very easy to mold and manipulate. With different amounts of heat and water in your hair you can pretty much style anyway you want with this product. It is very easy to use, very affordable, and has a long shelf life. High recommendations here</li>
            <li> I have fairly thin hair that curls. I use this product to style and hold and it works very well, even adding volume.</li>
            <li> The product holds my hair they way I want it without leaving crunchy. It&#x27;s pliable in the sense that your hair can still be be restyled and can still move around. Just don&#x27;t expect to do crazy styles that require strong amounts of antigravity hold. This is definitely a product for someone looking for pomade type hold, non greasy or non crunchy &#x27;something about Mary&#x27; hold.</li>
            <li> I lost my money and did not get the product,</li>
            <li> I first tried this at my sisters and loved it. It is not heavy feeling in the hair and does not make it feel greasy.</li>
            <li> works as described. best mens hair gel hands down.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Great hold for thick hair without turning my hair into a shell or a mess of silly putty</li>
            <li> Love this Product!  Easy ordering, Shipping and delivery.  I have both curly and wavy hair and this product helps me control my hair than just using gel.</li>
            <li> My hair: Straight and thick&lt;br /&gt;This product: In moderation it leaves my hair natural without shine and a good hold that looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;Only issue:  Dry climate increases the hold 10x .. use sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;Smell:  Light and tropical-ish. It doesn&#x27;t fill a room.  American crew makes the same thing in their brand label .. but with a terrible perfume reserved for fragrance offenders.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for family member who absolutely loves it....Have tried to purchase in stores but have had difficulty in locating it.  My only negative comment would be the price....</li>
            <li> This product works really well for spiking hair and hold.  The next time I buy it I&#x27;ll order the high shine version.  This one actually makes my hair color look dull and it also makes my head itch, but that could just be my personal reaction to it.  Overall, it&#x27;s decent.</li>
            <li> It does what it supposed to do...gives hair lift and holds it in place, but it&#x27;s a little &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34; feeling.</li>
            <li> Smells like chemicals and it&#x27;s filled with chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am caucasian with kinky, frizzy hair. This is a fantastic solution for men. Only use a little and you can style perfectly without it looking greasy or stiff. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This one is really bang for the buck. It makes your hair stay fresh throughout the whole day and it even smells good. I really enjoy using this and since the material is pretty strong, I have been using one bottle for a while now. Definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I usually use the &#x27;green&#x27; lid d:fi but have let my hair grow out. I have been using d:fi for years and love it. The d:struct is absolutely amazing for my new style and smells better than the green. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Good wax, not shiny or sticky, looks natural.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for awhile. It doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feeling on the hair and spikes the hair without it looking stiff.</li>
            <li> Ehh, I&#x27;m not impressed with this product. The product isn&#x27;t terrible and smells decent. I have short hair and I bought this product to mainly give texture and movement to my hair. It does an ok job, but nothing to rave home about. The container looked all beat up like it has been used when it arrived. For the price I paid, I would have expected a bit more...</li>
            <li> I use this every day to spike up my hair a bit and give it some character. It works wonderfully without adding any kind greasiness or shininess to your hair; it just looks natural. I&#x27;ve been asked how I get my hair to do what it does every day and all I need is this stuff, a dab of water, and about 10 seconds and it&#x27;s set for the day. I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Besides the fact the product lets you do whatever you want to your hair, it smells fantastic. It has a pina colada scent and doesn&#x27;t smell like a normal hair product. Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> This pomade works great on my hair - I have a decent thickness and good body - I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone with fine hair as it will pull you hair down. I used it wet on clean hair and blow dry - then often will use it (sparingly) to hold the shape. It holds so well that sometimes when I get up the next day, my hair still looks great! (no lie!) It helps add texture and gives shape. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the price was low.  I am very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> Since my barber introduced me to the stuff a few years ago, it&#x27;s all I use.  Bit of a learning curve compared to gels or waxes.  If you don&#x27;t get it right the first time, it&#x27;s hard to start over.  But once you get used to it, you&#x27;ll find that it&#x27;s quite versatile.  I have very straight hair and this allows me to add texture / pieces, slick it back, spike it, or add &amp;#34;dry volume&amp;#34; as I just decided to call it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use too much, best way to remove it is to towel your hair as if drying it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a great hair gel from the ratings, but it is unfortunately not a good hair gel. I would compare it to something that cost&#x27;s half the price. The creme never dries so your hair looks wet or greasy all day. The creme runs off on to your forehead through the day which is annoying. It doesn&#x27;t smell very pleasing either. I wanted a hair gel that looked as though i didn&#x27;t use hair gel and this did not do that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple years now; I wear my hair short and textured throughout the crown area. This product works great for forming spikes, wisps and getting those nasty cowlicks to cooperate!</li>
            <li> Only other kind that I&#x27;ve found to work better is Bumble Bumble, however this is a better price so I come back to it.</li>
            <li> Most of my old products either didn&#x27;t hold well or caused flakes whenever my hair was touched.  My barber introduced me to this stuff and I will no longer use anything else.  Perfect hold,  no flakes, and easy to wash out (unlike waxes).  I&#x27;m hooked!  A small container lasts a few minutes the because you only need a tiny bit for a full head of shorter hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium-length hair that doesn&#x27;t cooperate. I love this. This molding cream is best applied for me when hair is very slightly damp. A tiny dab does wonders. I believe this is a hydro-gel that actually *soaks up* water when applied, which takes slightly damp hair and dries it so it is manageable. I have found that, to save money on a typical day, I use a Wal-mart &amp;#34;9&amp;#34; gel as a base and then apply this gel as a finish.</li>
            <li> I bought this by pure luck at some closeout of a beauty salon but always go out of my way to buy this and happy I found it on Amazon.  Its creamy so doesnt feel sticky or leave your hair stiff</li>
            <li> This product is really nice but works better on finer or chemically relaxed hair textures.  Itâ€™s light, creamy, and non-greasy.  If you have really thick and course hair or non-relaxed African American hair, you may need to mix this with the molding wax to get your hair to really lay down.</li>
            <li> Works better than the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> This is a better smelling version of American Crew&#x27;s Forming Cream.</li>
            <li> I just got this stuff today and I tried it for the first time.  I had Semi damp hair because i felt the texture and I knew that it would mix better than my hair being dry.  It worked amazing!!  It has a coconut smell which isn&#x27;t so bad.  It&#x27;s a light smell and you don&#x27;t smell it once its in your hair.  I did not use very much about enough to give the inside tip of my finger.  Rub it into your palms and fingers and just smear it in your hair then style it.  It forms well with my hair and it did what I wanted once it was fully mix with my hair.  I did not have to keep trying to push my hair back into position.  I tried Vilain Golddiger/Silver Fox, Style Sexy hair 7 hold/7 shine prior to this and this one is amazing! I said welcome to my cupboard d:fi! I love you! It will be sticking around for a long time!</li>
            <li> Great product reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Well satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Works just as well as the more expensive American Crew Pomade. Hair stays soft but still styled.</li>
            <li> It holds ok and leaves flakes. Not quite as bad as, say, Axe or some other Chrenobyl-derived concoction, but still noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m going back to TAC texture taffy. Holds better, smells like Christmas, and washes out easy.</li>
            <li> Usually purchase the larger size, but could not keep it in my carry on luggage due to its size (and I never check bags)...the smaller one does the trick though</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight hair that will go flat unless I do a lot to it. I used to blow dry and use three products on it. This stuff is all I need. It makes my hair thicker and I am able to shape it without it being stiff or sticky. Water soluble, nice aroma. Best stuff ever.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years, good product, not too greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Use it all the time.  Price on Amazon best I can find.</li>
            <li> The Best! Holds my hair perfectly, not too stiff. Avoid the cheap stuff...</li>
            <li> Extremely easy to use. Even easier if your hair is a tiny bit damp or your hands are a bit wet.  Holds hair nicely. Not all day though.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this particular item seemed more liquid than previously used product.</li>
            <li> I like most everything about this product but have been consistently disappointed by its ability to hold my hair in place over time, even just off of my forehead, and unfortunately that is the point. If I&#x27;m doing something wrong, please let me know in a comment</li>
            <li> Thought I was getting &amp;#34;Pliable&amp;#34; not &amp;#34;medium hold&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Pliable&amp;#34; was not availible when purchased. The original &amp;#34;Pliable&amp;#34; version was great for me, I don&#x27;t know if it is the same product still. Regardless, I don&#x27;t like this product.  My hair is thin and this molding cream just makes me look unkempt. I use Dove molding cream or Old Spice now, I like both of those.</li>
            <li> This is the best product ever for my short hair.  I ordered it and it was there in 2 days.  AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Joe&#x27;s wax for a while now and I love it but I figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to try something new. after tons of research on Amazon, I came across this gem. I&#x27;ve got a lot of thick, straight black hair. The typical celebrity asian hair you see where it&#x27;s either spiked or really long and the guys look like girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I gotta tell you, this is a great creme (I actually thought it was a wax when I first got it so I was a little surprised) but it worked just as well. I use about a nickel&#x27;s size for this while my wax only required a dime&#x27;s size. Still works really well, mainly on dry or very very lightly damp hair. It&#x27;s easy to mold your hair to whatever you want and it keeps its shape. I have a bad habit of constantly brushing my hair with my fingers throughout the day and it actually continues to keep its hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that if you do brush your hair with your fingers like I do, the creme will actually maintain the last position of your hair as you brushed it. So while it&#x27;s not thick to go through, it can actually make you look crazy towards your co-workers. You&#x27;ll become the guy with crazy hair. So watch out for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m really happy with it and I can easily recommend it to anyone. Next time, I&#x27;m going to get the bigger jar and save me some money.</li>
            <li> This is a decent hair product. I have baby fine hair with a couple of cowlicks that this product wasn&#x27;t able to tame.</li>
            <li> I suppose that some guys like the fruity smell, but don&#x27;t be fooled by all the reviews by guys here... this product is perfect for girls.  I use this in conjunction with the [[ASIN:B000H30FFU D:fi D:tails Pomade for Hold + Shine 2.65oz]].  I have fine, bone-straight Asian hair and a medium-short hair length (shorter than a bob, longer than a boy-cut).  This (and the pomade) are the ONLY products that work with my hair.  It is not heavy and lasts all day long.  You only need a small dab, and run it most along the tips of your hair.  All other products I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tried many), lasts for an hour.  This one is worth every penny.  I hope they never discontinue or change this product.</li>
            <li> Not a good product, it doesn&#x27;t act as it says it does. Acts more like a low hold gel with high shine.</li>
            <li> arrived on time and arrived as pictured.</li>
            <li> The ingredient list here on Amazon is incomplete or out of date; my container&#x27;s list of ingredients lists \\&quot;methylparaben, ethylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben, isobutylparaben\\&quot; at the end. Whether or not parabens are carcinogenic is up for debate, of course - though I&#x27;m choosing to be wary and will be returning this.</li>
            <li> I definitely am not a hair stylist expert but for my hair this works well and give a strong hold and it is easy to use too!</li>
            <li> The only hair gel that actually styles my hair the way i want it styled without it having to be hard and greasy.  This product really does the trick to  style your hair while keeping it soft and it smells pretty good too.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!  I&#x27;ve used it for several years with different hair incarnations.  Even on mornings when my hair and I are equally tired, after a little d:fi, my coif looks spectacular!</li>
