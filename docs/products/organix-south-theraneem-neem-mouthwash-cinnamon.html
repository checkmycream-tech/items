            <li>This one has a unique taste but works wonders!  </li>
            <li>A strong and pleasant cinnamon taste, that I much prefer to their herbal mint variety.</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s flouride and cruelty free.</li>
            <li>It will surely save us money because the treatment now will be shorter than originally planned.</li>
            <li>The mouthwash had easily leaked through 1)</li>
            <li>It has a sweet, cinnamony taste that I LOVE.</li>
            <li>I find the taste just fine.  </li>
            <li>Its is fine.</li>
            <li>This has a nice strong flavor that goes really well with the orange mango toothpaste from Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li>The dentist was surprised to see it yesterday (Dec. 26/13) and found her gums looking alive, healthy and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It is mild but you feel good that it does not have harmful chemicals like the more commercial mouthwashes.  </li>
            <li>They want $2200 to clean my teeth and apply antibiotics.  </li>
            <li>My husband remembers neem leaves being used as cure-alls back in his native country, so he was happy when I bought him this for the first time.</li>
            <li>More time is needed to before I&#x27;ll really know.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff but the price has gone up so much</li>
            <li>Taste is not bad.</li>
            <li>really fresh  and clean.</li>
            <li>This Neem Mouthwash leaves me fresh &amp; clean, I use the toothpaste also.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Quick delivery.</li>
            <li>First of all, my last order never arrived (despite amazon and shipper claiming it was successfully delivered).  </li>
            <li>its main styrofoam-type cap seal, 2) its screw top, 3)</li>
            <li>shipped quickly</li>
            <li>This is the first mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t hurt me!</li>
            <li>it tastes great, but it does take a little getting used to.</li>
            <li>In an attempt to use more natural products, I decided to try out this mouthwash.</li>
            <li>I am VERY HAPPY to see that he is no longer using the unhealthy chemical-laden mouthwash we used to purchase from WalMart.</li>
            <li>Keeps my mouth really fresh and leaves my teeth shinier.</li>
            <li>Serves me right for not reading ingredients before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is that, unlike most mouthwashes which require you to swish for 30 seconds, this one requires swishing for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>The first ingredient is Calcium Carbonate.  </li>
            <li>That weird orange stuff from Listerine tastes horrid and might be best used as tile cleaner.  </li>
            <li>the plastic seal around the screw top, and 4) the poorly-sealed plastic bag that the packager had ATTEMPTED to include for extra leak</li>
            <li>On first try I knew this was a sugary mouthwash - not neem.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;To be fair, not sure if responsibility falls onto seller or Amazon, or maybe even the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>It definitely leaves my breath fresh and my teeth feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>finish the whole bottle but will not buy again.</li>
            <li>Delivery was also very prompt.</li>
            <li>First, love this product itself (actually slightly prefer the mint flavor)&lt;br</li>
            <li>although neem sounds healthy but taste not really because so many other ingredients.....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a HUGE Amazon fan, but have been having strange issues with this particular item.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle I bought him was mint flavored, but the second was this flavor (cinnamon), which he prefers.  </li>
            <li>Sorbital (sugar alcohol) is the first ingredient - neem, the VERY LAST.  </li>
            <li>She has been using it for a month now and all I can say is that it is almost completely healed.</li>
            <li>I am very pleasantly surprised by this mouthwash -</li>
            <li>I think that the freshness lasts much longer than traditional mouthwash.</li>
            <li>Its organic so all natural.</li>
            <li>In addition to mouth sores, I can also feel how my previously sensitive gums are now stronger and do not bleed or hurt any longer.</li>
            <li>I actually believe the main problem lays with the manufacturers weak-arse seal that is not well adhered to the rim of the container.  </li>

            <li> I have sensitive teeth and have had some trouble finding products that didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth since I switched over to organic/paraben/chemical/alcohol-free products.</li>
            <li> Had really bad mouth sores for a week and this miuthwash helped me fight them and keep my mouth healthy ever since.</li>
            <li> Cinnamon overrides the bitter taste that neem has.</li>
            <li> However, it has a syrupy consistency and the flavor is not as sharp as I expected.</li>
            <li> unfortunately this included sensitive electronic items such as USB cables, a $30 14000mAh power pack, etc.  </li>
            <li> WOW, I bought this product for the second time and getting ready to buy again; I have bought the product for my wife as she was having a very bad case of gum disease.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got an autism spectrum disorder, and have a certain thing about textures, and other mouthwashes often prickle my mouth and are very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE DANGERS OF NEEM-COULD HAVE KILLED ME</li>
            <li> The mouthwash is like  a syrup and not as thin as regular mouthwash.  </li>
            <li> SO AT LEAST THE CUSTOMER ONLY HAS TO CLEAN UP ONE MESSY PRODUCT, WRAPPING AND BOX!!!!!!!  </li>
            <li> My tongue gets a bit tired swishing that long!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I need to continue paying for mouthwash.</li>
            <li> This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and hard to get out of the tube.  </li>
            <li> For reference, it appears that approximately 25%  of product had leaked out.  </li>
            <li> Sort of a weird mouth feel.</li>
            <li> But the bottle leaks so forget about traveling  with it ugh:((</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this mouthwash........</li>
            <li> DID NOT KNOW ABOUT THE DANGERS OF NEEM-COULD HAVE KILLED ME</li>
            <li> Quick delivery. Product seems to work well. More time is needed to before I&#x27;ll really know.</li>
            <li> It works but you have to use regularily. Taste is not bad. Cinnamon overrides the bitter taste that neem has.</li>
            <li> Use this product daily. It&#x27;s healing properties are wonderful. I use it with Neem toothpaste.</li>
            <li> WOW, I bought this product for the second time and getting ready to buy again; I have bought the product for my wife as she was having a very bad case of gum disease. She has been using it for a month now and all I can say is that it is almost completely healed. The dentist was surprised to see it yesterday (Dec. 26/13) and found her gums looking alive, healthy and beautiful. Seen her improvement I can now recommend this product without any reservation. It will surely save us money because the treatment now will be shorter than originally planned.</li>
            <li> Sort of a weird mouth feel. And just not used to cinnamon after a lifetime off minty rinses.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for Cinnamon Neem in all the local health food stores with no luck.  Found it through Amazon and was thrilled.  All organic, refreshing taste with cinnamon as a proven teeth and gum health aid included.  The delivery was prompt and I will order again.</li>
            <li> Even though it says cinnamon, I detect a bit of anise(which I like).  It just leaves a good feeling in my mouth...really fresh  and clean.</li>
            <li> Theraneem mouthwash is really great for oral health. This one has a unique taste but works wonders!  I will buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chronic gingivitis, and my dentist is always on me for not using a mouthwash in addition to toothpaste. I&#x27;ve got an autism spectrum disorder, and have a certain thing about textures, and other mouthwashes often prickle my mouth and are very uncomfortable. Not this one. It&#x27;s as tasty and pleasant as an herbal tea! Plus, I&#x27;ve been checking my gums&#x27; performance on the gingival and gingival bleeding indices, and I&#x27;ve seen measurable reduction of the severity of my gingivitis within seven days. The only downside is that, unlike most mouthwashes which require you to swish for 30 seconds, this one requires swishing for 1 to 2 minutes. My tongue gets a bit tired swishing that long!</li>
            <li> I doubt I will ever go back to using a fluoride mouthwash or toothpaste again. Also seem to be some evidence of fluoride weakening bones.</li>
            <li> The product is very thick and hard to get out of the tube.  The first ingredient is Calcium Carbonate.  I don&#x27;t know why it is named Neem toothpaste - it should be called &amp;#34;Abrasive calcium carbonate toothpaste&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> My husband just isn&#x27;t a fan of mint, so if I get mint mouthwash it&#x27;s not going to get used.  That weird orange stuff from Listerine tastes horrid and might be best used as tile cleaner.  Enter cinnamon.  This has a nice strong flavor that goes really well with the orange mango toothpaste from Tom&#x27;s of Maine.</li>
            <li> Love this mouthwash.  It is mild but you feel good that it does not have harmful chemicals like the more commercial mouthwashes.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> This Neem Mouthwash leaves me fresh &amp; clean, I use the toothpaste also.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the smaller bottles for travleing...</li>
            <li> In an attempt to use more natural products, I decided to try out this mouthwash. I am very pleasantly surprised by this mouthwash - it tastes great, but it does take a little getting used to. It definitely leaves my breath fresh and my teeth feeling really clean. I think that the freshness lasts much longer than traditional mouthwash. I purchased this on subscribe and save, and will definitely keep my subscription!</li>
            <li> First, love this product itself (actually slightly prefer the mint flavor)&lt;br /&gt;BUT.....here&#x27;s the rub:  this has happened thrice in past year or so with this exact product---&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, not sure if responsibility falls onto seller or Amazon, or maybe even the manufacturer.  I&#x27;m a HUGE Amazon fan, but have been having strange issues with this particular item.  First of all, my last order never arrived (despite amazon and shipper claiming it was successfully delivered).  NOW, today my re-order of the cinnamon Neem mouthwash arrives leaking all over itself, and everything else in the compactly-package box-- unfortunately this included sensitive electronic items such as USB cables, a $30 14000mAh power pack, etc.  The mouthwash had easily leaked through 1) its main styrofoam-type cap seal, 2) its screw top, 3) the plastic seal around the screw top, and 4) the poorly-sealed plastic bag that the packager had ATTEMPTED to include for extra leak protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SHIP THIS PRODUCT IN ITS OWN SEPARATE CONTAINER, SO AT LEAST THE CUSTOMER ONLY HAS TO CLEAN UP ONE MESSY PRODUCT, WRAPPING AND BOX!!!!!!!  For reference, it appears that approximately 25%  of product had leaked out.  What a bunch of nonsense.  That being said-- I actually believe the main problem lays with the manufacturers weak-arse seal that is not well adhered to the rim of the container.  I suspect this blows off with altitude changes.  Just use some aluminum or plastic.  This is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job. However, it has a syrupy consistency and the flavor is not as sharp as I expected.</li>
            <li> Love the product. But the bottle leaks so forget about traveling  with it ugh:((</li>
            <li> My husband remembers neem leaves being used as cure-alls back in his native country, so he was happy when I bought him this for the first time. The first bottle I bought him was mint flavored, but the second was this flavor (cinnamon), which he prefers.  He likes it a lot and has already used several bottles. I am VERY HAPPY to see that he is no longer using the unhealthy chemical-laden mouthwash we used to purchase from WalMart.</li>
            <li> Serves me right for not reading ingredients before purchasing.  On first try I knew this was a sugary mouthwash - not neem.  Sorbital (sugar alcohol) is the first ingredient - neem, the VERY LAST.  Be warned.&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Deionized Aqua/Water/Eau, Sorbitol, Glycerin (Vegetarian), Aloe Barbadensis Gel*, Poloxamer 407, Ascorbic Acid, Xylitol, Potassium Sorbate, Supercritical Extracts of: Cinnamomum Zeylanicum (Cinnamon) Bark*, Cardamomum (Cardamom) Seed*, Illicium Verum (Star Anise) Fruit*, Eugenia Caryophyllus (Clove) Bud*, Vitis Vinifera (Grape) Seed*, Azadirachta Indica (Neem) Leaf*, Azadirachta Indica (Neem) Bark*.</li>
            <li> If you like cinnamon you will love this!  My grandson now brushes cause then I let him rinse with this mouthwash!!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but the price has gone up so much I can&#x27;t afford it anymore.</li>
            <li> finish the whole bottle but will not buy again. stick with my fav - organic mouthwash. although neem sounds healthy but taste not really because so many other ingredients.....</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth and have had some trouble finding products that didn&#x27;t hurt my teeth since I switched over to organic/paraben/chemical/alcohol-free products. This is the first mouthwash that doesn&#x27;t hurt me! It has a sweet, cinnamony taste that I LOVE. I use the toothpaste, too. My teeth and gums are feeling very strong and don&#x27;t hurt at all. Delivery was also very prompt. This product will stay a part of my oral health routine! I will order again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because my last visit to the Dentist they said I have Periodontal Disease.  They want $2200 to clean my teeth and apply antibiotics.  After I floss I rinse with the Theraneem.  My condition is caused by the dryness in my mouth from the pain medication that I am taking and the Theraneem seems to reduce the dryness when I sleep.  I guess I&#x27;ll find out when I go back to the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shipped quickly and I received it within 3 days.  The mouthwash is like  a syrup and not as thin as regular mouthwash.  I find the taste just fine.  I also use the cinnamon toothpaste which I like.</li>
            <li> I am happy with  the product. Its organic so all natural. Tastes good too. More like cinnamon and clove. Keeps my mouth really fresh and leaves my teeth shinier.</li>
            <li> Love this, my teeth feel much better since using this product.  The toothpaste is also good, I will order this product again. Taste great, no burning, just gooood!</li>
            <li> I love this mouthwash. It is so soothing and it tastes great. It has helped a great deal with gum inflammation. I also love that it&#x27;s flouride and cruelty free.</li>
            <li> A strong and pleasant cinnamon taste, that I much prefer to their herbal mint variety. It&#x27;s neem, and does the job very nicely.</li>
            <li> This was a great discovery for me. Had really bad mouth sores for a week and this miuthwash helped me fight them and keep my mouth healthy ever since. In addition to mouth sores, I can also feel how my previously sensitive gums are now stronger and do not bleed or hurt any longer. Added benefit - Amazon has it $2 cheaper than the nearby organic store.</li>
            <li> Its is fine. I&#x27;m not sure I need to continue paying for mouthwash.</li>
            <li> Excellent for your gums.</li>
            <li> very pleasant tasting and received good reviews for gum health.</li>
