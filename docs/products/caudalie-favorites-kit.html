    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I am also very impressed with the nail and hand cream.</li>
            <li>Perfect size and will be used for traveling after the baby is here!</li>
            <li>Absolutely wonderful in every way!</li>
            <li>Very good gift for the ladies.</li>
            <li>This is an AMAZING deal, I received mine in perfect condition</li>
            <li>A great starter set, well-priced.</li>
            <li>The cleansing water is another that is just great to use while traveling.</li>
            <li>And it smells AMAZING!</li>
            <li>Smells gorgeous and great value.</li>
            <li>I really love Caudalie products and this is the perfect way to try them!</li>
            <li>Samples were good except chapstick that was like plastic and would not spread on my lips.  </li>
            <li>- it makes my skin so smooth and provides a great canvas for the powder!  </li>
            <li>so if you like waxy chapstick, this is good for you</li>
            <li>Absolutely LOVE everything in this set!</li>
            <li>and I must admit I&#x27;m in love!.</li>
            <li>I even tried to warm the product up, but it was no use.</li>
            <li>The hand cream is amazing but my favorite thing is the beauty elixir.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it to try the cleansing water and fell in love with everything else too!</li>
            <li>Love love love the products, will be buying another set to keep in my office.</li>
            <li>I love these products.</li>
            <li>So, I did a search for the best French pharmacy products (which is how I discovered huile prodigieuse, a miracle product) and found many Caudalie products on this list.</li>
            <li>love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the Chapstick as well.</li>
            <li>Love all their products, this is my in my hospital bag for when I go into labor.  </li>
            <li>I love to use the Vinosource Moisturizing Sorbet under my jane iredale mineral powder</li>
            <li>I love the travel size accessories because that is the majority of the time that i use these products.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!  </li>
            <li>but my eye makeup comes off easily and does not irritate my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve already ordered more, in full size.</li>
            <li>This worked great for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The moisturizing facial sorbet is nice too, not greasy and very light on the skin.</li>
            <li>The items are great for sensitive skin and have a very nice, refreshing scent to them - nothing too overpowering and does not last very long either.  </li>
            <li>It is very soothing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going through it too quickly.</li>
            <li>other products in the set are also great, but I haven&#x27;t used them as much as the cleanser, elixir, and sorbet (used in that</li>
            <li>It was okay but not any better than some in the drug store for less money.</li>
            <li>The Make Up Remover Cleansing Water is also very gentle on the eyes.  </li>
            <li>m waiting for another gift at the same price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>It also leaves your face feeling so clean and moisturized, not dried out or filmy.</li>
            <li>just wish that there a large quantity of these products in the set.</li>
            <li>The lip balm is nice texture, but a little waxy...</li>
            <li>Love the fragrance, arriver faster than expected</li>
            <li>This set comes with Gentle Cleansing Milk, not the Cleansing Water as advertised and which I wanted.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t reasonably priced I&#x27;d want to return.</li>
            <li>I like the elixir on long-haul flights and while traveling because it really wakes up your skin and your senses.</li>
            <li>Mainly bought it for the caudalie beauty elixir.</li>
            <li>In addition, I also just started using a high dose formula of retinol.</li>
            <li>DON&#x27;T PURCHASE- old products!</li>
            <li>The essential oils of rosemary and peppermint snap everything back together and just make you feel so fresh and ready for the day.</li>
            <li>, now that I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and still unable to wear makeup, it has become important to me that my skin look as good as possible.</li>
            <li>Experience has told me that the products on the American market do not work for me (as evidenced by my medicine cabinet full of various tried and discarded  high-end products).</li>
            <li>smells like old people.</li>
            <li>After over a week of use, my skin is soft and clear.</li>
            <li>There have been no breakouts (as I have found to generally occur every time that I use a new product).</li>
            <li>There is a little tingling around my eyes when I do this, which is actually a little pleasant, but no actual burning or irritation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I do also like the hand cream, but I&#x27;m not picky for hand creams as long as they don&#x27;t have heavy fragrances, and it&#x27;s (again) a great travel size to pop in your carry on or even in your purse for everyday use.</li>
            <li>My skin is quite sensitive to sunlight, I also use it to calm my skin down.</li>
            <li>I eventually gave up on a skin care routine (and makeup) and just used a high quality bar of soap (such as Aveda) to cleanse and</li>
            <li>I just got this and the moisturizer barely had anything in it and the spray bottle didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I love Caudalie products, however, I use them very sparingly and never can quite finish the full-size products within a year (they are quite expensive to buy individually).</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive combination skin, with extreme sensitivity in my eye area.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE everything in this set! I originally purchased it to try the cleansing water and fell in love with everything else too! The hand cream is amazing but my favorite thing is the beauty elixir. I have combination/oily skin and was hesitant to try it in fear of it causing a breakout but to my relief it did everything but! And it smells AMAZING! Definitely buy this!</li>
            <li> Very good gift for the ladies.</li>
            <li> It was okay but not any better than some in the drug store for less money.</li>
            <li> This is an AMAZING deal, I received mine in perfect condition and I must admit I&#x27;m in love!. Love love love the products, will be buying another set to keep in my office.</li>
            <li> A great starter set, well-priced.</li>
            <li> smells like old people.</li>
            <li> I love these products. I am someone who has struggled for years with skin care. Products either were too harsh or left my face feeling greasy. I have very sensitive combination skin, with extreme sensitivity in my eye area. I eventually gave up on a skin care routine (and makeup) and just used a high quality bar of soap (such as Aveda) to cleanse and Huile Prodigieuse as a moisturizer. This worked great for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, now that I&#x27;m in my mid 30s and still unable to wear makeup, it has become important to me that my skin look as good as possible. Experience has told me that the products on the American market do not work for me (as evidenced by my medicine cabinet full of various tried and discarded  high-end products). So, I did a search for the best French pharmacy products (which is how I discovered huile prodigieuse, a miracle product) and found many Caudalie products on this list. This package included several of them without a big investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are all wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with the elixir. The first time that I used it, I naively sprayed it on my face with abandon. My entire eye area went up in flames. I have since learned to spray on my face and keep my eyes closed for about 5 seconds afterwards. There is a little tingling around my eyes when I do this, which is actually a little pleasant, but no actual burning or irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the makeup removing cleanser to wash my face, the elixir, and the moisturizing sorbet on my face daily (sometimes multiple times). After over a week of use, my skin is soft and clear. There have been no breakouts (as I have found to generally occur every time that I use a new product). In addition, I also just started using a high dose formula of retinol. I put the sorbet over it and haven&#x27;t had any of the typical side effects of getting your face used to retinol. Just soft, clear, firm skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the sorbet goes over my sunscreen beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other products in the set are also great, but I haven&#x27;t used them as much as the cleanser, elixir, and sorbet (used in that order).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just wish that there a large quantity of these products in the set. I&#x27;m going through it too quickly. I&#x27;ve already ordered more, in full size.</li>
            <li> Samples were good except chapstick that was like plastic and would not spread on my lips.  Don&#x27;t know if it was a product problem or the product was old and dried out.</li>
            <li> 5*&lt;br /&gt;I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27; m waiting for another gift at the same price!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T PURCHASE- old products! The set is from 2014, and the items had an off smell. The lip conditioner was the texture of a glue stick! I even tried to warm the product up, but it was no use. Completly dried out! Such a dissapointment.</li>
            <li> Smells gorgeous and great value.</li>
            <li> Mainly bought it for the caudalie beauty elixir. That is MUST-HAVE for a long flight. My skin is quite sensitive to sunlight, I also use it to calm my skin down. It is very soothing and refreshing. You won&#x27;t go back to any other spray, I promise, after using this one. I am also very impressed with the nail and hand cream. It actually works for my nail. Love the Chapstick as well. Not very impressed with the make-up remover, it&#x27;s too gentle, barely did anything for eye make up.</li>
            <li> I really love Caudalie products and this is the perfect way to try them!</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance, arriver faster than expected</li>
            <li> Love all their products, this is my in my hospital bag for when I go into labor.  Perfect size and will be used for traveling after the baby is here!</li>
            <li> I use Caudalie and decided to purchase this because I wanted four out of the five products. Instead I end up with only three out of the five. This set comes with Gentle Cleansing Milk, not the Cleansing Water as advertised and which I wanted. Otherwise not sure I would have bought this . If it weren&#x27;t reasonably priced I&#x27;d want to return.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try Caudalie products for some time now and found this set and finally tried it out.  I was not disappointed!  The items are great for sensitive skin and have a very nice, refreshing scent to them - nothing too overpowering and does not last very long either.  I love to use the Vinosource Moisturizing Sorbet under my jane iredale mineral powder - it makes my skin so smooth and provides a great canvas for the powder!  The Make Up Remover Cleansing Water is also very gentle on the eyes.  It might take a few swipes but my eye makeup comes off easily and does not irritate my eyes.  I would definitely recommend this set for travel or to try Caudalie products!</li>
            <li> I just got this and the moisturizer barely had anything in it and the spray bottle didn&#x27;t work. Would return if I could.</li>
            <li> Caudalie always gets 5 stars. It&#x27;s a 5 star brand. Absolutely wonderful in every way!</li>
            <li> I love Caudalie products, however, I use them very sparingly and never can quite finish the full-size products within a year (they are quite expensive to buy individually). I love the travel size accessories because that is the majority of the time that i use these products. My favorites are the elixir and the cleansing water. I like the elixir on long-haul flights and while traveling because it really wakes up your skin and your senses. The essential oils of rosemary and peppermint snap everything back together and just make you feel so fresh and ready for the day. The cleansing water is another that is just great to use while traveling. You can remove makeup or freshen up on long plane rides, and it smells so divine. It also leaves your face feeling so clean and moisturized, not dried out or filmy. I do also like the hand cream, but I&#x27;m not picky for hand creams as long as they don&#x27;t have heavy fragrances, and it&#x27;s (again) a great travel size to pop in your carry on or even in your purse for everyday use. The lip balm is nice texture, but a little waxy... so if you like waxy chapstick, this is good for you (I gave mine to my Gran). The moisturizing facial sorbet is nice too, not greasy and very light on the skin.</li>
