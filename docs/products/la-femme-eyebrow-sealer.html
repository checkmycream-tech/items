            <li>good before I apply it.  </li>
            <li>This product is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kind of a glue.</li>
            <li>I like it better than Model In A Bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more than pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I do make sure I wipe the&lt;br /&gt;brush</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll always order it whenever it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li>It works better and is so easy to apply.  </li>
            <li>This stuff seals them but also is easy to wash off.  </li>
            <li>Amazon and this product is superior, it does not flake or leave a white residue on the eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>On hot days, during super high temperatures and during workouts...it holds up!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Fast quality shipping.  </li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>The brush never gets stiff and there&#x27;s more product in the bottle.  </li>
            <li>After 20 to 30 minutes of facial artistry, it is nice to see that they stay exactly how I sealed them from @ 5:30am to sometimes late at nite.</li>
            <li>Through gentle blotting and a stroke of facial powder once a day,they stay set.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t a very expensive brand, and it does a good job.  </li>

            <li> This isn&#x27;t a very expensive brand, and it does a good job.  </li>
            <li> It may not be quite as long lasting, but it doesn&#x27;t look shiny or flake like Model</li>
            <li> It also seems to have a very long shelf life</li>
            <li> She-Laq left a glossy shine on top of your brows when they were dried which was abit annoying, but it stayed on ALL DAY EVEN WHEN RUBBING THEM.</li>
            <li> I find tha the La Femme product doesn&#x27;t stay on as well if you only use 1 coat, so I usually have to use two coats.</li>
            <li> Sometimes gets a little flaky but that could be due to residual moisture.</li>
            <li> If you like Model in a Bottle, try this for much less money.  </li>
            <li> I like that it didn&#x27;t have a strong smell like Model in a Bottle&#x27;s eyebrow sealer does, however it still has a weird stale paper smell.</li>
            <li> I draw my eyebrows on everyday.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it keeps my brows in check even after a workout at the GYM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve ordered another brand&lt;br /&gt;from</li>
            <li> It was a little expensive (if I remember well) for what it&#x27;s supposed to do........</li>

            <li> To be frank with you I don&#x27;t know exactly what it is suppose to do. You have to be a customer with a lot of eyebrows. It&#x27;s kind of a glue. It was a little expensive (if I remember well) for what it&#x27;s supposed to do........</li>
            <li> The best product on the market for sealing your brows</li>
            <li> works perfect.  And I do not go out of the house without my eyebrows on.  And now they don&#x27;t just blow away the color.  This stuff seals them but also is easy to wash off.  Fast quality shipping.  THANKS</li>
            <li> This product is a god send. I draw my eyebrows on everyday. After 20 to 30 minutes of facial artistry, it is nice to see that they stay exactly how I sealed them from @ 5:30am to sometimes late at nite. Through gentle blotting and a stroke of facial powder once a day,they stay set. Only one thing...I would like it to be waterproof.Then it would be perfect</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t even bother.</li>
            <li> I like it better than Model In A Bottle.  It may not be quite as long lasting, but it doesn&#x27;t look shiny or flake like Model In A Bottle can do.</li>
            <li> I like that it didn&#x27;t have a strong smell like Model in a Bottle&#x27;s eyebrow sealer does, however it still has a weird stale paper smell. Not a big deal though. It didn&#x27;t hold my eyebrow color all day as well either. Not buying it again, but it&#x27;ll do for now.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and it keeps my brows in check even after a workout at the GYM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t a very expensive brand, and it does a good job.  I always use this product before applying eyebrow pencil.</li>
            <li> I received this product shortly after I ordered it.  I&#x27;m more than pleased with this product.  In the past I&#x27;ve ordered another brand&lt;br /&gt;from Amazon and this product is superior, it does not flake or leave a white residue on the eyebrows.  I do make sure I wipe the&lt;br /&gt;brush good before I apply it.  I have sparse brows and it keeps my brow pencil and powder on all day!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing. I apply in the morning and it keeps my eyebrow powder in place all day. On hot days, during super high temperatures and during workouts...it holds up!</li>
            <li> This product was as described.  I had my hopes up to fiund a duplicate of She-Laq,  which it was not! On the flip side, I do like the fact that when you put  La Femme on your brows it doesn&#x27;t leave ashine on your brows.  She-Laq left a glossy shine on top of your brows when they were dried which was abit annoying, but it stayed on ALL DAY EVEN WHEN RUBBING THEM. I find tha the La Femme product doesn&#x27;t stay on as well if you only use 1 coat, so I usually have to use two coats. Until I find another Eyebrow sealer, Le Femme is it for now.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered this product......I&#x27;ll always order it whenever it&#x27;s available!</li>
            <li> If you like Model in a Bottle, try this for much less money.  It works better and is so easy to apply.  The brush never gets stiff and there&#x27;s more product in the bottle.  It also seems to have a very long shelf life and it&#x27;s dependable on all skin types.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.  Sometimes gets a little flaky but that could be due to residual moisture.</li>
