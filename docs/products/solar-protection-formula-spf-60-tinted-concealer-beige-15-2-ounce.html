            <li>I don&#x27;t ever mix the light/dark tubes into the sunscreen because I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are and the default beige works fine with my skin.</li>

            <li>First of all it does not take a lot to custom blend.  </li>
            <li>You will still need a natural color foundation on top to look natural.</li>
            <li>And, this product is far, far better than even any high end foundation.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>

            <li>but looks natural.</li>
            <li>&amp; I added the entire tube of &#x27;dark&#x27; and still too light.</li>

            <li>then I use an Olay serum with a very small amount of foundation (True Match) to even out color/tone and blot that too before blush, eye makeup, etc.</li>

            <li> Great product especially since you are given clear or color additives to adjust the tinting to match your own skin color for all seasons .  I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> I have to say after reading several reviews I had higher expectations for this product. I do like the way it spreads however I felt like I was putting foundation base on as it appears so thick once applied.  Also even with adding tints to the base it never looked natural.  It&#x27;s also very messy.  Perhaps it&#x27;s a better product for gals and not for guys.  I will stick to Solar Protection Tizo3.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased this foundation after my dermatologist recommended it. I love the coverage and how it stays in place throughout the day and how easily it washes off.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It covers my little spider veins on my legs great.  I will say that I add a little moisturizer to it before I put it on, it helps it smooth out better. It&#x27;s very water resistant and it stays on !</li>
            <li> I could get on the roof top and give a speech about these Solar products (see my review for Tizo Solar Protection Facial Mineral Fusion also).  You can save yourself a lot of dough in wrinkle creams and brown spot treatments if you will just use this.  And the sooner the better.  Year &#x27;round.  Get your teenage girls to wear it instead of over the counter makeup (this sunscreen is foundation too).  They will thank you years later!  My dermatologist told me about this company.  I have had two precancerous lesions burned off because we did not have this kind of sunscreen when I was growing up.&lt;br /&gt;So here is what I&#x27;ve learned: Solar makes a few products and it was confusing to me at first about which one to get... BUT I am very glad I have both.&lt;br /&gt;1)  Tizo Solar Protection Facial Mineral Fusion is like a primer/light foundation.  Your skin just glows like all get out with this stuff. You can wear it by itself if you want.  #3 is for medium complexions and #2 is for lighter complexions.  (I am fair and actually the #3 is ok b/c I spread it and use it mostly as a primer.)&lt;br /&gt;2) This one I&#x27;m reviewing here is the Solar Protection Formula Tinted Concealer.  I have no idea why they call it a concealer b/c it is more like a foundation.  The shade in the bottle is too dark for me but it comes with two tubes....white and dark.  Check to see if the shade by itself is ok.  If not, you add drops of whichever one you want to custom blend to the shade that suits you best.  I gradually added a lot of the white (testing along the way) and the final shade is perfect.  Now you might think this is a lot of trouble and it would be easier to just buy an over the counter foundation.  Wrong!  First of all it does not take a lot to custom blend.  And, this product is far, far better than even any high end foundation.</li>
            <li> This product blends in well.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for years as my makeup. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> My doctor and his staff recommended this product to me after a facial. After looking for years for a product that works with my large&lt;br /&gt;pores, I am satisfied. It is not water proof so if sweating it needs to be reapplied. It is thick so I put it on while my face is still damp from&lt;br /&gt;lotion.</li>
            <li> It is heavier &amp; almost cake like in consistency.  Also the color is too light &amp; I added the entire tube of &#x27;dark&#x27; and still too light.</li>
            <li> I am very happy, satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> This product gives great coverage and doubles as a foundation</li>
            <li> especially essential for us melanoma survivors!&lt;br /&gt;you look good, conceals your scars and you protect your skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about six years every morning, but I found early on that if you dot your face with a daytime moisturizer when applying it that it goes on much smoother and creamier, as it is rather thick by itself and too much coverage is unnatural looking and feels heavy. I blot it after it is smoothed on with a dry washcloth or a Kleenex to absorb any excess oil from the moisturizer then I use an Olay serum with a very small amount of foundation (True Match) to even out color/tone and blot that too before blush, eye makeup, etc. It works great and I get a lot of comments about how good my skin looks....from strangers and at 68 y.o. compliments are always well received. It also last a long time, so the cost is relatively inexpensive over several months of use.....buy it, use faithfully and enjoy the compliments to follow :)</li>
            <li> I use this product as my make up base.  I love it.  I have also tried the water resistant and I use it to exercise outdoors.  The line is very good.</li>
            <li> This product is really good for me, as I have rosacea and am hyper sensitive to sunshine.  My dermatologist recommended it for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for years and I love it. Great coverage and protection. If blended well, it works nicely with my fair skin tone. I often mix a dab of my favorite face lotion with it to make it slightly creamier and a little lighter. This works like a charm. I have very sensitive acne prone skin and it has never caused me any problems. I don&#x27;t ever mix the light/dark tubes into the sunscreen because I don&#x27;t know what the ingredients are and the default beige works fine with my skin.</li>
            <li> My doctor started me on this and I&#x27;ll never change...lasts all day and covers well but looks natural. Very good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I adjusted the base color with color control dark to match my skin tone. It works well to cover my brown spots on my face.</li>
            <li> I got this for mom and she s happy with the product!</li>
            <li> Love this sunscreen base- I use it as foundation...great coverage and not greasy. You will not be sorry- even if you have oily skin!</li>
            <li> It is the best choice for a sun block and makeup.&lt;br /&gt;You can mix the color to get your shade and I especially like both price and the quality.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely wonderful... I am using this as my concealer and makeup all in one!!! I love the fact that is non-oily, which is much different when using a regular sunblock. A little goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much, that I suggested it to my aunt... who also LOVES it!!! My dermatologist told me it is what she uses, but can be a little pricey. It&#x27;s price is no where NEAR comparable to its amazingness! They could charge double and I would still buy it! I have VERY sensitive skin, and this has helped GREATLY with my breakouts and with protecting it from the sun. SIX THUMBS UP!</li>
            <li> The product seems to do the job as for UVA; however, the tinted colors tend to have an un-natural color to them no matter how you try to darken or lighten them (with the enclosed darken and lighten tint). You will still need a natural color foundation on top to look natural.</li>
            <li> This is the most natural and smoothest make-up that I have ever used.  I judge it by  how easy it is to apply, and the many compliments&lt;br /&gt;that I get from others.</li>
            <li> IThe product came as I expected and i really like it.  I&#x27;ll buy it again when I usd up these 2 bottles that were bought.  Thanks for carrying this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely yours,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Janet_N</li>
            <li> Covers age spots and scars wonderfully!&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t ever want to be without it!&lt;br /&gt;I have been it took years off my appearance!</li>
