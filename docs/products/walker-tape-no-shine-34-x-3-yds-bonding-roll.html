            <li>it stays perfectly in place!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li>But thats whats best as units should be removed often</li>
            <li>This tape works greatly for a lace wig but then again I don&#x27;t keep my wigs taped for longer than a week as I am on a hair growth journey, I have to wash my hair once a week</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>If adhesive doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is a good one.  </li>
            <li>Good product and met my expectations.</li>
            <li>Good Product.  </li>
            <li>It holds PHENOMENALLY!</li>
            <li>I have been using it for a week now and this product is absolutely phenomenal!</li>
            <li>I used this to make my own tape in hair extensions.  </li>
            <li>I love this tape.</li>
            <li>It had a really strong bond in my hair.</li>
            <li>Not as strong as it claims to be</li>
            <li>Works fine besides that.</li>
            <li>While using the tape i experienced the wig pulling back after about 2 days</li>
            <li>I am looking forward to how much EASIER this tape will be to remove!!!</li>

            <li>Have reordered more than once would order again in the future and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>This tape is not as strong as the regular supertape.</li>

            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone who does tape hair extensions.  </li>
            <li>(little tip : Once applied I use twizzers to remove the non sticky part, it works fabulously)</li>

            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that will last a LONG time, get this!</li>
            <li> no shine, but didn&#x27;t hold very long.</li>
            <li> I might have had a bit of slipping with my bottom-most row of wefts, but had that with salon-placed wefts also</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T GET YOUR HAIR WET, because if you do the tape loses 100% of its stick.</li>
            <li> It worked as expected; it&#x27;s just not my favorite method as the adhesive is mildly irritating -- not like an allergic reaction type of irritating, just annoying</li>
            <li> Very very messy.</li>
            <li> This tape was NO GOOD and would not stick at all,would not recommend and would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> The tape does not budge in water, cold conditions, heat...</li>
            <li> This tape is almost impossible to separate from the backing without getting it all balled up.  </li>
            <li> This tape is horrible</li>
            <li> This is the worst tape.</li>
            <li> This tape lifted in about 8 days and gave me a terrible rash.</li>

            <li> This tape works greatly for a lace wig but then again I don&#x27;t keep my wigs taped for longer than a week as I am on a hair growth journey, I have to wash my hair once a week so it&#x27;s perfect for me. When I need to keep the wig on longer than a week I apply this tape (little tip : Once applied I use twizzers to remove the non sticky part, it works fabulously) and then I apply the no tape glue on it and finally apply my wig. When I do that it lasts me 2 to 3 weeks. The no tape alone last about a week too, but the 2 together are definitely the business!</li>
            <li> This tape is not as strong as the regular supertape. It is pretty glare-free but who cares about the glare if it wont adhere to your lace wig. While using the tape i experienced the wig pulling back after about 2 days</li>
            <li> I used this to make my own tape in hair extensions.  It worked as expected; it&#x27;s just not my favorite method as the adhesive is mildly irritating -- not like an allergic reaction type of irritating, just annoying (like I find hair glue).  If adhesive doesn&#x27;t bother you, then this is a good one.  It had a really strong bond in my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the only tape I will ever use. It holds PHENOMENALLY! I used to buy cheaper stuff either online or at a beauty supply store and nothing holds the way this does. Best tape ever for my hair extensions</li>
            <li> Excellent tape for no sew hair wefts!  Stays put for 8 weeks and can sometimes go longer.  I would highly recommend this product to anyone who does tape hair extensions.  Buyer beware!  Always looks for Walker No-Shine tape when purchasing on line.  Do not, I repeat, Do not buy Super Tape by Tru-Tape, you will regret it.</li>
            <li> This tape was NO GOOD and would not stick at all,would not recommend and would not purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Good product and met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Used it for hair extensions... hair has been in a for a couple weeks... no issues! I might have had a bit of slipping with my bottom-most row of wefts, but had that with salon-placed wefts also and they used tape AND glue. I am looking forward to how much EASIER this tape will be to remove!!!</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Works great. Have reordered more than once would order again in the future and recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I love this tape. It has not only kept my human hair extentions in but the synthetic as well. The tape does not budge in water, cold conditions, heat... Nothing! If you&#x27;re looking for something that will last a LONG time, get this! One roll fit my over 5ft weft of hair with plenty left over. I will be buying this again!</li>
            <li> This tape is horrible it didnt stick to anything. I would not use for tape in hair extensions.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T GET YOUR HAIR WET, because if you do the tape loses 100% of its stick. Works fine besides that.</li>
            <li> I have used this tape for years on my wigs and it really holds the wigs on good, it will last a couple of weeks and I go swimming with it on.</li>
            <li> This tape is almost impossible to separate from the backing without getting it all balled up.  I gave up on it.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a week now and this product is absolutely phenomenal! it stays perfectly in place! I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the worst tape. It won&#x27;t come off of the hair system and it&#x27;s glue on the skin took forever to come off. Very very messy. It melts into glue all over.</li>
            <li> Not as strong as it claims to be</li>
            <li> This tape lifted in about 8 days and gave me a terrible rash.</li>
            <li> no shine, but didn&#x27;t hold very long. But thats whats best as units should be removed often</li>
