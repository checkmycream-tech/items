            <li>My friend who has sensitive skin loved this set.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural product that has a good rating on the EWGs cosmetics database.  </li>
            <li>These are perfect for travel, I have several but this particular brightening kit has the products I bought for evey day use.</li>
            <li>The sizes are tiny.but the scents are so fresh, and I really want to buy the full size purple carrot night cream, it smells so good and feels luxurious.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne for about 2 years (prior to that I had perfect skin).</li>
            <li>face wash and creams smell amazing and leave your skin SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>I even ordered the full sizes.</li>
            <li>The day cream is lovely and gentle.</li>
            <li>I love this so much.</li>
            <li>I often got compliment for nice clear skin.  </li>
            <li>I researched online some more and read some more review, confirmed that they really are using natural ingredients</li>
            <li>so it ran out quickly).</li>
            <li>The cleansing cream is fine; definitely a gentle, creamy texture.</li>
            <li>It was a nice facial cream.</li>
            <li>My Mother who had commented before on my skin was so surprised at how smooth it looked!  </li>
            <li>I bought it and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>You really get effective skincare at a reasonable price and natural.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have noticed diminished sun spots in just a few weeks; love this mini size kit because it works great for traveling.</li>
            <li>Great kit that allowed me to try several products before purchasing larger versions.  </li>
            <li>They may be fine products but the lack of scent in this batch kind of killed the excitement for me!</li>
            <li>My skin is still completely pimple free after using to product for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>now i know i can buy with regular retail sizes :-)</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and the texture of the different products in this travel/sample kit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used products from each line and they all do exactly what they claim.  </li>
            <li>this was the first time I&#x27;ve seen a set of travel sizes.</li>
            <li>No one wants to hear that right?  </li>
            <li>I also took them with me on a trip and it was lovely to pamper myself after a long day of sight seeing.</li>
            <li>, I have ordered the full size items directly from Andalou&#x27;s website.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, so moisturizers can easily be too heavy or too light.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find the products in this kit had much scent to them.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I use the fruit stem cell revitalize serum from the Age Defying Serum with this line and find it very sufficient.  </li>
            <li>I recommend them highly to everyone I know!  </li>
            <li>highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I am 44 and have used MyChelle, which didn&#x27;t do much for me, and Mineral Fusion which irritated my skin and gave me a rash.</li>
            <li>For sure, I&#x27;ll revisit this brand for my skincare needs, can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other stuff.</li>
            <li>Overall, I found the cleanser too mild for my oily skin, the mask is fine but it burns really for the first 30-40 seconds, not sure if I will get a full size</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten complements on my clear skin and the new &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; from having such healthy skin.</li>
            <li>It just made my face feel extra clean.</li>
            <li>Within the first two weeks my skin cleared up completely.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that damages easily in the sun and was starting to notice some new freckles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>Most other products like these tend to cost a fortune although, with consumer awareness spreading the demand for natural skincare products has increased.</li>
            <li>The one thing I loved about this product is it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight or itch like some other products I had tried.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Andalou also has many other products for different skin types and skin issues, I encourage you to try them out!</li>
            <li>The first one I bought was a serum, later on</li>
            <li>Hello!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Qiora, a very expensive Japanese brand which has excellent results on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Same for the night cream: not heavy, but moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>sometimes with natural products they just dont perform as well as their chemical counterparts, but not these.  </li>
            <li>The moisturizer hydrates so well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, I am trying to use natural products.  </li>
            <li>She told me she went to Wholefood and got recommended for some natural skincare products</li>
            <li>cause i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>When I saw this at Grocery Outlet, I knew that it was a steal because of how natural it is, no gluten, parabens, or petroleum ingredients.</li>
            <li>After about 2 week of using this product I saw major results!</li>
            <li>They are on sale elsewhere in other websites cheaper than here ;)</li>
            <li>As a product line I liked the smell of the product, but left my skin feeling tight and dried out.</li>
            <li>It is all natural and seems to have solved my two year long adult acne nightmare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 22 year old female</li>

            <li> I wanted to start out small and try the sample sizes, but couldn&#x27;t find it at my local store. I was very excited to locate it online and even more so when I started using the product. After the first use my skin felt softer and cleaner than usual. I love the smell of all the brightening products, even the toner which is a miracle. After all the face products I&#x27;ve gone through it&#x27;s nice to find one that I would recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Everything I have tried from Andalou works great and smells incredible.  sometimes with natural products they just dont perform as well as their chemical counterparts, but not these.  You really get effective skincare at a reasonable price and natural.  I love it!</li>
            <li> Wife loves it. Im sure she&#x27;ll force me to order anotger set.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t find the products in this kit had much scent to them. I was looking forward to trying the Meyer Lemon face cleanser, sounds luscious, only to find it smelled like well ....nothing. They may be fine products but the lack of scent in this batch kind of killed the excitement for me!</li>
            <li> I really liked the products. It does seem to brighten the skin. My only complaint is that the daily moisturizer does not have SPF in it. Also, my skin is on the dry side and it I felt that I needed a bit more hydration.</li>
            <li> Good intro to a great product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this set for the last two weeks now - sparingly - since these tubes are tiny. I am very satisfied with how my skin feels now. It feels softer and moisturized. I am very picky about facial creams etc because they tend to make me break out and feel as if my skin is very tight (in a bad way) but not these. I am definitely ordering the other kits too soon and maybe even buy some for my mom and grandma.</li>
            <li> I loved these products. I even ordered the full sizes. The moisturizer hydrates so well and doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It was a nice facial cream. i would want to buy the kit again.</li>
            <li> Great kit that allowed me to try several products before purchasing larger versions.  I also use them for travel.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have sensitive skin and I can use it. The smell is wonderful. Great product and worth trying.</li>
            <li> This is a great trial-size pack. You get a little bit of everything, so you can try it all out before committing to a whole bottle. Definitely enough in each to use every day for at *least* a couple of weeks. I use an app that evaluates the toxicity of all the products I use so I can make sure they&#x27;re &amp;#34;clean.&amp;#34; All of these products rate a 4 on a scale of 1-10, and that&#x27;s only for potential allergens/irritants (they didn&#x27;t show anything in the carcinogen or developmental/reproductive toxicity categories). The products themselves are awesome: I love the toner. It&#x27;s really refreshing, has a great smell, and makes my face feel very clean without drying it out. The cleansing cream is fine; definitely a gentle, creamy texture. Not suds-y, but it works well and even removes my waterproof mascara. The day cream is lovely and gentle. Just enough moisture. I have combination skin, so moisturizers can easily be too heavy or too light. This one is perfect. Same for the night cream: not heavy, but moisturizes very well. I love using it. The mask is nice; I don&#x27;t often use masks and didn&#x27;t notice any kind of difference using this one, but the texture and smell were nice. It just made my face feel extra clean. I&#x27;ll definitely be buying a full-size bottle of the toner and the night cream, and may invest in the cleanser and day cream as well, later on. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 22 year old female and I&#x27;ve been struggling with adult acne for about 2 years (prior to that I had perfect skin). I&#x27;ve tried just about EVERYTHING from mud masks to prescriptions to drastic changes in diet. A friend suggested Andalou and I was skeptical but decided to give it a shot since nothing else was really working for me. Within the first two weeks my skin cleared up completely. The starter kit lasted for just over 3 weeks (I was religious about washing my face morning + night so it ran out quickly). I was so satisfied with this product, I have ordered the full size items directly from Andalou&#x27;s website. My skin is still completely pimple free after using to product for about 2 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash and creams smell amazing and leave your skin SO SOFT. I&#x27;ve gotten complements on my clear skin and the new &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; from having such healthy skin. I would recommend this product to anyone! It is all natural and seems to have solved my two year long adult acne nightmare. Andalou also has many other products for different skin types and skin issues, I encourage you to try them out!</li>
            <li> I love this so much. The sizes are tiny.but the scents are so fresh, and I really want to buy the full size purple carrot night cream, it smells so good and feels luxurious.</li>
            <li> Packed neatly and nicely. Non irritating. My friend who has sensitive skin loved this set. I gave it to her as one of her gifts!</li>
            <li> small bottles, not worth the price :( bottle sizes were smaller than travel bottles and lasted less than 1 week when used according to directions on the bottles.  As a product line I liked the smell of the product, but left my skin feeling tight and dried out.</li>
            <li> definitely a good buy. my skin is smoother, brighter, looks healthier and hydrated. now i know i can buy with regular retail sizes :-)</li>
            <li> Great set to try it out. I dont feel like it did anything for my skin, but its a nice lite skin care line if you don&#x27;t really have any issues.</li>
            <li> Hello!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Qiora, a very expensive Japanese brand which has excellent results on my skin.  I often got compliment for nice clear skin.  However, I am trying to use natural products.  I started with using Burtbees body oil for bath and after shower for moisturizing and that made me feel good.  I come across Andalou Naturals when I met my friend for lunch whom I haven&#x27;t seen in a couple of months.  We talked about skincare and we both used expensive products but hers didn&#x27;t quite work out and she has been switching from one expensive one to the next. When I saw her this time I noticed her skin was glowing, not from make-up but I can see healthiness oozing out of her face. So I asked her what she is using.  She told me she went to Wholefood and got recommended for some natural skincare products and she told me it&#x27;s a fraction of what she&#x27;s been paying.  I didn&#x27;t ask her the name of the product, I assume when I went online to that website I would see it.  So, I saw the only facial product was Andalou Naturals.  The first one I bought was a serum, later on I found out it is from the Age Defying line.  Then I also found out it&#x27;s meant to use before moisturizer.  At the time I was still using my expensive line but they are almost gone.  When the last expensive drop of moisturizer is gone I found this Brightening Kit.  I researched online some more and read some more review, confirmed that they really are using natural ingredients then I bought it.  It has been almost 2 weeks and most of the product are almost finished.  I have oily skin, I should probably bought the Clarifying Kit instead of this one but I like the way they use vitamin C and I read reviews of how nice it smells, like orange.  Overall, I found the cleanser too mild for my oily skin, the mask is fine but it burns really for the first 30-40 seconds, not sure if I will get a full size but I see rave reviews on that one.  The day lotion and night lotion are both with nice texture and glide onmy skin with great absorption.  Not greasy or anything at all.  I use the fruit stem cell revitalize serum from the Age Defying Serum with this line and find it very sufficient.  After the 1st week of use, no breakouts, no change of anything sign, my skin stays glowing and healthy looking. Then I bought the Clarifying and Age Defying kits as well.  I am intending to try out all 3 sets then I&#x27;ll pick and choose the cleanser, serum, masks, moisturizer, and night cream accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am just very happy to stay beautiful with natural product such as Andalou Naturals.  I recommend them highly to everyone I know!  If you are wondering what would suit you then try out the kits.  They are on sale elsewhere in other websites cheaper than here ;)</li>
            <li> I loved that I was able to try this product before I bought it, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint! I&#x27;ve always had very sensitive skin so I wanted to try it before I bought it.  Before I bought this, I was to the point where I just washed my face with a little soap, or just water.  My face was very uneven and I had lots of pimples.  One day my Mom even commented on my skin was &amp;#34;bumpy&amp;#34; Bleeh! No one wants to hear that right?  I saw this at a health food store and decided to buy it on here because it was less expensive.  After about 2 week of using this product I saw major results! My skin looked fresh, smooth, and bright!  My Mother who had commented before on my skin was so surprised at how smooth it looked!  After my skin adjusted, I had hardly any pimples as well!  The one thing I loved about this product is it didn&#x27;t make my skin feel tight or itch like some other products I had tried.  This product might not work for everyone, but it&#x27;s nice you can try a bit before you buy a lot!</li>
            <li> Even since I began using this product I&#x27;ve seen fewer and less severe breakouts. I will continue to purchase this as long as my skin remains clear.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my face feel great. I love the way it smells and the texture of the different products in this travel/sample kit.  If you&#x27;re unsure of whether or not this will work for you, I recommend trying this kit before committing to the larger (more expensive) sizes.</li>
            <li> Would buy again. Nice esp the meyer lemon cleaner and mask. Highly recommend.  This line is certified non gmo through the nongmoproject.com. highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t for me cause i have sensitive skin. I had been using it for around 2 week &amp; I haven&#x27;t see any change except it give me a little tingle feeling  &amp; dry skin. Wont buy it again! By the way, shipping take forerver it took 2 week for it 2 arrive...</li>
            <li> This is great for travel or for trying out Andalou products, I bought it because I needed something new and I was flying so size was a consideration. I love the products though and will continue to use and buy Andalou products and recommend them to friends. My skin has a very healthy glow and improved resiliency. I am 44 and have used MyChelle, which didn&#x27;t do much for me, and Mineral Fusion which irritated my skin and gave me a rash.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to put on my face because I had gone too long with just wearing moisturizer with spf. I have sensitive skin that damages easily in the sun and was starting to notice some new freckles. When I saw this at Grocery Outlet, I knew that it was a steal because of how natural it is, no gluten, parabens, or petroleum ingredients. I bought it and started using it right away. I thought the bottles are too small to use long enough to see results but already I&#x27;m seeing some changes. Most other products like these tend to cost a fortune although, with consumer awareness spreading the demand for natural skincare products has increased. For sure, I&#x27;ll revisit this brand for my skincare needs, can&#x27;t wait to try some of their other stuff.</li>
            <li> Did not do anything for my skin</li>
            <li> I love Andalou products.  I&#x27;ve used products from each line and they all do exactly what they claim.  I like the small sizes for trial use and travel.  Extremely convenient.  Will restock when this one is depleted.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural product that has a good rating on the EWGs cosmetics database.  I have been using these products for a couple of weeks now.  The products smell nice but not overpowering.  The products make my face look good.  I am very happy with the products and will purchase them again</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, bought it to try and wound up taking on a trip. These are perfect for travel, I have several but this particular brightening kit has the products I bought for evey day use.</li>
            <li> Overall I have noticed diminished sun spots in just a few weeks; love this mini size kit because it works great for traveling.</li>
            <li> Great package for travel!  I&#x27;ve used these products for a long time but this was the first time I&#x27;ve seen a set of travel sizes.</li>
            <li> This is the perfect size to try out all the products. I liked each and every one of them! I know exactly what I want to buy the larger size of, and can estimate how long it will last me. I also took them with me on a trip and it was lovely to pamper myself after a long day of sight seeing. Well worth the money!</li>
