            <li>You&#x27;ll be glad you did, for sure!</li>
            <li>The best product I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
            <li>Hair Covet works perfect as just described and the outcomes are worth satisfying and is also pocket friendly.</li>
            <li>I needed help with my hair and needed it fast, I knew vitamins were a perfect fit since I am vegan</li>
            <li>Great product, delivery very fast</li>
            <li>I think Hair Covet is creating a healthy growth environment (no dryness and itchiness).</li>
            <li>ingredients do support healthy hair growth</li>
            <li>Take recommended dosages and you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li>What a great combination,  my hair is growing so fast and filling in so well.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I want my hair to have more body, more shine, and to be healthier.</li>
            <li>Feeling this supplement is compatible with everything else in my healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li>So I am now taking more regularly to get the best</li>
            <li>I love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>More and more, year after year:</li>
            <li>They do increase my urination a bit, I&#x27;m sure because of the Vitamin B6 in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li>In the description it did not list folic acid, so I thought I was safe when I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be any more pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many products to help with the loss and thinning of my hair but nothing has worked quite as well as Hair Covet has.</li>
            <li>Before purchasing Hair Covet, I had tried many hair regrowth vitamins</li>
            <li>and I had also read a lot of different articles and studies about the best formulas for hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I tried Hair Covet.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I came across this Hair</li>
            <li>If your hair loss is a result of genetics, meaning the hair loss runs through your family, then Lipogaine for Women is probably be the best choice because it has minoxidil, the only drug approved by the FDA for treating genetic hair loss.</li>
            <li>Now since it has been about three month i can confidently say that it works wonders.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much more than Hair Rush</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased these and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I love this item it works</li>
            <li>No....lost more hair.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve dyed it, cut it, razored it, chopped it all off for locks of love (after a year of nothing to my hair), burnt it, fried it, bleached it,</li>
            <li>I bleached most of my hair 3 times and the ends 5 times so</li>
            <li>I have tried many products.</li>
            <li>I also tried many hair stimulating shampoos.</li>
            <li>I cannot say for sure</li>
            <li>I came upon this product and am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and I can already notice a difference :)</li>
            <li>I wish they were more affordable.</li>
            <li>how satisfied they were, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products but nothing worked until Hair Covet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 100% sold on it and recommend it to anyone looking for a safe, easy way to improve the health, quality, and attractiveness of their hair, nails, and, skin.</li>
            <li>and although I have not seen much result in the growth department (as it takes more than 3 weeks to see this kind of result) I have notice a VERY significant change in the amount of hair loss and my hair feels much more healthy.</li>
            <li>, I have tried many other products and this is the best.</li>
            <li>I will update my review when I finish the bottle to give a more detailed review but,</li>
            <li>and I quickly bought a 90-day supply, taking them was so easy and affordable!</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>My hair is coming back in beautifully</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t huge though, they are easy for me to swallow..</li>
            <li>I am still hopeful that maybe it will show some regrowth, but overall, I am happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>I took these for a straight month and I&#x27;m honestly amazed at what this did for my locks.</li>
            <li>Free product provided for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s working for me, and that’s what is important.</li>
            <li>/&gt;**I received a free product for a review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered this two times and so far so good.  </li>
            <li>My wife picked these up for herself and so far so good.</li>
            <li>So I think so far they are doing a good job, and the progress is noticeable.</li>
            <li>Top notch stuff, getting ready to dye my hair soon and glad I&#x27;m taking this because it&#x27;ll help keep it at</li>
            <li>So far so good will keep trying it.</li>
            <li>and so I did some research and came across this product and it has just the right amount of all the vitamins I need because my hair is doing so much better.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to enhance overall healthy hair, and as a great addition to your arsenal of anti-aging products to keep hair looking and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li>It had great reviews and in comparison to other supplements the pricing was much better for my wallet.</li>
            <li>and this has really helped!!!</li>
            <li>My husband bought me this amazing product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>My hair loss has significantly reduced as I suffer from PCOS</li>
            <li>She however was willing to take the supplement in conjunction with Lipogaine to see if the combination would be more impactful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hope you will have success with it as well!</li>
            <li>I saw significant improvement after I took this vitamin with lipogaine for women for three months.</li>
            <li>So far I am very satisfied with this supplement.</li>
            <li>Two months after using it I noticed a significant decline in shedding.</li>
            <li>You have to be consistent with taking them and make sure you drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li>As you age you quickly find out how important the metals are.</li>
            <li>Before I can find a better product, I will continue using it as this is the most helpful product that I have found so far.</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s not falling out, it&#x27;s certainly going to get longer:)</li>
            <li>I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone who like myself is concerned about thinning hair or damaged hair.</li>
            <li>they turn my pee really bright yellow.  </li>
            <li>I read many reviews and after much consideration, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing faster, has more volume and looks/feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li>(  Well....after using this product for a few weeks I have seen an incredible difference.  </li>
            <li>think this is a good supplement to try as a preventive method and to aid a topical treatment.  </li>
            <li>I am going to take this vitamin for 3 months to see if it will make my hair as full as 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>and it is priced much more reasonable.</li>
            <li>Yes recovering, for some reason after pregnancy even if I continue prenatal vitamins my hair falls out by the hand full</li>
            <li>This supplement is good for anyone who wants longer hair/quick growth or someone suffering from vitamin difficiency/avoidable hair loss since it contains many beneficial ingredients (proven to help hair growth) such as biotin, nettle leaf, saw palmetto, and vitamins B-6 and B-12.</li>
            <li>It’s packed full of vitamins so that is probably the explanation for the energy boost</li>
            <li>She had no bad side-effects, no allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not losing more than 2-3 hairs a day, which is completely normal!  </li>
            <li>I will stay loyal to this product.</li>
            <li>My hair and nails  have grown tremendously thank you Amazon for making it happen.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been putting up with hair loss on and off for several years, and tried a number of oral hair strengthening supplements with different ingredients to Hairsentials by Flawless Botanics.</li>
            <li>Relieved that there is someone out there offering a hair loss product that is creating results as quickly as this.</li>
            <li>I will purchase a few more bottles because I do feel it&#x27;s a good vitamin for hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s feeling more smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only has it stopped me from losing any more hair, but the nutrients must be strengthening it because it is shinier and healthy than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the initial results.</li>
            <li>So far so good - I think my hair has grown a bit more, and this definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>In the sunlight I looked like a porcupine, lol, but I knew that once they got longer, they&#x27;d lay down.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who is in search of a vitamin that effectively stops and reverses hair loss, or simply wants to grow hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Since taking the vitamins, the texture of my new growth has become more manageable.  </li>
            <li>It does have 5000u of Biotin in it, and I know that works well, and my nails are growing incredibly fast and are quite strong.  </li>
            <li>This product is pretty good, I am buying this again because, it’s just offering up some solid results.</li>
            <li>Very pleased to finally find an effective nutritional supplement for hair, that can increase my hair health and appearance, and, as an extra, benefits my nails and skin also.</li>
            <li>After only a week of using it I noticed my hair was thicker and more full (my friends noticed too!).</li>
            <li>but it has been consistent!  </li>
            <li>I have just finished my first bottle of Lipogaine Hair Covet and already notice a difference in the growth of my hair and even my eyelashes!  </li>
            <li>Both my hairdresser and myself are amazed at how fast my hair is growing!!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s growing fast!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually feeling more energetic which is a HUGE plus since I have two young children.</li>
            <li>I tried this after reading the ingredients and figured it would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li>and I realized one day that I could see my scalp far more than I ever had.  </li>
            <li>By no means is this an overnight success story</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another nice thing about this product is that it is 100% satisfaction guaranteed or you can get your money back.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a mother of 4, at age 49 and noticed significant hair loss and breakage which I found really bothersome.  </li>
            <li>Well I can honestly say after the first bottle that I am not losing anywhere near as much hair when coming out of the shower</li>
            <li>I found this vitamin bottle in February and started using right away.  </li>
            <li>and I can see results right away</li>
            <li>My New growth feels immaculate and it&#x27;s growing strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced moderate to severe hair loss for the last 7-10 years and because my hair loss started in my thirties...</li>
            <li>This is very exciting to see as I have used many other hair vitimans with no luck.  </li>
            <li>I know with time it&#x27;s only going to get better.  </li>
            <li>I am on my third bottle of Hair Covet, and my hair feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Lipogaine!</li>
            <li>Anyway, He cut it, and it has stayed that exact length for 3 years.  </li>
            <li>My first month taking Hair Covet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than using topical solutions.  </li>
            <li>At first I thought it was a fluke</li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t believe that something is going on in my scalp that is helping my hair from falling out!  </li>
            <li>Saw results in the first three weeks</li>
            <li>and I have long hair (a bit gray under the red haircolor, lol.)  </li>
            <li>It truly gave me back my confidence : )</li>
            <li>Finishing up my first bottle soon.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty damaged, so I needed something to help nutrient my hair and this product works well.</li>
            <li>I made sure that I went and had my hair trimmed before starting the supplement</li>
            <li>Overall my hair looks amazingly healthy.</li>
            <li>An all in one hair product, would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle yet, but I&#x27;m already seeing results.</li>
            <li>I have just ordered my next bottle and am glad I found this supplement.</li>
            <li>I have noticed HEALTHY, STRONG, THICK, FULL</li>
            <li>There were no reviews on this product when I made my first order, but I decided to give it a try as the ingredients looked promising and price was right.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, my hair is growing super fast and it should be back to the length it was very quickly.</li>
            <li>could see positive results in the first week of use.</li>
            <li>and you could see my New growth quickly.</li>
            <li>I style my hair the same way and have had to incorporate the new hair, which is a first, and it is funny because their is a nice amount of new hair!</li>
            <li>Delightfully surprised by the astounding results from using this hair supplement, for example I am now experiencing only 3 - 4 strands in the drain catch!</li>
            <li>I am using this along with Every Man&#x27;s Jack 2 in 1 Thickening Shampoo, and I can&#x27;t help but see positive results.</li>
            <li>I am anticipating what the long term results will be :)</li>
            <li>After taking it for a couple of weeks, my hair is noticeably healthy, my skin is more subtle and my mood is brighter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely thinner than it used to be and breaks off easily.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue to use this and strongly recommend this to anyone with hair problems.</li>
            <li>I would always wash my hair and have large amounts of hair come out ...</li>
            <li>maybe if I use it for few more months then it will help me in hair regrowth fingers crossed!</li>
            <li>In order to be completely transparent, I did receive compensation for this review in form of a free bottle of product, but I this review is sincere non the less.</li>
            <li>and I just started to notice a tiny bit of fine hairs show up at my scalp line.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of products and supplements for hair growth, and any of them really gave me real and positive results but Hair Covet really</li>
            <li>I really hope this product is never discontinued because it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This bottle of vitamins REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li>I had started noticing minimal hair loss about a year ago on her, and we had tried all the top brands out there.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>; like when I was much younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loaded with whole lines of intentional nutrients that create a prescription for hair growth designed for women.  </li>
            <li>An added plus is that it&#x27;s made in America and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Much to my surprise, I have also noticed thicker and longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li>I hope you buy it because it really works.  </li>
            <li>but this product is really helping in reducing the hair loss</li>
            <li>Frea is the real version of  &amp;#34;folic acid&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>- I can&#x27;t wait to see how much hair I have in another couple months....</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see results until I tried Hair Covet.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a much happier woman now, and I Highly Recommend this supplement!</li>
            <li>Hair even strengthening and growing in trouble spots (top of my head more toward the back) and edges.</li>
            <li>I took this supplement for a month straight.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hair braids for this whole summer</li>
            <li>I took some biotin and One-A-Day multi-vitamin without much result.</li>
            <li>Not only has my hair&#x27;s mid-line completely filled in, but the hair all over my head is getting fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li>My hair is also noticeably growing much faster than before.</li>
            <li>So you really have absolutely nothing to lose by trying this product.</li>
            <li>product seems also help grow my hair much faster.</li>
            <li>I really do recommend this.</li>
            <li>My hair is absolutely fuller and ends to root my hair is thicker per strand(yea</li>
            <li>,I pay way too much time examining my hair).</li>
            <li>Now my hair is growing fast and fuller.</li>
            <li>I din&#x27;t expect much from this product when I bought it 3 months ago.</li>
            <li>I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This really does work.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I have very kinky, curly hair.</li>
            <li>I tried viviscal but didn’t see any results and its very pricey</li>
            <li>Prior to this supplement that actually works, I had been taking a popular brand for 5 months, with no results&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like the vitamins so far, purchased only one bottle, 10 more days to go to finish.</li>
            <li>My hair was becoming unusually dry and almost felt brittle on the ends- until I started this product.  </li>
            <li>My nails are also growing very long and strong.</li>
            <li>My hair feels much thicker and healthier and I would highly recommend Hair Covet.</li>
            <li>I know all of this may sound strange but that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li>The only change I&#x27;ve really noticed on my scalp is that it seems a tad bit more oily now, but it had been dry, so I see this as a positive.  </li>
            <li>I have been very pleased so far and definitely will continue to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li>and I have NEW hair!</li>
            <li>After using this for the whole bottle i can see some results, my hair is thicker and i plan on buying a few more bottles and seeing what happens after months of use.  </li>
            <li>I have tried over the counter women&#x27;s Rogaine and applied it religiously on my problem area (top of head where my bangs begin), but no such luck!</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about 3 weeks now and while it’s too soon to notice any growth I have noticed that my hair is super shiny.</li>
            <li>Looks promising so far!</li>
            <li>If large pills are a problem for you I think you could easily cut them in half with a pill splitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This normal amount of hair loss I can live with!</li>
            <li>As I mentioned, it&#x27;s too early yet to decide if it&#x27;s helping with that, but I will say I haven&#x27;t noticed as much hair falling out as I used to see, so</li>
            <li>I knew that it was going to take more than a few weeks to see the results I had been hoping for.  </li>
            <li>I will continue with my second bottle before I decide if it is worth continuing with this product.</li>
            <li>They did help my hair grow thicker and healthier, but I don&#x27;t think my hair grew any faster than it normally does.</li>
            <li>What works on one persons dry brittle hair may or may not work better on another person’s similar hair structure.</li>
            <li>Hopefully, new hair grows, too.  </li>
            <li>Within weeks, I could SEE new growth.  </li>
            <li>I have expectations that within a couple months I will begin seeing new growth as my DHT levels are lowered.  </li>
            <li>and I have new growth.  </li>
            <li>All of the vitamins made my hair grow longer, but none of them stopped my hair loss or prompted new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have new growth and my hair texture feels healthier.</li>
            <li>Skimmed through the active ingredients of the product, and it has all of the important ingredients for hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>far as hair growth, it&#x27;s too early to say really.  </li>
            <li>The little bunch in the shower drain, more when I wet combed, then more in my hair brush after my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li>and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>I plan to continue using Hair Covet for at least a few more months to see if it helps with the thinning hair I have on top of my head.  </li>
            <li>I felt that my hair was falling out more than usual</li>
            <li>First, my hair feels thicker, it&#x27;s definitely longer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first she was a little upset at me because she thought I was poking fun at her.</li>
            <li>Not only did I see my hair fall out less after 3 weeks, I also am feeling what appears to be more new growth on my scalp after one month.</li>
            <li>I have super thin, fine hair that literally has not grown in 3 years.</li>
            <li>I have seen a major result in new hair growth!</li>
            <li>It makes my hair ( which is very thin ) look so much better and seems full.</li>
            <li>These on the other hand worked efficiently and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed a considerable decrease in the amount of hair I lose.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t a reason not to proceed.  </li>
            <li>was a natural selection for me.</li>
            <li>So far, I haven&#x27;t been taking them consistently.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product performs in a whole different way.</li>
            <li>Will buy the second bottle very soon.</li>
            <li>I am a 40 year old mother of 3 boys.</li>
            <li>came across Hair Covet completely by accident.</li>
            <li>My hair loss is almost completely stopped.</li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
            <li>let it go wild almost to dreadlocks status, and now it is recovering from pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Within two weeks, the shedding seemed to stop completely, as there was no longer any hair in the shower drain.</li>
            <li>Three months later, my hair is much healthier and fuller than before.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it for at least one more purchase.</li>
            <li>Thanks Hair Covet&lt;br /&gt;After years of dying, and several extensions I practically destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li>I thought about wearing a wig and just letting it grow out complete but that could take years to happen.</li>
            <li>I am really surprised with this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is shiny and strong with very little breakage.</li>
            <li>Seriously my husband has mentioned many times that it looks so alive,</li>
            <li>The only reason I bought it in the first place and decided to give it a try was the money back guarantee and the reduced price.</li>
            <li>and I really missed my long hair.</li>
            <li>Barely any hair at all anymore!  </li>
            <li>As a skeptic,I purchased this supplement not expecting any major results.</li>
            <li>and I have noticed a major improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a major change in my nails.</li>
            <li>Thank you Hair Covet for saving my hair from falling out so much I had to use hair piece or wide hair band to cover my balding spots.</li>
            <li>I now have barely a strand</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even take the full dosage everyday and what a difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to see tiny New hairs around my temples.  </li>
            <li>decided to stop coloring my hair, because I am so impatient I cut my hair super short</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: Due to affordability issues, I stopped taking the vitamin and my hair began falling at a fast rate.</li>
            <li>I guess you really need to use a supplement like this for at least 3 months before you see any real results.</li>
            <li>Professionally Formulated Extra Strength Version, 60 ml/2oz for the last month.  </li>
            <li>I ordered Hair Covet, and after one bottle, I noticed that not only was my hair not falling out as it had been, but I saw little hairs (about a half inch long) growing on the top of my head, near my part.  </li>
            <li>My hair was getting noticeably thinner in the classic female balding pattern just like my mother&#x27;s did as she aged.</li>
            <li>Not that I am going bald, but I must be going down that path because I find so much of my hair in the drain trap after every shower.  </li>
            <li>The results can be appreciated in less than a month.</li>
            <li>It actually has provided nutrients I am lacking in my diet, which aid in my hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I’m also doing all of the precautionary measures that other women advise in hair care videos, like co-washing, limited brushing, no heat applied to my head(outside of a heating cap with hot oil once a month)</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and the medication I use makes it very thin</li>
            <li>It has always been thin, and fine.  </li>
            <li>The one downside is that you have to take one with each meal (or 3 times a day) which can be hard to remember, but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I want my hair to have more body, more shine, and to be healthier.</li>
            <li> Feeling this supplement is compatible with everything else in my healthy lifestyle.</li>
            <li> So I am now taking more regularly to get the best</li>
            <li> I love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> More and more, year after year:</li>
            <li> They do increase my urination a bit, I&#x27;m sure because of the Vitamin B6 in them.&lt;br</li>
            <li> In the description it did not list folic acid, so I thought I was safe when I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be any more pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products to help with the loss and thinning of my hair but nothing has worked quite as well as Hair Covet has.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing Hair Covet, I had tried many hair regrowth vitamins</li>
            <li> and I had also read a lot of different articles and studies about the best formulas for hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> I am glad that I tried Hair Covet.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I came across this Hair</li>
            <li> If your hair loss is a result of genetics, meaning the hair loss runs through your family, then Lipogaine for Women is probably be the best choice because it has minoxidil, the only drug approved by the FDA for treating genetic hair loss.</li>
            <li> Now since it has been about three month i can confidently say that it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much more than Hair Rush</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased these and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this item it works</li>
            <li> No....lost more hair.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dyed it, cut it, razored it, chopped it all off for locks of love (after a year of nothing to my hair), burnt it, fried it, bleached it,</li>
            <li> I bleached most of my hair 3 times and the ends 5 times so</li>
            <li> I have tried many products.</li>
            <li> I also tried many hair stimulating shampoos.</li>
            <li> I cannot say for sure</li>
            <li> I came upon this product and am so pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and I can already notice a difference :)</li>
            <li> I wish they were more affordable.</li>
            <li> how satisfied they were, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products but nothing worked until Hair Covet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 100% sold on it and recommend it to anyone looking for a safe, easy way to improve the health, quality, and attractiveness of their hair, nails, and, skin.</li>
            <li> and although I have not seen much result in the growth department (as it takes more than 3 weeks to see this kind of result) I have notice a VERY significant change in the amount of hair loss and my hair feels much more healthy.</li>
            <li> , I have tried many other products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> I will update my review when I finish the bottle to give a more detailed review but,</li>
            <li> and I quickly bought a 90-day supply, taking them was so easy and affordable!</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My hair is coming back in beautifully</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t huge though, they are easy for me to swallow..</li>
            <li> I am still hopeful that maybe it will show some regrowth, but overall, I am happy with the product.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this two times and so far so good.  </li>
            <li> My wife picked these up for herself and so far so good.</li>
            <li> So I think so far they are doing a good job, and the progress is noticeable.</li>

            <li> and so I did some research and came across this product and it has just the right amount of all the vitamins I need because my hair is doing so much better.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to enhance overall healthy hair, and as a great addition to your arsenal of anti-aging products to keep hair looking and feeling healthy.  </li>
            <li> It had great reviews and in comparison to other supplements the pricing was much better for my wallet.</li>
            <li> and this has really helped!!!</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this amazing product and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> My hair loss has significantly reduced as I suffer from PCOS</li>
            <li> She however was willing to take the supplement in conjunction with Lipogaine to see if the combination would be more impactful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hope you will have success with it as well!</li>
            <li> I saw significant improvement after I took this vitamin with lipogaine for women for three months.</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied with this supplement.</li>
            <li> Two months after using it I noticed a significant decline in shedding.</li>
            <li> You have to be consistent with taking them and make sure you drink plenty of water.</li>
            <li> As you age you quickly find out how important the metals are.</li>
            <li> Before I can find a better product, I will continue using it as this is the most helpful product that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s not falling out, it&#x27;s certainly going to get longer:)</li>
            <li> I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone who like myself is concerned about thinning hair or damaged hair.</li>
            <li> they turn my pee really bright yellow.  </li>
            <li> I read many reviews and after much consideration, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing faster, has more volume and looks/feels so much healthier.</li>
            <li> (  Well....after using this product for a few weeks I have seen an incredible difference.  </li>
            <li> think this is a good supplement to try as a preventive method and to aid a topical treatment.  </li>
            <li> I am going to take this vitamin for 3 months to see if it will make my hair as full as 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> and it is priced much more reasonable.</li>
            <li> Yes recovering, for some reason after pregnancy even if I continue prenatal vitamins my hair falls out by the hand full</li>
            <li> This supplement is good for anyone who wants longer hair/quick growth or someone suffering from vitamin difficiency/avoidable hair loss since it contains many beneficial ingredients (proven to help hair growth) such as biotin, nettle leaf, saw palmetto, and vitamins B-6 and B-12.</li>
            <li> It’s packed full of vitamins so that is probably the explanation for the energy boost</li>
            <li> She had no bad side-effects, no allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not losing more than 2-3 hairs a day, which is completely normal!  </li>
            <li> I will stay loyal to this product.</li>
            <li> My hair and nails  have grown tremendously thank you Amazon for making it happen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been putting up with hair loss on and off for several years, and tried a number of oral hair strengthening supplements with different ingredients to Hairsentials by Flawless Botanics.</li>
            <li> Relieved that there is someone out there offering a hair loss product that is creating results as quickly as this.</li>
            <li> I will purchase a few more bottles because I do feel it&#x27;s a good vitamin for hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s feeling more smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only has it stopped me from losing any more hair, but the nutrients must be strengthening it because it is shinier and healthy than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the initial results.</li>
            <li> So far so good - I think my hair has grown a bit more, and this definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> In the sunlight I looked like a porcupine, lol, but I knew that once they got longer, they&#x27;d lay down.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone who is in search of a vitamin that effectively stops and reverses hair loss, or simply wants to grow hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> Since taking the vitamins, the texture of my new growth has become more manageable.  </li>
            <li> It does have 5000u of Biotin in it, and I know that works well, and my nails are growing incredibly fast and are quite strong.  </li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, I am buying this again because, it’s just offering up some solid results.</li>
            <li> Very pleased to finally find an effective nutritional supplement for hair, that can increase my hair health and appearance, and, as an extra, benefits my nails and skin also.</li>
            <li> After only a week of using it I noticed my hair was thicker and more full (my friends noticed too!).</li>
            <li> but it has been consistent!  </li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle of Lipogaine Hair Covet and already notice a difference in the growth of my hair and even my eyelashes!  </li>
            <li> Both my hairdresser and myself are amazed at how fast my hair is growing!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s growing fast!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually feeling more energetic which is a HUGE plus since I have two young children.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading the ingredients and figured it would be worth a shot.</li>
            <li> and I realized one day that I could see my scalp far more than I ever had.  </li>
            <li> By no means is this an overnight success story</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another nice thing about this product is that it is 100% satisfaction guaranteed or you can get your money back.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a mother of 4, at age 49 and noticed significant hair loss and breakage which I found really bothersome.  </li>
            <li> Well I can honestly say after the first bottle that I am not losing anywhere near as much hair when coming out of the shower</li>
            <li> I found this vitamin bottle in February and started using right away.  </li>
            <li> and I can see results right away</li>
            <li> My New growth feels immaculate and it&#x27;s growing strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced moderate to severe hair loss for the last 7-10 years and because my hair loss started in my thirties...</li>
            <li> This is very exciting to see as I have used many other hair vitimans with no luck.  </li>
            <li> I know with time it&#x27;s only going to get better.  </li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of Hair Covet, and my hair feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Lipogaine!</li>
            <li> Anyway, He cut it, and it has stayed that exact length for 3 years.  </li>
            <li> My first month taking Hair Covet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than using topical solutions.  </li>
            <li> At first I thought it was a fluke</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t believe that something is going on in my scalp that is helping my hair from falling out!  </li>
            <li> Saw results in the first three weeks</li>
            <li> and I have long hair (a bit gray under the red haircolor, lol.)  </li>
            <li> It truly gave me back my confidence : )</li>
            <li> Finishing up my first bottle soon.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty damaged, so I needed something to help nutrient my hair and this product works well.</li>
            <li> I made sure that I went and had my hair trimmed before starting the supplement</li>
            <li> Overall my hair looks amazingly healthy.</li>
            <li> An all in one hair product, would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle yet, but I&#x27;m already seeing results.</li>
            <li> I have just ordered my next bottle and am glad I found this supplement.</li>
            <li> I have noticed HEALTHY, STRONG, THICK, FULL</li>
            <li> There were no reviews on this product when I made my first order, but I decided to give it a try as the ingredients looked promising and price was right.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my hair is growing super fast and it should be back to the length it was very quickly.</li>
            <li> could see positive results in the first week of use.</li>
            <li> and you could see my New growth quickly.</li>
            <li> I style my hair the same way and have had to incorporate the new hair, which is a first, and it is funny because their is a nice amount of new hair!</li>
            <li> Delightfully surprised by the astounding results from using this hair supplement, for example I am now experiencing only 3 - 4 strands in the drain catch!</li>
            <li> I am using this along with Every Man&#x27;s Jack 2 in 1 Thickening Shampoo, and I can&#x27;t help but see positive results.</li>
            <li> I am anticipating what the long term results will be :)</li>
            <li> After taking it for a couple of weeks, my hair is noticeably healthy, my skin is more subtle and my mood is brighter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely thinner than it used to be and breaks off easily.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue to use this and strongly recommend this to anyone with hair problems.</li>
            <li> I would always wash my hair and have large amounts of hair come out ...</li>
            <li> maybe if I use it for few more months then it will help me in hair regrowth fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> In order to be completely transparent, I did receive compensation for this review in form of a free bottle of product, but I this review is sincere non the less.</li>
            <li> and I just started to notice a tiny bit of fine hairs show up at my scalp line.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products and supplements for hair growth, and any of them really gave me real and positive results but Hair Covet really</li>
            <li> I really hope this product is never discontinued because it&#x27;s a</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This bottle of vitamins REALLY WORKS.  </li>
            <li> I had started noticing minimal hair loss about a year ago on her, and we had tried all the top brands out there.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> ; like when I was much younger.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loaded with whole lines of intentional nutrients that create a prescription for hair growth designed for women.  </li>
            <li> An added plus is that it&#x27;s made in America and is reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Much to my surprise, I have also noticed thicker and longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I hope you buy it because it really works.  </li>
            <li> but this product is really helping in reducing the hair loss</li>
            <li> Frea is the real version of  &amp;#34;folic acid&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> - I can&#x27;t wait to see how much hair I have in another couple months....</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see results until I tried Hair Covet.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a much happier woman now, and I Highly Recommend this supplement!</li>
            <li> Hair even strengthening and growing in trouble spots (top of my head more toward the back) and edges.</li>
            <li> I took this supplement for a month straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hair braids for this whole summer</li>
            <li> I took some biotin and One-A-Day multi-vitamin without much result.</li>
            <li> Not only has my hair&#x27;s mid-line completely filled in, but the hair all over my head is getting fuller and thicker.</li>
            <li> My hair is also noticeably growing much faster than before.</li>
            <li> So you really have absolutely nothing to lose by trying this product.</li>
            <li> product seems also help grow my hair much faster.</li>
            <li> I really do recommend this.</li>
            <li> My hair is absolutely fuller and ends to root my hair is thicker per strand(yea</li>
            <li> ,I pay way too much time examining my hair).</li>
            <li> Now my hair is growing fast and fuller.</li>
            <li> I din&#x27;t expect much from this product when I bought it 3 months ago.</li>
            <li> I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This really does work.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I have very kinky, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I tried viviscal but didn’t see any results and its very pricey</li>
            <li> Prior to this supplement that actually works, I had been taking a popular brand for 5 months, with no results&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like the vitamins so far, purchased only one bottle, 10 more days to go to finish.</li>
            <li> My hair was becoming unusually dry and almost felt brittle on the ends- until I started this product.  </li>
            <li> My nails are also growing very long and strong.</li>
            <li> My hair feels much thicker and healthier and I would highly recommend Hair Covet.</li>
            <li> I know all of this may sound strange but that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li> The only change I&#x27;ve really noticed on my scalp is that it seems a tad bit more oily now, but it had been dry, so I see this as a positive.  </li>
            <li> I have been very pleased so far and definitely will continue to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> and I have NEW hair!</li>
            <li> After using this for the whole bottle i can see some results, my hair is thicker and i plan on buying a few more bottles and seeing what happens after months of use.  </li>
            <li> I have tried over the counter women&#x27;s Rogaine and applied it religiously on my problem area (top of head where my bangs begin), but no such luck!</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about 3 weeks now and while it’s too soon to notice any growth I have noticed that my hair is super shiny.</li>
            <li> Looks promising so far!</li>
            <li> If large pills are a problem for you I think you could easily cut them in half with a pill splitter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This normal amount of hair loss I can live with!</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, it&#x27;s too early yet to decide if it&#x27;s helping with that, but I will say I haven&#x27;t noticed as much hair falling out as I used to see, so</li>
            <li> I knew that it was going to take more than a few weeks to see the results I had been hoping for.  </li>
            <li> I will continue with my second bottle before I decide if it is worth continuing with this product.</li>
            <li> They did help my hair grow thicker and healthier, but I don&#x27;t think my hair grew any faster than it normally does.</li>
            <li> What works on one persons dry brittle hair may or may not work better on another person’s similar hair structure.</li>
            <li> Hopefully, new hair grows, too.  </li>
            <li> Within weeks, I could SEE new growth.  </li>
            <li> I have expectations that within a couple months I will begin seeing new growth as my DHT levels are lowered.  </li>
            <li> and I have new growth.  </li>
            <li> All of the vitamins made my hair grow longer, but none of them stopped my hair loss or prompted new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have new growth and my hair texture feels healthier.</li>
            <li> Skimmed through the active ingredients of the product, and it has all of the important ingredients for hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> far as hair growth, it&#x27;s too early to say really.  </li>
            <li> The little bunch in the shower drain, more when I wet combed, then more in my hair brush after my hair was dry.  </li>
            <li> and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> I plan to continue using Hair Covet for at least a few more months to see if it helps with the thinning hair I have on top of my head.  </li>
            <li> I felt that my hair was falling out more than usual</li>
            <li> First, my hair feels thicker, it&#x27;s definitely longer!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first she was a little upset at me because she thought I was poking fun at her.</li>
            <li> Not only did I see my hair fall out less after 3 weeks, I also am feeling what appears to be more new growth on my scalp after one month.</li>
            <li> I have super thin, fine hair that literally has not grown in 3 years.</li>
            <li> I have seen a major result in new hair growth!</li>
            <li> It makes my hair ( which is very thin ) look so much better and seems full.</li>
            <li> These on the other hand worked efficiently and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable decrease in the amount of hair I lose.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t a reason not to proceed.  </li>
            <li> was a natural selection for me.</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t been taking them consistently.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product performs in a whole different way.</li>
            <li> Will buy the second bottle very soon.</li>
            <li> I am a 40 year old mother of 3 boys.</li>
            <li> came across Hair Covet completely by accident.</li>
            <li> My hair loss is almost completely stopped.</li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
            <li> let it go wild almost to dreadlocks status, and now it is recovering from pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Within two weeks, the shedding seemed to stop completely, as there was no longer any hair in the shower drain.</li>
            <li> Three months later, my hair is much healthier and fuller than before.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it for at least one more purchase.</li>
            <li> Thanks Hair Covet&lt;br /&gt;After years of dying, and several extensions I practically destroyed my hair.</li>
            <li> I thought about wearing a wig and just letting it grow out complete but that could take years to happen.</li>
            <li> I am really surprised with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is shiny and strong with very little breakage.</li>
            <li> Seriously my husband has mentioned many times that it looks so alive,</li>
            <li> The only reason I bought it in the first place and decided to give it a try was the money back guarantee and the reduced price.</li>
            <li> and I really missed my long hair.</li>
            <li> Barely any hair at all anymore!  </li>
            <li> As a skeptic,I purchased this supplement not expecting any major results.</li>
            <li> and I have noticed a major improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen a major change in my nails.</li>
            <li> Thank you Hair Covet for saving my hair from falling out so much I had to use hair piece or wide hair band to cover my balding spots.</li>
            <li> I now have barely a strand</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even take the full dosage everyday and what a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to see tiny New hairs around my temples.  </li>
            <li> decided to stop coloring my hair, because I am so impatient I cut my hair super short</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: Due to affordability issues, I stopped taking the vitamin and my hair began falling at a fast rate.</li>
            <li> I guess you really need to use a supplement like this for at least 3 months before you see any real results.</li>
            <li> Professionally Formulated Extra Strength Version, 60 ml/2oz for the last month.  </li>
            <li> I ordered Hair Covet, and after one bottle, I noticed that not only was my hair not falling out as it had been, but I saw little hairs (about a half inch long) growing on the top of my head, near my part.  </li>
            <li> My hair was getting noticeably thinner in the classic female balding pattern just like my mother&#x27;s did as she aged.</li>
            <li> Not that I am going bald, but I must be going down that path because I find so much of my hair in the drain trap after every shower.  </li>
            <li> The results can be appreciated in less than a month.</li>
            <li> It actually has provided nutrients I am lacking in my diet, which aid in my hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I’m also doing all of the precautionary measures that other women advise in hair care videos, like co-washing, limited brushing, no heat applied to my head(outside of a heating cap with hot oil once a month)</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and the medication I use makes it very thin</li>
            <li> It has always been thin, and fine.  </li>
            <li> The one downside is that you have to take one with each meal (or 3 times a day) which can be hard to remember, but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also I have less shedding than I normally do.</li>
            <li> I hate to seem vain, but my long red hair has been my glory crown ever since I quit being made fun of for having red hair as a kid :-)</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I have noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t as voluminous or vibrant as it used to be.</li>
            <li> these actually WORK!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a broken record about it, but my lupus and all the medication I take has caused my already fine hair to start coming out quite a bit and lose a lot of it&#x27;s (already minimal) thickness and body.</li>
            <li> 49 yr old black female.</li>
            <li> My front hairline now had brand new little &amp;#34;baby bangs&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I recently ombred my hair so my awkward transition from short to long hair is a bit more tolerable.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using Hair Covet that long, maybe about a month or so, so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see a lot of benefit yet, but I do feel that the condition of my hair has improved since I started using the product.  </li>
            <li> Since I started applying this supplement, I have recommended it to most of my friends who just stop to touch my hair as others ask the secret behind my thick, strong, long and healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I use religiously), this product is helping my scalp retain its natural oils so that I don&#x27;t feel like my scalp is tight and dry.</li>
            <li> Although, I will admit, to say that I chose this product completely by accident is probably not true.</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, I have unbelievable new growth across my entire scalp.</li>
            <li> Some had no effect at all, and actually made her feel kind of sick.  </li>
            <li> These are a rather large hard pill (not a capsule) but I haven&#x27;t had any problems swallowing them.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, menopause sucks, but having your hair fall out is just too much to handle.  </li>
            <li> When I lose hair, the hair loss is magnified because every strand is so long.</li>
            <li> Seems to have darkened or eliminated the grey that was coming in.</li>
            <li> I tried Vitamins for hair from GNC store, it didn&#x27;t do anything other than making my nail growing much faster usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reliable (as long as I am, remembering to take my capsules every day!).</li>
            <li> If your hair loss has been caused by something other than genetics, Hair Covet may be your bet, because it covers a broad range of ingredients to help people with hair loss issue due to nutrient, vitamin, and immune system deficiencies and also hair loss caused by stress or from pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wear quite short hair and sometimes have bad habit of pulling on my frontal (forehead) hairline (basically to see how many hair give up).</li>
            <li> My hair texture used to feel dry and straw-like,</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying this product for at least three months to see if shedding decreases.</li>
            <li> I used to have hairdressers tell me how beautiful and thick my hair was, but recently one commented on how thin it was and recommended ridiculously expensive volumizing hair products.  </li>
            <li> When I was younger I used to be blessed with very think head of hair but for the past few years it&#x27;s been going down the drain.</li>
            <li> and I definitely can tell I&#x27;m losing less hair.  </li>
            <li> Not only am I seeing less hair in my hands when I shampoo and condition</li>
            <li> I also noticed the ends of my hair have been looking less damaged recently (</li>
            <li> It you take care of your hair properly, i.e. using less heat, keeping it moisturized, etc.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed slight yellow discoloration of urine and stool, which is to be expected from the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> So Can not really comment on it</li>
            <li> For the last few years, I HAD BEEN increasingly losing my hair.  </li>
            <li> After taking two bottles I have seen some, but minimal hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have very dry scalp (probably due to the minoxidil</li>
            <li> My hair is finally going thick and long.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews from other users saying that it works for them &amp;</li>
            <li> For the past three months this is the only product I have used.</li>
            <li> This is compared to pretty frightening patches of hair that came out before.</li>
            <li> and I mean I go from luscious thick hair to thin and brittle, barely able to be put into a pony tail hair because it just cuts off wherever I tie it</li>
            <li> But now I only have to use very little dark brown hair filler to camouflage.</li>
            <li> I also noticed an unexpected side effect of this product that is like a little bonus...energy!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much, but I&#x27;ve just noticed a slight uptick in oiliness at my roots</li>
            <li> &amp; I see that a particular spot on my head where I had less hair seems to be filling in not so thin anymore.</li>
            <li> Since using Hair Covet along with the aforementioned shampoo I failed to see any if only single hair come off at times.</li>
            <li> During the second bottle, I was hard pressed to find a hair in my hair brush, and NONE in the shower drain, and NONE when I wet combed!!  </li>
            <li> When I run my fingers through my hair, it feels like the thick head of hair that I had when I was younger.</li>
            <li> You do have to take it for several months before you see a difference, because hair grows slowly.</li>
            <li> I was discouraged and down about the condition my hair was in.</li>
            <li> I believe it is slowing down my hair loss and my hair seems to be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slowing down my hair loss, but it seems not getting thicker in the thinning areas.  </li>
            <li> I have also tried other hair recovery supplements like Phytoworx which costed me $64.99 a bottle, and still no luck!</li>
            <li> I am noticing less hair loss, but I can&#x27;t tell that it is getting thicker in the thinning areas.  </li>
            <li> I also bleach my hair, and these vitamins have made less hair come out when I comb, because it&#x27;s stronger.  </li>
            <li> and I was just hoping I was seeing less hair in the drain...</li>
            <li> Hair is showing results; a lot less hair shedding.</li>
            <li> and I am noticing a slight difference</li>
            <li> I also noticed less hair loss while showering when I was taking these vitamins.</li>
            <li> Reccommend this product for black girls as well.</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, you may want to view the writers previous reviews.</li>
            <li> It might just be my imagination, but I think it even affected my nails slightly as well.</li>
            <li> there is less hair in my shower and on the floors.</li>
            <li> She used this product and in less than a week was convinced her hair was thicker and stronger and not falling out after showering or combing.</li>
            <li> I tried Hair Covet  because my hair loss is due to menopause, I didn&#x27;t really think it would work, but I was desperate.</li>
            <li> The lipogaine seems to slow the loss and perhaps the supplement will help strengthen in the long run.</li>
            <li> I have taken Covet hair vitamin for about 3 weeks, so far I believe it has grown faster, and maybe not falling out quite as bad, but I think it&#x27;s to soon for major difference.  </li>
            <li> Years ago  I had grown it to be a little longer than my shoulders</li>
            <li> some worked a little</li>
            <li> My hair now feels thicker and is a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Hair Covet for a little under a month</li>
            <li> Read label and Contains ginkgo and green tea.</li>
            <li> After just a few weeks of using this product I could see a difference.</li>
            <li> the last 5 years in an attempt to thicken it, I have tried at least 10 different hair vitamins - including some really expensive ones.</li>
            <li> thought about giving up, tired of wasting money after a 5-year journey of trying all different varieties of products.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks and have noticed a difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I would continue using the pills as my everyday routine.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now.  </li>
            <li> Almost all of them are oddly similar in regards to the products they purchased and it appears that the people are falsely made up.  </li>
            <li> With all due respect for buyers with negative experience, I must beg to differ.</li>
            <li> What a mess!  </li>
            <li> I had a bad experience with a stylist recently who cut my hair too short</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects, no aftertaste, stomach-ache, nausea or anything unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s with all of the fake reviews posted on the same day and when you click on the poster&#x27;s name...</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 47 and, color my hair, and have grown it almost to my past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that the number of follicles have increased, but I have stopped losing hair.</li>
            <li> and although there not many reviews at time of purchase, I still went ahead with it.</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this would work for me.</li>
            <li> not sure if that&#x27;s because of this product though).</li>
            <li> Hopefully my hair will be chest length in a few months!</li>
            <li> In addition, there are very few hair strands falling out when I shampoo my hair.</li>
            <li> It was very messy.</li>
            <li> I hardly see any hair in the bathtub when I take shower now.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I wanted to use it for at least sometime before  leaving a review .</li>
            <li> I noticed my aunt always complained about her hair getting thinner and thinner.</li>
            <li> It was patchy (even bald in some spots) thin, lifeless, and just overall a sad sight to see.</li>
            <li> My hair grows so slow</li>
            <li> I have been slowly losing my hair since 30.</li>
            <li> it seemed (I am 52 and have always had a thick head of hair).</li>
            <li> BUT NO MORE!  </li>
            <li> I have been mean to my hair.</li>
            <li> It started to get ridiculous</li>
            <li> They are hard compressed herbal material with a thin wax coating.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any negative side effects to this day.</li>
            <li> Pulling hair fall out of the shower drain catch used to be a common sight, and I found it to be quite disturbing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s no longer thinning or brittle, breaking, or any of the things I was starting to hate about it.</li>
            <li> I also would have alot of breakage when brushing and that has also decreased.</li>
            <li> the quality of my hair dramatically decreased.</li>
            <li> Very very very mean.</li>
            <li> My hair has also been slowly thinning lately and I wanted something to combat that before its gets really bad.</li>
            <li> well, it&#x27;s been difficult.</li>
            <li> and here&#x27;s the weird thing...no itchy dryness...</li>
            <li> (I mean, seriously, it had been so bad that I used to find hairs on my clothes, on my sleeves, and it used to sometimes wind up in the food when I was cooking!)  </li>
            <li> I was also noticing a lot of hair loss after getting out of the shower (very scary) and on the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - have been taking as directed and no improvement.</li>
            <li> Something in these pills messed my hair real bad.</li>
            <li> My hair has been through alot of dying and processing and i have damaged my hair horribly.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed with this product!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So, I have used a lot....did I say a lot???...I mean...a lot of hair growth products. I&#x27;ve experienced moderate to severe hair loss for the last 7-10 years and because my hair loss started in my thirties...well, it&#x27;s been difficult. I&#x27;ve been using Hair Covet for three weeks now and here&#x27;s the weird thing...no itchy dryness...at all. I have very dry scalp (probably due to the minoxidil I use religiously), this product is helping my scalp retain its natural oils so that I don&#x27;t feel like my scalp is tight and dry. I know all of this may sound strange but that&#x27;s my experience. I think Hair Covet is creating a healthy growth environment (no dryness and itchiness). I&#x27;m going to hang in there with Hair Covet. Crossing my fingers for mega growth!</li>
            <li> I bought it to try since I had nail breakage going on . It seems to work , nails stop braking and hair seems to grow faster .&lt;br /&gt;I would order this again .</li>
            <li> I have noticed a considerable decrease in the amount of hair I lose.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a Good vitamin but couldn&#x27;t understand why I wasn&#x27;t sleeping at night as I was taking at night.  Read label and Contains ginkgo and green tea. So stopped  So Can not really comment on it worked</li>
            <li> Over the last few years I have noticed that my hair wasn&#x27;t as voluminous or vibrant as it used to be. Since it wasn&#x27;t an issue until after I had my son, I chalked it up to hormonal changes.  I used to have hairdressers tell me how beautiful and thick my hair was, but recently one commented on how thin it was and recommended ridiculously expensive volumizing hair products.  I wasn&#x27;t about to spend a lot of money and effort into making my hair only appear thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research and came across Hair Covet. I read many reviews and after much consideration, I decided to give it a try. I knew that it was going to take more than a few weeks to see the results I had been hoping for.  I am now 2/3 done with my second bottle and all I can say is WOW!  I don&#x27;t even take the full dosage everyday and what a difference! My hair is fuller and shinier than it has been in years.  I know with time it&#x27;s only going to get better.  I really hope this product is never discontinued because it&#x27;s a must have for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus my nails and eyelashes are beautiful too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, be patient with it, and expect great results.</li>
            <li> product seems to be working&lt;br /&gt; hair (and nails) are going faster&lt;br /&gt;listed ingredients do support healthy hair growth</li>
            <li> I am on my third bottle of Hair Covet, and my hair feels and looks healthy.  I am noticing less hair loss, but I can&#x27;t tell that it is getting thicker in the thinning areas.  I am still hopeful that maybe it will show some regrowth, but overall, I am happy with the product.  I have tried a lot of hair vitamins, and this one actually seems to have made my hair healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this two times and so far so good.  There is no discomfort after taking pills and I definitely can tell I&#x27;m losing less hair.  Hopefully, new hair grows, too.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many hair pills from Biotin to Infinity, none seems to show me results like Hair Covet! I saw results instantly! I will stay loyal to this product. Take recommended dosages and you will be satisfied.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s with all of the fake reviews posted on the same day and when you click on the poster&#x27;s name... they all have supposedly left reviews for the same products!!! Hmmmm... SUSPICIOUS!!!!!</li>
            <li> Just started taking these to supplmeet my use of lipogaine and big 3 shampoo. What a great combination,  my hair is growing so fast and filling in so well.</li>
            <li> Great product, delivery very fast, i tried several product and this product you will see the result after a week, i had son hair lost and now i can see the difference. really happy and i will buy again.</li>
            <li> After using this for the whole bottle i can see some results, my hair is thicker and i plan on buying a few more bottles and seeing what happens after months of use.  Thanks Lipogaine!</li>
            <li> Oh thank the goddess, these actually WORK!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been a broken record about it, but my lupus and all the medication I take has caused my already fine hair to start coming out quite a bit and lose a lot of it&#x27;s (already minimal) thickness and body. I took these for a straight month and I&#x27;m honestly amazed at what this did for my locks. My hair has become thicker, bouncier and fuller. Areas that seemed to be thinning quite a bit are filling out. I&#x27;m seriously impressed with what these did for my hair. I hate to seem vain, but my long red hair has been my glory crown ever since I quit being made fun of for having red hair as a kid :-) This is making my hair look better than it did when I was actually HEALTHY! The one downside is that you have to take one with each meal (or 3 times a day) which can be hard to remember, but the results are worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for review purposes, but all opinions are 100% my own</li>
            <li> Nice product. Already noticing a difference in my hair growth.</li>
            <li> This bottle of vitamins REALLY WORKS.  I have super thin, fine hair that literally has not grown in 3 years. Years ago  I had grown it to be a little longer than my shoulders and I went to my hairdresser (normally terrific) and for some reason he decided to CUT MY HAIR. AHH!  I had told him SO many times that my hair doesn&#x27;t grow! Anyway, He cut it, and it has stayed that exact length for 3 years.  I found this vitamin bottle in February and started using right away.  Within weeks, I could SEE new growth.  My front hairline now had brand new little &amp;#34;baby bangs&amp;#34;.  The rest of my hair felt thicker and stronger.  I style my hair the same way and have had to incorporate the new hair, which is a first, and it is funny because their is a nice amount of new hair! I am 40 with 4 kids and I have NEW hair! I also bleach my hair, and these vitamins have made less hair come out when I comb, because it&#x27;s stronger.  Believe the reviews. This product rules!</li>
            <li> My wife picked these up for herself and so far so good. I had started noticing minimal hair loss about a year ago on her, and we had tried all the top brands out there.  Shampoo&#x27;s, gels, pills etc...some worked a little but then the changes stopped.  Some had no effect at all, and actually made her feel kind of sick.  These on the other hand worked efficiently and quickly.  She had no bad side-effects, no allergic reaction.  So I think so far they are doing a good job, and the progress is noticeable.</li>
            <li> My first month taking Hair Covet and I feel that the nutrients provided have boosted my energy level.  I&#x27;m trying this product under supervision of my doctor because of some health and medicine issues.  So far, I haven&#x27;t a reason not to proceed.  I have expectations that within a couple months I will begin seeing new growth as my DHT levels are lowered.  It&#x27;s so much better than using topical solutions.  I tried one for 3 months and my hair grew - but it fell out shortly after I stopped using the product.  What a mess!  What a waste of time and money!  Learning my problem was from inside - Hair Covet  was a natural selection for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle of Hair Covet and I love it. After just a few weeks of using this product I could see a difference. My hair is growing faster, has more volume and looks/feels so much healthier. I will continue to use it and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading the ingredients and figured it would be worth a shot. Not only did I see my hair fall out less after 3 weeks, I also am feeling what appears to be more new growth on my scalp after one month. I think it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> This product hair covet have good vitamins for your hair and nails it even gave me a burst of energy too. My hair and nails  have grown tremendously thank you Amazon for making it happen.</li>
            <li> I got the product for testing purposes/ for free in exchange for an honest review It works! I&#x27;ve been taking this hair growth product for a month. Very satisfied with the initial results. I&#x27;m 47 and, color my hair, and have grown it almost to my past my shoulders. When I lose hair, the hair loss is magnified because every strand is so long. Pulling hair fall out of the shower drain catch used to be a common sight, and I found it to be quite disturbing. I&#x27;d been putting up with hair loss on and off for several years, and tried a number of oral hair strengthening supplements with different ingredients to Hairsentials by Flawless Botanics. I want my hair to have more body, more shine, and to be healthier. Prior to this supplement that actually works, I had been taking a popular brand for 5 months, with no results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. I gave up on it and decided to try a recommendation, Hairsentials by Flawless Botanics supplement. It&#x27;s perfect for me. It&#x27;s reliable (as long as I am, remembering to take my capsules every day!). I wanted to reduce hair fall, and then to maintain optimum hair and scalp health, and I will definitely continue with Hairsentials by Flawless Botanics. Very pleased to finally find an effective nutritional supplement for hair, that can increase my hair health and appearance, and, as an extra, benefits my nails and skin also. Delightfully surprised by the astounding results from using this hair supplement, for example I am now experiencing only 3 - 4 strands in the drain catch! This normal amount of hair loss I can live with! Feeling this supplement is compatible with everything else in my healthy lifestyle. Relieved that there is someone out there offering a hair loss product that is creating results as quickly as this. The search is done; I found what I was looking for in this. And, great customer service, plus really good value for money. I&#x27;m 100% sold on it and recommend it to anyone looking for a safe, easy way to improve the health, quality, and attractiveness of their hair, nails, and, skin. Happy to give this 5 starstractiveness of their hair, nails, and, skin. Happy to give this 5 stars</li>
            <li> Looks promising so far!</li>
            <li> So far, I haven&#x27;t been taking them consistently.&lt;br /&gt;I will take one a day.. I have noticed HEALTHY, STRONG, THICK, FULL hair.&lt;br /&gt;The hair of my dreams! So I am now taking more regularly to get the best results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A must-try to all the skeptics!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product! After only a week of using it I noticed my hair was thicker and more full (my friends noticed too!). Will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a month and can already see a difference. My hair looks healthier and has grown a bit. I have to say that even my nails have been growing faster. I love this product and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely because I was looking for a hair loss remedy.  Not that I am going bald, but I must be going down that path because I find so much of my hair in the drain trap after every shower.  (Rule in the house is that everyone cleans the trap after a shower). More and more, year after year:(  Well....after using this product for a few weeks I have seen an incredible difference.  At first I thought it was a fluke and I was just hoping I was seeing less hair in the drain...but it has been consistent!  Barely any hair at all anymore!  I really can&#x27;t believe that something is going on in my scalp that is helping my hair from falling out!  Now that it&#x27;s not falling out, it&#x27;s certainly going to get longer:)</li>
            <li> Hair is showing results; a lot less hair shedding. Saw results in the first three weeks</li>
            <li> I have taken Covet hair vitamin for about 3 weeks, so far I believe it has grown faster, and maybe not falling out quite as bad, but I think it&#x27;s to soon for major difference.  I will purchase a few more bottles because I do feel it&#x27;s a good vitamin for hair.</li>
            <li> Free product provided for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say that this works to regrow hair.  I&#x27;ve only taken it 3 weeks, and these are my observations based on that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This formula is that of a multi-vitamin with herbal support for good hair, skin, and nail growth.  I notice that some of these herbs are anti-androgens and are said to promote hair growth.  I do like taking this formula- it gives me some extra pep and I&#x27;ve overall done well on it.&lt;br /&gt;As far as hair growth, it&#x27;s too early to say really.  It does have 5000u of Biotin in it, and I know that works well, and my nails are growing incredibly fast and are quite strong.  The only change I&#x27;ve really noticed on my scalp is that it seems a tad bit more oily now, but it had been dry, so I see this as a positive.  It&#x27;s not much, but I&#x27;ve just noticed a slight uptick in oiliness at my roots; like when I was much younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dosage is 3 a day.  They are hard compressed herbal material with a thin wax coating.  There is no taste that I can discern.  Each tab is yellowish, and slightly larger than a OTC pain reliever.  They aren&#x27;t huge though, they are easy for me to swallow..I&#x27;ve had no negative side effects, no aftertaste, stomach-ache, nausea or anything unpleasant.  They do increase my urination a bit, I&#x27;m sure because of the Vitamin B6 in them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also noticed slight yellow discoloration of urine and stool, which is to be expected from the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking Biotin for my hair and nails for over a year now with noticeable improvement. This product performs in a whole different way. It&#x27;s loaded with whole lines of intentional nutrients that create a prescription for hair growth designed for women.  As you age you quickly find out how important the metals are. Their in here as well. When I was younger I used to be blessed with very think head of hair but for the past few years it&#x27;s been going down the drain. Not only am I seeing less hair in my hands when I shampoo and condition but it&#x27;s increased the production in my eyebrows. I was provided a sample to try and test as a consumer for review purposes and the results are impressive. An added plus is that it&#x27;s made in America and is reasonably priced. Great product!</li>
            <li> I have just finished my first bottle of Lipogaine Hair Covet and already notice a difference in the growth of my hair and even my eyelashes!  This product is excellent!  Nourishing your hair, skin and nails from the inside out makes sense, especially as we age.  There is only so much topical products can do - but Hair Covet has made my hair visibly healthier, shinier and has definitely made it grow faster.  Much to my surprise, I have also noticed thicker and longer eyelashes. I highly recommend this product to enhance overall healthy hair, and as a great addition to your arsenal of anti-aging products to keep hair looking and feeling healthy.  This is a supplement that I will never be without.</li>
            <li> It works!! my hair is no longer falling out.  I&#x27;ve was using a more expensive hair loss pill i saw endorsed by Dr. Oz, but it just stopped working.  I tried Hair Covet  because my hair loss is due to menopause, I didn&#x27;t really think it would work, but I was desperate. Hooray, my hair Has definitely  stopped falling out and I have new growth.  I am purchasing my 6th bottle, and being a thrifty person that says everything. Lets face it, menopause sucks, but having your hair fall out is just too much to handle.  I hope you buy it because it really works.  God bless</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 and my hair is not what it used to be. It&#x27;s definitely thinner than it used to be and breaks off easily. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a month and I am noticing a slight difference I guess you really need to use a supplement like this for at least 3 months before you see any real results.</li>
            <li> My hair loss has significantly reduced as I suffer from PCOS so I always have to struggle with my hair but this product is really helping in reducing the hair loss maybe if I use it for few more months then it will help me in hair regrowth fingers crossed!</li>
            <li> This has great ratings, that&#x27;s why I bought it. I didn&#x27;t try it because it has folic acid. My body cannot metabolize folic acid.  Folic acid is a man made substance,  it&#x27;s not organic. Frea is the real version of  &amp;#34;folic acid&amp;#34;.  In the description it did not list folic acid, so I thought I was safe when I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This product (Hair Covet) is the most amazing thing!!  I&#x27;m 62 and I have long hair (a bit gray under the red haircolor, lol.)  It has always been thin, and fine.  For the last few years, I HAD BEEN increasingly losing my hair.  The little bunch in the shower drain, more when I wet combed, then more in my hair brush after my hair was dry.  It started to get ridiculous and I realized one day that I could see my scalp far more than I ever had.  I panicked and went to Amazon to try to find a product to help me.  I ordered Hair Covet, and after one bottle, I noticed that not only was my hair not falling out as it had been, but I saw little hairs (about a half inch long) growing on the top of my head, near my part.  In the sunlight I looked like a porcupine, lol, but I knew that once they got longer, they&#x27;d lay down.  During the second bottle, I was hard pressed to find a hair in my hair brush, and NONE in the shower drain, and NONE when I wet combed!!  My hair is coming back in beautifully and I&#x27;m not losing more than 2-3 hairs a day, which is completely normal!  (I mean, seriously, it had been so bad that I used to find hairs on my clothes, on my sleeves, and it used to sometimes wind up in the food when I was cooking!)  BUT NO MORE!  I couldn&#x27;t be any more pleased with this product.  It&#x27;s wonderful, and I will continue to take it forever!  I truly believe it has helped my nails as well.  Love it!  If you are losing your hair, trust me and give this product a try.  You&#x27;ll be glad you did, for sure!</li>
            <li> I have been using Hair Covet for almost 2 months now and I can definitely see a  decrease in my hair LOSS.  I&#x27;m starting to see tiny New hairs around my temples.  This is very exciting to see as I have used many other hair vitimans with no luck.  I will continue to use Hair Covet - I can&#x27;t wait to see how much hair I have in another couple months.... the reason I gave 4 stars is because I have only used it not even 2 months.  I will rate this again at 4 months ( I bet it gets 5 stars then ) my money is on Hair Covet ~~~ thank you !!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair has always taken forever to grow. I tried a couple supplements. Didn&#x27;t really see results until I tried Hair Covet. Very happy with the results!</li>
            <li> As a skeptic,I purchased this supplement not expecting any major results. I have tried many products to help with the loss and thinning of my hair but nothing has worked quite as well as Hair Covet has. I have seen a major result in new hair growth! I am anticipating what the long term results will be :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a much happier woman now, and I Highly Recommend this supplement!</li>
            <li> Thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my friend after she has been using Lipogaine for a couple weeks.  Looking at the ingredients there are a lot of proven vitamins and some herbs that remain a mystery. She however was willing to take the supplement in conjunction with Lipogaine to see if the combination would be more impactful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a month in she reported that her nails seem to be growing faster but nothing with her hair yet. The lipogaine seems to slow the loss and perhaps the supplement will help strengthen in the long run. Only time will tell…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this is a good supplement to try as a preventive method and to aid a topical treatment.  Of course you need to give it a good 6 months to see how your body reacts. Hope this helps, sample provided for reviewing.</li>
            <li> I am a 53-year-old woman who has thinning hair. My hair was getting noticeably thinner in the classic female balding pattern just like my mother&#x27;s did as she aged. Not only was there fewer strands of hair, but my hair was finer, the hair shaft was getting smaller as well. I&#x27;ve been using Hair Covet for over a year. When I run my fingers through my hair, it feels like the thick head of hair that I had when I was younger. I&#x27;m not sure that the number of follicles have increased, but I have stopped losing hair. And the thicker shafts help to cover the thinning areas. I wish I had started taking this product years ago. This product has made my hair healthier. You do have to take it for several months before you see a difference, because hair grows slowly. In order to be completely transparent, I did receive compensation for this review in form of a free bottle of product, but I this review is sincere non the less. I use this product and recommend it for women who have thinning hair.</li>
            <li> Pardon me as I have never done this before, writing review(s) is just not my thing -but I am making an exception this time to recommend a product that truly did wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am a mother of 4, at age 49 and noticed significant hair loss and breakage which I found really bothersome.  I have tried over the counter women&#x27;s Rogaine and applied it religiously on my problem area (top of head where my bangs begin), but no such luck! I have also tried other hair recovery supplements like Phytoworx which costed me $64.99 a bottle, and still no luck! My hair continued to fall and break to an extent that it would be all over the tub as I washed and/or combed my hair! It was also be all over the ground around my bedroom and living room. My hair was feeling thinner and thinner by the day.&lt;br /&gt;I found hair covet by chance searching trough amazon and although there not many reviews at time of purchase, I still went ahead with it. I am glad I made that purchase!!! I now see an improvement in the way my hair looks and feels! In addition, there are very few hair strands falling out when I shampoo my hair. I also no longer see fallen hair dominating my living space! Plus, I now see baby hair growing!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you! Thank you! I recommend this product with no reservations! It truly gave me back my confidence : )</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now and have had amazing results. My hair feels much thicker and healthier and I would highly recommend Hair Covet. My hair has been thinning quite a bit over the last 6 months and this has really helped!!! Hope you will have success with it as well!</li>
            <li> Great product. Finishing up my first bottle soon. Hair is getting stronger and longer. Hair even strengthening and growing in trouble spots (top of my head more toward the back) and edges. My nails are also growing very long and strong. Will buy the second bottle very soon. 49 yr old black female.</li>
            <li> Hair Covet is the supplement I&#x27;ve been looking for. After taking it for a couple of weeks, my hair is noticeably healthy, my skin is more subtle and my mood is brighter. I will continue to take this product in the future. Can&#x27;t imagine not using it !</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using Hair Covet that long, maybe about a month or so, so it hasn&#x27;t been long enough to see a lot of benefit yet, but I do feel that the condition of my hair has improved since I started using the product.  My hair texture used to feel dry and straw-like, but it&#x27;s feeling more smooth and soft.  I plan to continue using Hair Covet for at least a few more months to see if it helps with the thinning hair I have on top of my head.  As I mentioned, it&#x27;s too early yet to decide if it&#x27;s helping with that, but I will say I haven&#x27;t noticed as much hair falling out as I used to see, so for that reason alone I believe Hair Covet is helping, and I plan on continuing to use it.</li>
            <li> I took this supplement for a month straight. My hair now feels thicker and is a little bit longer. By no means is this an overnight success story but if you take these and keep with them then you will definitely start seeing some results. I also noticed less hair loss while showering when I was taking these vitamins.</li>
            <li> I was told they are not that great, and was told there are better products</li>
            <li> This product is actually really good. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it to be but it was. I do a lot of coloring to my hair so it&#x27;s pretty damaged, so I needed something to help nutrient my hair and this product works well. My New growth feels immaculate and it&#x27;s growing strong. I&#x27;ve hair braids for this whole summer and you could see my New growth quickly. Reccommend this product for black girls as well.</li>
            <li> I use this product with lipogaine for women. It works great for me. I lost a lot of hair after I had my baby. I took some biotin and One-A-Day multi-vitamin without much result. I saw significant improvement after I took this vitamin with lipogaine for women for three months. Now my hair looks almost the same as before my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I am truly amazed at the results from Hair Covet. I am a 40 year old mother of 3 boys. I noticed my hair thinning in the mid-line and at the temples 5 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the last 5 years in an attempt to thicken it, I have tried at least 10 different hair vitamins - including some really expensive ones. All of the vitamins made my hair grow longer, but none of them stopped my hair loss or prompted new hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across Hair Covet completely by accident. There were no reviews on this product when I made my first order, but I decided to give it a try as the ingredients looked promising and price was right. Without any customer reviews to go on, I had no idea that this product would work to help me regrow hair. Although, I will admit, to say that I chose this product completely by accident is probably not true. Before purchasing Hair Covet, I had tried many hair regrowth vitamins and I had also read a lot of different articles and studies about the best formulas for hair regrowth. From my research, I found the ingredients in this product to a combination of everything I had read about as being effective for hair regrowth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WOW! I am glad that I tried Hair Covet. Since I started using it, I have unbelievable new growth across my entire scalp. Not only has my hair&#x27;s mid-line completely filled in, but the hair all over my head is getting fuller and thicker. My hair is also noticeably growing much faster than before. And this is only after I finished my second bottle!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought about giving up, tired of wasting money after a 5-year journey of trying all different varieties of products. Nothing was working for me! I am so glad that I came across this Hair Covet - it has truly worked wonders for me. I highly recommend this product to anyone who is in search of a vitamin that effectively stops and reverses hair loss, or simply wants to grow hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will this product work for everyone? I cannot say with confidence, as causes for hair loss are different from person to person. If your hair loss is a result of genetics, meaning the hair loss runs through your family, then Lipogaine for Women is probably be the best choice because it has minoxidil, the only drug approved by the FDA for treating genetic hair loss. If your hair loss has been caused by something other than genetics, Hair Covet may be your bet, because it covers a broad range of ingredients to help people with hair loss issue due to nutrient, vitamin, and immune system deficiencies and also hair loss caused by stress or from pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice thing about this product is that it is 100% satisfaction guaranteed or you can get your money back. So you really have absolutely nothing to lose by trying this product. And believe me, if you are losing your hair like I was, then you will try anything.  Try something that actually works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using Hair Covet vitamin for only one month, but i have already notice the  difference.  My hair loss is almost completely stopped. I used to see lot of hair in the drain when I took a shower. Now it is almost none. I am going to take this vitamin for 3 months to see if it will make my hair as full as 4 years ago. I will report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product seems also help grow my hair much faster. I had a bad experience with a stylist recently who cut my hair too short and I really missed my long hair. Thankfully, my hair is growing super fast and it should be back to the length it was very quickly. Bottom line, this stuff is awesome and really does work!</li>
            <li> After taking two bottles I have seen some, but minimal hair growth. My nails do seem to be stronger. I will continue with my second bottle before I decide if it is worth continuing with this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is thinning at the hairline. I made sure that I went and had my hair trimmed before starting the supplement so I would know if there was a difference.  I have been taking this Hair Growth Supplement for a month.  I can see a difference in the fullness of my hair and the elasticity with fewer spilt end damage.  I have new growth and my hair texture feels healthier.</li>
            <li> This was recommended by a friend and I have not been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has drastically improved my hair quality and has stopped my hair from thinning since having my baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has it stopped me from losing any more hair, but the nutrients must be strengthening it because it is shinier and healthy than ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It has been almost 3 months using this product. I started seeing the difference from the 3rd week of using it 2 times a day with meals.It made my hair healthier , I could actually see a difference in the volume and texture. I feel the density and thickness . I would recommend this product , it did work for me . I wanted to use it for at least sometime before  leaving a review . Now since it has been about three month i can confidently say that it works wonders.</li>
            <li> this product truly helped my hair from thinning. Before I ordered this product I went through 2 bottles of Hair Rush made by Ultrax Labs, paying $50 each. But since it was over priced I decided to give Hair Covet a try. Boy, I am so glad that I made that decision!! I love this product so much more than Hair Rush and it is priced much more reasonable. My hair is getting fuller than ever and looks healthier. I am about to finish up my 2nd bottle. Thank you Hair Covet for saving my hair from falling out so much I had to use hair piece or wide hair band to cover my balding spots. But now I only have to use very little dark brown hair filler to camouflage.</li>
            <li> am very pleased with this product my hair has more shine and looks healthier and fuller</li>
            <li> This product is really great! I have been using it for a few weeks and have noticed a difference in my hair. I felt that my hair was falling out more than usual and so I did some research and came across this product and it has just the right amount of all the vitamins I need because my hair is doing so much better. I am glad I purchased these and will continue to use it. I really do recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love this item it works and I can see results right away, I have tried many other products and this is the best.</li>
            <li> This product is pretty good, I am buying this again because, it’s just offering up some solid results. My hair was becoming unusually dry and almost felt brittle on the ends- until I started this product.  This product just works! I am sure it’s all about the 37 ingredients that are just good for a woman’s hair. Biotin is a mainstay and I have always resorted to going back to it. This supplement just packs it in. It actually has provided nutrients I am lacking in my diet, which aid in my hair growth.&lt;br /&gt;I’m also doing all of the precautionary measures that other women advise in hair care videos, like co-washing, limited brushing, no heat applied to my head(outside of a heating cap with hot oil once a month) and I sleep with a hair wrap. My hair is absolutely fuller and ends to root my hair is thicker per strand(yea,I pay way too much time examining my hair). When my hair was breaking at the ends  all I could do was pin it up. I was discouraged and down about the condition my hair was in. I’m happy with the product, and I also know everyone’s hair is unique to their chemical make up. What works on one persons dry brittle hair may or may not work better on another person’s similar hair structure. This is why I tried it myself. It’s working for me, and that’s what is important.</li>
            <li> So far so good - I think my hair has grown a bit more, and this definitely doesn&#x27;t hurt! I plan to keep using it and see if my hair continues to improve.</li>
            <li> This is product has all the vitamins you need to get your hair growing.  My hair grows so slow and I have to take biotin to grow it out.  The only things I do not like about this product is that I have to take 3 pills and (TMI alert) they turn my pee really bright yellow.  I will update my review when I finish the bottle to give a more detailed review but, so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;Sample Provided</li>
            <li> I was hopeful that it will work after reading so many good reviews and decided to give a try. No....lost more hair. It didn&#x27;t work so I returned the product and requested a refund.</li>
            <li> I seen results in a matter of weeks. I have been using these for about 5months now and I have noticed a major improvement in my hair. My hair is finally going thick and long. My hair is shiny and strong with very little breakage. Overall my hair looks amazingly healthy.</li>
            <li> Something in these pills messed my hair real bad. But again,it may work for some people but not me. I went back to the devil I know, Natrol&#x27;s Biotin 10,000 mg maximum strength.</li>
            <li> Hi I purchase hair growth hair loss I love it my hair doesn&#x27;t fall out anymore I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I was not sure if this would work for me. I ordered one bottle and finished it. I let ordering another to see the different. Yes, there was a different. Now I am on my second bottle and it works. It makes my hair ( which is very thin ) look so much better and seems full. I would continue using the pills as my everyday routine.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> I have been mean to my hair. Very very very mean. I&#x27;ve dyed it, cut it, razored it, chopped it all off for locks of love (after a year of nothing to my hair), burnt it, fried it, bleached it, let it go wild almost to dreadlocks status, and now it is recovering from pregnancy. Yes recovering, for some reason after pregnancy even if I continue prenatal vitamins my hair falls out by the hand full and I mean I go from luscious thick hair to thin and brittle, barely able to be put into a pony tail hair because it just cuts off wherever I tie it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product brought back my hair to the point of awesomeness! Seriously my husband has mentioned many times that it looks so alive, that I can roll out of bed now and it looks like I planned it to look the way it does. It&#x27;s no longer thinning or brittle, breaking, or any of the things I was starting to hate about it. It&#x27;s full of a ton of great ingredients and nothing in it has caused any issues with me at all. Top notch stuff, getting ready to dye my hair soon and glad I&#x27;m taking this because it&#x27;ll help keep it at it&#x27;s healthiest!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a free product for a review. My opinions are 100% honest and my own.**</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products and supplements for hair growth, and any of them really gave me real and positive results but Hair Covet really works.&lt;br /&gt;I could see positive results in the first week of use. This supplement is awesome. Now my hair is growing fast and fuller.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a &amp;#34;hair and nails&amp;#34; supplement and this has what I want plus so much more!  I have been very pleased so far and definitely will continue to use it for a long time!</li>
            <li> this have been giving energy as well.  noticed the nails are getting stronger also..</li>
            <li> Before buying this product, you may want to view the writers previous reviews. Almost all of them are oddly similar in regards to the products they purchased and it appears that the people are falsely made up.  These are not legitimate so beware.</li>
            <li> Bought this for a family member who recently experienced accelerated hairloss. Within two weeks, the shedding seemed to stop completely, as there was no longer any hair in the shower drain. Reordered without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I have been taking this product now for approx. 3 weeks and although I have not seen much result in the growth department (as it takes more than 3 weeks to see this kind of result) I have notice a VERY significant change in the amount of hair loss and my hair feels much more healthy. I would always wash my hair and have large amounts of hair come out ... I now have barely a strand come out. I also would have alot of breakage when brushing and that has also decreased. My hair has been through alot of dying and processing and i have damaged my hair horribly. I would most certainly recommend this product to anyone who like myself is concerned about thinning hair or damaged hair. I am very satisfied with my purchase and will definately purchase again to keep this up and write another update review on the growth portion. You will not be disappointed with this product!!</li>
            <li> I like the vitamins so far, purchased only one bottle, 10 more days to go to finish. Its pricey but i believe im noticing results! My hairs growing &amp; my skin looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I recently ombred my hair so my awkward transition from short to long hair is a bit more tolerable. I bleached most of my hair 3 times and the ends 5 times so the quality of my hair dramatically decreased. My hair has also been slowly thinning lately and I wanted something to combat that before its gets really bad. I wanted a product to help me grow quality hair faster and maintain the hair that I already had. After tons of scrolling through amazon and comparing different supplements I decided to go with this one. It had great reviews and in comparison to other supplements the pricing was much better for my wallet. I&#x27;ve been using Hair Covet for a little under a month and I can already see some hair growth! When I run my fingers through my scalp I feel tiny baby hairs/stubble-esque hairs growing!! I also noticed the ends of my hair have been looking less damaged recently (not sure if that&#x27;s because of this product though). Yay for progress. Hopefully my hair will be chest length in a few months!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed - have been taking as directed and no improvement. I will be requesting a refund.</li>
            <li> I noticed my aunt always complained about her hair getting thinner and thinner. Being the awesome nephew that I am, I bought her this hair covert. At first she was a little upset at me because she thought I was poking fun at her. But a month later she sent me a text thanking me for my gift. She was really happy with  the results. Her hair is starting to look thicker, and she also reported that hair fallls are lessen for about 90%. Skimmed through the active ingredients of the product, and it has all of the important ingredients for hair regrowth. An all in one hair product, would definitely recommend :)</li>
            <li> I have been slowly losing my hair since 30. I have tried many products. I tried Rogaine. It was very messy. I tried Bosely, only found it was the same as Rogaine. I tried Vitamins for hair from GNC store, it didn&#x27;t do anything other than making my nail growing much faster usual. I also tried many hair stimulating shampoos. They didn&#x27;t work either. I din&#x27;t expect much from this product when I bought it 3 months ago. I bought it because the price was reasonable and the ingredients look very impressive. Three months later, my hair is much healthier and fuller than before. I hardly see any hair in the bathtub when I take shower now.&lt;br /&gt;I truly believe this product. I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I cannot say for sure but it seems like it is helping. I will continue to use it for at least one more purchase.</li>
            <li> So far I am very satisfied with this supplement. My hair feels stronger and healthier, and while I cannot say if it can regrow hair, my hair does feel fuller. This supplement is good for anyone who wants longer hair/quick growth or someone suffering from vitamin difficiency/avoidable hair loss since it contains many beneficial ingredients (proven to help hair growth) such as biotin, nettle leaf, saw palmetto, and vitamins B-6 and B-12. I think this supplement helps to prevent genetic hair loss, but obviously there is no cure.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for a few months now. I believe it is slowing down my hair loss and my hair seems to be thicker.&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;s working well enough that I plan to keep using it.</li>
            <li> I came upon this product and am so pleased with the results.  Since taking it I can actually see that my hair has grown an inch in a month! I am almost 50 and am dying to get my hair length back to where it was 10 years ago.  I sincerely believe I can do it with the help of this product!</li>
            <li> I been taking it for about 2weeks and I can already notice a difference :)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now.  It&#x27;s slowing down my hair loss, but it seems not getting thicker in the thinning areas.  I wish I could have seen some hair regrowth. Before I can find a better product, I will continue using it as this is the most helpful product that I have found so far.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t finished the first bottle yet, but I&#x27;m already seeing results. I&#x27;ve seen a major change in my nails. They&#x27;re no longer cracking and peeling. I&#x27;m also beginning to see some baby hair sprouting along my hairline. The good thing about Hair Covet is that it&#x27;s a multi-vitamin as well as a hair growth formula so it helps all around. I&#x27;m actually feeling more energetic which is a HUGE plus since I have two young children. I plan on continuing daily use of this product! I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Due to affordability issues, I stopped taking the vitamin and my hair began falling at a fast rate. It makes sense since your body eventually expels any remnants of the vitamins and reacts to the lack of these vitamins. I wish they were more affordable. They definitely do work, though... but they have to be taken long-term/indefinitely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE2: Started taking Hair Covet once again. I couldn&#x27;t deal with the hair loss! It&#x27;s been two months and I&#x27;m sprouting hair all over the place. This really does work. And I only take two pills a day instead of three!</li>
            <li> I have been using Hair Covet along with Lipogaine for Women: Minoxidil Enhanced with Biotin and Vitamin for Thinning Hair Loss / Hair Regrowth Treatment Professionally Formulated Extra Strength Version, 60 ml/2oz for the last month.  I am giddy with the results!! First, my hair feels thicker, it&#x27;s definitely longer!&lt;br /&gt;I decided to stop coloring my hair, because I am so impatient I cut my hair super short (Jamie Lee Curtis short!) Both my hairdresser and myself are amazed at how fast my hair is growing!! HOLY MOLY!! I already need a trim!!! In just 3 weeks!??!&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels healthy! Looks shiny, it&#x27;s fuller and it&#x27;s growing fast!! If I was still coloring my hair I would say I am way beyond a root touch up phase!&lt;br /&gt;Take 3 pills a day with a meal. These are a rather large hard pill (not a capsule) but I haven&#x27;t had any problems swallowing them. If large pills are a problem for you I think you could easily cut them in half with a pill splitter.&lt;br /&gt;I am thoroughly impressed!! These WORK!!! I am so thankful to have been given a bottle to try for the purpose of this review. AWESOME product!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews from other users saying that it works for them &amp; how satisfied they were, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve only used for a month &amp; I see that a particular spot on my head where I had less hair seems to be filling in not so thin anymore. So far so good will keep trying it.The best product I&#x27;ve used so far. Thanks</li>
            <li> Thanks Hair Covet&lt;br /&gt;After years of dying, and several extensions I practically destroyed my hair. It was patchy (even bald in some spots) thin, lifeless, and just overall a sad sight to see. I thought about wearing a wig and just letting it grow out complete but that could take years to happen. I needed help with my hair and needed it fast, I knew vitamins were a perfect fit since I am vegan, I don’t get all the nutrients my hair needs from plants. A friend told me about Hair Covet and I quickly bought a 90-day supply, taking them was so easy and affordable! After 4 months my hair has grown 7 INCHES! I’m never dying my hair, or putting extension in ever again. My hair looks great! Thanks Hair Covet!!!!</li>
            <li> I am really surprised with this product. The only reason I bought it in the first place and decided to give it a try was the money back guarantee and the reduced price. But after two months of using this supplement, my hair has actually become noticeably thicker and looks healthier. It might just be my imagination, but I think it even affected my nails slightly as well. I have not experienced any negative side effects to this day. I will definitely continue to use this and strongly recommend this to anyone with hair problems.</li>
            <li> I never trusted some advertisements that I see often until I saw this one of Hair Covet and decided to give a try on my thinning hair. Since I started applying this supplement, I have recommended it to most of my friends who just stop to touch my hair as others ask the secret behind my thick, strong, long and healthier hair. Hair Covet works perfect as just described and the outcomes are worth satisfying and is also pocket friendly. It is a five star product definitely.</li>
            <li> Did not prevent hair loss, did make hair grown rapidly.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a month now- there is less hair in my shower and on the floors. That&#x27;s a PLUS!  Since we tend to not wait to see results and move on to the next product I want to use it for 3 months to see if there is a solid result. I will post again in 3 months.</li>
            <li> Wanted to finish 1st bottle before reviewing this product.  I am very pleased and encouraged with the lack if fall out that I have experience while using this product.  I have just ordered my next bottle and am glad I found this supplement.</li>
            <li> I can see a different in my hair it&#x27;s more full already!!!!</li>
            <li> I can honestly say this product works. I have struggled with hair loss for five years and only recently been working with products that inhibit dht. For the past three months this is the only product I have used. Two months after using it I noticed a significant decline in shedding. Now, it doesn&#x27;t regrow hair, but it seemed to stabilize the amount of shedding. I highly recommend trying this product for at least three months to see if shedding decreases.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife as she was distressed about  her hair loss especially after showering and the hair left in the bath and after combing as it was attached to the comb. She used this product and in less than a week was convinced her hair was thicker and stronger and not falling out after showering or combing. we now buy this regularly so she does not run out.</li>
            <li> I received these vitamins to try out. People are different and for me, these vitamins did not drastically make my hair grow longer. They did help my hair grow thicker and healthier, but I don&#x27;t think my hair grew any faster than it normally does. I think they are good vitamins. I have very kinky, curly hair. Since taking the vitamins, the texture of my new growth has become more manageable.  Also I have less shedding than I normally do. You have to be consistent with taking them and make sure you drink plenty of water. Also have patience. They aren&#x27;t miracle pills but they do help your hair to become healthier. It you take care of your hair properly, i.e. using less heat, keeping it moisturized, etc., your hair will definitely grow and retain length.</li>
            <li> I am a male in mid 30s with thinning hair and receding line. I started buying this supplement when it had only four reviews. Best thing I&#x27;ve ever done for my hair. I am using this along with Every Man&#x27;s Jack 2 in 1 Thickening Shampoo, and I can&#x27;t help but see positive results. I wear quite short hair and sometimes have bad habit of pulling on my frontal (forehead) hairline (basically to see how many hair give up). Since using Hair Covet along with the aforementioned shampoo I failed to see any if only single hair come off at times. This is compared to pretty frightening patches of hair that came out before. With all due respect for buyers with negative experience, I must beg to differ. Hope the price stays the same (or lower ;o).</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as I was noticing thinning around my temples and my bangs were getting thinner it seemed (I am 52 and have always had a thick head of hair). I was also noticing a lot of hair loss after getting out of the shower (very scary) and on the bathroom floor. I thought I would give these pills a try to see if it would help. Well I can honestly say after the first bottle that I am not losing anywhere near as much hair when coming out of the shower and I just started to notice a tiny bit of fine hairs show up at my scalp line. I will definitely be purchasing another bottle!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Seems to have darkened or eliminated the grey that was coming in.</li>
            <li> My husband bought me this amazing product and I highly recommend it. I have tried many products but nothing worked until Hair Covet. The results can be appreciated in less than a month.</li>
            <li> Great product! I have very fine hair and the medication I use makes it very thin and I have tried several different supplements to help restore my hair. I tried viviscal but didn’t see any results and its very pricey so I kept searching for another solution and found Hair Covet.  I have only been using it for about 3 weeks now and while it’s too soon to notice any growth I have noticed that my hair is super shiny. I also noticed an unexpected side effect of this product that is like a little bonus...energy!!! I have lots of energy when I take this supplement! It’s packed full of vitamins so that is probably the explanation for the energy boost but I like that this helps my hair and gives me energy. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
