            <li>It arrived on time and smells so great!</li>
            <li>this is the perfect way.</li>
            <li>Very good incense sticks.</li>
            <li>Aroma is very pleasant and fills the room very nicely.  </li>
            <li>A great deal but too a bit \\&quot;un-natural\\&quot; for me.  </li>
            <li>like this a lot for summer and fall use, and it is a great change of pace.  </li>
            <li>The product is so nice!  </li>
            <li>Really pleasant, a bit perfume like</li>
            <li>a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>While the incense smells good, it does not smell like forest or any tree.</li>

            <li>so my apologies to not be able to review the item, tho if it is HEM ( my favorite) there is a very good chance that you will be happy with the product if you receive it:)</li>
            <li>Fantastic - Love the tubes - great for gifts!  </li>
            <li>Love the smell!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>arrived on time, in good shape, and I have enjoyed hem through the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It makes a nice calming scent for the home.</li>
            <li>This gives a nice forest musk.  </li>
            <li>This incense burns well, and has a light, pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower a room.</li>
            <li>Nice scent that is not so overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>what I liked best is it&#x27;s obviously not just pine</li>
            <li>This is a very light forest smell.</li>
            <li>Pleasant clean smell and easy on the senses.</li>
            <li>Easy to light and smells good.</li>
            <li>Smells OK.  </li>
            <li>It has displaced Daigen-Koh Rosewood as my favorite, but please do try that too if you like HEM Forest.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, however, if you love the scent it did fill two rooms with its aroma.  </li>
            <li>I bought a mix of scents, thinking I would like them all, but this incense is my favorite.</li>
            <li>It is incense, what more can be said?</li>
            <li>It is better than cheaper versions.</li>
            <li>Love this incense and have reordered it a number of times.</li>
            <li>more words</li>
            <li>more words required.</li>
            <li>burns fine..smells much better after lighting.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and what it does to make my home smell relaxing and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Smells good and good for praying early in the morning.</li>
            <li>and we can smell this throughout without it being overwhelming at the source.  </li>
            <li>More of a Pine forest however.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this for the holidays!</li>
            <li>I purchased it while ago love the smell of it.</li>
            <li>I shelved the rest except for First Rain, which doesn&#x27;t remind me of rain, yet is pleasant, nonetheless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great incense if that particular scent is what you&#x27;re looking for.  </li>
            <li>the fragrance is woodsy with a touch of floral, perfect for Freshening the house in the summer with the windows closed and air conditioning on!  </li>
            <li>Not quite as sharp though but totally perfect.</li>
            <li>Oh wow man, like the smile on a cat this will bless you with the peace of kindness, very good karma</li>
            <li>Smells woodsy not too strong, just a mellow scent.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a pretty good deal on very nice incense.  </li>
            <li>This is our favorite, but there are still many other great scents from HEM.</li>
            <li>Burned fine but will not recommend.</li>
            <li>It smells like cheap men&#x27;s colonge.</li>
            <li>&quot; It is very relaxing to burn this anytime of the day and leave such a wonderful fragrance in your home.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just as good as hem brand garden of flowers and wild orchids.</li>
            <li>These incense get great reviews for a reason - they lack the irksome chemical smell of many other incense.  </li>
            <li>Of the bunch of these that I bought, these have the nicest scent and are most consistent in lighting and burning.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li>At first whiff, I was convinced that I loved this scent, but within seconds, I started to get the vivid scent of men&#x27;s cologne.  </li>
            <li>I know it can&#x27;t recreate a true scent of the forest, but it takes me there.</li>
            <li>This incense was better then real pine by every means.</li>
            <li>you need something sweet but not a lot.</li>
            <li>actually not a bad incense.</li>
            <li>I like this smell, it&#x27;s not too strong and it reminds me of being outside which is nice.</li>
            <li>A nice on the nose foresty scent that is pleasant and not like the heavy scent of so many other incenses</li>
            <li>Earthy and fun.</li>
            <li>Pretty and sweet.  </li>
            <li>If you use this product, have a vacuum handy.  </li>
            <li>I am ranking them by strength of smell because Moon is very light and Sun is right in the middle, with a significant strength, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Mellow and subtle, HEM Forest incense is refreshing and reminds me of campfires in the summer and good times shared around the fireplace in the winter.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like being in the forest around the pine trees.</li>
            <li>just burned my first one from the package..</li>
            <li>first time with hem incense, didn&#x27;t care for the scent reminded us of an overpowering laundromat smell.  </li>
            <li>The sticks are strong and lightens very properly.</li>
            <li>Really like this brand a lot.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really need to know much about this before ordering it because the name of the incense explains it \\&quot;Forest\\</li>
            <li>It just doesn&#x27;t smell very &amp;#34;forest-y&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>why settle for the scent of one tree for Christmas when you can have a whole forest?</li>
            <li>It did have a nice burn though, it definately left a haze of smoke, needed to open a window to remove it.</li>
            <li>They do smell good but they are hard to light; need to be lit several times; spark when burning; and burn all too fast compared to other Hem products I use (Cedar &amp; Precious Lavender).</li>
            <li>I love this incense, as the other buyers stated there is no smoke odor</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>Have used many incense; these do not burn clean and leave strings behind.</li>
            <li>Long lasting smells and just really refreshing to come home to.</li>
            <li>Nice scent and saves money and prevents me from buying incense at icky liquor stores or neon-bright &#x27;head shops&#x27;</li>
            <li>To me it smells like a strong aftershave used heavily by a man who can not smell very well anymore.</li>
            <li>The Moon &amp; Forest incense sticks were purchased at the same time and neither will light nor burn properly.</li>
            <li>With Sun and Moon smelling so much more natural, I would have expected the same out of this one, but I didn&#x27;t quite get that...</li>
            <li>A bit milder scent than I expected from Hem but not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Forest is the one that  I consider to be &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; as far as the three scents go...</li>
            <li>They smell natural and leave a nice lingering scent behind.  </li>
            <li>Makes me think I&#x27;m still a hippie in the 60&#x27;s, and not an old man in the 2nd millennium teens.</li>
            <li>Between forest and moon, I don&#x27;t really need any other scents.</li>
            <li>I would suspect if anyone tried out a few of them at random, they would be happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and I have to go with the low rating because they&#x27;re pretty useless if they don&#x27;t light and burn properly.</li>

            <li> and I have to go with the low rating because they&#x27;re pretty useless if they don&#x27;t light and burn properly.</li>
            <li> Burns clean and smells natural not chemical or fake</li>
            <li> The scent is mostly reminiscent of pine and tends to stick around for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps there was a product issue or they were on a shelf too long before they were sold</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m reluctant to use incense that has a wooden core (dipped incense) since a lot of them smell smoky and awful when lit, but HEM seems to do a really nice job making their incense smell like anything but smoke.  </li>
            <li> Careful not to burn these in the same room you are in the smoke is pretty ridiculous and harsh.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to linger quite as long as other Hem incense however.</li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t sure if i should order them after reading some of the bad reviews, but went ahead and got them.</li>
            <li> I really do not like the scent of this incense.</li>
            <li> like I expected.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how long the burn is because I cut it off half way though...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably be checking out other HEM scents soon.</li>
            <li> As usual with all the incense I&#x27;ve ordered, a lot of the sticks came to small to where it didn&#x27;t stay in the hole, I have three different incensed holders and none of them will hold the tiny width without using another stick to keep it in the hole....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the time messing with these</li>
            <li> It is not my intention to knock the other review but; yuk!</li>
            <li> If you identify with the following you might not like this; if you pay money to buy nice perfume and are a bit of sensitive to artificial oders you&#x27;ll hate this!</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Not woody and green</li>
            <li> and my house smells like green forrest.</li>
            <li> it is hard to know if you will like it or not before you try it.</li>
            <li> but it was a acceptably slow burn until that point.</li>
            <li> And a dusty pan handier.</li>
            <li> Even though she is here in the US, she cooks as if she is still in that poor country.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a comforting back-to-nature smell without any weird undertones or perfumey sneeziness.  </li>
            <li> Of course, my neighbor cooks food from a country that is very poor.</li>
            <li> but both are a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Maybe as an outdoor essence around an artificial fire?</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have that bad after-smell like some of the cheaper incense do.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> So the food smells terrible to me.</li>

            <li> Smells OK.  But coralling the ashes is like herding cats.  If you use this product, have a vacuum handy.  And a dusty pan handier.</li>
            <li> The Moon &amp; Forest incense sticks were purchased at the same time and neither will light nor burn properly. Perhaps there was a product issue or they were on a shelf too long before they were sold but both are a disappointment. They do smell good but they are hard to light; need to be lit several times; spark when burning; and burn all too fast compared to other Hem products I use (Cedar &amp; Precious Lavender). It&#x27;s not worth the time messing with these and I have to go with the low rating because they&#x27;re pretty useless if they don&#x27;t light and burn properly.</li>
            <li> I like this smell, it&#x27;s not too strong and it reminds me of being outside which is nice. It burns for about 30 to 45 minutes depending on the stick.</li>
            <li> Mellow and subtle, HEM Forest incense is refreshing and reminds me of campfires in the summer and good times shared around the fireplace in the winter.  It&#x27;s a comforting back-to-nature smell without any weird undertones or perfumey sneeziness.  It has displaced Daigen-Koh Rosewood as my favorite, but please do try that too if you like HEM Forest.</li>
            <li> Very enjoyable fragrance.  I like to burn incense.  Makes me think I&#x27;m still a hippie in the 60&#x27;s, and not an old man in the 2nd millennium teens.</li>
            <li> Normally I&#x27;m reluctant to use incense that has a wooden core (dipped incense) since a lot of them smell smoky and awful when lit, but HEM seems to do a really nice job making their incense smell like anything but smoke.  The scent is mostly reminiscent of pine and tends to stick around for a long time.  Overall this is a pretty good deal on very nice incense.  I&#x27;ll probably be checking out other HEM scents soon.</li>
            <li> I really do not like the scent of this incense. But there is no doubt it is quality. I can&#x27;t tell you how long the burn is because I cut it off half way though... but it was a acceptably slow burn until that point. To me it smells like a strong aftershave used heavily by a man who can not smell very well anymore. As a bonus, however, if you love the scent it did fill two rooms with its aroma.  Smell is so personal...it is hard to know if you will like it or not before you try it. I will keep searching. If anyone has suggestions for incense that smells like the out of doors, I am all ears!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought a mix of scents, thinking I would like them all, but this incense is my favorite. I know it can&#x27;t recreate a true scent of the forest, but it takes me there. It reminds me of the smells of forest and campfires at Yosemite, in the campground. It&#x27;s perfect for me. I shelved the rest except for First Rain, which doesn&#x27;t remind me of rain, yet is pleasant, nonetheless.</li>
            <li> It is not my intention to knock the other review but; yuk! If you identify with the following you might not like this; if you pay money to buy nice perfume and are a bit of sensitive to artificial oders you&#x27;ll hate this! It smells like cheap men&#x27;s colonge. A great deal but too a bit \\&quot;un-natural\\&quot; for me.  Maybe as an outdoor essence around an artificial fire? No not there either.</li>
            <li> It is incense, what more can be said? It is better than cheaper versions. Really like this brand a lot.</li>
            <li> I cannot even burn these incense. They give me a headache and smell like the perfume inserts in magazines. There is no forest scent at all. I can burn nag champa, but could not even let one of these finish burning inside the house (with windows open). Have used many incense; these do not burn clean and leave strings behind. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Did not smell anything like a forest. Wasted money. Burned fine but will not recommend. My mom made me put it out because in her words &amp;#34;smelled terrible&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Of the bunch of these that I bought, these have the nicest scent and are most consistent in lighting and burning.&lt;br /&gt;They arrived on time, in good shape, and I have enjoyed hem through the holidays.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Love this incense and have reordered it a number of times.</li>
            <li> I purchased Sun, Moon and Forest all at the same time.  These incense get great reviews for a reason - they lack the irksome chemical smell of many other incense.  They smell natural and leave a nice lingering scent behind.  Forest is the one that  I consider to be &amp;#34;extreme&amp;#34; as far as the three scents go... I believe I described it as &amp;#34;loud&amp;#34; in another of my reviews. I am ranking them by strength of smell because Moon is very light and Sun is right in the middle, with a significant strength, but not overpowering.  If you need to get the smell of your wood-burning stove&#x27;s smoke belches out of the air, this one is definitely the go-to.  At first whiff, I was convinced that I loved this scent, but within seconds, I started to get the vivid scent of men&#x27;s cologne.  The smell drifts back and forth to my senses, smelling of both the forest and too-strong men&#x27;s cologne at times.  It&#x27;s a great incense if that particular scent is what you&#x27;re looking for.  With Sun and Moon smelling so much more natural, I would have expected the same out of this one, but I didn&#x27;t quite get that...</li>

            <li> I have a lot of different scents, and this is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this a lot for summer and fall use, and it is a great change of pace.  Earthy and fun.</li>
            <li> the fragrance is woodsy with a touch of floral, perfect for Freshening the house in the summer with the windows closed and air conditioning on!  Great value for the quantity!</li>
            <li> Smells like 1970s Patchouli-Pine Mens Colognes, w/ soapy note-break out the Neil Diamond and Plaid Wool suit !</li>
            <li> A bit milder scent than I expected from Hem but not bad at all. It makes a nice calming scent for the home. It doesn&#x27;t seem to linger quite as long as other Hem incense however.</li>
            <li> I got this incense hoping it would take me back to the smell of forests, mountains and cabins. It did not happen. While the incense smells good, it does not smell like forest or any tree.</li>
            <li> This incense is wonderful. It smells exactly like being in the forest around the pine trees. Not quite as sharp though but totally perfect. I didn&#x27;t really need to know much about this before ordering it because the name of the incense explains it \\&quot;Forest\\&quot; It is very relaxing to burn this anytime of the day and leave such a wonderful fragrance in your home. I would get this again.</li>
            <li> actually not a bad incense. doesn&#x27;t have that bad after-smell like some of the cheaper incense do. wasn&#x27;t sure if i should order them after reading some of the bad reviews, but went ahead and got them. just burned my first one from the package..burns fine..smells much better after lighting. sorta smells like cologne before lighting.</li>
            <li> The product is so nice!  It arrived on time and smells so great!</li>
            <li> Good Incense by HEM. Burns clean and smells natural not chemical or fake</li>
            <li> I buy a lot of incense, this shows I purchased here and to please leave a review...might have ordered it but never received it so my apologies to not be able to review the item, tho if it is HEM ( my favorite) there is a very good chance that you will be happy with the product if you receive it:)</li>
            <li> I said it...I love the scent and what it does to make my home smell relaxing and refreshing.This is one of my favorites!</li>
            <li> This is our favorite, but there are still many other great scents from HEM. I would suspect if anyone tried out a few of them at random, they would be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> A nice on the nose foresty scent that is pleasant and not like the heavy scent of so many other incenses</li>
            <li> Pleasant clean smell and easy on the senses.</li>
            <li> Really pleasant, a bit perfume like</li>
            <li> This incense burns well, and has a light, pleasant fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower a room. It just doesn&#x27;t smell very &amp;#34;forest-y&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have a fake tree but love that pine scent. This incense was better then real pine by every means. why settle for the scent of one tree for Christmas when you can have a whole forest? what I liked best is it&#x27;s obviously not just pine, there&#x27;s something else in it that gives it that deciduous forest scent, perhaps a type of wood. Another winner from HEM!!!</li>
            <li> I like this incense, one of my faves, but it does not smell like any forest I&#x27;ve been in here in the States.  Smells like flowers to me, lots and lots of flowers.  Pretty and sweet.  Not woody and green like I expected.</li>
            <li> Long lasting smells and just really refreshing to come home to. Careful not to burn these in the same room you are in the smoke is pretty ridiculous and harsh.</li>
            <li> Nice scent and saves money and prevents me from buying incense at icky liquor stores or neon-bright &#x27;head shops&#x27; this is the perfect way. One of these  six boxes would be about 4 bucks in my neighborhood this pays for itself</li>
            <li> As usual with all the incense I&#x27;ve ordered, a lot of the sticks came to small to where it didn&#x27;t stay in the hole, I have three different incensed holders and none of them will hold the tiny width without using another stick to keep it in the hole....</li>
            <li> Very good incense sticks. Smells good and good for praying early in the morning. The sticks are strong and lightens very properly.</li>
            <li> Nice scent that is not so overwhelming.  Our townhouse is about 1300 sq ft and we can smell this throughout without it being overwhelming at the source.  Good deal too.</li>
            <li> Fantastic - Love the tubes - great for gifts!  Aroma is very pleasant and fills the room very nicely.  Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This is a very light forest smell. i like this one for those times you need something sweet but not a lot. the sticks burn well.</li>
            <li> It was great, got it for a family member and even they love it. Easy to light and smells good.</li>
            <li> I love the calmness the great smell of incense inspires. I need to relax, and use incense to help me. Of course, my neighbor cooks food from a country that is very poor. Even though she is here in the US, she cooks as if she is still in that poor country. So the food smells terrible to me. The scent gets into the hall and my apartment. The incense eradicates this smell.</li>
            <li> I like this over the actual Pine Scent.  This gives a nice forest musk.  More of a Pine forest however.  I really enjoy this for the holidays!</li>
            <li> first time with hem incense, didn&#x27;t care for the scent reminded us of an overpowering laundromat smell.  It did have a nice burn though, it definately left a haze of smoke, needed to open a window to remove it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell! Smells woodsy not too strong, just a mellow scent. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this incense, as the other buyers stated there is no smoke odor and my house smells like green forrest. Love it!</li>
            <li> I purchased it while ago love the smell of it. It&#x27;s just as good as hem brand garden of flowers and wild orchids.</li>
            <li> Oh wow man, like the smile on a cat this will bless you with the peace of kindness, very good karma</li>
