    <ol>
            <li>This is not a holy grail but it is a great find!</li>
            <li>Awesome</li>
            <li>(: Came on time and is an excellent product!</li>
            <li>Perfect colors and go on very nice</li>
            <li>I have not used the product yet however the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li>I bought this palette at Target, and I will agree the pigment is lighter, but if you put an eyeshadow primer on (ELF makes a great one)</li>
            <li>Another great buy in terms of price and quality.</li>
            <li>Out of all these rectangle palettes this one was my favorite!!</li>

            <li>I receive so many compliments when I wear it.</li>
            <li>It looks sophisticated and semi-natural.</li>
            <li>I love this litte palette.</li>
            <li>When the package came, I was so excited!</li>
            <li>I love the colours in this palette and they are easy to use.</li>
            <li>I love how i cam make a different look each time i use and know it looks good!</li>
            <li>I love the light sparkle in some of the colors too.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t show up as much as i would like even after using a really good eye shadow primer.</li>
            <li>The colors look &amp;#34;ADORABLE&amp;#34; and there are two that clearly look very nice and glittery</li>
            <li>All the other colors are wonderful.</li>
            <li>Quickly received this Adorable pallette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li>but they apply light and just don&#x27;t stay on my lids.  </li>
            <li>Cute colors and worth the money to spend.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a brown/neutral colored palette for an everyday look and this was perfect.</li>
            <li>the colors are are adorable on or 2 of the colors have shimmer and its great for an everyday use</li>
            <li>Its also super cheap at $6.</li>
            <li>I loved the different shades, and the way they look on me.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly what I wanted... would have loved a golden tone one though to make the Adorable a little more</li>
            <li>Other, than that, product is great.</li>
            <li>make up, Some people might like a particular color and use that more often than the others</li>
            <li>Very pretty colors.</li>
            <li>Wayyy smaller than I anticipated but super cute!</li>
            <li>Colors are pretty but only go on well and look pigmented if you have a good primer on underneath.</li>
            <li>Great little palette of shzdows.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the colors just weren&#x27;t right for my skin tone.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone unless you like very, VERY, light, barely noticeable color.  </li>
            <li>I use this eye pallete daily for a cute natural look, i love it</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will be a better palette when I have a little more color on my skin in the summer months.</li>
            <li>Beautiful colors, they are slightly glittery just fyi for anyone that wants matte, but it isn&#x27;t too much at all looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li>The shadows are vivid and light on the eyes.</li>
            <li>the colors are rich and the application is SMOOTH not gritty ..</li>
            <li>I love the colors and its larger than I thought it would be!</li>
            <li>Very pigmented!  </li>
            <li>I was uneasy with the purchase, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it out for a while I really like it!</li>
            <li>The colors they put together in this palette are so pretty.  </li>
            <li>Colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li>It is smaller than it looks but cute.</li>
            <li>I recommend these whole heartedly!</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
            <li>Some of the colors don&#x27;t really go well together.</li>
            <li>Very chalky didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li>so I generally try to build up quiet a bit darker than I would normally just so it will stay at a nice level of color.</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented and blend out well.</li>
            <li>Some had sparkle and was very brown tone to all.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to trying out this palette.  </li>
            <li>I think its made to be really blend-able and maybe that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t show up as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li>Most of the shadows are chalky &amp; not very pigmented.</li>
            <li>I really like these.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>My mom loves it too and wants one for herself haha</li>
            <li>I use it everyday for an everyday makeup look and its perfect.</li>
            <li>These shadows are highly pigmented, they blend like a dream and wear all day without moving from where I put them.</li>
            <li>and I use it regularly with other eye shadow shades and on its own.</li>
            <li>The powder isn&#x27;t loose enough to be able to put on a brush and apply to eyes.</li>
            <li>it takes the pigment to a new level.</li>
            <li>Arrived earlier than expected and in brand new, mint condition, and these colors will look lovely on me.</li>
            <li>It was a gift for a friend of my 14 year old daughter.  </li>
            <li>guess this color palette will last me a while because I don&#x27;t see myself or anyone else going through so much eye</li>
            <li>Now for the actual eyeshadow...from what I still could use...I have determined that this is very cheep eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Pigment not great maybe good pallet for a young teen learning how to wear shadow wear is not good.</li>
            <li>The only bad thing is they don&#x27;t have a good pigment on some of the colors.</li>

            <li> The only bad thing is they don&#x27;t have a good pigment on some of the colors.</li>
            <li> color pay off is not as intense as is usual with NYX products.</li>
            <li> The pink only lasts for a couple of hours, and all the colors fade throughout the day</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented all the colors look the same to me.</li>
            <li> I needed one for a long time and this product suits my demand.</li>
            <li> The pink, taupe and white are matte, while the other 3 have shimmer.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I bought this, but I am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I usually prefer Makeup Forever amd Nars products, and with the primer, this shadow can compete with more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Just a little smaller than i thought</li>
            <li> It goes on well with minimal dusting.</li>
            <li> A chunk of shadow was missing from the third slot when I received the package.</li>
            <li> The pink doesn&#x27;t show up as pink as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of NYX shadows, but I thought this palette would change my mind.</li>
            <li> I highlight with the pink.</li>
            <li> For example, the white and darker brown are very frustrating to pick up with a brush compared to other shades, and don&#x27;t seem to show up unless you dig into the powder with your brush and really lay on the color.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, because a few of the shadow shades are like this, I only really use the lighter brown and the pink shade.</li>
            <li> There was eyeshadow all over the place, but when I wiped the shadow from the case, and looked in, there was very little of the actual eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I really only use a few colors in this palette--mainly due to the lack of pigmentation in half of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lasted longer than any other ones my daughter has used.</li>
            <li> recommend buying the other palettes as well to have a variety.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the pink does not show up on olive complexions and is not very pigmented.</li>
            <li> I apply the lightest brown color, the very light khaki color, as a base</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Going to get other colors!</li>
            <li> They are on the gray side of the spectrum, which makes my (olive) skin tone look a little washed out.</li>
            <li> I have to dig into it a little bit.</li>
            <li> My skin is freakishly pale, so getting shadow to show on my eyelids is almost never a problem.</li>
            <li> This palette was so small and the colors weren&#x27;t pigmented.</li>
            <li> Usually NYX products are nicer than this palette, so it&#x27;s a bit of a bummer.</li>
            <li> its a small pallete for the price I paid</li>
            <li> A little frustratingly inconsistent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even notice ANY shimmer/glitter, or at least nothing that&#x27;s as noticeable on the pallette.  </li>
            <li> Not fair.</li>
            <li> but this palette gives you a broad base of hues to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have tried applying with both primer and NYX base in white.</li>
            <li> I use the white and beige color as a base.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t go on smoothly no matter what type of base I use under them.</li>
            <li> But I was disappointed when I opened the box.</li>

            <li> This is a good set of neutral colors for light colored skin. It goes on well with minimal dusting. It&#x27;s lasted longer than any other ones my daughter has used.</li>
            <li> Arrived earlier than expected and in brand new, mint condition, and these colors will look lovely on me. I can&#x27;t wait to play!</li>
            <li> A chunk of shadow was missing from the third slot when I received the package. I don&#x27;t want to fuss over a return so I&#x27;ll deal with it. Aside from that issue the palette is nice, it is 0.21 ounces of product (or in my case, 0.18 ounces) so I did not expect it to exceed my expectation. Nice and compact, happy it came with an applicator.</li>
            <li> I would buy another set of colors today! The shadows are vivid and light on the eyes. No need for touch ups, color lasts all day!</li>
            <li> I have this palette! Some of the colors don&#x27;t really go well together. This is not a holy grail but it is a great find!</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when I bought this, but I am so glad I did. I love it!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this off of amazon, but I must say this is by far the best thing ever !! A must buy</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors, they are slightly glittery just fyi for anyone that wants matte, but it isn&#x27;t too much at all looks exactly like the picture</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product</li>
            <li> No pigment, I couldn&#x27;t get the colors to apply for the life of me.. I will never use NYX eye shadow again.</li>
            <li> Very chalky didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> (Sister posting) color pay off is not as intense as is usual with NYX products. I have tried applying with both primer and NYX base in white. The pink only lasts for a couple of hours, and all the colors fade throughout the day so I generally try to build up quiet a bit darker than I would normally just so it will stay at a nice level of color. I recieve many compliments throughout the day, however.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and how they look on my eyes.  Very easy to apply and no need for me to have to reapply during the day.</li>
            <li> Not very pigmented all the colors look the same to me.</li>
            <li> cute palette, lovely blendable colors</li>
            <li> I like this palette. The colors are very pigmented and blend out well. I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars because the colors just weren&#x27;t right for my skin tone. They are on the gray side of the spectrum, which makes my (olive) skin tone look a little washed out. Hopefully this will be a better palette when I have a little more color on my skin in the summer months. I may give to a friend who has a more suitable complexion for this palette.</li>
            <li> Perfect colors and go on very nice</li>
            <li> Color is not what you see on line. Some had sparkle and was very brown tone to all.</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a friend of my 14 year old daughter.  My daughter says her friend liked it and was happy with it.</li>
            <li> Love the colors, but need to apply quite a bit to see some of the lighter shades.</li>
            <li> I love the colors and its larger than I thought it would be!</li>
            <li> The pink doesn&#x27;t show up as pink as I wanted it to be</li>
            <li> this palette is awesome, all of the shadows are highly pigmented! I would recommend this palette to everyone.</li>
            <li> You know I like the colors but they apply light and just don&#x27;t stay on my lids.  Fade away city after about 4 hours.  I work, I can&#x27;t reapply mid day. Not fair. If it had more staying power, it would be a hit with me.</li>
            <li> Very pigmented!  I was uneasy with the purchase, but now that I&#x27;ve tried it out for a while I really like it!</li>
            <li> Love this üòÉ. Love the colors. Just a little smaller than i thought but overall i like it</li>
            <li> I bought this palette at Target, and I will agree the pigment is lighter, but if you put an eyeshadow primer on (ELF makes a great one) it takes the pigment to a new level. I usually prefer Makeup Forever amd Nars products, and with the primer, this shadow can compete with more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my sister and she loves it! Arrived fast</li>
            <li> Not bad. Colors are pretty but only go on well and look pigmented if you have a good primer on underneath.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to trying out this palette.  The colors they put together in this palette are so pretty.  The only bad thing is they don&#x27;t have a good pigment on some of the colors.</li>
            <li> I love how i cam make a different look each time i use and know it looks good!</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly what I wanted... would have loved a golden tone one though to make the Adorable a little more SWANKY!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this color palette will last me a while because I don&#x27;t see myself or anyone else going through so much eye make up, Some people might like a particular color and use that more often than the others but this palette gives you a broad base of hues to choose from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend buying the other palettes as well to have a variety.</li>
            <li> I really love the colors and the texture but they don&#x27;t show up as much as i would like even after using a really good eye shadow primer. I think its made to be really blend-able and maybe that&#x27;s why it doesn&#x27;t show up as much as I&#x27;d hoped.</li>
            <li> The powder isn&#x27;t loose enough to be able to put on a brush and apply to eyes. I have to dig into it a little bit. Other, than that, product is great. Cute colors and worth the money to spend.</li>
            <li> Nice palette.  Colors are really pretty.</li>
            <li> Pigment not great maybe good pallet for a young teen learning how to wear shadow wear is not good.</li>
            <li> I bought this palette for the nice matte colors.  I use the white and beige color as a base.  The darker colors blend well in the crease. I love the name and found this palette to be adorable. I bought it two weeks ago from Ulta and I use it regularly with other eye shadow shades and on its own. I feel it is a good mix of colors for me. I am fair but it think it would look good on a lot of skin tones.</li>
            <li> Great little palette of shzdows. The pink, taupe and white are matte, while the other 3 have shimmer. I apllied over eyelid primer and they lasted all day with no touchups. Going to get other colors!</li>
            <li> This palette was so small and the colors weren&#x27;t pigmented. They were kind of chalky. This palette is good for a beginner, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again.</li>
            <li> love these colors. Out of all these rectangle palettes this one was my favorite!!</li>
            <li> This product is not as good as I had hoped. Most of the shadows are chalky &amp; not very pigmented. They don&#x27;t go on smoothly no matter what type of base I use under them. I&#x27;ve never really been a fan of NYX shadows, but I thought this palette would change my mind.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this, t is my first NYX product. very pigmented and perfect colors. you can ix and match and they all go so well together.</li>
            <li> I loved the different shades, and the way they look on me.</li>
            <li> I have not used the product yet however the colors are beautiful.</li>
            <li> Quickly received this Adorable pallette and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. These shadows are highly pigmented, they blend like a dream and wear all day without moving from where I put them.</li>
            <li> I really only use a few colors in this palette--mainly due to the lack of pigmentation in half of them. For example, the white and darker brown are very frustrating to pick up with a brush compared to other shades, and don&#x27;t seem to show up unless you dig into the powder with your brush and really lay on the color. Unfortunately, because a few of the shadow shades are like this, I only really use the lighter brown and the pink shade. A little frustratingly inconsistent. My skin is freakishly pale, so getting shadow to show on my eyelids is almost never a problem. Usually NYX products are nicer than this palette, so it&#x27;s a bit of a bummer. Glad I didn&#x27;t spend more on this product..</li>
            <li> When the package came, I was so excited! But I was disappointed when I opened the box. There was eyeshadow all over the place, but when I wiped the shadow from the case, and looked in, there was very little of the actual eyeshadow. Now for the actual eyeshadow...from what I still could use...I have determined that this is very cheep eyeshadow. NOT WORTH YOUR MONEY. It was made in P.R.C.</li>
            <li> Awesome (: Came on time and is an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I needed one for a long time and this product suits my demand. From the packaging design to the color palette I am very much pleased with NYX adorable shadows. Another great buy in terms of price and quality.</li>
            <li> its a small pallete for the price I paid</li>
            <li> Very pretty colors. Love this brand. Will order again</li>
            <li> It is smaller than it looks but cute.</li>
            <li> Does NOT show up well on medium toned skin</li>
            <li> I love the colours in this palette and they are easy to use. I love the light sparkle in some of the colors too.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this pallette from Amazon, but let me just say, you get what you pay for.  The colors look &amp;#34;ADORABLE&amp;#34; and there are two that clearly look very nice and glittery which is why I bought them, but this isn&#x27;t what you get once it&#x27;s applied.  I don&#x27;t even notice ANY shimmer/glitter, or at least nothing that&#x27;s as noticeable on the pallette.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone unless you like very, VERY, light, barely noticeable color.  It looks very cheap to be honest.  I like some of the NYX make up but this one just isn&#x27;t one of the things I like.</li>
            <li> The pallet is so cute, but it&#x27;s not pigmented üòê</li>
            <li> I love this palette. My only complaint is that the pink does not show up on olive complexions and is not very pigmented. All the other colors are wonderful.</li>
            <li> Wayyy smaller than I anticipated but super cute!</li>
            <li> comes off easily but pretty good!</li>
            <li> I really like these. I was a fan of the mineral wear  but it itches my eyelids ... for the price I am well pleased. the colors are rich and the application is SMOOTH not gritty .. I recommend these whole heartedly! No itch and I love the colors!</li>
            <li> I give this product 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this palette the colors are are adorable on or 2 of the colors have shimmer and its great for an everyday use I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Adorable palette. I receive so many compliments when I wear it. A caveat: You must wear eye shadow primer before applying this eye shadow (I recommend Smashbox or Urban Decay, both at Sephora). I have Colombian/Middle Eastern medium to light skin, and it pops beautifully. It looks sophisticated and semi-natural. I apply the lightest brown color, the very light khaki color, as a base and then I apply the mud brown and then the darker browns in the crease. I highlight with the pink. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Great shades, nicely pigmented, lasts all day</li>
            <li> I use this eye pallete daily for a cute natural look, i love it</li>
            <li> Very nice colors; perfect for those that love neutrals.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. It was exactly what I was expecting. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love this litte palette. I use it everyday for an everyday makeup look and its perfect. I was looking for a brown/neutral colored palette for an everyday look and this was perfect. My mom loves it too and wants one for herself haha Its also super cheap at $6. definitely happy i bought this :)</li>
