            <li>Very nice otherwise</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to have all sorts of grooming tools to have, but the quality of the tools aren&#x27;t very good.</li>
            <li>when you just need something that you dont want to do with your good set.</li>
            <li>Nice Set, works great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to have pleased my husband and didn&#x27;t have to hand over too many shekels to do so!</li>
            <li>After the 5th attempt to cut his toenails, the hubs asked for his own set.    </li>
            <li>So, I looked for something nice;</li>
            <li>My husband viewed it and smiled, uttering,</li>
            <li>i enjoyed the nail clipper set, a good investment item.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the case is really nice</li>
            <li>The case is very nice and the clippers is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>these tools are really easy to use with good quality, wish u like them too</li>
            <li>so I kept it and got a better quality for my Mom at Ulta...</li>
            <li>eight or nine bucks for all these precise tools!</li>
            <li>I just love this set.</li>

            <li>Every item works just fine.</li>
            <li>cheap quality and cheap finish</li>
            <li>This has a lot of tools to take care of your finger nails but the cutters are cheap and fall apart.</li>
            <li>All very good quality and sharp blades.</li>
            <li>All of the items are very useful.</li>
            <li>Good variety of different pieces that are made well.</li>
            <li>quality of tools is adequate - 3 stars&lt;</li>
            <li>SUPER FAST shipping too.</li>
            <li>which is what I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t pay that much for it, so it&#x27;s really worth it.</li>
            <li>very meh...</li>
            <li>/&gt;all of the clippers feel very cheap, and it feels like they almost tear my nails off, leaving them very rough.</li>
            <li>something high quality to impress him and do the job.    </li>
            <li>I would have been too embarrassed to give it to my Mom for Christmas and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the price to ship it back</li>
            <li>I have used it numerous times to remove splinters, and believe me when I say - you don&#x27;t know how useful this took kit</li>
            <li>The outside design is pretty also.</li>
            <li>and I personally know (because I tried them myself) that the nail clippers are strong and very sharp.    </li>

            <li> not very good quality at all. It arrived with one of the clippers broken and nail cuticle trimmer had a rust stain or some sort of stain on it already..and it just looked really bad. I would have been too embarrassed to give it to my Mom for Christmas and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth the price to ship it back so I kept it and got a better quality for my Mom at Ulta...which is what I should have done in the first place.</li>
            <li> The case is sturdy, the tools are solid and the kit has everything I need to keep my heathen nails in check.</li>
            <li> Should meet all the demands my daughter would place on a grooming kit.</li>
            <li> meh... very meh... back of the bathroom drawer kinda thing when you just need something that you dont want to do with your good set.</li>
            <li> xmas gifts. great product</li>
            <li> I use this kit constantly. I have used it numerous times to remove splinters, and believe me when I say - you don&#x27;t know how useful this took kit is until you buy one for yourself.</li>
            <li> cheap quality and cheap finish</li>
            <li> these tools are really easy to use with good quality, wish u like them too</li>
            <li> I purchased these because the younger members of the household  (whom shall remain nameless) kept removing daddy&#x27;s nail clippers from his drawer.  After the 5th attempt to cut his toenails, the hubs asked for his own set.    So, I looked for something nice; something high quality to impress him and do the job.    The nail set arrived and it appeared quite substantial.  My husband viewed it and smiled, uttering, \\&quot;it looks like a collection of medieval torture tools\\&quot;.  Ha!    Well, he loves the set and I personally know (because I tried them myself) that the nail clippers are strong and very sharp.    I&#x27;m happy to have pleased my husband and didn&#x27;t have to hand over too many shekels to do so!</li>
            <li> I liked it but one of the cutter came apart first time I used it,other than that nice item.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Case is very nice, as well as some of the tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all of the clippers feel very cheap, and it feels like they almost tear my nails off, leaving them very rough. cuticle clipper was garbage too, wont cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE:&lt;br /&gt;For the price I paid, I am content with the case and the four or five tools that I will actually use.</li>
            <li> i enjoyed the nail clipper set, a good investment item. thank you for posting product.</li>
            <li> The black edge was coming off so I had to superglue it back one.  Very nice otherwise</li>
            <li> The all in one manicure set! It was a hit! It arrived on time and the product is a great quality. I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to have all sorts of grooming tools to have, but the quality of the tools aren&#x27;t very good., especially the nail cutters.  To open one of them, the handle gets stuck, like it wasn&#x27;t inspected for quality.  You also have to press harder to cut your nails compared to other quality nail cutters.</li>
            <li> The red leather case is a little gauche for my tastes, but the implements are all well-constructed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving this four stars because it can be difficult to retrieve the flatter tools (e.g., the file). Also, I am a little concerned that the clasp/locking mechanism might not hold up to heavy use and travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> nothing to write home about.  when it&#x27;s time to get another, I&#x27;d try another set.</li>
            <li> Has to be one of Amazon&#x27;s best values...eight or nine bucks for all these precise tools!</li>
            <li> I just love this set. I had been looking for something like this. I am very happy I decided to buy this one. Every item works just fine. It&#x27;s small so you can carry it around. The outside design is pretty also. All of the items are very useful.</li>
            <li> This has a lot of tools to take care of your finger nails but the cutters are cheap and fall apart. Very poorly made.</li>
            <li> Nice Set, works great</li>
            <li> Toe nail clippers are not sharp and are difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Tools work well and this product is great for the price</li>
            <li> for the money this product gets 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the case is really nice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the quality of tools is adequate - 3 stars&lt;br /&gt;i give it five stars for cost / value</li>
            <li> What you see in the pic is what you get.  If this isn&#x27;t the most nifty utensil for nails, I sure don&#x27;t knwo what is.  All very good quality and sharp blades. I will be getting these as gifts for people, who doesn&#x27;t need that?</li>
            <li> Good variety of different pieces that are made well. No issues, husband loves it.</li>
            <li> The case is very nice and the clippers is pretty good too. It&#x27;s not polished chrome but I didn&#x27;t pay that much for it, so it&#x27;s really worth it. SUPER FAST shipping too.</li>
