            <li>it&#x27;s such a nice fine spray!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to use in the winter when my skin feels so dry.</li>
            <li>The mist quickly dries and absorbs the oil on my skin which then soon tightens.</li>
            <li>When I am able to afford it, I use this mineral water spray only to wash my face before moisterizing.</li>
            <li>My favorite ...has been since I was a teen.</li>
            <li>I consider it more of a luxury item and only splurge on a can every once in awhile.</li>

            <li>and in this hot weather.</li>
            <li>just ok, it is not as useful as i expected.</li>
            <li>such awesome moisture spray, spray a few times after washing face, dont even need a moisturizer of lotion, this keeps my face very soft and quenched.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t worth this price, not so much diffirence with normal water.</li>
            <li>This is the third one ,fully recommend to try it ,good for my skin!!!Just use it when your skin feel dry..</li>
            <li>live near the beach and always take one in a cooler and spray to keep cool then too.  </li>

            <li>Before I bought it, I was worried about the quality for some negative reviews, but it is really nice as mist.</li>
            <li>I spray first thing in the morning to refresh my skin, last thing at night and periodically throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Economical for home use - a little large to carry around though.  </li>

            <li> totally perfect. But the bottom of bottle is kind of like dirty, and the bottle is not very clean. Need improve. The product self is wonderful. Good.</li>
            <li> absolutely fantastic.When I am able to afford it, I use this mineral water spray only to wash my face before moisterizing.</li>
            <li> I have been using Evian Natural Mineral Water Facial Spray for at least 10 years and would not be without it.&lt;br /&gt;I spray it on my face immediately after applying my make up.  Not only does it tone my skin, it sets my make up and gives my face a most refreshing feeling.  I will also spray it on my face when I am not wearing foundation because it feels so refreshing. It sets your makeup and gives you a polished look.  My make up table is never without it.  At one time I could purchase it at JC Penny but after I could no longer find it there, I was ecstatic when I searched Amazon and was able to purchase it here. Please don&#x27;t stop selling it, I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Always a winner for me!  Refreshing.</li>
            <li> So clean and refreshing feeling.  Use it for great skin moisture throughout the day.  Great after or during a workout and through out the day to stay fresh.  Nice big bottle lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED EVIAN SPRAY FOR MANY YEARS AND I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> My favorite ...has been since I was a teen. A must have in your beauty routine. :D</li>
            <li> Sometimes you just have to smarten up just a bit more when buying beauty products. Do yourself a favor, if you want a face freshener, skin tightener, etc..that will actually deliver results:  http://goo.gl/n05SFS  ... don&#x27;t just follow the marketing hype.</li>
            <li> Love this fine refreshing mist on my face to set make-up.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff...perfect for setting make up</li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s just water in a can but I love this spray. It&#x27;s great to use in the winter when my skin feels so dry. Ive also used it when Im sick/feverish. It basically has the same effect as a cool wash cloth on your forehead. It&#x27;s definitely overpriced. I consider it more of a luxury item and only splurge on a can every once in awhile.</li>
            <li> Great to freshen up and add moisture to my face! Love!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I use it before I put moisturizer on my face and after I put my makeup on to set my powder.</li>
            <li> Very nice fine mist feels great.  I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this water spray. It keeps my face moisturized in a dry climate and heals any acne or small skin infections. I always carry the small bottle with me, too. It comes in very handy.</li>
            <li> Love this! Really refreshing, especially in the summer or after a workout. Good wake-me-up in the morning, too. Use to set makeup, also, works great.</li>
            <li> such awesome moisture spray, spray a few times after washing face, dont even need a moisturizer of lotion, this keeps my face very soft and quenched.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product. Before I bought it, I was worried about the quality for some negative reviews, but it is really nice as mist.</li>
            <li> I use it first thing in the morning...my eyes are so dry....I grab the Evian can before I open my eyes, and spray my face, especially the eye area...it relieves the dryness.  In the summer also, it&#x27;s relaxing to spray the face....it&#x27;s such a nice fine spray!</li>
            <li> This is a must have for me. Spritz before moisturizer and moisture works better. Spray over make up to set it, tone and moisturize your skin. If you haven&#x27;t tried it, you have to.. you&#x27;ll love it.. and in this hot weather. ahhh love it !!! Thank you for excellent prompt shipping and product exactly as advertised .. good seller, good transaction !!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for decades and use it before applying moisturizer so it absorved nicely.  Also I use it several times a day so skin won&#x27;t be dry. I do belive the skin needs minerals, and Evian does wonder to your skin.  I love this item and hope they keep on selling it.</li>
            <li> My wife wanted a facial mist spray, we managed to find this one on here and it definitely does the job.  No complaints here!</li>
            <li> This is the third one ,fully recommend to try it ,good for my skin!!!Just use it when your skin feel dry..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but once I tried this product about 10 years ago, I&#x27;ve never stopped using it! I love it!</li>
            <li> No case, no packaging, like someone used before, I&#x27;m not comfort with it. maybe next time I would not buy it anymore</li>
            <li> Its should to be in every home! My scin like it</li>
            <li> I love it. The mist quickly dries and absorbs the oil on my skin which then soon tightens. It is an awesome refresher.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping your skin moist and supple, especially as the summer progresses!</li>
            <li> Economical for home use - a little large to carry around though.  The spray itself works well just before applying moisturizer and/or sunblock.  I don&#x27;t have to use as much moisturizer because with the spray, the moisturizer is more effective and a smaller amount of it goes further.</li>
            <li> This is a good product.  However I was looking for a product with a bit more staying power.</li>
            <li> I am a yoga fan and Evian spray is the perfect way to cool down after a good class.</li>
            <li> just ok, it is not as useful as i expected. it doesn&#x27;t worth this price, not so much diffirence with normal water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fanatical about this spray.  I cannot go a day without it.  I keep two in my refrigerator, one in my bedroom and one in my bathroom.  I spray first thing in the morning to refresh my skin, last thing at night and periodically throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live near the beach and always take one in a cooler and spray to keep cool then too.  The travel size goes in my purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People compliment me on my skin all the time - I feel pretty sure it has a lot to do with years of this wonderful mineral water.</li>
            <li> So refreshing for our hot NC summers!!!!</li>
            <li> Very refreshing ...especially on the go</li>
            <li> I like it but the spray cap inside was broken so I had to tape it in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> perfect  I need it again -</li>
