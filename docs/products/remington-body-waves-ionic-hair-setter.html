            <li>These are great electric rollers!</li>
            <li>This is the Best curler set I have EVER used.  </li>
            <li>The best curlers ever.  </li>
            <li>The three types of rollers are perfect for all lenghts of hair</li>
            <li>The rollers themselves are good but the clips are a joke!</li>
            <li>this product has done a great job for me.  </li>
            <li>These rollers are great.  </li>
            <li>I found this to be a good product</li>
            <li>They are also a good value for the price.</li>
            <li>Sincerely, a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to create a great hairstyle, that lasts, with these rollers.</li>
            <li>The set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up.  </li>
            <li>If I was to ask for one change, it would be a quicker warm up time.  </li>
            <li>It does not have a handle for carrying, and you have to find your own storage for the roller clamps.  </li>
            <li>So accomadating &amp; portable &amp; easy to use &amp; VERY cost effective!!!</li>
            <li>I have used this style of hotcurlers for over 35yrs &amp; LOVE LOVE LOVE them!</li>
            <li>Much better than conair</li>
            <li>Satisfied 100%.</li>
            <li>I like these way better than curlers with the felt.  </li>
            <li>The rollers surface, when warm, grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to style when I take the rollers out.</li>
            <li>I replaced the clips with the good old fashioned metal clips to be able to use this hair setter.</li>
            <li>The rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb</li>
            <li>Appears to add body to my fine hair &amp;amp; holds well.</li>
            <li>I bought these rollers, my first hot rollers ever, hoping for good results, which I did not get.  </li>
            <li>They heat up quickly and are easy to use.</li>
            <li>Next time I will spend more more for a better product.</li>
            <li>Finally I was able to fine the Remmington Curlers that I had used for years.</li>
            <li>It is worth it because of the way it lasts.  </li>
            <li>For the money I don&#x27;t think they were worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the warm up time takes longer than the time I actually leave the curlers in my hair.  </li>
            <li>This item was returned at my shipping expense---the 15 year old Clairol unit this item was meant to replace heats faster and works better.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what I want it to</li>
            <li>Knowing what I know now after having purchased these hot rollers, I would not buy them again if they went on sale for a dime.  </li>
            <li>I received it in four or five days way before Christmas and it was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>These are highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Very klutzy design.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast &amp;amp; assorted sizes makes setting a snap.</li>
            <li>The rollers are not that easy to use and the clips always fall out on my long hair.  </li>
            <li>Most of my rollers have melt spots after just a few weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>You must do a lot of guess work to get the rollers back in the right spot.  </li>
            <li>The rollers have melted at the edges,leaving grey plastic on the heaters (I&#x27;ve been lucky about my hair and have stopped using them).</li>
            <li>However, just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy, makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation.  </li>
            <li>About the only positive thing I can say about this set of curlers is that the ends stay much cooler than those in my old set (which were so hot to handle that I threw them away after a very short use.  </li>
            <li>When I removed them, the curls were pretty, but only lasted for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>I got this curler set, and I completely regret it!</li>
            <li>Once heated, the rollers are relatively cool to the touch (no more burned fingers) but due to the wax core, the rollers hold plenty of     heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent, long lasting results.  </li>
            <li>The old set is about to get company...)</li>
            <li>It takes up too much room when open.  </li>
            <li>It needs a retractible cover (like my old Clairol set).  </li>
            <li>I recently cut my hair very short, it looks like the haley berry cut from ex-men two and the curlers still works for a short length, my hair is full of bounce and shine</li>
            <li>As far as it taking too long to heat up, I don&#x27;t really let that affect my review because I plug it in and while it is heating up</li>
            <li>The rollers that did manage to stay in place (very, very few of what I put in) produced curl which was way too soft to last for more than a very short time.  </li>
            <li>Over the years, I have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and I never liked using any of them.  </li>
            <li>She wanted to do her hair nice for a day out and ended up having to use a curling iron and running a bit late due to all the lost time she put in to trying to use these rollers.</li>
            <li>(sorry I can&#x27;t recall second part of vendor&#x27;s name right now, however it will be easy to find)New</li>
            <li>They took a long time to cool down.  </li>
            <li>It took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down.</li>
            <li>I was extremely satisified when I found them fast to use, heating up fast &amp; providing long lasting curls.</li>
            <li>Thanks Remmington (I still don&#x27;t like your other regular rollers!</li>
            <li>I bought my first set 5 years ago, and I used them everyday.</li>

            <li> I needed this product Remington Body Waves Ionic Hair Setter asap because my older ones just like it went out about a week and a half before Christmas!</li>
            <li> They take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair.  </li>
            <li> They took a long time to heat up, took forever to put in my hair, clips did not stay in, so</li>
            <li> I have very long hair and don&#x27;t use hair products; yet my curls still stay all day.  </li>
            <li> These roller sets have very short posts so that slightly bumping them knocks them over.</li>
            <li> But, I used different clips and got used to burning my fingertips a little when I used it.  </li>
            <li> And the lid doesn&#x27;t snap closed</li>
            <li> I recently bought a new set which I had to return due to the fact that I had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls, they would immediately fall out of my hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this roller set as a gift for someone after reading the Amazon reviews; her experience did not match those of the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> I had not used Remington curlers before &amp; was hesitant about trying them after being set on a certain brand I had used before but unable to find.  </li>
            <li> , therefore if you close the lid, slightly bump the set, all of the rollers spill out.  </li>
            <li> The clamps don&#x27;t work on even slightly long or thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Your curls stay intact and your curls are tight and have body.  </li>
            <li> I ordered on line so that I would not have the hassle or waste the time of going to a retail establishment and making the purchase.  </li>
            <li> The Remington H-1080N rollers were slow to heat, the roller clamps were difficult to place in the proper position, and it was difficult to put the rollers back in their proper slots when finished.  </li>
            <li> This reason itself would usually send me looking elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hard to please, so</li>
            <li> Wt would probably work on women who don&#x27;t have thick hair.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was unable to find the Remmington Curlers and ended up using other brands.</li>
            <li> It is not good for travel, because the rollers do not stay put.  </li>
            <li> My chief complaint is that the clips are horribly designed and allow the rollers to fall out of my hair almost as fast as I can put them in.  </li>
            <li> It was less expensive than the Manufacturer&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> Is this false advertisment?  </li>
            <li> The last brand I used was the worst Vidal Sasson.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used electric rollers since 1969 and this is the only horrible design I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The product&#x27;s design is fundamentally flawed: the clamps, rollers, and parking slots are not color-coded.  </li>
            <li> This product has been a disappointment.  </li>
            <li> The oval case makes it impossible to wrap the cord for storage.</li>
            <li> Really very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I bought these rollers yesterday and they are terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought these rollers yesterday and they are terrible. I plan on returning them. They do not stay up in my my wife&#x27;s hair. They give you these flimsy plastic clips that don&#x27;t work. Wt would probably work on women who don&#x27;t have thick hair. She wanted to do her hair nice for a day out and ended up having to use a curling iron and running a bit late due to all the lost time she put in to trying to use these rollers. Next time I will spend more more for a better product.</li>
            <li> I have almost no complaints about this product.  The rollers are not that easy to use and the clips always fall out on my long hair.  This reason itself would usually send me looking elsewhere.  But, I used different clips and got used to burning my fingertips a little when I used it.  It is worth it because of the way it lasts.  I have very long hair and don&#x27;t use hair products; yet my curls still stay all day.  Much better than conair 2 min. setter and caruso steam stylers!</li>
            <li> I found this to be a good product and it works well in my hair it does exactly what I want it to and I only paid $14.99 for it. It doesn&#x27;t cause my hair to frizz up and it&#x27;s easy to style when I take the rollers out. As far as it taking too long to heat up, I don&#x27;t really let that affect my review because I plug it in and while it is heating up I do my makeup or something else. (I&#x27;m a multi-tasker anyway)  I also don&#x27;t find that the clips leave a mark in my hair but my hair has some perm in it so it may do that on straighter hair.  Overall I like it.</li>
            <li> I have used this style of hotcurlers for over 35yrs &amp; LOVE LOVE LOVE them! So accomadating &amp; portable &amp; easy to use &amp; VERY cost effective!!! Please DONT stop making them!!!</li>
            <li> this product has done a great job for me.  I recently cut my hair very short, it looks like the haley berry cut from ex-men two and the curlers still works for a short length, my hair is full of bounce and shine and i always get complimented on it.</li>
            <li> For the longest time I was unable to find the Remmington Curlers and ended up using other brands. The last brand I used was the worst Vidal Sasson. Finally I was able to fine the Remmington Curlers that I had used for years. I am so thankful they&#x27;re still making these and hope they will continue to offer them. These are the best curlers in my opinion and would recommend them to anyone. Sincerely, a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> These are great electric rollers! They heat up quickly and are easy to use. It&#x27;s easy to create a great hairstyle, that lasts, with these rollers. They are also a good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Knowing what I know now after having purchased these hot rollers, I would not buy them again if they went on sale for a dime.  My chief complaint is that the clips are horribly designed and allow the rollers to fall out of my hair almost as fast as I can put them in.  The rollers that did manage to stay in place (very, very few of what I put in) produced curl which was way too soft to last for more than a very short time.  About the only positive thing I can say about this set of curlers is that the ends stay much cooler than those in my old set (which were so hot to handle that I threw them away after a very short use.  The old set is about to get company...)</li>
            <li> These roller sets have very short posts so that slightly bumping them knocks them over. The hinged lid isn&#x27;t removable so it crowds the vanity.  And the lid doesn&#x27;t snap closed, therefore if you close the lid, slightly bump the set, all of the rollers spill out.  The rollers have melted at the edges,leaving grey plastic on the heaters (I&#x27;ve been lucky about my hair and have stopped using them). The oval case makes it impossible to wrap the cord for storage. The clamps don&#x27;t work on even slightly long or thick hair.  I&#x27;ve used electric rollers since 1969 and this is the only horrible design I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> The Electric Rollers that were advertised and that I purchaseed were Remington Body Waves - Model 1080i - The Model Number that was shipped was Model Number 1080n. Is this false advertisment?  Really very disappointed.  I ordered on line so that I would not have the hassle or waste the time of going to a retail establishment and making the purchase.  I now have to figure out a way to repackage the merchandise and get it to the shipper!!!</li>
            <li> I needed this product Remington Body Waves Ionic Hair Setter asap because my older ones just like it went out about a week and a half before Christmas! I ordered it from Amazon.com vendor Jungle?.com (sorry I can&#x27;t recall second part of vendor&#x27;s name right now, however it will be easy to find)New not Used and was told it would take seven to ten days to receive it-I guess because it was around Christmas time.  I received it in four or five days way before Christmas and it was exactly what I wanted. Satisfied 100%. Will order again in future from them if I ever need another one.  It was less expensive than the Manufacturer&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  They take way too long to heat up and the clips leave a crimp mark in her hair.  For the money I don&#x27;t think they were worth it.</li>
            <li> I bought these rollers, my first hot rollers ever, hoping for good results, which I did not get.  They took a long time to heat up, took forever to put in my hair, clips did not stay in, so my hair all fell out of the rollers.  They took a long time to cool down.  When I removed them, the curls were pretty, but only lasted for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li> I got this curler set, and I completely regret it! I used it once, and I wont touch it again! It left my hair frizzy, and there was a bump from where the clamps were. It took me 3x as long to get fix my hair as it did to put it in the curlers and wait for it to cool down. I wouldn&#x27;t even give it one star...take my advice- DO NOT buy this!!</li>
            <li> Over the years, I have tried many different brands and types of heated rollers and I never liked using any of them.  I recently bought a new set which I had to return due to the fact that I had a terrible time trying to roll my hair on the almost smooth surface of the rollers and then after clipping the rolls, they would immediately fall out of my hair....scream! I bought the Remmington #1080N wax core roller set and I have finally found the easiest and quickest  way to curl my hair.  The rollers surface, when warm, grab the hair ends immediately to allow great control when trying to roll even short hair.  The rollers are held in place by a full clip which looks more like a comb so the clips do not leave a ridge in my hair.  Once heated, the rollers are relatively cool to the touch (no more burned fingers) but due to the wax core, the rollers hold plenty of     heat and it takes just a few minutes after setting to produce excellent, long lasting results.  The set takes about 10 - 15 minutes to warm up.  I&#x27;ve found the warm up time takes longer than the time I actually leave the curlers in my hair.  This is the Best curler set I have EVER used.  If I was to ask for one change, it would be a quicker warm up time.  However, just the fact that rolling is so quick and easy, makes up for the few extra minutes of preparation.  I&#x27;m hard to please, so my recommendation says alot.  Thanks Remmington (I still don&#x27;t like your other regular rollers! Ha).</li>
            <li> I purchased this roller set as a gift for someone after reading the Amazon reviews; her experience did not match those of the other reviewers.  The Remington H-1080N rollers were slow to heat, the roller clamps were difficult to place in the proper position, and it was difficult to put the rollers back in their proper slots when finished.  The product&#x27;s design is fundamentally flawed: the clamps, rollers, and parking slots are not color-coded.  This item was returned at my shipping expense---the 15 year old Clairol unit this item was meant to replace heats faster and works better.</li>
            <li> These rollers are great.  Your curls stay intact and your curls are tight and have body.  I like these way better than curlers with the felt.  These are highly recommended! Plus, they last for years.  This is my second set.  I bought my first set 5 years ago, and I used them everyday.</li>
            <li> The best curlers ever.  All of the newer models do not perform like these.  The three types of rollers are perfect for all lenghts of hair</li>
            <li> This product has been a disappointment.  It takes up too much room when open.  It needs a retractible cover (like my old Clairol set).  It is not good for travel, because the rollers do not stay put.  If you accidentally bump it, the rollers will disengage and the plastic will melt.  Most of my rollers have melt spots after just a few weeks of use.  You must do a lot of guess work to get the rollers back in the right spot.  And, if you don&#x27;t, guess what--more melting.  It does not have a handle for carrying, and you have to find your own storage for the roller clamps.  Very klutzy design.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast &amp;amp; assorted sizes makes setting a snap.Appears to add body to my fine hair &amp;amp; holds well.</li>
            <li> I had not used Remington curlers before &amp; was hesitant about trying them after being set on a certain brand I had used before but unable to find.  I was extremely satisified when I found them fast to use, heating up fast &amp; providing long lasting curls.</li>
            <li> The rollers themselves are good but the clips are a joke! You would have to have short hair for the clips to stay in place and not fall out. I replaced the clips with the good old fashioned metal clips to be able to use this hair setter.</li>
