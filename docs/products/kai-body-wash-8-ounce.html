            <li>i loved how this vendor shipped it to me so fast too, thsk you!</li>
            <li>Most of &#x27;Kai&#x27; products are FABULOUS however this &#x27;Kai Linen&#x27; kaka isn&#x27;t so.  </li>
            <li>A very mild scent of Gardenia which lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous smelling and keeps my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li>Smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Genuine product.</li>
            <li>Light and clean smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so fresh and clean and smells like flowers!</li>
            <li>The fabulous  aroma of Hawaiian gardenia doesn&#x27;t and certainly doesn&#x27;t last for more that 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>Beautiful scent but doesn&#x27;t last very long, and given the price</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel terrific and smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>Although Kai has a nice fragrance it can be a bit overwhelming and when I shower I don&#x27;t feel that the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; lasts as long when I shower with other products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had it 3 days and the MOST annyoing part is that atomizer when you place your finger to  S - P - R - A - Y  the friggin&#x27; bottle, your finger slips over and over again the the atomizer is dripping WET with Kai Linen.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I bought from one of the retail establishments in New Orleans.</li>
            <li>It smells like old bananas.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t purchase it because it is overpriced, not worth the price and doesn&#x27;t do what it states for $47.00 here and most other sites $52.00.  </li>
            <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t quite as intense and did not last as long as the Kai Body Wash</li>
            <li>, not sure it was worth it.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Kai is a superb body wash.  A little goes a long way.  A very mild scent of Gardenia which lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Have used in past but first time purchased from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smooth and silky.  A wonderful scent!</li>
            <li> Although Kai has a nice fragrance it can be a bit overwhelming and when I shower I don&#x27;t feel that the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; lasts as long when I shower with other products.</li>
            <li> Smells heavenly, I use these products when I need a mental vacation. I give these products as gifts...always a hit.</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this scent.  It&#x27;s so fresh and clean and smells like flowers! I get compliments on it all the time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to the aroma. It makes showering even more luxurious. I wish their products were a bit less pricey.</li>

            <li> Most of &#x27;Kai&#x27; products are FABULOUS however this &#x27;Kai Linen&#x27; kaka isn&#x27;t so.  Don&#x27;t purchase it because it is overpriced, not worth the price and doesn&#x27;t do what it states for $47.00 here and most other sites $52.00.  Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t give you $10.00 for 5 of em.  The fabulous  aroma of Hawaiian gardenia doesn&#x27;t and certainly doesn&#x27;t last for more that 3 minutes.  How about a minute and a half?&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it 3 days and the MOST annyoing part is that atomizer when you place your finger to  S - P - R - A - Y  the friggin&#x27; bottle, your finger slips over and over again the the atomizer is dripping WET with Kai Linen.  Most perfume bottles have an atomizer similiar to this, however,  this doesn&#x27;t occur or they&#x27;d never sell expensive perfume, obviously Kai took a &#x27;short cut&#x27; to save money on this  atomizer fer sure.  Too bad because most of thier products are excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine trying to get your money back on this complaint?  NEVER is too soon.  Take the hint FOLKS.</li>
            <li> Genuine product. Fast delivery. Good value.</li>
            <li> Love it but way too expensive.</li>
            <li> Beautiful scent but doesn&#x27;t last very long, and given the price, not sure it was worth it. May buy again, not sure.</li>
            <li> This Kai Body Wash is the best body wash that I have ever used.  Beside the beautiful fragrance, you just feel so silky all over after you used it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll never trade it for anything.  I love my Kai Body Wash.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift - on the wish list; recipient loves this entire line so can only say it&#x27;s got to be Great!</li>
            <li> I think I received a counterfeit version of this product.  It doesn&#x27;t even smell like Kai, which I have been using for years.  It smells like old bananas.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. perfect</li>
            <li> Delicious scent and amazing formula for sensitive skin.  LOVE KAI!</li>
            <li> Best body wash ever, just wish it came in a 32oz. Pump for the shower.</li>
