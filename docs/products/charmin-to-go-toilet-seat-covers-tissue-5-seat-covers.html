            <li>Most bathroom carry the tissue paper.</li>
            <li>Most places do not provide seat covers and we love making sure we have them when we go out.</li>
            <li>Convenient product, easy to carry unobtrusively and does the job well.</li>
            <li>EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>These are absolutely indispensable.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and extremely convenient when travelling, as many places do not provide seat covers in their rest rooms.</li>
            <li>They fit right in my backpack for easy travel.</li>
            <li>All I will say is that not every place uses toilet seats, which is where these came in really handy!  </li>
            <li>Worked great, and packaged small so its easy to carry with you.</li>
            <li>Great for on the go squat on the pot in foreign places!</li>
            <li>I rarely used it.</li>
            <li>Bottom layer is kind of like toilet paper.</li>
            <li>the paper from Charmin was nicer but to reach inside my bag and get one of these out was too much work because there were available in most public bathrooms.</li>
            <li>They are durable and work great at protecting me on any public toilet.  </li>
            <li>She hates using public bathrooms and this kinda puts her more at ease.</li>
            <li>(they are flush able) then put down one of these handy Toilet seat tissues.&lt;br</li>
            <li>they work great for carrying around in your car/purse JUST IN CASE you have to stop at a gas station or somewhere remote that may not have or be out of toilet seat covers.</li>
            <li>These come in a nice little case that compactly fits in my purse for use everywhere I go.  </li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied with the toilet seat covers.  </li>
            <li>The paper is very flimsy.</li>
            <li>LIKE SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Mini enough to fit in a purse.</li>
            <li>However, several more words are required to complete this review.</li>
            <li>Comes in handy when using public toilet rooms when you don&#x27;t want to sit on the sear.</li>
            <li>gave this brand 5 stars as it is much more compact and softer than other brands I have</li>
            <li>Love the small package too.  </li>
            <li>carry anti-bacterial wipes that I use first on the toilet seat</li>
            <li>I have 4to yr old son</li>
            <li>The top layer is is a sort-of-plastic that slowly dissolves in water.</li>
            <li>AND it&#x27;s barely big enough to be called the right size.    </li>
            <li>Small size will fit in backpack, purse or even a pocket.  </li>
            <li>Was a little small for the one public place where I tried one of them, but still worked ok.  </li>
            <li>other words, they&#x27;re small, they break easily, and they&#x27;re entirely ineffective.</li>
            <li>Very convenient little pack to keep on you.</li>

            <li> I was extremely happy with these, as they provide some kind of security and safety, and the reason why I purchased them, again.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000GCRX9I Charmin To Go Toilet Seat Covers Tissue, 5 Seat Covers]]    These are handy to carry in my purse and are sturdy paper, do not tear easily.  They come in a travel pack.</li>
            <li> ok kinda ok but will look for something not so pricey</li>
            <li> These toilet seat covers are the same size and the same quality as the ones provided in public restrooms, and yet five of them are folded up in a 4&amp;#34; x 3&amp;#34; snap open-and-shut pouch small enough to drop in a man&#x27;s pocket or a lady&#x27;s purse.  If you value the toilet seat covers you&#x27;ve been using in public restrooms, you&#x27;re going to like these.</li>
            <li> I took these camping and would not leave home without them!!! They fit right in my backpack for easy travel.</li>
            <li> Very convenient little pack to keep on you. great for traveling!</li>
            <li> The paper is very flimsy. When you try to tear the perforation to open up the center part of the cover, the entire thing rips up. And it sometimes tears up just pulling it away from the other covers in the pack. AND it&#x27;s barely big enough to be called the right size.    I&#x27;ll be looking for a higher-quality substitute. So should you.    UPDATE: Found it! An item called Toileaf. Man this is some well kept secret!!    Bottom layer is kind of like toilet paper. The top layer is is a sort-of-plastic that slowly dissolves in water. So it keeps your tush dry. Sturdy out of the package, you almost can&#x27;t yank it apart. The hole is already built in. And it&#x27;s got a bit of stick-em on the bottom to keep it in place during use. It&#x27;s got a little-bitty tab on one end that you pull on and hold while you drop it in the bowl before you flush.    No longer available on Amazon ... but the company has its their own website. Ordering is the quickest I&#x27;ve ever seen for something online. Pick the size packet you want, just one click and you are paying with PayPal and it&#x27;s being sent to your PalPal address!    There&#x27;s a demo video on YouTube ... check it out!    UPDATE [05-01-2014] Toileaf has apparently gone out of business. :(    UPDATE [2014-09-20] The Toileaf website is back up and running. I just ordered and rec&#x27;d some more of them. Now they come five to a pack (instead of four). And they&#x27;ve improved it by removing the tape that held each one tighly shut (which was difficult to get off without tearing the product) and instead have put each one into a plastic wrap that is easy to just pull off. Yeah, these cost more than the cheap paper ones, but they work very very well!</li>
            <li> Convenient product, easy to carry unobtrusively and does the job well.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and extremely convenient when travelling, as many places do not provide seat covers in their rest rooms.</li>
            <li> A necessary product while traveling, but not only when going overseas!  Doesn&#x27;t take up any space in your purse and can&#x27;t count on them being available everywhere!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT. EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.&lt;br /&gt;I WILL TELL OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT THAT.ENJOY IT IN DAILY LIFE. THANK YOU!</li>
            <li> Great to carry in your purse or pocket for those non-home bathrooms..</li>
            <li> I bought these for my fiance.  She hates using public bathrooms and this kinda puts her more at ease. Love the small package too.  She&#x27;s able to put it in her purse.</li>
            <li> Overall, very satisfied with the toilet seat covers.  Was a little small for the one public place where I tried one of them, but still worked ok.  Maybe could be designed to be a little larger?</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT RECOMMEND ME LIKE SO MUCH WITH MY FRIENDS, AMAZON SELLS CUTE THINGS AND GOOD PRICE, I AM VERY SATISFIED</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  They are truly an advantage for safety and protection.  These come in a nice little case that compactly fits in my purse for use everywhere I go.  They are durable and work great at protecting me on any public toilet.  I fully recommend these!</li>
            <li> Product is self explanatory. All I will say is that not every place uses toilet seats, which is where these came in really handy!  Heck, I even use when there is a toilet seat.  Easy to unfold and store for traveling.</li>
            <li> Small size will fit in backpack, purse or even a pocket.  Comes in handy when using public toilet rooms when you don&#x27;t want to sit on the sear.</li>
            <li> Keep these in my car glove box.</li>
            <li> What can I say..they work great for carrying around in your car/purse JUST IN CASE you have to stop at a gas station or somewhere remote that may not have or be out of toilet seat covers.</li>
            <li> Ok for a get away package I would defintely purchase again unless one of my gift basket receipent did not like it.</li>
            <li> How can you not love this product?? I use them at the outdoor gun range where they have out houses. What a wonderful thing to have with you! Works like a charm. Even the guys used them!</li>
            <li> Wife loves them when we are on the road.</li>
            <li> I always carry Toilet Seat cover Tissue in my purse just in case. Some pubic restrooms are just not clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I carry anti-bacterial wipes that I use first on the toilet seat (they are flush able) then put down one of these handy Toilet seat tissues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this brand 5 stars as it is much more compact and softer than other brands I have had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who is out and about and ends up having to use a public toilet as well as to others who are wheelchair bound like myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend these to family &amp; friends ... I already have.</li>
            <li> Most bathroom carry the tissue paper. I rarely used it. the paper from Charmin was nicer but to reach inside my bag and get one of these out was too much work because there were available in most public bathrooms.</li>

            <li> I got this for a friend because she hates public restrooms. Mini enough to fit in a purse. Very handy.</li>
            <li> That is all. They work. However, several more words are required to complete this review. Great for on the go squat on the pot in foreign places!</li>
            <li> Love these things! I have 4to yr old son and i hate when were in public and he has to go potty!</li>
            <li> I get grossed out when I&#x27;m in a public bathroom.  These are absolutely indispensable.  The packs are small and inconspicuous.  I always have a pack in my purse.</li>
            <li> bought for our trip overseas since we knew they wouldnt have seat covers. Worked great, and packaged small so its easy to carry with you.</li>
