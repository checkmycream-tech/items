            <li>I&#x27;m not too crazy about the white, however it&#x27;s easy to paint your own design onto it or apply decals.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that these (tiny) bottles didn&#x27;t have the Ford running pony on the caps.</li>

            <li> The 4 bottles are mini bottles so you won&#x27;t have them hanging around long if you aren&#x27;t fond of them.  </li>
            <li> NOT WORTH THE MONEY.</li>
            <li> I priced the polishes, Base and Top Coats, Dryer, Polish Remover, and the cost came out cheaper than all the mani/pedi places I&#x27;ve been to.  </li>
            <li> extremely small.</li>
