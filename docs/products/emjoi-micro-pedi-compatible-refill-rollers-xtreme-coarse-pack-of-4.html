            <li>These work great at keeping my feet callous free</li>
            <li>These are amazing.  </li>
            <li>These rollers keep my feet happy, smooth and cleaner looking and I like that</li>
            <li>but they fit and work great.</li>
            <li>A great way to smooth even the roughest of calluses.</li>

            <li>These file heads work the best for very course and calused feet</li>
            <li>These are perfect for very calloused feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>I have yet to swap out from the original roller, but think that the coarser roller will be great.</li>
            <li>Came quickly and fit the emjoi perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Good description easy transaction</li>
            <li>The Xtreme coarse ARE really good - and my feet, and my hubby - are happy!</li>
            <li>Quick ship, great product, as advertised, would order from this seller again.</li>

            <li>Works great and shipped fast!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay, but not as good as the original Emjoi rollers.</li>
            <li>Leaves my feet very smooth</li>
            <li>Excellent product that actually works but get the plug in not the battery operated because if you use any pressure with the battery one it stops rotating.</li>
            <li>I like these better than the rollers that came with my Emjoi</li>
            <li>I love the Emjoi.</li>
            <li>Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>I WOULD PURCHASE MORE.</li>
            <li>Granted, end-of-winter feet are more renovation than maintenance, but still I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li>Love these rollers.  </li>
            <li>Glad I find them here</li>
            <li>I was pleased but not blown away.</li>
            <li>Love the Emjoi and these rollers</li>
            <li>and I feel these are better in that they get rid of more callous material.  </li>
            <li>Pumice stone much much better...</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love these.  </li>
            <li>I have achieved a better result though it takes more than one attempt and you have to keep up the maintenance because it doesn&#x27;t just stay</li>
            <li>Better than any razor or buffer I know of.</li>
            <li>Love this product for in-between pedicures.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought these</li>
            <li>awesome, very coarse does the job even better than the one the sander comes with.</li>
            <li>Much better than what came with the device.</li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>but most of us aren&#x27;t in that boat.  </li>
            <li>Glad I purchased these.  </li>
            <li>Great price, fast service.</li>
            <li>so glad it comes in this grade of courseness.</li>
            <li>Better than a pedicure.</li>
            <li>love my Emjoi</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just writing the review on this one based on feedback but rest assure that if my wife says it works then it works because she is more picky than I am</li>
            <li>satisfied with product</li>
            <li>Absolutely love Emjoi products.</li>
            <li>They feel better after using these roller than after a salon pedicure.</li>
            <li>I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers (</li>
            <li>I believe these rollers are for the EMJOI NANO.&lt;br /&gt;The product needs to be relabeled or a better description.</li>
            <li>; BUT IM OKAY WITH THAT</li>
            <li>I love all Micro-Pedi products and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li>Love the product</li>
            <li>These coarse rollers are perfect for someone who always walks barefoot</li>
            <li>These are definitely the best to get a lot off of your feet..</li>
            <li>pretty good, but, should have lasted longer</li>
            <li>BUT WORKS PRETTY GOOD</li>
            <li>It said it was a more coarse roller, but it is not producing very good results.</li>
            <li>Very good product definitely would reccomend</li>
            <li>The Micro-Pedi is the best tool for rough feet around  </li>
            <li>It does an awesome job on removing rough spots on your feet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine.</li>
            <li>so far they work great.</li>
            <li>these are great very well packaged quick delivery thank you</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t believe I found them for such a good price!</li>
            <li>The original ones are way better</li>
            <li>I thought they would hurt being extremely course but they are great!</li>
            <li>Even better than the original ones.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too strong and it works much better than the original.</li>
            <li>They also wear out very quickly.  </li>
            <li>but these work just fine</li>
            <li>Works just fine.</li>

            <li>just a light touch.</li>
            <li>Now I have smooth heels.</li>
            <li>but this reallllly works to smooth them out.</li>
            <li>They fit my Emjoi and work as well as those I received with product.</li>
            <li>The mico-pedi refill rollers (Xtreme coarse) work great.  </li>

            <li>It is very effective, save time compare with blue one.</li>
            <li>Works like the original.</li>
            <li>Same great products for much lower price!!</li>
            <li>Besides, they don&#x27;t have clean ones.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m blown by the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li>They are very handy to use on dry feet.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good things about</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t work nearly as good as the actual emjoi ones.</li>
            <li>Wow, these are effective rollers for callouses.  </li>
            <li>She really likes the Xtreme rollers more than the smoother ones.</li>
            <li>They work good must be cleaned regularly to maintain effectiveness.</li>
            <li>so much I bought 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li>great product  to smooth down your feet</li>
            <li>Originally I bought the regular (blue) roller and then decided to go with the coarser ones (these) and made the best decision.</li>
            <li>Xtreme Pedi Active works great on my husbands feet.</li>
            <li>quickly removes calluses</li>
            <li>wish they were more durable and more coarse.</li>
            <li>use the constantly to keep my heels and feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>removes callus quickly</li>
            <li>Seller shipped quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li>worked well but has to be switched quickly</li>
            <li>These are more coarse and supposedly do a better job.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quick as a flash.</li>
            <li>Needed the more coarse ones and these work better.</li>
            <li>Green extra course is the best for big toe callouses, especially important to have during sandals weather.</li>
            <li>Really make calluses smooth within minutes.</li>
            <li>They do a good job of smoothing rough feet and eliminating callouses.</li>
            <li>The Micro-Pedi gets&lt;br /&gt;the rough skin off as good as the tool the foot doctor used.  </li>
            <li>These are the coarsest ones I&#x27;ve used and the only ones that are remotely effective.</li>
            <li>This product is perfect for my extra rough heels.  </li>
            <li>In 3 sessions I took away years worth of callous buildup.from his feet.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic, so much better than the standard rollers.</li>
            <li>Got the whole system and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>Great product, easy to install and last a long time</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t feel the (Xtreme Coarse Rollers) were any better than the original rollers that came with my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  </li>
            <li>I think these are better than the original blue roller that came with my Emjoi.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied, my feet get rough and this produce took care of it the first I used it!</li>
            <li>Even these, however take a whole lot of rubbing to effect significant change.</li>
            <li>are good if you have a lot of callous build-up but be careful not to over use them!</li>
            <li>I expect this product to be as good as the other two rollers.</li>
            <li>Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li>i bought the electric Emjoi and am impressed with the power and how easy it is too use.the extreme coarse rollers smooth heels that i have soaked,moisturized and even had a podiatrist work on and after using the Emjoiwith the xtreme coarse roller</li>
            <li>I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came</li>
            <li>These rollers really didn&#x27;t work much better/faster than the bright blue ones than were included with the Emjoi machine, and here&#x27;s why</li>
            <li>Im a dancer and on my feet a lot many times needing to dance in bare feet.  </li>
            <li>It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2),</li>
            <li>Problem solved thanks to emjoi!</li>
            <li>Work very well!</li>
            <li>Abrasive rollers (COARSE) do the job a lot faster - and I love them.</li>
            <li>that they would be work better, but next time I will buy the &amp;#34;Super course&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>ones so that I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot on my heels so many times as with the Xtreme.  </li>
            <li>Works better the coarse rollers.</li>
            <li>Much better than the blue.</li>
            <li>I thought they would be a more coarse</li>
            <li>Gave me soft &amp; smooth feet.</li>
            <li>Work better than the blue ones.</li>
            <li>Needed extra refills and glad I ordered these.  </li>
            <li>Works better than the roller it came with because these are less fine grit (think sandpaper).  </li>
            <li>Because it is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more Xtreme rollers when needed.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t worn out the first roller,</li>
            <li>Better with coarse rollers.</li>
            <li>First time it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>Like these a lot, they work much better than the blue ones.</li>
            <li>Worked way better than the blue rollers.  </li>
            <li>Works better than the blue ones.</li>
            <li>These are even better the blue ones that come with the emjoi.</li>
            <li>Your feet will be smooth and soft like never before.</li>
            <li>I evidently invented callous formation..</li>
            <li>so much better than the regular ones.</li>
            <li>Really does work with the Emjoi!</li>
            <li>and my feet are so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I thought the roller would be a bit more coarse.</li>
            <li>so happy to finally take care of dry cracked heels!</li>
            <li>These are very coarse and work great for those rough patches on your heels.</li>
            <li>Good value, as they seem to last longer than the regular grade refills!</li>
            <li>This is the refills for it and it is a little more coarse than the refills that come with the original emoji purchase, but I really like it better.</li>
            <li>works really well fits like genuine roller however only good for one time use on both feet and takes about half an hour to get desired results</li>
            <li>Seemed to wear down kind of fast.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll know for certain once I change batteries.  </li>
            <li>Really works for summer dry heels :)</li>
            <li>Love the extreme course for first passes.</li>
            <li>the extra cord is just fine.</li>
            <li>I am giving them four stars because they are, in my honest opinion, a little spendy for what they are.</li>
            <li>Keeps my feet soft and pretty!</li>
            <li>but my feet really where like sand paper</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Very aggressive</li>
            <li>These work very well this</li>
            <li>Really like these rollers and are much cheaper than QVC.</li>
            <li>Delivered fast.</li>
            <li>Makes the job much faster.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d expected a bit more.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Performed better than expected</li>
            <li>The Emjoi is made to stpp if too much pressure is applied.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>it works very well with these rollers...</li>
            <li>works very well....</li>
            <li>I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect it to be very course if you have the machine</li>
            <li>My feet actually feel smooth now.</li>
            <li>They are the only rollers that make my heels smooth.</li>
            <li>Very lightweight</li>
            <li>also can&#x27;t tell much difference between the &#x27;brand name&#x27; rollers and these off-brand ones.</li>
            <li>They absolutely did nothing for my feet.</li>
            <li>fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li>The emjoi cam with a much calmer one</li>
            <li>These work really well.  </li>
            <li>cause it doesn&#x27;t do much for that issue.</li>
            <li>THESE WORK REALLY</li>
            <li>REALLY</li>
            <li>Works we&#x27;ll very goid</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>This is definitely the choice for you to do the most damage as far as emjoi refills go.</li>
            <li>It keeps the feet smooth and takes those rough spots right off.  </li>
            <li>Great for feet that are extremely callused and rough.</li>
            <li>They only remove the outermost part of calluses and rough spots, more like a finishing or polishing tool than a true remover.  </li>
            <li>and I was glad to find these extreme course roller refills.  </li>
            <li>The rollers last longer if you clean the skin&lt;br /&gt;off</li>
            <li>after using - I use the &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; setting on outside hose to clean mine.</li>
            <li>These are supposed to be the most heavy duty - exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>so far works pretty well</li>
            <li>Second shipment all one kind,  Blue, no green.</li>
            <li>Very good like them a lot just have to be careful not to press hard</li>
            <li>And since it doesn&#x27;t work as it is supposed to one has to use it several times per week just to maintain what little good it does..</li>
            <li>: while it&#x27;s true that they are much coarser, they also have a lot more open surface area in which to trap dead skin cells.</li>
            <li>The green refills are perfect  for hard calloused feet.</li>
            <li>Better than previous refill rollers I purchased.  </li>
            <li>Easily removes rough spots from your feet.</li>
            <li>For light dry skin removal.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need elbow grease with Emoji as it&#x27;s all electric and these green rollers are gentle, yet the most abrasive callous removers for this machine.</li>
            <li>and while I have not used them consistently/regularly enough to remove all of it entirely, they remove so much and definitely make my feet look better!  </li>
            <li>good grit for my tough feet</li>
            <li>If anything, it&#x27;s like polishing concrete.  </li>
            <li>Used it on my husbands feet (and boy were they rough) and he says his feet feel smooth.  </li>
            <li>They really have helped make my feet soft again.</li>
            <li>The other rollers worked fine, but I was having use the Emjoi every day.  </li>
            <li>not coarse enough wears out easily</li>
            <li>These are a lot better than the standard blue rollers, but I still burn through them before my feet are completely free of dead callous skin.  </li>
            <li>If you happen to be one of the lucky few who have very light, superficial calluses and rough spots this would probably work</li>
            <li>With these new rollers it stops everytime I even attempt to touch my foot.</li>
            <li>As for my they are like a new babies ...&lt;</li>
            <li>This product is extremely poorly made, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit securely, stops and comes apart.</li>
            <li>Overall, I do love the concept of the Emjoi, and afterwards I put on super thick lotion</li>
            <li>These look and perform exactly like the brand name Pedi Refill in Xtreme coarse.</li>
            <li>I use these first and finish with the blue rollers.</li>
            <li>Not sure these are any better than the others</li>
            <li>Although you only get bout 3 uses out of each one at first</li>
            <li>wears out fast constantly need new ones</li>
            <li>Excellent rollers and less expensive then anywhere else.</li>
            <li>These are nice for using in the summer or whenever your skin gets really tough.  </li>
            <li>only use one roller annually - so the package of 4 will last for a while - but couldn&#x27;t contemplate being without my emjoi micro pedi - and these coarse rollers are the best for my tough feet!</li>
            <li>These refills are getting there as far as coarseness is concerned.  </li>
            <li>direct replacement.</li>
            <li>Make feet so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li>Bought the complete set which contained a finer grit Roller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>after to keep them soft.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really see the difference between these and the regular rollers.</li>
            <li>defiantly lasts for pretty long time</li>
            <li>They were so soft I could have used them on my face and still wouldn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
            <li>well and does not waste away quickly&lt;</li>
            <li>Love these Xtreme Coarse rollers to eliminate calluses and dead skin from heel and bottom of feet.  </li>
            <li>Since a thick callus (sp?) has no blood flow and no nerve endings we should be able to get something courser than this.</li>
            <li>The other colors are too fine to make a dent in the big toe callus or the heels.</li>
            <li>No really difference noted from the original blue roller IMO.</li>
            <li>Bought the original Micro-Pedi that had the smoother rollers and my wife did not think they were rough enough, so, I bought the Xtreme rollers.</li>
            <li>The other ones work, but these really make your feet smooth and then use the other files to soften.  </li>
            <li>A must have for anyone who don&#x27;t liked dry hard skin on hands and feet.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the Xtreme Coarse Rollers.</li>
            <li>Do the job very fast, quite rough.</li>
            <li>With the blue rollers I could easily go 15 minutes before the roller needed to be rinsed and dried to regain effectiveness.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>These work - careful not to hold it in one place too long - definitely makes your heels smooth.</li>
            <li>I used the blue ones first but they were not coarse enough.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed for a man&#x27;s foot, the blue ones that came with the Emjoi were fine for my foot, but the green ones worked miracles on my boyfriend&#x27;s extra rough heels.</li>
            <li>Works better on the tough spots.</li>
            <li>Does a fantastic job of scraping away hard calluses.</li>
            <li>Works very well, have persistent very sensitive and dry thumbs especially and need to &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; occasionally!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised because it is advertised as actual &amp;#34;EMJOI&amp;#34; refills.</li>
            <li>I only have the experience with the factory blue roller, but these are at least 2x&#x27;s more abrasive if not</li>
            <li>This product, especially these green ones, make the most difference in my rough, cracked heels.</li>
            <li>Now the fun part, use Emjoi with these Xtreme rollers, and watch the dead skin fall off.</li>
            <li>In case you didn&#x27;t know, use an old toothbrush to lengthen the life of the rollers (and always keep dry).  </li>
            <li>You will notice some difference if you spend a lot of time going over your feet, but who wants to spend a half an hour three times a week on your feet?  </li>
            <li>I have to do it at least a few times a week because my callouses just come back, but it&#x27;s totally worth the time to have normal, soft feet.  </li>
            <li>Love the roughness of these for tough toe nails!</li>
            <li>When my feet start snagging the sheets, five minutes with these bad boys and its all good.</li>

            <li> I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> Love these!  </li>
            <li> These work great at keeping my feet callous free</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  </li>
            <li> These rollers keep my feet happy, smooth and cleaner looking and I like that</li>
            <li> but they fit and work great.</li>
            <li> A great way to smooth even the roughest of calluses.</li>
            <li> The coarseness is perfect for getting my feet summer ready.</li>
            <li> These file heads work the best for very course and calused feet</li>
            <li> These are perfect for very calloused feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The whole Micro-Pedi devise is awesome.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to swap out from the original roller, but think that the coarser roller will be great.</li>
            <li> Came quickly and fit the emjoi perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Good description easy transaction</li>
            <li> The Xtreme coarse ARE really good - and my feet, and my hubby - are happy!</li>
            <li> Quick ship, great product, as advertised, would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!  </li>
            <li> Works great and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay, but not as good as the original Emjoi rollers.</li>
            <li> Leaves my feet very smooth</li>
            <li> Excellent product that actually works but get the plug in not the battery operated because if you use any pressure with the battery one it stops rotating.</li>
            <li> I like these better than the rollers that came with my Emjoi</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I WOULD PURCHASE MORE.</li>
            <li> Granted, end-of-winter feet are more renovation than maintenance, but still I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers.  </li>
            <li> Glad I find them here</li>
            <li> I was pleased but not blown away.</li>
            <li> Love the Emjoi and these rollers</li>
            <li> and I feel these are better in that they get rid of more callous material.  </li>
            <li> Pumice stone much much better...</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Love these.  </li>
            <li> I have achieved a better result though it takes more than one attempt and you have to keep up the maintenance because it doesn&#x27;t just stay</li>
            <li> Better than any razor or buffer I know of.</li>
            <li> Love this product for in-between pedicures.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought these</li>
            <li> awesome, very coarse does the job even better than the one the sander comes with.</li>
            <li> Much better than what came with the device.</li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> but most of us aren&#x27;t in that boat.  </li>
            <li> Glad I purchased these.  </li>
            <li> Great price, fast service.</li>
            <li> so glad it comes in this grade of courseness.</li>
            <li> Better than a pedicure.</li>
            <li> love my Emjoi</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just writing the review on this one based on feedback but rest assure that if my wife says it works then it works because she is more picky than I am</li>
            <li> satisfied with product</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Emjoi products.</li>
            <li> They feel better after using these roller than after a salon pedicure.</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers (</li>
            <li> I believe these rollers are for the EMJOI NANO.&lt;br /&gt;The product needs to be relabeled or a better description.</li>
            <li> ; BUT IM OKAY WITH THAT</li>
            <li> I love all Micro-Pedi products and this is no exception.  </li>
            <li> Love the product</li>
            <li> These coarse rollers are perfect for someone who always walks barefoot</li>
            <li> These are definitely the best to get a lot off of your feet..</li>
            <li> pretty good, but, should have lasted longer</li>
            <li> BUT WORKS PRETTY GOOD</li>
            <li> It said it was a more coarse roller, but it is not producing very good results.</li>
            <li> Very good product definitely would reccomend</li>
            <li> The Micro-Pedi is the best tool for rough feet around  </li>
            <li> It does an awesome job on removing rough spots on your feet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine.</li>
            <li> so far they work great.</li>
            <li> these are great very well packaged quick delivery thank you</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe I found them for such a good price!</li>
            <li> The original ones are way better</li>
            <li> I thought they would hurt being extremely course but they are great!</li>
            <li> Even better than the original ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too strong and it works much better than the original.</li>
            <li> They also wear out very quickly.  </li>
            <li> but these work just fine</li>
            <li> Works just fine.</li>

            <li> just a light touch.</li>
            <li> Now I have smooth heels.</li>
            <li> but this reallllly works to smooth them out.</li>
            <li> They fit my Emjoi and work as well as those I received with product.</li>
            <li> The mico-pedi refill rollers (Xtreme coarse) work great.  </li>
            <li> This a great device and these heavy duty rollers are great for real problem areas.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> All set for summer pedi&#x27;s and pretty feet!!</li>
            <li> It is very effective, save time compare with blue one.</li>
            <li> Works like the original.</li>
            <li> Same great products for much lower price!!</li>
            <li> Besides, they don&#x27;t have clean ones.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m blown by the many positive reviews.</li>
            <li> They are very handy to use on dry feet.</li>
            <li> I cannot say enough good things about</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t work nearly as good as the actual emjoi ones.</li>
            <li> Wow, these are effective rollers for callouses.  </li>
            <li> She really likes the Xtreme rollers more than the smoother ones.</li>
            <li> They work good must be cleaned regularly to maintain effectiveness.</li>
            <li> so much I bought 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> great product  to smooth down your feet</li>
            <li> Originally I bought the regular (blue) roller and then decided to go with the coarser ones (these) and made the best decision.</li>
            <li> Xtreme Pedi Active works great on my husbands feet.</li>
            <li> quickly removes calluses</li>
            <li> wish they were more durable and more coarse.</li>
            <li> use the constantly to keep my heels and feet nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> removes callus quickly</li>
            <li> Seller shipped quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li> worked well but has to be switched quickly</li>
            <li> These are more coarse and supposedly do a better job.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quick as a flash.</li>
            <li> Needed the more coarse ones and these work better.</li>
            <li> Green extra course is the best for big toe callouses, especially important to have during sandals weather.</li>
            <li> Really make calluses smooth within minutes.</li>
            <li> They do a good job of smoothing rough feet and eliminating callouses.</li>
            <li> The Micro-Pedi gets&lt;br /&gt;the rough skin off as good as the tool the foot doctor used.  </li>
            <li> These are the coarsest ones I&#x27;ve used and the only ones that are remotely effective.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my extra rough heels.  </li>
            <li> In 3 sessions I took away years worth of callous buildup.from his feet.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic, so much better than the standard rollers.</li>
            <li> Got the whole system and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to install and last a long time</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the (Xtreme Coarse Rollers) were any better than the original rollers that came with my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  </li>
            <li> I think these are better than the original blue roller that came with my Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, my feet get rough and this produce took care of it the first I used it!</li>
            <li> Even these, however take a whole lot of rubbing to effect significant change.</li>
            <li> are good if you have a lot of callous build-up but be careful not to over use them!</li>
            <li> I expect this product to be as good as the other two rollers.</li>
            <li> Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> i bought the electric Emjoi and am impressed with the power and how easy it is too use.the extreme coarse rollers smooth heels that i have soaked,moisturized and even had a podiatrist work on and after using the Emjoiwith the xtreme coarse roller</li>
            <li> I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came</li>
            <li> These rollers really didn&#x27;t work much better/faster than the bright blue ones than were included with the Emjoi machine, and here&#x27;s why</li>
            <li> Im a dancer and on my feet a lot many times needing to dance in bare feet.  </li>
            <li> It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2),</li>
            <li> Problem solved thanks to emjoi!</li>
            <li> Work very well!</li>
            <li> Abrasive rollers (COARSE) do the job a lot faster - and I love them.</li>
            <li> that they would be work better, but next time I will buy the &amp;#34;Super course&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> ones so that I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot on my heels so many times as with the Xtreme.  </li>
            <li> Works better the coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> Much better than the blue.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a more coarse</li>
            <li> Gave me soft &amp; smooth feet.</li>
            <li> Work better than the blue ones.</li>
            <li> Needed extra refills and glad I ordered these.  </li>
            <li> Works better than the roller it came with because these are less fine grit (think sandpaper).  </li>
            <li> Because it is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more Xtreme rollers when needed.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t worn out the first roller,</li>
            <li> Better with coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> First time it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Like these a lot, they work much better than the blue ones.</li>
            <li> Worked way better than the blue rollers.  </li>
            <li> Works better than the blue ones.</li>
            <li> These are even better the blue ones that come with the emjoi.</li>
            <li> Your feet will be smooth and soft like never before.</li>
            <li> I evidently invented callous formation..</li>
            <li> so much better than the regular ones.</li>
            <li> Really does work with the Emjoi!</li>
            <li> and my feet are so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I thought the roller would be a bit more coarse.</li>
            <li> so happy to finally take care of dry cracked heels!</li>
            <li> These are very coarse and work great for those rough patches on your heels.</li>
            <li> Good value, as they seem to last longer than the regular grade refills!</li>
            <li> This is the refills for it and it is a little more coarse than the refills that come with the original emoji purchase, but I really like it better.</li>
            <li> works really well fits like genuine roller however only good for one time use on both feet and takes about half an hour to get desired results</li>
            <li> Seemed to wear down kind of fast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll know for certain once I change batteries.  </li>
            <li> Really works for summer dry heels :)</li>
            <li> Love the extreme course for first passes.</li>
            <li> the extra cord is just fine.</li>
            <li> I am giving them four stars because they are, in my honest opinion, a little spendy for what they are.</li>
            <li> Keeps my feet soft and pretty!</li>
            <li> but my feet really where like sand paper</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Very aggressive</li>
            <li> These work very well this</li>
            <li> Really like these rollers and are much cheaper than QVC.</li>
            <li> Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> Makes the job much faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d expected a bit more.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Performed better than expected</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is made to stpp if too much pressure is applied.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> it works very well with these rollers...</li>
            <li> works very well....</li>
            <li> I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect it to be very course if you have the machine</li>
            <li> My feet actually feel smooth now.</li>
            <li> They are the only rollers that make my heels smooth.</li>
            <li> Very lightweight</li>
            <li> also can&#x27;t tell much difference between the &#x27;brand name&#x27; rollers and these off-brand ones.</li>
            <li> They absolutely did nothing for my feet.</li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> The emjoi cam with a much calmer one</li>
            <li> These work really well.  </li>
            <li> cause it doesn&#x27;t do much for that issue.</li>
            <li> THESE WORK REALLY</li>
            <li> REALLY</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll very goid</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> This is definitely the choice for you to do the most damage as far as emjoi refills go.</li>
            <li> It keeps the feet smooth and takes those rough spots right off.  </li>
            <li> Great for feet that are extremely callused and rough.</li>
            <li> They only remove the outermost part of calluses and rough spots, more like a finishing or polishing tool than a true remover.  </li>
            <li> and I was glad to find these extreme course roller refills.  </li>
            <li> The rollers last longer if you clean the skin&lt;br /&gt;off</li>
            <li> after using - I use the &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; setting on outside hose to clean mine.</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be the most heavy duty - exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> so far works pretty well</li>
            <li> Second shipment all one kind,  Blue, no green.</li>
            <li> Very good like them a lot just have to be careful not to press hard</li>
            <li> And since it doesn&#x27;t work as it is supposed to one has to use it several times per week just to maintain what little good it does..</li>
            <li> : while it&#x27;s true that they are much coarser, they also have a lot more open surface area in which to trap dead skin cells.</li>
            <li> The green refills are perfect  for hard calloused feet.</li>
            <li> Better than previous refill rollers I purchased.  </li>
            <li> Easily removes rough spots from your feet.</li>
            <li> For light dry skin removal.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need elbow grease with Emoji as it&#x27;s all electric and these green rollers are gentle, yet the most abrasive callous removers for this machine.</li>
            <li> and while I have not used them consistently/regularly enough to remove all of it entirely, they remove so much and definitely make my feet look better!  </li>
            <li> good grit for my tough feet</li>
            <li> If anything, it&#x27;s like polishing concrete.  </li>
            <li> Used it on my husbands feet (and boy were they rough) and he says his feet feel smooth.  </li>
            <li> They really have helped make my feet soft again.</li>
            <li> The other rollers worked fine, but I was having use the Emjoi every day.  </li>
            <li> not coarse enough wears out easily</li>
            <li> These are a lot better than the standard blue rollers, but I still burn through them before my feet are completely free of dead callous skin.  </li>
            <li> If you happen to be one of the lucky few who have very light, superficial calluses and rough spots this would probably work</li>
            <li> With these new rollers it stops everytime I even attempt to touch my foot.</li>
            <li> As for my they are like a new babies ...&lt;</li>
            <li> This product is extremely poorly made, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit securely, stops and comes apart.</li>
            <li> Overall, I do love the concept of the Emjoi, and afterwards I put on super thick lotion</li>
            <li> These look and perform exactly like the brand name Pedi Refill in Xtreme coarse.</li>
            <li> I use these first and finish with the blue rollers.</li>
            <li> Not sure these are any better than the others</li>
            <li> Although you only get bout 3 uses out of each one at first</li>
            <li> wears out fast constantly need new ones</li>
            <li> Excellent rollers and less expensive then anywhere else.</li>
            <li> These are nice for using in the summer or whenever your skin gets really tough.  </li>
            <li> only use one roller annually - so the package of 4 will last for a while - but couldn&#x27;t contemplate being without my emjoi micro pedi - and these coarse rollers are the best for my tough feet!</li>
            <li> These refills are getting there as far as coarseness is concerned.  </li>
            <li> direct replacement.</li>
            <li> Make feet so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> Bought the complete set which contained a finer grit Roller.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> after to keep them soft.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really see the difference between these and the regular rollers.</li>
            <li> defiantly lasts for pretty long time</li>
            <li> They were so soft I could have used them on my face and still wouldn&#x27;t get any results.</li>
            <li> well and does not waste away quickly&lt;</li>
            <li> Love these Xtreme Coarse rollers to eliminate calluses and dead skin from heel and bottom of feet.  </li>
            <li> Since a thick callus (sp?) has no blood flow and no nerve endings we should be able to get something courser than this.</li>
            <li> The other colors are too fine to make a dent in the big toe callus or the heels.</li>
            <li> No really difference noted from the original blue roller IMO.</li>
            <li> Bought the original Micro-Pedi that had the smoother rollers and my wife did not think they were rough enough, so, I bought the Xtreme rollers.</li>
            <li> The other ones work, but these really make your feet smooth and then use the other files to soften.  </li>
            <li> A must have for anyone who don&#x27;t liked dry hard skin on hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the Xtreme Coarse Rollers.</li>
            <li> Do the job very fast, quite rough.</li>
            <li> With the blue rollers I could easily go 15 minutes before the roller needed to be rinsed and dried to regain effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> These work - careful not to hold it in one place too long - definitely makes your heels smooth.</li>
            <li> I used the blue ones first but they were not coarse enough.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed for a man&#x27;s foot, the blue ones that came with the Emjoi were fine for my foot, but the green ones worked miracles on my boyfriend&#x27;s extra rough heels.</li>
            <li> Works better on the tough spots.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of scraping away hard calluses.</li>
            <li> Works very well, have persistent very sensitive and dry thumbs especially and need to &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; occasionally!  </li>
            <li> I was surprised because it is advertised as actual &amp;#34;EMJOI&amp;#34; refills.</li>
            <li> I only have the experience with the factory blue roller, but these are at least 2x&#x27;s more abrasive if not</li>
            <li> This product, especially these green ones, make the most difference in my rough, cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Now the fun part, use Emjoi with these Xtreme rollers, and watch the dead skin fall off.</li>
            <li> In case you didn&#x27;t know, use an old toothbrush to lengthen the life of the rollers (and always keep dry).  </li>
            <li> You will notice some difference if you spend a lot of time going over your feet, but who wants to spend a half an hour three times a week on your feet?  </li>
            <li> I have to do it at least a few times a week because my callouses just come back, but it&#x27;s totally worth the time to have normal, soft feet.  </li>
            <li> Love the roughness of these for tough toe nails!</li>
            <li> When my feet start snagging the sheets, five minutes with these bad boys and its all good.</li>
            <li> they have really helped me be less embarrassed of my feet an bunions!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell much difference between &#x27;green&#x27; and &#x27;blue&#x27; rollers and they last a really long time regardless.  </li>
            <li> You file down more dead skin and don&#x27;t waste your time or batteries.</li>
            <li> but these coarse ones really go after the dead skin!</li>
            <li> Took advice of previous reviewers and purchased very corse refills as I have very dry feet.</li>
            <li> Really sands down the rough spots without abrasion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about ready to trash my Emjoi, it is just not powerful enough for the average person.  </li>
            <li> these seem to be the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; ones, but they don&#x27;t last too long.</li>
            <li> Definitley doesn&#x27;t get down to the soft skin.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed that the replacement rollers don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Gentle enough for me but tough enough for my husband&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> They work, but not for long.</li>
            <li> I think the green and the blue have the same coarse of grit.</li>
            <li> The Xtreme Coarse, cut extremely well ,</li>
            <li> I wish they worked a little faster for my more difficult calluses.</li>
            <li> I have very rough, coarse calluses and cracks</li>
            <li> Work so well to get rid of dry cracked skin on heels.  </li>
            <li> Works well as removing dry, callused skin.  </li>
            <li> I will only use the green Xtreme coarse rollers for now on!</li>
            <li> decades of working on my feet all day render them in pretty poor condition</li>
            <li> I use these only sometimes, usually using the blue ones.  </li>
            <li> NOt much more course than the regular blue ones, but do the job.</li>
            <li> The bottoms of my feet are very dry.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of great reviews before I bought these and was very disappointed when I got them.</li>
            <li> These rollers were a huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> It works for my rough feet.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has really rough heels should also get these besides the ones that come with the unit.  </li>
            <li> AS EXPECTED.  </li>
            <li> Now my feet are extremely rough and I have used everything&lt;br /&gt;on</li>
            <li> doing the job as expected</li>
            <li> but  not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and they last a few months.</li>
            <li> Smooths rough spots almost immediately.</li>
            <li> They work well these for the rough spots and the other to finish.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with other callous remover products or devices.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the other types of refills.</li>
            <li> Work well just like the other refills I have used.</li>
            <li> cause mine are on the extreme side...</li>
            <li> They work extremely well.</li>
            <li> This has resulted in big, hard, rough callouses on both</li>
            <li> Not a great difference from the extra coarse.</li>
            <li> They remove dead, dry skin</li>
            <li> Not effective enough.</li>
            <li> try these in due &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> They get the job done in half the time.</li>
            <li> She spends less time working on her callouses and she thinks her feet are smoother.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why some folks were unhappy with their rollers - either they are not using them properly or they have way super worse feet than mine</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the was just in a little bubble wrap with tape</li>
            <li> Wish they would make some a little bit stronger.</li>
            <li> Put &amp;#34;Callous Blaster&amp;#34; (drugstores/grocery story) on bottom of feet, let sit for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> The brand name came with plastic covers for each roller which this one is missing, but I never use them anyway</li>
            <li> then green ones called &amp;#34;Xtreme Coarse&amp;#34; (#3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> I appreciate this machine&#x27;s ability to do the heavy lifting between pedicures from the professionals.</li>
            <li> It helps, but takes forever and is messy.</li>
            <li> The product description is not accurate.</li>
            <li> Just goes from hard and rough to hard and shiny.</li>
            <li> Really works, I wear flip flops all the time and my feet get bad calluses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure they have a product for people like that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to invest in an electric, professional grade remover because I&#x27;m very sick and tired of messing around with an inferior product that really does not do the job.  </li>
            <li> Use with the Emjoi micro pedi POWER callous remover to clean up those nasty hard dried cracked heels and toes.</li>
            <li> Hardly does anything.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s hard to imagine</li>
            <li> I like to use my emjoi at least once a week.  </li>
            <li> You will need this if your calluses are quite thick.</li>
            <li> you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> after one use, rollers were no good</li>
            <li> He went through socks like crazy because his feet were so rough that they wore holes in the bottom of the socks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s weak</li>
            <li> It seems very dull.</li>
            <li> like these replacements since they are grittier for my tough heels.</li>
            <li> Coarser refills perform bethere on tough heel callouses.</li>
            <li> Have very thick skin.. doesn&#x27;t even seem to make a dent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> Was shocked when these were delivered today.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> Must be some fakes:(</li>
            <li> My husband has terrible callused feet that crack and are painful to walk on.  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These rollers are fantastic. They get the job done in half the time.</li>
            <li> These refills are getting there as far as coarseness is concerned.  Better than previous refill rollers I purchased.  If used faithfully it does keep your feet smooth.</li>
            <li> Works great for those stubborn callouses.</li>
            <li> These refill rollers were return because I also return the pedi they were purchased to go with. Wasn&#x27;t happy with the pedi or how it worked so returned with these rollers</li>
            <li> Junk! This product is extremely poorly made, it doesn&#x27;t seem to fit securely, stops and comes apart.</li>
            <li> It works for my rough feet.</li>
            <li> These work great at keeping my feet callous free</li>
            <li> The product worked as well as described. Easily removes rough spots from your feet.</li>
            <li> Very good product definitely would reccomend</li>
            <li> direct replacement. good quality.</li>
            <li> my wife says she loves them.</li>
            <li> Anyone who has really rough heels should also get these besides the ones that come with the unit.  The other ones work, but these really make your feet smooth and then use the other files to soften.  Excellent product that actually works but get the plug in not the battery operated because if you use any pressure with the battery one it stops rotating.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. I wish I would have known about this year&#x27;s ago. A must have for anyone who don&#x27;t liked dry hard skin on hands and feet. Problem solved thanks to emjoi!</li>
            <li> Work very well! Will buy again when I need replacement.</li>
            <li> I bought the pedi  machine and tried it on my husband and myself both and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;you might find this had to believe but my feet really where like sand paper</li>
            <li> I like these better than the rollers that came with my Emjoi</li>
            <li> GREAT ITEM IS WONDERFUL!!</li>
            <li> so happy to finally take care of dry cracked heels! i bought the electric Emjoi and am impressed with the power and how easy it is too use.the extreme coarse rollers smooth heels that i have soaked,moisturized and even had a podiatrist work on and after using the Emjoiwith the xtreme coarse roller i have smoother heels than i have had for years. can&#x27;t wait for sandal weather.</li>
            <li> So far so good. They work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Critic</li>
            <li> Great service and product!</li>
            <li> Great for the rougher skin on your feet.</li>
            <li> Happy I ordered these, and a great price.</li>
            <li> These rollers are an added value to the micro pedi for tougher areas on callus. They are a bargain when purchasing the micro-pedi.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> If the blue rollers that come with your Micro-Pedi aren&#x27;t course enough, try these.  They do a good job of smoothing rough feet and eliminating callouses.</li>
            <li> Great and great price</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi. These rollers are coarser than the ones that come with the file. They work well these for the rough spots and the other to finish.</li>
            <li> so far works pretty well</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even bother with other callous remover products or devices. This is the best. I&#x27;ve tried everything. You don&#x27;t need elbow grease with Emoji as it&#x27;s all electric and these green rollers are gentle, yet the most abrasive callous removers for this machine. I LOVE IT! You should see my heels!!!!!</li>
            <li> Abrasive rollers (COARSE) do the job a lot faster - and I love them.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  Satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Love the extreme course for first passes.</li>
            <li> The price meet my budget, deliver on time and the product excellent</li>
            <li> not any coarser than the &amp;#34;Extra course&amp;#34;  blue ones.  I was hoping with the word &amp;#34;Xtreme&amp;#34; that they would be work better, but next time I will buy the &amp;#34;Super course&amp;#34; ones so that I don&#x27;t have to keep going over the same spot on my heels so many times as with the Xtreme.  Overall, I do love the concept of the Emjoi, and afterwards I put on super thick lotion and my feet feel like a baby&#x27;s skin.!</li>
            <li> my wife loves it. quickly removes calluses</li>
            <li> Very good, I enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Work great. Very aggressive</li>
            <li> These work very well this my micro-pedi. It would be great if  each roller would last longer, but at least it does the job, unlike the mediocre blue rollers that came with my micro-pedi. I will only use the green Xtreme coarse rollers for now on!</li>
            <li> The best rollers for Micro-Pedi you can buy.</li>
            <li> Seemed to wear down kind of fast.</li>
            <li> Really like these rollers and are much cheaper than QVC.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Works better the coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> these seem to be the &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; ones, but they don&#x27;t last too long. wish they were more durable and more coarse.</li>
            <li> These work great. Delivered fast.</li>
            <li> this is a good product</li>
            <li> These are amazing.  Work so well to get rid of dry cracked skin on heels.  Make feet so soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> pretty good, but, should have lasted longer</li>
            <li> Works very well, have persistent very sensitive and dry thumbs especially and need to &amp;#34;file&amp;#34; occasionally!  Works well</li>
            <li> If you have never tried the emoji, then you should. This is the refills for it and it is a little more coarse than the refills that come with the original emoji purchase, but I really like it better. Will make your feet look smoother for the summer!</li>
            <li> not as course as I thought they would be. I thought these were the &amp;#34;coarsest&amp;#34; you could buy.  No really difference noted from the original blue roller IMO.</li>
            <li> Makes the job much faster. This product is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely the choice for you to do the most damage as far as emjoi refills go.</li>
            <li> Much better than the blue.</li>
            <li> GOOD AS EXPECTED.  I WOULD PURCHASE MORE.</li>
            <li> Not effective enough.</li>
            <li> I think I need some with diamond tipped rock boulders.</li>
            <li> You will need this if your calluses are quite thick.</li>
            <li> Love these!! Can&#x27;t believe I found them for such a good price! All set for summer pedi&#x27;s and pretty feet!!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference between these and the other types of refills. Work well just like the other refills I have used.</li>
            <li> Get this. It&#x27;s very good.</li>
            <li> Not a great difference from the extra coarse. I&#x27;d expected a bit more.</li>
            <li> I bought these to get extra exfoliating power. They work, but not for long.Expect around 6-8 uses, then diminishing effectiveness. I apply to both feet, at great toes and heel regions,Over time, it&#x27;s cheaper and more convenient than visiting the manicurist.  Besides, they don&#x27;t have clean ones.  They&#x27;re used between clients. Could spread disease.</li>
            <li> These worked perfectly. Gentle enough for me but tough enough for my husband&#x27;s feet.</li>
            <li> wears out fast constantly need new ones</li>
            <li> Bought the complete set which contained a finer grit Roller.&lt;br /&gt;I like these replacements since they are grittier for my tough heels.</li>
            <li> Disappointed. These rollers really didn&#x27;t work much better/faster than the bright blue ones than were included with the Emjoi machine, and here&#x27;s why: while it&#x27;s true that they are much coarser, they also have a lot more open surface area in which to trap dead skin cells. With the blue rollers I could easily go 15 minutes before the roller needed to be rinsed and dried to regain effectiveness. The green was closer to 3 minutes, and even rotating the four rollers the whole process ended up being slower, because a roller won&#x27;t air-dry in 9 minutes. Granted, end-of-winter feet are more renovation than maintenance, but still I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> Love these rollers.  Keeping my feet smooth as silk in between pedicures.</li>
            <li> Good description easy transaction Thanks</li>
            <li> The Micro-Pedi is the best tool for rough feet around  I had some problems with my feet after&lt;br /&gt;getting a pedicure and had to go to the foot doctor for every couple of weeks for a year and used&lt;br /&gt;lots of steroid crème on my feet.  Now my feet are extremely rough and I have used everything&lt;br /&gt;on the market and sleep in socks with Vaseline or some foot crème nightly.  The Micro-Pedi gets&lt;br /&gt;the rough skin off as good as the tool the foot doctor used.  I cannot say enough good things about&lt;br /&gt;this product - so that said - the refill rollers are wonderful.  The rollers last longer if you clean the skin&lt;br /&gt;off after using - I use the &amp;#34;stream&amp;#34; setting on outside hose to clean mine.</li>
            <li> I grind and i grind and i grind....  Have very thick skin.. doesn&#x27;t even seem to make a dent. Definitley doesn&#x27;t get down to the soft skin.  If anything, it&#x27;s like polishing concrete.  Just goes from hard and rough to hard and shiny.</li>
            <li> doing the job as expected</li>
            <li> Same great products for much lower price!!</li>
            <li> The emoji is the bomb.  It does an awesome job on removing rough spots on your feet.  It feels as if you have had a pedicure.  Start with an Epsom salt soak and then Emoji .  Try some coconut oil as your finish for the softest feet ever.</li>
            <li> I could&#x27;ve saved myself 80 dollars and purchased a foot file...</li>
            <li> In case you didn&#x27;t know, use an old toothbrush to lengthen the life of the rollers (and always keep dry).  I like to use my emjoi at least once a week.  Im a dancer and on my feet a lot many times needing to dance in bare feet.  These rollers keep my feet happy, smooth and cleaner looking and I like that they last and are well made.</li>
            <li> works great, good price</li>
            <li> Work great, use them all the time.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the was just in a little bubble wrap with tape but they fit and work great.</li>
            <li> Refills and they are very good ones.</li>
            <li> Performed better than expected</li>
            <li> I chose these Refill Rollers for Emjoi Micro-Pedi because I saved money by buying a four pack of these as compared to buying a two pack of the originals. Also, the reviews said they worked just as well and even though I&#x27;ve never used the originals, I find these to work great.</li>
            <li> just what I needed ! thank you</li>
            <li> These are very coarse and work great for those rough patches on your heels.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be a more coarse but they do the job.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted and needed.</li>
            <li> great price! Glad I find them here</li>
            <li> use the constantly to keep my heels and feet nice and smooth. I use baby diaper rash ointment  after to keep them soft. But these work!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel the (Xtreme Coarse Rollers) were any better than the original rollers that came with my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  I was a bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> the extra cord is just fine. I was pleased but not blown away. decades of working on my feet all day render them in pretty poor condition I&#x27;m not sure they have a product for people like that but these work just fine</li>
            <li> I love my Emjoi and these refills are awesome!!</li>
            <li> Best - these things work Great!</li>
            <li> The Emjoi is made to stpp if too much pressure is applied.  With these new rollers it stops everytime I even attempt to touch my foot.</li>
            <li> Works great with my emoji.  The coarseness is perfect for getting my feet summer ready.</li>
            <li> I need to order ones that would get a bit deeper!  But the Emjoi Micro-Pedi is great!</li>
            <li> Gave me soft &amp; smooth feet. Love!</li>
            <li> Works like the original.</li>
            <li> I read a ton of great reviews before I bought these and was very disappointed when I got them. They don&#x27;t work nearly as good as the actual emjoi ones. It takes forever to get anywhere</li>
            <li> Wow, these are effective rollers for callouses.  My method: 1. Soak feet for 10 minutes in foot spa  2.  Put &amp;#34;Callous Blaster&amp;#34; (drugstores/grocery story) on bottom of feet, let sit for a few minutes. 3.  Now the fun part, use Emjoi with these Xtreme rollers, and watch the dead skin fall off. It will amaze you. I have to do it at least a few times a week because my callouses just come back, but it&#x27;s totally worth the time to have normal, soft feet.  I&#x27;m addicted to this product!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Very satisfied</li>
            <li> A great way to smooth even the roughest of calluses. And I have them! Use it and then put on a great&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer and your feet and heels will be smooth for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you~</li>
            <li> These are the coarsest ones I&#x27;ve used and the only ones that are remotely effective. The other colors are too fine to make a dent in the big toe callus or the heels. Even these, however take a whole lot of rubbing to effect significant change. They are very handy to use on dry feet. White &amp;#34;dust&amp;#34; flies everywhere, but lots of &amp;#34;sanding&amp;#34; is required to make a big difference and they must be replaced often. Lots of $.</li>
            <li> Love these!  Love the Emjoi and these rollers are good if you have a lot of callous build-up but be careful not to over use them!</li>
            <li> GOOD TO WORK WITH THE MACHINE.</li>
            <li> I have not tried this roller yet, but plan on it.  I expect this product to be as good as the other two rollers.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of removing callouses .</li>
            <li> Work better than the blue ones.</li>
            <li> Really sands down the rough spots without abrasion.</li>
            <li> These are terrible. I&#x27;m blown by the many positive reviews. They don&#x27;t last but one use and the surface is very gritty but looses all grit immediately. The original ones are way better</li>
            <li> These are supposed to be the most heavy duty - exactly what I need.  Works just fine.</li>
            <li> Use with the Emjoi micro pedi POWER callous remover to clean up those nasty hard dried cracked heels and toes.</li>
            <li> Needed extra refills and glad I ordered these.  They work just fine.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed for a man&#x27;s foot, the blue ones that came with the Emjoi were fine for my foot, but the green ones worked miracles on my boyfriend&#x27;s extra rough heels.</li>
            <li> removes callus quickly</li>
            <li> good grit for my tough feet</li>
            <li> These are great.  I bought the Emjoi Pedi initially w/the blue rollers and I feel these are better in that they get rid of more callous material.  I&#x27;ll know for certain once I change batteries.  That&#x27;s the trick.  You need to change batteries rather often-after every 4 uses or so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good  but  not what I expected.</li>
            <li> Not as abrasive as anticipated.  Didn&#x27;t really see the difference between these and the regular rollers.</li>
            <li> Hardly does anything.  Pumice stone much much better...</li>
            <li> Great replacement for the originals.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery and product is as described. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the mouse sander</li>
            <li> Just tried the Emjoi Micro Pedi.  Love it it works very well with these rollers...just a light touch.</li>
            <li> after one use, rollers were no good</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great service from Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Love these.  They are coarse which is what I was looking for.  Great price and Service.</li>
            <li> Thank you for your quick service! Happy customer! 👍🏼👏🏼</li>
            <li> Works better than the roller it came with because these are less fine grit (think sandpaper).  I have achieved a better result though it takes more than one attempt and you have to keep up the maintenance because it doesn&#x27;t just stay smooth.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it&#x27;s electric; easier than rubbing by hand.</li>
            <li> Works great....I wish the devices came with one Xtreme refill. Because it is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> These file heads work the best for very course and calused feet</li>
            <li> These are nice for using in the summer or whenever your skin gets really tough.  I use these only sometimes, usually using the blue ones.  These are the heavier duty ones or as I like them &amp;#34;the Big Boys&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Work great!&lt;br /&gt;Bought pack and split with my daughter.</li>
            <li> Product as described, prompt shipper.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, my feet get rough and this produce took care of it the first I used it! I would order again.</li>
            <li> takes a mm off every 2 days</li>
            <li> Wish they would make some a little bit stronger.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Better than any razor or buffer I know of. Green extra course is the best for big toe callouses, especially important to have during sandals weather.</li>
            <li> Bought the original Micro-Pedi that had the smoother rollers and my wife did not think they were rough enough, so, I bought the Xtreme rollers. She really likes the Xtreme rollers more than the smoother ones. She spends less time working on her callouses and she thinks her feet are smoother. Will definitely buy more Xtreme rollers when needed.</li>
            <li> These are not the &amp;#34;official Emjoy rollers&amp;#34; but they work a treat. They remove dead, dry skin and I haven&#x27;t worn out the first roller, yet and I&#x27;ve used it several times. I am giving them four stars because they are, in my honest opinion, a little spendy for what they are. I&#x27;ll keep buying them tho because they do work great.</li>
            <li> Works better on the tough spots.</li>
            <li> Works great and shipped fast!</li>
            <li> There is a difference to the &amp;#34;coarseness&amp;#34; of this refill roller than the one ithe Emjoi came with...</li>
            <li> Works well. Leaves my feet very smooth</li>
            <li> Love this product for in-between pedicures.</li>
            <li> These look and perform exactly like the brand name Pedi Refill in Xtreme coarse. I put them side to side, tried using it and see no difference in the roller itself. The brand name came with plastic covers for each roller which this one is missing, but I never use them anyway once I take it out of the package and put it on my Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> These rollers work great and are perfect for use in between pedis! I have very rough, coarse calluses and cracks and while I have not used them consistently/regularly enough to remove all of it entirely, they remove so much and definitely make my feet look better!  I&#x27;m not sure why some folks were unhappy with their rollers - either they are not using them properly or they have way super worse feet than mine and that&#x27;s hard to imagine cause mine are on the extreme side...</li>
            <li> Great product, great price</li>
            <li> I am so glad I bought these they&#x27;re great</li>
            <li> Great value and they last a few months. Really make calluses smooth within minutes.</li>
            <li> these are great very well packaged quick delivery thank you</li>
            <li> good deal on these replacement rollers for my Emjoi.  They work great.</li>
            <li> awesome, very coarse does the job even better than the one the sander comes with.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality.  I think these are better than the original blue roller that came with my Emjoi.</li>
            <li> works very well.... you will like!!!</li>
            <li> Since childhood, I&#x27;ve always worn thongs daily; in adulthood, 12 months a year. (Don&#x27;t get all excited--moderns call these flip-flops!) This has resulted in big, hard, rough callouses on both feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! I have a whole kit of scrubbers, pumices, graters and razors, all of which were a hell of a lot of work for spare results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the Emjoi Micro-Pedi (corded model, 110-240V) got rid of most of the callous with about a half-hour&#x27;s light work with the roller shipped with the machine. (Yes, it does require a bit of cleaning as its sandpaper gets clogged with callous dust. I cleaned the roller dry with an old toothbrush, much more effective than using the brush that came with.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;d like coarser rollers to make lighter work. It would appear the original Emjoi bright blue rollers are called &amp;#34;Extra Coarse&amp;#34; (#1), followed by a duller blue roller called &amp;#34;Super Coarse&amp;#34; (#2), then green ones called &amp;#34;Xtreme Coarse&amp;#34; (#3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will try these in due &amp;#34;coarse&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> NOt much more course than the regular blue ones, but do the job. Don&#x27;t expect it to be very course if you have the machine you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> The item was smaller than I anticipated. Great price. Seller shipped quick and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Coarser refills perform bethere on tough heel callouses.</li>
            <li> This Micro pedi is awsome&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe  how well it works.better then a profectional manacure.</li>
            <li> Very good like them a lot just have to be careful not to press hard or you&#x27;ll remove skin.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! Better with coarse rollers.</li>
            <li> theses are awesome  !!!!! the emjoi has been a God send for me . Help my heels like nothing else. Now I have smooth heels.</li>
            <li> Took advice of previous reviewers and purchased very corse refills as I have very dry feet. First time it worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Great product. The extra coarse help exfoliate your feet.</li>
            <li> They work good must be cleaned regularly to maintain effectiveness.</li>
            <li> Much better than what came with the device.</li>
            <li> Like these a lot, they work much better than the blue ones.</li>
            <li> Really works, I wear flip flops all the time and my feet get bad calluses but this reallllly works to smooth them out.</li>
            <li> If these came in a category called &amp;#34;jackhammer&amp;#34; coarseness...I would order those!  The Xtreme coarse ARE really good - and my feet, and my hubby - are happy!</li>
            <li> these micro pedi refill rollers work really great</li>
            <li> They fit my Emjoi and work as well as those I received with product. Bought at Amazon instead of QVC what a saving on the rollers.</li>
            <li> These fit perfectly in my Emjoi Micro-Pedi.  They&#x27;re okay, but not as good as the original Emjoi rollers.</li>
            <li> These in no way should be classified as &amp;#34;xtreme&amp;#34; roller refills.  They only remove the outermost part of calluses and rough spots, more like a finishing or polishing tool than a true remover.  They also wear out very quickly.  You will notice some difference if you spend a lot of time going over your feet, but who wants to spend a half an hour three times a week on your feet?  I&#x27;m about ready to trash my Emjoi, it is just not powerful enough for the average person.  If you happen to be one of the lucky few who have very light, superficial calluses and rough spots this would probably work okay, but most of us aren&#x27;t in that boat.  I&#x27;m going to invest in an electric, professional grade remover because I&#x27;m very sick and tired of messing around with an inferior product that really does not do the job.  And since it doesn&#x27;t work as it is supposed to one has to use it several times per week just to maintain what little good it does..</li>
            <li> Great for feet that are extremely callused and rough. Used it on my husbands feet (and boy were they rough) and he says his feet feel smooth.  He went through socks like crazy because his feet were so rough that they wore holes in the bottom of the socks. Now, we won&#x27;t have to worry about buying socks so often. Highly recommend the Xtreme Coarse Rollers.</li>
            <li> worked well but has to be switched quickly</li>
            <li> Works great does an amazing job!!</li>
            <li> Worked way better than the blue rollers.  My feet actually feel smooth now. Will never go back to the blue rollers.</li>
            <li> Excellent fit for the mini. Works great on the feet.</li>
            <li> These Xtreme refills are the BEST!!  Helps take care of my &amp;#34;winter feet&amp;#34; really quickly!  Good value, as they seem to last longer than the regular grade refills!</li>
            <li> Good product not much to say about it, I would recommend to a friend!</li>
            <li> I will be purchasing more!</li>
            <li> The mico-pedi refill rollers (Xtreme coarse) work great.  They are the only rollers that make my heels smooth.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased these.  I will not spend time waiting for extra one&#x27;s to arrive.  Great item!</li>
            <li> this is almost as good as getting a pedicure! defiantly lasts for pretty long time</li>
            <li> This product, especially these green ones, make the most difference in my rough, cracked heels. When my feet start snagging the sheets, five minutes with these bad boys and its all good.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Works better than the blue ones. They rock and roll over my feet and my spouse&#x27;s too.</li>
            <li> Great price, fast service.</li>
            <li> Works well, very impressed with results</li>
            <li> These work - careful not to hold it in one place too long - definitely makes your heels smooth.</li>
            <li> so glad it comes in this grade of courseness.</li>
            <li> Would not buy again.  Very lightweight</li>
            <li> I love my Emjoi callus remover and these are perfect for my stubborn callus.</li>
            <li> Good service and product.</li>
            <li> Better than a pedicure.</li>
            <li> Buy this. It&#x27;s not too strong and it works much better than the original.</li>
            <li> These are a lot better than the standard blue rollers, but I still burn through them before my feet are completely free of dead callous skin.  Since a thick callus (sp?) has no blood flow and no nerve endings we should be able to get something courser than this.</li>
            <li> Great transaction. All went well!</li>
            <li> Was shocked when these were delivered today.</li>
            <li> Works great for tougher jobs. I use these first and finish with the blue rollers.</li>
            <li> This product is perfect for my extra rough heels.  The other rollers worked fine, but I was having use the Emjoi every day.  Now I can go 3-4 days without the Emjoi.</li>
            <li> Does a fantastic job of scraping away hard calluses.</li>
            <li> These do a great job!</li>
            <li> works really well fits like genuine roller however only good for one time use on both feet and takes about half an hour to get desired results</li>
            <li> Works well for rougher spots.</li>
            <li> This a great device and these heavy duty rollers are great for real problem areas.</li>
            <li> I think the green and the blue have the same coarse of grit. I would say it&#x27;s in the range of 240 grit sand paper. Works good buy it you will not regret it.</li>
            <li> Great value. Came quickly and fit the emjoi perfectly.  Will buy these again.  Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t tell much difference between &#x27;green&#x27; and &#x27;blue&#x27; rollers and they last a really long time regardless.  also can&#x27;t tell much difference between the &#x27;brand name&#x27; rollers and these off-brand ones.</li>
            <li> These work great with the Emjoi Micro-Pedi.</li>
            <li> It sucked as a matter of fact took back the micro pedi it&#x27;s weak</li>
            <li> These are perfect for very calloused feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally talked my hubby into letting me attack his feet.  In 3 sessions I took away years worth of callous buildup.from his feet.  As for my they are like a new babies ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my Emjoi so much I bought 3 more as gifts.</li>
            <li> I purchased a Emjoi Micro Pedi and my wife needed some refills.  These are more coarse and supposedly do a better job.  I&#x27;m just writing the review on this one based on feedback but rest assure that if my wife says it works then it works because she is more picky than I am and that&#x27;s saying a heck of a lot.</li>
            <li> Excellent rollers and less expensive then anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Not sure these are any better than the others</li>
            <li> These rollers were a huge disappointment. They absolutely did nothing for my feet. They were so soft I could have used them on my face and still wouldn&#x27;t get any results. Must be some fakes:(</li>
            <li> get these!  They work best!</li>
            <li> fast delivery, product as described</li>
            <li> The whole Micro-Pedi devise is awesome.  Just start course to fine rollers.</li>
            <li> Excellent rollers, should have bought sooner.</li>
            <li> Work good on time a go all around</li>
            <li> These are great.  The emjoi cam with a much calmer one but these coarse ones really go after the dead skin!</li>
            <li> Great addition to the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Pro Foot Buffer.  I have yet to swap out from the original roller, but think that the coarser roller will be great.</li>
            <li> great product  to smooth down your feet&lt;br /&gt;works well and does not waste away quickly&lt;br /&gt;very satisfied with product</li>
            <li> not coarse enough wears out easily</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the refill yet but I bet it will do the job.</li>
            <li> Love the roughness of these for tough toe nails!</li>
            <li> These work great and a lot cheaper.  Very pleased and I will order again.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, so much better than the standard rollers.</li>
            <li> These are even better the blue ones that come with the emjoi. They really have helped make my feet soft again.</li>
            <li> Love the emjoi Micro-Pedi and these work great</li>
            <li> Absolutely love Emjoi products. Originally I bought the regular (blue) roller and then decided to go with the coarser ones (these) and made the best decision. These work so good. Your feet will be smooth and soft like never before. They feel better after using these roller than after a salon pedicure. Definitely an awesome purchase.</li>
            <li> It is very effective, save time compare with blue one.</li>
            <li> Quick ship, great product, as advertised, would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> These are not actual Emjoi rollers. I was surprised because it is advertised as actual &amp;#34;EMJOI&amp;#34; refills. I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These refill rollers are great!</li>
            <li> Perfection.......I evidently invented callous formation..</li>
            <li> These work really well.  Smooths rough spots almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Best purchase for Summer soles EVER! I appreciate this machine&#x27;s ability to do the heavy lifting between pedicures from the professionals.</li>
            <li> The Xtreme Coarse, cut extremely well ,</li>
            <li> Arrived quick as a flash. They work extremely well.</li>
            <li> very happy...and my feet are happy</li>
            <li> These refills work just fine.</li>
            <li> I love the Emjoi Micro-Pedi Refill Rollers (Xtreme Pedi Active works great on my husbands feet. I will continue to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;The service was excellent  !!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again,&lt;br /&gt;ML</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if I would by these or the Pedi again. It helps, but takes forever and is messy. For light dry skin removal. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend for cracked heels cause it doesn&#x27;t do much for that issue.</li>
            <li> It said it was a more coarse roller, but it is not producing very good results. It seems very dull. I am not that impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> The product description is not accurate. The rollers are a miniature version of the&lt;br /&gt;rollers by the same name. I believe these rollers are for the EMJOI NANO.&lt;br /&gt;The product needs to be relabeled or a better description.</li>
            <li> so much better than the regular ones.</li>
            <li> THESE WORK REALLY WELL...WISH I WOULD HAVE SEEN THE OFFER ON TV WITH THE &amp;#34;LIFE TIME REFILL ROLLERS&amp;#34; BUT IM OKAY WITH THAT</li>
            <li> I love all Micro-Pedi products and this is no exception.  Works well as removing dry, callused skin.  Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed Ah!  Really does work with the Emjoi!</li>
            <li> Needed the more coarse ones and these work better.</li>
            <li> The bottoms of my feet are very dry. I use the coarse Micro-Pedi rollers once a week and my feet are so smooth and soft. Love the product</li>
            <li> These are great. Very effective. You file down more dead skin and don&#x27;t waste your time or batteries.</li>
            <li> excellent, does an amazing job, smooths your feet, and softens them, who needs a pedicure</li>
            <li> These work great and fit the plug-in Emjoi perfectly...they have really helped me be less embarrassed of my feet an bunions!</li>
            <li> These work pretty well.  I wish they worked a little faster for my more difficult calluses.</li>
            <li> These coarse rollers are perfect for someone who always walks barefoot and I do. I thought they would hurt being extremely course but they are great!</li>
            <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve used yet. Do the job very fast, quite rough. Just beware of your toes, I did scrape some skin with these.</li>
            <li> refill for the Micro-Pedi, I have not had to use them</li>
            <li> I purchased the Emjoi Pedi about a month ago.  I have noticed that the replacement rollers don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> Not as course as you might want</li>
            <li> only use one roller annually - so the package of 4 will last for a while - but couldn&#x27;t contemplate being without my emjoi micro pedi - and these coarse rollers are the best for my tough feet!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE THESE!! THEY WORK REALLY WELL AND LAST LONGER THAN OTHERS!!!</li>
            <li> I only have the experience with the factory blue roller, but these are at least 2x&#x27;s more abrasive if not 3x&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> These are definitely the best to get a lot off of your feet.. I used the blue ones first but they were not coarse enough. but these ones do the job well!</li>
            <li> Really works for summer dry heels :)</li>
            <li> NOT AS COARSE AS I THOUGHT,BUT WORKS PRETTY GOOD</li>
            <li> I thought the roller would be a bit more coarse.</li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll very goid</li>
            <li> Only way to use your Gemini buffer is with these babies.</li>
            <li> These are exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Great product, easy to install and last a long time</li>
            <li> I ordered these along with the machine. My husband has terrible callused feet that crack and are painful to walk on.  Although you only get bout 3 uses out of each one at first if you keep at it, they will last longer as your feet are getting smoother and smoother. I have used it two days in a row and my husbands feet are the softest I can remember in our 20 years of marriage.</li>
            <li> Good purchase!!  Use with Emjoi Micro-Pedi electric unit.  Feet are softer than ever!</li>
            <li> nice for my feet especially in the cold weather</li>
            <li> Everything handled perfectly.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product. The green refills are perfect  for hard calloused feet.</li>
            <li> 1st shipment lost in mail.  Second shipment all one kind,  Blue, no green.</li>
            <li> Love it, love it, love it!  Got the whole system and can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. Best prices too, (and I shopped around!)</li>
            <li> I have had my Emjoi for a couple of years now and I was glad to find these extreme course roller refills.  They work great for both my husband and myself.  We use it regularly.  It keeps the feet smooth and takes those rough spots right off.  Great purchase</li>
            <li> Work well smoothing out my callouses.</li>
            <li> These are a must for maintaining my heels during the winter!</li>
            <li> Love these!  Even better than the original ones.</li>
            <li> Love these Xtreme Coarse rollers to eliminate calluses and dead skin from heel and bottom of feet.  Keeps my feet soft and pretty!</li>
            <li> Excellent price, and so far they work great.</li>
