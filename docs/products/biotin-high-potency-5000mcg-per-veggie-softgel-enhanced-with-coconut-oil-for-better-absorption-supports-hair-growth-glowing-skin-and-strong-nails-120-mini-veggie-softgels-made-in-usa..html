            <li>So I would recommend to take at your own discretion!!!</li>
            <li>AND I HAD NO PROBLEMS AND HAD GREAT RESULTS!</li>
            <li>but I did break out incredibly.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this product as I am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li>I am a happy camper  </li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the great reviews in the hopes that it would help my hair.</li>
            <li>I am so happy about that alone.  </li>
            <li>I decided to start with biotin and have found this brand to be very effective.  </li>
            <li>now it has been quite amazing!  </li>
            <li>but after a month, it was healthy and beautiful!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never in my life had nice nails!)</li>
            <li>But, I decided to give the product a fair try and took it anyways.  </li>
            <li>Also this company buys good reviews from people.</li>
            <li>Will update with more info soon!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li>but my skin looks AMAZING</li>
            <li>Because I didn&#x27;t like the price I was paying for those vitamins ($35 - $75 a month), I started doing my own research and bought this Biotin as well as another bottle of Pygeum combined with Saw Palmetto (to decrease the DHEA from testosterone which shrinks the hair follicles).  </li>
            <li>To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect to see results this soon.</li>
            <li>I have noticed SIGNIFICANT differences in the health and quality of my hair!!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this supplement and will surely continue to take it to maintain these results.</li>
            <li>They offer a free bottle of pills if you leave a good review.</li>
            <li>In full disclosure, this company has offered a complementary refill bottle in exchange for a fair and honest review after purchase.</li>
            <li>Too potent and made my face break out.  </li>
            <li>Also, many reviewers noted flare ups of cystic acne.</li>
            <li>Once I was able to tolerate it I started taking it once a day and the acne returned with avengents.  </li>
            <li>After using this  product for a month, I  am confident saying that it does not work.</li>
            <li>In a week, my face was more even toned.  </li>
            <li>Every day my skin became more supple, dewy and taut.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>After 2 weeks, my hair is healthy, voluptuous, and has a beautiful natural shine to it that I have never had before.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE the size of the capsules; they&#x27;re extremely easy to swallow and make the experience that much better.</li>
            <li>So many of the reviews are just blabber to get some free products.  </li>
            <li>I am looking forward to continuing use of this product to see the full effects for my locks!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re taking it for one reason, be prepared to notice some other wonderful advantages to taking this product.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s been so easy to quit.</li>
            <li>but now they chip, break easy, and come off in layers.</li>
            <li>This is not the only product that contains this controversial ingredient!!</li>
            <li>After the first day, I had a spontaneous breakout of acne on my face.</li>
            <li>I experienced no hair/nail growth or improvement when taking this for the short amount of time that I did.</li>
            <li>This company will SEND you a FREE (FREE.</li>
            <li>YES FREE) bottle of vitamins if you write a review for them.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve tried cheap forms of biotin before, and they haven&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li>And with the opportunity to get a FREE bottle?</li>
            <li>THE GOOD REVIEWS WERE ONLY WRITTEN TO GET A FREE BOTTLE!</li>
            <li>These capsules are NOT vegan friendly, despite their marketed claims.</li>
            <li>MY HAIR HAS BEEN PRETTY HEALTHY</li>
            <li>morning and evening)--your mileage may vary but keep in mind that biotin is water soluble, so taking several pills at once will probably not be more effective than just one at a time.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product if your having any trouble growing your hair or even just wanting healthier and more beautiful hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Based on my good experience with the first bottle, I purchased several more.  </li>
            <li>I was taking the whole food brands and my nails were long, strong and beautiful.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much softer and I can now go longer between washes because it stays so clean and healthy, and shampoos are too damaging to my hair.</li>
            <li>In terms of growth, I will update my review after 30 and 60 days of the product to see if that is actually true.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure they can rival any salon nails ;)</li>
            <li>I look like I did five years ago when I was pregnant and at my loveliest-healthy, glowing and radiant.</li>
            <li>Overall, very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I use it with a high potency rosehip vitamin c supplement primarily for my skin&#x27;s health and am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I stopped taking the biotin yesterday, and like magic, my skin is mostly clear today.</li>
            <li>They rarely grow to the ends of my fingers.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t afford those expensive vitamins anymore, though, and this product filled the bill perfectly to help with my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought maybe it was due to all the supplements I was on for my workouts and that maybe it just wasn&#x27;t a good combination with my protein and fat burner powders</li>
            <li>RIGHT THEN</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in my skin and perhaps slightly less hair in the shower drain, so that&#x27;s good too.</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, it&#x27;s clear that they are already a little better than before, so I am very pleased with this low-cost option</li>
            <li>I will continue using one more bottle of Biotin and report back.</li>
            <li>and it felt much stronger and healthier!</li>
            <li>I ordered the first bottle and took one a day.  </li>
            <li>My hair and skin are softer, hair seems thicker and a bit longer in only a week on top of the fact that it gave me a bit of an energy boost.</li>
            <li>First, I stopped the T-cream (which had been prescribed by my doctor for libido).  </li>
            <li>How can this company pushing gmo free and all natural ingredients when they put junk in there.</li>
            <li>AND NOTICED SOOOOO MUCH SHEDDING IN MY HAIR!</li>
            <li>I GOT MY REGULAR HAIR TRIM TO MAKE SURE</li>
            <li>I have almost finished my first bottle, and my nails are stronger.  </li>
            <li>I will be switching back to a more reputable brand, hopefully it won&#x27;t take my nails too long to recover.</li>
            <li>It has definitely grown more since taking High Potency</li>
            <li>I will not say it has completely cleared that up, but it has eased it tremendously.  </li>
            <li>First of all, when it arrived, there was an offer in the box that implied you would get a free bottle if you left a 5-star review.</li>
            <li>AS I WAS GETTING READY TO ORDER MY USUAL GNC BIOTIN, I CAME ACROSS THIS BRAND AND DECIDED TO TRY IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS; AND</li>
            <li>I have noticed a tremendously positive change in my hair since I started using this combination, and the cost is extremely reasonable for both products.  </li>
            <li>Also, my fine lines have filled in a little bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I already had fine hair, and now I&#x27;ve lost about a third of what I did have.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is growing fast too.</li>
            <li>Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li>So it really depends on your skin type.  </li>
            <li>This made so much of my hair fall out.</li>
            <li>They are so long and strong</li>
            <li>I have very acne prone skin and was on Accutane for over 2 years, so now am very careful about what I use and take so as to not cause any more acne.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant hair growth (as it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks)</li>
            <li>But as soon as I ordered biotin, my hair grew immensely and I could see the difference right away!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different vitamins and products and this has been the only one where I&#x27;ve noticed a real change in my hair.  </li>
            <li>There has to be a better solution for hair/ nail growth- not worth the side effects.</li>
            <li>There are many nutritional options and people probably respond differently to each type, depending on their specific circumstances.  </li>
            <li>hair (which is in desperate need of a cut and therefore would not look nice otherwise) is healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li>The dose is way too high.</li>
            <li>I chose it because it had a high rating for quality.  </li>
            <li>Had high hopes but did not work out.</li>
            <li>I started taking this on the advice of a friend for my hair and it has made a HUGE difference in that, and the dryness of my skin has lessened, and absolutely NO increase in breakouts (acne).  </li>
            <li>My hair grew at normal rate.</li>
            <li>They are working :D. I love Garden of Life Vitamin Code Raw Prenatal Multivitamin, for women.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m semi-prone to acne flare ups even as an adult, but I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple for weeks even during hormonal changes when they&#x27;re most likely to crop up for</li>
            <li>I expect it would take 3-6 months to really see a major difference in hair like mine.  </li>
            <li>Not only have my fingernails grown in luxuriously long and strong</li>
            <li>After a bit over a month I have noticed more shedding than usual.</li>
            <li>If you are acne-prone or have sensitive skin, please rethink this product!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to notice changes in my facial skin within the first week or two.</li>
            <li>lost so far!)</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to any extra speed in growth, as my ends have been a little damaged due to some highlights I am trying to grow out, but the DENSITY of my hair at the scalp is amazing!  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND A COMBINATION OF NATURAL OILS.</li>
            <li>Getting ready to start my second bottle</li>
            <li>I am 54 years old, and my hair has shine again.  </li>
            <li>I ran out of my supply and decided to try this brand instead of sticking with my old one because of its rave reviews.  </li>
            <li>I contacted this company direct through their website with no response.</li>
            <li>I thought I was just misinterpreting how much hair I was suddenly seeing in my comb, but nope--</li>
            <li>and my skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>AND I USED ALL NATURAL HAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li>Although I wish they would stop breaking completely, my nails have grown longer, they do not peel and crack anymore, and I am no longer embarrassed by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The beneficial.effects have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li>This brand seems a little more expensive than many other brands, but a bottle should easily last 2-4 months, depending on how many you take.  </li>
            <li>The pills are small and easy to swallow.  </li>
            <li>In order to fairly assess the benefits of the product, I didn&#x27;t add any topical treatments for my nails, or any other action I haven&#x27;t been doing over the past year.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s January and my hair shed waaaaaaay more than usual on a daily basis!!!</li>
            <li>So I started taking it every other day, which made less pimples more tolerable.  </li>
            <li>After a few months of supplements I finally had strong nails that didn&#x27;t break constantly.</li>
            <li>Literally 100 or MORE bumps consisting of tiny hard pimples, whiteheads, and deep cystic acne.</li>
            <li>have been worse than usual, and my hair and skin not too great either.</li>
            <li>I have been taking two pills once a day for 16 days so far (total 10,000mg per day).</li>
            <li>My husband recently bought these for me after I relaxed my hair over 2 years of being natural, regretted it and decided to &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; (cut all my relaxed hair off).  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s only been a month so far.</li>
            <li>make matters worse,my 18 yr old daughter took them and have expirenced the same thing!</li>
            <li>Additionally there has been no improvement in my thin fingernails, although I have been getting more hangnails.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two months and already I&#x27;ve noticed positive changes in my hair!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small pill so its easy to take and its soft and doesn&#x27;t have a bitter taste at all.</li>
            <li>the first two weeks, my nails continued to peel and break, but now that the old bad parts are mostly gone, the nails do seem a bit stronger and aren&#x27;t peeling or breaking.</li>
            <li>I was very skeptical when buying this product at first for many reasons: 1)</li>
            <li>As i&#x27;ve gotten older i&#x27;ve noticed my hair shedding more than I remember, a general thinning overall, and have had an incredibly hard time growing it past my collarbone.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with my hair due to constant dyeing but the real problem happened when I bleached my hair 3x in one day.</li>
            <li>have very long, fine hair, so it&#x27;s hard to judge if the product has promoted growth.  </li>
            <li>The only downside is if you&#x27;re not a fan of drinking water you may get acne due to the high dosage.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> I will continue using one more bottle of Biotin and report back.</li>
            <li> and it felt much stronger and healthier!</li>
            <li> I ordered the first bottle and took one a day.  </li>
            <li> My hair and skin are softer, hair seems thicker and a bit longer in only a week on top of the fact that it gave me a bit of an energy boost.</li>
            <li> First, I stopped the T-cream (which had been prescribed by my doctor for libido).  </li>
            <li> How can this company pushing gmo free and all natural ingredients when they put junk in there.</li>
            <li> AND NOTICED SOOOOO MUCH SHEDDING IN MY HAIR!</li>
            <li> I GOT MY REGULAR HAIR TRIM TO MAKE SURE</li>
            <li> I have almost finished my first bottle, and my nails are stronger.  </li>
            <li> I will be switching back to a more reputable brand, hopefully it won&#x27;t take my nails too long to recover.</li>
            <li> It has definitely grown more since taking High Potency</li>
            <li> I will not say it has completely cleared that up, but it has eased it tremendously.  </li>
            <li> First of all, when it arrived, there was an offer in the box that implied you would get a free bottle if you left a 5-star review.</li>
            <li> AS I WAS GETTING READY TO ORDER MY USUAL GNC BIOTIN, I CAME ACROSS THIS BRAND AND DECIDED TO TRY IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS; AND</li>
            <li> I have noticed a tremendously positive change in my hair since I started using this combination, and the cost is extremely reasonable for both products.  </li>
            <li> Also, my fine lines have filled in a little bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I already had fine hair, and now I&#x27;ve lost about a third of what I did have.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is growing fast too.</li>
            <li> Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> So it really depends on your skin type.  </li>
            <li> This made so much of my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> They are so long and strong</li>
            <li> I have very acne prone skin and was on Accutane for over 2 years, so now am very careful about what I use and take so as to not cause any more acne.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant hair growth (as it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks)</li>
            <li> But as soon as I ordered biotin, my hair grew immensely and I could see the difference right away!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different vitamins and products and this has been the only one where I&#x27;ve noticed a real change in my hair.  </li>
            <li> There has to be a better solution for hair/ nail growth- not worth the side effects.</li>
            <li> There are many nutritional options and people probably respond differently to each type, depending on their specific circumstances.  </li>
            <li> hair (which is in desperate need of a cut and therefore would not look nice otherwise) is healthy and shiny.</li>
            <li> The dose is way too high.</li>
            <li> I chose it because it had a high rating for quality.  </li>
            <li> Had high hopes but did not work out.</li>
            <li> I started taking this on the advice of a friend for my hair and it has made a HUGE difference in that, and the dryness of my skin has lessened, and absolutely NO increase in breakouts (acne).  </li>
            <li> My hair grew at normal rate.</li>
            <li> They are working :D. I love Garden of Life Vitamin Code Raw Prenatal Multivitamin, for women.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m semi-prone to acne flare ups even as an adult, but I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple for weeks even during hormonal changes when they&#x27;re most likely to crop up for</li>
            <li> I expect it would take 3-6 months to really see a major difference in hair like mine.  </li>
            <li> Not only have my fingernails grown in luxuriously long and strong</li>
            <li> After a bit over a month I have noticed more shedding than usual.</li>
            <li> If you are acne-prone or have sensitive skin, please rethink this product!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to notice changes in my facial skin within the first week or two.</li>
            <li> lost so far!)</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to any extra speed in growth, as my ends have been a little damaged due to some highlights I am trying to grow out, but the DENSITY of my hair at the scalp is amazing!  </li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND A COMBINATION OF NATURAL OILS.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to start my second bottle</li>
            <li> I am 54 years old, and my hair has shine again.  </li>
            <li> I ran out of my supply and decided to try this brand instead of sticking with my old one because of its rave reviews.  </li>
            <li> I contacted this company direct through their website with no response.</li>
            <li> I thought I was just misinterpreting how much hair I was suddenly seeing in my comb, but nope--</li>
            <li> and my skin feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> AND I USED ALL NATURAL HAIR PRODUCTS.</li>
            <li> Although I wish they would stop breaking completely, my nails have grown longer, they do not peel and crack anymore, and I am no longer embarrassed by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The beneficial.effects have completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> This brand seems a little more expensive than many other brands, but a bottle should easily last 2-4 months, depending on how many you take.  </li>
            <li> The pills are small and easy to swallow.  </li>
            <li> In order to fairly assess the benefits of the product, I didn&#x27;t add any topical treatments for my nails, or any other action I haven&#x27;t been doing over the past year.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s January and my hair shed waaaaaaay more than usual on a daily basis!!!</li>
            <li> So I started taking it every other day, which made less pimples more tolerable.  </li>
            <li> After a few months of supplements I finally had strong nails that didn&#x27;t break constantly.</li>
            <li> Literally 100 or MORE bumps consisting of tiny hard pimples, whiteheads, and deep cystic acne.</li>
            <li> have been worse than usual, and my hair and skin not too great either.</li>
            <li> I have been taking two pills once a day for 16 days so far (total 10,000mg per day).</li>
            <li> My husband recently bought these for me after I relaxed my hair over 2 years of being natural, regretted it and decided to &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; (cut all my relaxed hair off).  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s only been a month so far.</li>
            <li> make matters worse,my 18 yr old daughter took them and have expirenced the same thing!</li>
            <li> Additionally there has been no improvement in my thin fingernails, although I have been getting more hangnails.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two months and already I&#x27;ve noticed positive changes in my hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small pill so its easy to take and its soft and doesn&#x27;t have a bitter taste at all.</li>
            <li> the first two weeks, my nails continued to peel and break, but now that the old bad parts are mostly gone, the nails do seem a bit stronger and aren&#x27;t peeling or breaking.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical when buying this product at first for many reasons: 1)</li>
            <li> As i&#x27;ve gotten older i&#x27;ve noticed my hair shedding more than I remember, a general thinning overall, and have had an incredibly hard time growing it past my collarbone.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my hair due to constant dyeing but the real problem happened when I bleached my hair 3x in one day.</li>
            <li> have very long, fine hair, so it&#x27;s hard to judge if the product has promoted growth.  </li>
            <li> The only downside is if you&#x27;re not a fan of drinking water you may get acne due to the high dosage.  </li>
            <li> However-I&#x27;m noticing far less shedding, major reduction of  hair in my brush and drains.</li>
            <li> I normally have pretty clear skin, but I usually have to work hard and eat a lot of greens to get that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> The one positive is that the small amount of coconut oil they include in this product did make my hair feel softer.</li>
            <li> And within a few months, it was several inches longer and back to my normal length</li>
            <li> I am 42 and am mistaken for late 20s very often.</li>
            <li> But having healthy hair will encourage steady hair growth - whereas having frail hair, thin hair, split ends, dry hair, or damaged hair will simply slow down the process due to breakage.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have this side effect with any other brand, and nothing else in my health, diet, or environment changed except for taking this supplement, so it&#x27;s definitely the cause.</li>
            <li> I thought it might clear up as my body got used to the supplement, but it only got worse by spreading to my neck, chest, and back.</li>
            <li> I was getting pimples which I normally never get</li>
            <li> Sigh, made my hair literally fall out and thin within the first 2 weeks of using it.</li>
            <li> Everyone saying their hair grew half an inch in a month  should know that your hair naturally grows half an inch every month giving you a 6 inch hair growth every year.  </li>
            <li> My hair was ear length when I started only a few months ago, and now... ITS HALFWAY DOWN MY BACK!</li>
            <li> Sorry folks I like my own hair too much to continue using this bad product.</li>
            <li> However all the growth I had gained is now gone thanks to this poor quality product.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> My face is usually really clean and within 2 weeks I started breaking out like crazy.</li>
            <li> no longer tear, my hair is shinier, and my skin is less dry.  </li>
            <li> There are plenty of other supplements out there that won&#x27;t wreak havoc on your skin.</li>
            <li> Also, about 10 days ago, I began using activated charcoal about every other day.  </li>
            <li> I believe this was due to a variety of factors including testosterone cream, aging, stress.  .  </li>
            <li> If you want your hair stay longer, use other method, don&#x27;t risk it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me, I switched from my regular brand (which I had used for nearly 2 years) and my hair started falling out in clumps (again) and my nails started breaking.</li>
            <li> After seven weeks of taking this small, tasteless and easy to swallow pill twice a day, the results are in.</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth it.</li>
            <li> My skin was especially in need of some TLC because crazy amounts of stress the past few months have left my face with nurmerous, deep red acne scars.  </li>
            <li> Screw this threw all bottles away not worth the cancer causing agents.</li>
            <li> I also have dry skin and 2 or 3 small patches of psoriasis on my hand (which is genetic and inherited).  </li>
            <li> The other brand was basically a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I took these for about a month and a half and never noticed a difference.  </li>
            <li> The skin on my body hasn&#x27;t undergone such a dramatic transformation but dry patches have cleared up</li>
            <li> I took these pills for a month and a half and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair or nails</li>
            <li> Only thing positive about this product is that it was delivered promptly, other than that it was worthless.  </li>
            <li> Also within a few weeks I noticed less hair coming out in the shower</li>
            <li> Considering their inaccurate information on this matter, I&#x27;m not sure how valid their other claims are...</li>
            <li> Google it and do a little research.</li>
            <li> Expensive creams and treatments are a small percentage of what keeps you looking vibrant and youthful.</li>
            <li> This product actually made my nails WORSE.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Does not work waste of money</li>
            <li> The day I stopped taking the pills my stomach problems went away immediately and my skin cleared up within a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always wary of the far reaching claims supplements make.</li>
            <li> and during the past few months I&#x27;ve noticed my nails</li>
            <li> For the past few months, my nails have been cracking and breaking.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it works on men.</li>
            <li> But I am not sure that I see an improvement in hair growth and nail strength.</li>
            <li> Do not be fooled by their green V!</li>
            <li> I USUALLY USE GNC BIOTIN 5000MG</li>
            <li> My nails have always been thin and weak, with a tendency to peel in layers, which then further weakens the ends.</li>
            <li> Before starting a Biotin supplement, my nails were in very poor condition.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about 2 months and my skin has a luminous quality without trying hard at all.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the health risk, not for me!!!</li>
            <li> Well, it did nothing to my hair at least.</li>
            <li> For any company to use this as one of its ingredients loses credibility for me as a company that is &amp;#34;health aware&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I should have read the negative reviews about the side effects of cystic acne before purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it would strengthen my hair, but it did the opposite and hair started to fall out like CRAZY after 1 week of using it.</li>
            <li> The patches are getting smaller, and they don&#x27;t itch as bad.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even polish them, just an occasional clip and file of the bad edges as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But lately they had been getting much worse.</li>
            <li> Not good.  </li>
            <li> In the worst place was one cystic pimple, right beside my nose.....</li>
            <li> It was so bad I was sweeping clumps of long hair off my bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> But after a bad set of hair extensions left my hair very thin, frail, and dull</li>
            <li> I have always had very weak and brittle nails, but the condition has gotten worse over the past 2 years.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not talking minor cystic acne, it&#x27;s bad!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda scary.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to stop it .</li>
            <li> (sorry)</li>
            <li> I had nothing but a bad experience with these.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t question me, it was a bad mistake, I know.</li>
            <li> I wanted sooo bad for this work for hair growth; but OMG,it ruined my skin.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me :-(</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want that crap in your body.</li>
            <li> I continued taking, drank lots of water and still very bad acne that I&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;Too</li>
            <li> STILL SHREDDED LIKE CRAZY UNTIL I STOPPED TAKING THEM!!</li>
            <li> These pills are the worst thing to happen to my hair.</li>
            <li> and I was having terrible stomach pains at night from this product.</li>
            <li> WORST.</li>
            <li> I have horrible horrible cystic acne all along my jaw line.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Only thing positive about this product is that it was delivered promptly, other than that it was worthless.  Definitely not worth it. They tell you it&#x27;s guaranteed money back but not how to do it. Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Sigh, made my hair literally fall out and thin within the first 2 weeks of using it. It was so bad I was sweeping clumps of long hair off my bathroom floor. To my horror, it also is not a vegan product if you look at the ingredients. I really wanted to like this product. Since I had to  stop taking it. My existing hair stop shedding after stopping this product. I am a happy camper  now with  taking organic prenatal vitamins for hair growth. They are working :D. I love Garden of Life Vitamin Code Raw Prenatal Multivitamin, for women. Not sure if it works on men. Sorry folks I like my own hair too much to continue using this bad product.</li>
            <li> These pills are the worst thing to happen to my hair. After a bit over a month I have noticed more shedding than usual. My hair was literally coming out as a combed it from the roots. PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. I RECOMMEND A COMBINATION OF NATURAL OILS. JOJOBA, COCONUT, ROSEMARY, CASTOR.</li>
            <li> I took work a week and stopped because it caused acne on my body and face.</li>
            <li> I took this supplement for a week (2 capsules per day). After the first day, I had a spontaneous breakout of acne on my face. Literally 100 or MORE bumps consisting of tiny hard pimples, whiteheads, and deep cystic acne. I thought it might clear up as my body got used to the supplement, but it only got worse by spreading to my neck, chest, and back. I stopped taking the biotin yesterday, and like magic, my skin is mostly clear today. Coincidence? I think not. I experienced no hair/nail growth or improvement when taking this for the short amount of time that I did. If you are acne-prone or have sensitive skin, please rethink this product! There are plenty of other supplements out there that won&#x27;t wreak havoc on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had great results! I used to bite my nails, but since my nails have been growing out stronger it&#x27;s been so easy to quit. My hair is growing fast too. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> Read about carrageenan for yourselves! This is not the only product that contains this controversial ingredient!! Not worth the health risk, not for me!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking this product for almost three months now it has been quite amazing!  As i&#x27;ve gotten older i&#x27;ve noticed my hair shedding more than I remember, a general thinning overall, and have had an incredibly hard time growing it past my collarbone. I&#x27;ve tried so many different vitamins and products and this has been the only one where I&#x27;ve noticed a real change in my hair.  I can&#x27;t attest to any extra speed in growth, as my ends have been a little damaged due to some highlights I am trying to grow out, but the DENSITY of my hair at the scalp is amazing!  I am looking forward to continuing use of this product to see the full effects for my locks!</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews in the hopes that it would help my hair. It did nothing. Well, it did nothing to my hair at least. This product actually made my nails WORSE. My nails were never a problem before but now they chip, break easy, and come off in layers. Thanks for nothing.</li>
            <li> Update:  I went through the bottle and noticed no results. This gets filed under &amp;#34;fad supplements&amp;#34; for me.  ----  I&#x27;ve been taking this since Jan 17, and I cannot yet say whether this product has improved my skin, nails, and hair.  Two weeks into taking Biotin, I also began incorporating collagen/gelatin into my smoothies and drinks. Also, about 10 days ago, I began using activated charcoal about every other day.  I would guess that these three products combined have helped with a decrease in facial acne. But I am not sure that I see an improvement in hair growth and nail strength. I will continue using one more bottle of Biotin and report back.</li>
            <li> Did not like this. Too potent and made my face break out.  Needed a combo product with biotin in it. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over two months and already I&#x27;ve noticed positive changes in my hair! I&#x27;ve recommended this to my sister and mother as well. I absolutely LOVE the size of the capsules; they&#x27;re extremely easy to swallow and make the experience that much better.</li>
            <li> Getting ready to start my second bottle and I can already tell a big difference.  I am 54 years old, and my hair has shine again.  I am so happy about that alone.  I also have dry skin and 2 or 3 small patches of psoriasis on my hand (which is genetic and inherited).  It is also helping that.  The patches are getting smaller, and they don&#x27;t itch as bad.  I will not say it has completely cleared that up, but it has eased it tremendously.  I started taking this on the advice of a friend for my hair and it has made a HUGE difference in that, and the dryness of my skin has lessened, and absolutely NO increase in breakouts (acne).  I will definitely keep taking this.</li>
            <li> This product is great! I have been trying to grow my hair out for a while and just couldn&#x27;t get it to grow. This product showed results within weeks for nail growth. Also within a few weeks I noticed less hair coming out in the shower and it felt much stronger and healthier! I will continue to use this product as I am very pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I took these for about a month and a half and never noticed a difference.  I had nothing but a bad experience with these.  I kept getting yeast infections taking these. My skin also broke out.  I couldn&#x27;t figure out what was going on with me until I read the side effects of taking Biotin.  Biotin causes yeast infections and acne! DO NOT BUY!</li>
            <li> I have been taking two pills once a day for 16 days so far (total 10,000mg per day). While I haven&#x27;t noticed any significant hair growth (as it&#x27;s only been 2 weeks) I have noticed SIGNIFICANT differences in the health and quality of my hair!!  I was very skeptical when buying this product at first for many reasons: 1) A lot of the reviews are not verified purchases. 2) This company will SEND you a FREE (FREE. YES FREE) bottle of vitamins if you write a review for them. So many of the reviews are just blabber to get some free products.  But after a bad set of hair extensions left my hair very thin, frail, and dull, I decided there was no harm in trying it out. After 2 weeks, my hair is healthy, voluptuous, and has a beautiful natural shine to it that I have never had before. It&#x27;s also much softer and I can now go longer between washes because it stays so clean and healthy, and shampoos are too damaging to my hair. In terms of growth, I will update my review after 30 and 60 days of the product to see if that is actually true. However, it should be noted that nothing can ACTUALLY make your hair grow faster. But having healthy hair will encourage steady hair growth - whereas having frail hair, thin hair, split ends, dry hair, or damaged hair will simply slow down the process due to breakage.  Also, many reviewers noted flare ups of cystic acne. I have very acne prone skin and was on Accutane for over 2 years, so now am very careful about what I use and take so as to not cause any more acne. However this product did not make me break out at all. So it really depends on your skin type.  Overall, very satisfied. Will update with more info soon!</li>
            <li> Carrageenan is one of the ingredients. For any company to use this as one of its ingredients loses credibility for me as a company that is &amp;#34;health aware&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t have the time to share what I know or have read about carrageenan but I&#x27;ve read enough to know that it presents a health risk. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I ordered the first bottle and took one a day.  I began to break out in cystic pimples.  So I started taking it every other day, which made less pimples more tolerable.  My edges began to fill in again.  So I ordered a second bottle because I wanted to see some hair growth.  Once I was able to tolerate it I started taking it once a day and the acne returned with avengents.  I broke out in places on my face that never seen a pimple, just before my summer vacation.  In the worst place was one cystic pimple, right beside my nose.....it was not for me because I may be allergic to biotin.....I will not order again.</li>
            <li> Does not work waste of money</li>
            <li> Before starting a Biotin supplement, my nails were in very poor condition. After a few months of supplements I finally had strong nails that didn&#x27;t break constantly. I ran out of my supply and decided to try this brand instead of sticking with my old one because of its rave reviews.  First of all, when it arrived, there was an offer in the box that implied you would get a free bottle if you left a 5-star review. That in and of itself set off warning bells in my mind. But, I decided to give the product a fair try and took it anyways.  I am almost through the entire bottle (3 months), and all I have to show for it are nails that are brittle, peeling, and breaking off, one after another. I KNOW Biotin works for me because I have seen the change in my nails before. However all the growth I had gained is now gone thanks to this poor quality product. I will be switching back to a more reputable brand, hopefully it won&#x27;t take my nails too long to recover.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this product did not work for me, I switched from my regular brand (which I had used for nearly 2 years) and my hair started falling out in clumps (again) and my nails started breaking. I contacted this company direct through their website with no response. The one positive is that the small amount of coconut oil they include in this product did make my hair feel softer.</li>
            <li> I have always had very weak and brittle nails, but the condition has gotten worse over the past 2 years.  My nails were tearing and/or chipping even though I keep them very short.  I finally got fed up enough to do an internet search on supplements which strengthen nails.  There are many nutritional options and people probably respond differently to each type, depending on their specific circumstances.  I decided to start with biotin and have found this brand to be very effective.  I have been taking this for about 45days and my nails no longer tear, my hair is shinier, and my skin is less dry.  The pills are small and easy to swallow.  This brand seems a little more expensive than many other brands, but a bottle should easily last 2-4 months, depending on how many you take.  I take two tablets a day (morning and evening)--your mileage may vary but keep in mind that biotin is water soluble, so taking several pills at once will probably not be more effective than just one at a time.</li>
            <li> Nails seem thicker but hair hasn&#x27;t seen any change. I wanted my hair to get healthier.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product since March 15th with not improvement in quality or quantity of hair.  Additionally there has been no improvement in my thin fingernails, although I have been getting more hangnails.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with my hair due to constant dyeing but the real problem happened when I bleached my hair 3x in one day. Don&#x27;t question me, it was a bad mistake, I know. But as soon as I ordered biotin, my hair grew immensely and I could see the difference right away! After my bleaching incident, my hair literally fell out and ripped out but after a month, it was healthy and beautiful! And within a few months, it was several inches longer and back to my normal length but it didn&#x27;t stop there! My hair is growing faster and fuller than it ever has! My hair was ear length when I started only a few months ago, and now... ITS HALFWAY DOWN MY BACK! I highly recommend this product if your having any trouble growing your hair or even just wanting healthier and more beautiful hair!</li>
            <li> After using this  product for a month, I  am confident saying that it does not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking these Biotin pills for a three months now and can definitely tell a difference in my hair and nails. My hair feels thicker and softer and my nails grow faster now. It&#x27;s a small pill so its easy to take and its soft and doesn&#x27;t have a bitter taste at all. I uploaded some pictures of my hair growth.</li>
            <li> These capsules are NOT vegan friendly, despite their marketed claims. They contain beeswax which is obviously an animal product. Do not be fooled by their green V! Considering their inaccurate information on this matter, I&#x27;m not sure how valid their other claims are...</li>
            <li> My husband recently bought these for me after I relaxed my hair over 2 years of being natural, regretted it and decided to &amp;#34;big chop&amp;#34; (cut all my relaxed hair off).  My hair and skin are softer, hair seems thicker and a bit longer in only a week on top of the fact that it gave me a bit of an energy boost. I was on another brand of biotin with a 7500 mcg dosage and besides the nail hardening and growth, which is the same. The other brand was basically a waste of money. The only downside is if you&#x27;re not a fan of drinking water you may get acne due to the high dosage.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking to grow their hair in a faster time span.</li>
            <li> The dose is way too high. I was getting pimples which I normally never get and I was having terrible stomach pains at night from this product. The day I stopped taking the pills my stomach problems went away immediately and my skin cleared up within a few days. Also this company buys good reviews from people. They offer a free bottle of pills if you leave a good review. I find that unethical and misleading. Do not buy from this company!!</li>
            <li> This made so much of my hair fall out. I thought I was just misinterpreting how much hair I was suddenly seeing in my comb, but nope-- it&#x27;s definitely happening. It&#x27;s not breakage, because the hairs all have the roots attached. I didn&#x27;t have this side effect with any other brand, and nothing else in my health, diet, or environment changed except for taking this supplement, so it&#x27;s definitely the cause. I already had fine hair, and now I&#x27;ve lost about a third of what I did have. WORST.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to this product.  I broke out and had to stop taking them.</li>
            <li> My hair had thinned to about a third of what it was in its prime. I believe this was due to a variety of factors including testosterone cream, aging, stress.  .  First, I stopped the T-cream (which had been prescribed by my doctor for libido).  Then, I started taking the specialty vitamins, which did offer some help.  Because I didn&#x27;t like the price I was paying for those vitamins ($35 - $75 a month), I started doing my own research and bought this Biotin as well as another bottle of Pygeum combined with Saw Palmetto (to decrease the DHEA from testosterone which shrinks the hair follicles).  I have noticed a tremendously positive change in my hair since I started using this combination, and the cost is extremely reasonable for both products.  My hair is thicker, longer, and the individual hairs are themselves sturdier and thicker.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve tried cheap forms of biotin before, and they haven&#x27;t helped.  But I decided to give biotin another shot before throwing in the towel.  I chose this one because it was recommended on a blog for hair growth.  I chose it because it had a high rating for quality.  After one day, I noticed a difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Now I normally have pretty clear skin, but I usually have to work hard and eat a lot of greens to get that &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34;.  My skin was especially in need of some TLC because crazy amounts of stress the past few months have left my face with nurmerous, deep red acne scars.  In a week, my face was more even toned.  I&#x27;ve been using this product about 2 months and my skin has a luminous quality without trying hard at all.  Also, my fine lines have filled in a little bit too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nails have been a bit brittle because of the harsh winters here in upstate NY, but since taking this biotin, I can FEEL how much stronger they are.  They are so long and strong I&#x27;m pretty sure they can rival any salon nails ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair (which is in desperate need of a cut and therefore would not look nice otherwise) is healthy and shiny. It has definitely grown more since taking High Potency Biotin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all.  I&#x27;m really impressed with this product.  If you&#x27;re taking it for one reason, be prepared to notice some other wonderful advantages to taking this product.  I&#x27;ll be buying more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always wary of the far reaching claims supplements make. I knew Biotin has beneficial properties, but I had no idea... My fingernails were brittle and peeling and I was looking for products to promote strength and growth. After seven weeks of taking this small, tasteless and easy to swallow pill twice a day, the results are in. Not only have my fingernails grown in luxuriously long and strong (I am constantly admiring them-I&#x27;ve never in my life had nice nails!) but my skin looks AMAZING and I just can&#x27;t get over it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started to notice changes in my facial skin within the first week or two. Every day my skin became more supple, dewy and taut. I look like I did five years ago when I was pregnant and at my loveliest-healthy, glowing and radiant. The skin on my body hasn&#x27;t undergone such a dramatic transformation but dry patches have cleared up and my skin feels soft and silky. I&#x27;m semi-prone to acne flare ups even as an adult, but I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple for weeks even during hormonal changes when they&#x27;re most likely to crop up for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, fine hair, so it&#x27;s hard to judge if the product has promoted growth.  I expect it would take 3-6 months to really see a major difference in hair like mine.  However-I&#x27;m noticing far less shedding, major reduction of  hair in my brush and drains. My hair definitely appears fuller. Shinier too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this supplement and will surely continue to take it to maintain these results. In full disclosure, this company has offered a complementary refill bottle in exchange for a fair and honest review after purchase.</li>
            <li> Did not see any results at all.</li>
            <li> I should have read the negative reviews about the side effects of cystic acne before purchasing this product. I have changed nothing else in my routine besides taking two of this pills daily.. I&#x27;ve stopped taking them immediately once I made the connection and do NOT recommend this product. There has to be a better solution for hair/ nail growth- not worth the side effects.</li>
            <li> Seems to make my hair fall out been taking it since 11/30/2014 so it&#x27;s January and my hair shed waaaaaaay more than usual on a daily basis!!! It&#x27;s kinda scary. I stopped taking it and it&#x27;s only been a month so far. Seems to have made my nails stronger and grow faster . So I would recommend to take at your own discretion!!! It didn&#x27;t work for me :-(</li>
            <li> Biotin might help your hair growth but it also helps your cystic acne on the chin ..... One of the side effects... read online about it. Unfortunately I have to stop it .</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last three months. It is a quality product, made in the USA, and does what it claims to do. I use it with a high potency rosehip vitamin c supplement primarily for my skin&#x27;s health and am not disappointed. I have begun using SR&#x27;s Evening Primrose and vitamin K because I trust this brand. I will try their Phytoceramides as well. FYI, I eat well, exercise, and drink water and teas. I am 42 and am mistaken for late 20s very often. Take care of your skin inside and out, ladies. Expensive creams and treatments are a small percentage of what keeps you looking vibrant and youthful.</li>
            <li> I have cancer and my hair had fallen out.  I started taking Biotin 2 months ago and my hair has grown an inch!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy it! I thought it would strengthen my hair, but it did the opposite and hair started to fall out like CRAZY after 1 week of using it. If you want your hair stay longer, use other method, don&#x27;t risk it. I don&#x27;t know what they put in there that cause me to shed like a dog (sorry)</li>
            <li> Screw this threw all bottles away not worth the cancer causing agents. Beware** educate yourself. How can this company pushing gmo free and all natural ingredients when they put junk in there. Keep searching!! Why are they feeding this too us? And with the opportunity to get a FREE bottle? Something&#x27;s up. Educate yourself on all additives. Power to the people!</li>
            <li> I took these pills for a month and a half and didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair or nails but I did break out incredibly. My face is usually really clean and within 2 weeks I started breaking out like crazy. I thought maybe it was due to all the supplements I was on for my workouts and that maybe it just wasn&#x27;t a good combination with my protein and fat burner powders so I passed it on to my cousin. She as well started breaking out after a week of using the biotin. My hair grew at normal rate. Everyone saying their hair grew half an inch in a month  should know that your hair naturally grows half an inch every month giving you a 6 inch hair growth every year.  In my opinion you should just find something else.</li>
            <li> I HAVE USED THESE VITAMINS ALMOST 3 MONTHS AND NOTICED SOOOOO MUCH SHEDDING IN MY HAIR! I DIDN&#x27;T STOP TAKING THEM RIGHT THEN BECAUSE I WANTED TO ELIMINATE ME BEING THE CAUSE OF THE SHEDDING. MY HAIR HAS BEEN PRETTY HEALTHY AND I USED ALL NATURAL HAIR PRODUCTS. I GOT MY REGULAR HAIR TRIM TO MAKE SURE I DIDN&#x27;T HAVE ANY SPLIT ENDS AND MY HAIR STILL SHREDDED LIKE CRAZY UNTIL I STOPPED TAKING THEM!! NO SHEDDING SINCE I STOPPED THESE VITAMINS. I USUALLY USE GNC BIOTIN 5000MG AND I HAD NO PROBLEMS AND HAD GREAT RESULTS! AS I WAS GETTING READY TO ORDER MY USUAL GNC BIOTIN, I CAME ACROSS THIS BRAND AND DECIDED TO TRY IT BECAUSE OF ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS; AND THE GOOD REVIEWS WERE ONLY WRITTEN TO GET A FREE BOTTLE! THE COMPANY SENDS YOU AN EMAIL! THIS SHOULD BE OFF AMAZON!!</li>
            <li> I have been on a weight-loss diet for over a year (75 lbs. lost so far!) and during the past few months I&#x27;ve noticed my nails have been worse than usual, and my hair and skin not too great either. My nails have always been thin and weak, with a tendency to peel in layers, which then further weakens the ends. They rarely grow to the ends of my fingers. But lately they had been getting much worse. I remembered a time when I was taking an expensive set of daily vitamins, and my nails were much better then. I can&#x27;t afford those expensive vitamins anymore, though, and this product filled the bill perfectly to help with my nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Biotin for about 3 weeks now, one pill a day. In order to fairly assess the benefits of the product, I didn&#x27;t add any topical treatments for my nails, or any other action I haven&#x27;t been doing over the past year. I didn&#x27;t even polish them, just an occasional clip and file of the bad edges as always.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the first two weeks, my nails continued to peel and break, but now that the old bad parts are mostly gone, the nails do seem a bit stronger and aren&#x27;t peeling or breaking. I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement in my skin and perhaps slightly less hair in the shower drain, so that&#x27;s good too. To be honest, I didn&#x27;t expect to see results this soon. It takes a while for nails to grow out, so there is still probably some &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; nail material to grow out and get rid of. Nevertheless, it&#x27;s clear that they are already a little better than before, so I am very pleased with this low-cost option so far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m baffled with this containing Carrageenan. Google it and do a little research. You don&#x27;t want that crap in your body.</li>
            <li> In the past month exactly my hair has grown an entire INCH. This is coming from a girl whos hair grew an inch a YEAR. LOVE THIS. definately rebuying when i get low!!</li>
            <li> I was taking the whole food brands and my nails were long, strong and beautiful. I decided to give this one a try and after 2 weeks my nails became so brittled I had to stop. all my nails chipped and broke off. It didn&#x27;t work for me so I stop taking it.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  I have taken this for a week (one pill a day with a meal).  My stomach has been upset and I am breaking out  with acne.  Not good.  I&#x27;m going to discontinue use.  Had high hopes but did not work out.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been taking it my nails have started to split from cut edge to cuticle so that I&#x27;ve ended up with nail fringe.  DON&#x27;T LIKE THAT.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t ever write reviews, but beware. I wanted sooo bad for this work for hair growth; but OMG,it ruined my skin. I have horrible horrible cystic acne all along my jaw line. I continued taking, drank lots of water and still very bad acne that I&#x27;ve never had before.&lt;br /&gt;Too make matters worse,my 18 yr old daughter took them and have expirenced the same thing! I&#x27;m not talking minor cystic acne, it&#x27;s bad! Be careful.</li>
            <li> I have almost finished my first bottle, and my nails are stronger.  Although I wish they would stop breaking completely, my nails have grown longer, they do not peel and crack anymore, and I am no longer embarrassed by them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my good experience with the first bottle, I purchased several more.  The beneficial.effects have completely disappeared. For the past few months, my nails have been cracking and breaking.  I don&#x27;t know whether the body adapted to the supplement or what, but the biotin is no longer eggective.</li>
