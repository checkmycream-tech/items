            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use very many products on my hair, but this added great shine, bounce, and heat protection with minimal weight.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the full size because I had fallen in love.</li>
            <li>This works well for fine hair like mine.keeps</li>
            <li>This brand has a really come come up as my favorite productS!</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels and the way it smells, but it is not helping very much with the frizz...</li>
            <li>Need very little and the smell is delicious!  </li>
            <li>The scent is strong and unusual and at this time I love it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks to this lotion my hair is frizz free, and most importantly, free of split-ends.</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it claims to do, it literally mends your split ends like magic.</li>
            <li>This is by far one of my favorite products!</li>
            <li>This smells so good, and makes my color last longer.</li>
            <li>I am okay with a little bit of perfume in products, but I tried wearing this and my friends all commented and not in a good way, just avoid.</li>
            <li>Leaves a very natural, lovely sheen that is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Used so far for 2 weeks so pleased.  </li>
            <li>the product is definitely worth it</li>
            <li>Love the smell and it makes my hair feel healthy without weighing it down or making greasy</li>
            <li>The smell is also absolutely divine -- somewhere between earthy and sweet, but not quite</li>
            <li>I use their other products, Leave in treatment and hair styling elixir, and this one is even more fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair healthy and very little is taken off because it is so healthy at each appointment</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny how that is -</li>
            <li>Made my wirery hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and makes my hair look healthier, though it does not seem to have a lasting effect on its actual strength.</li>
            <li>Will absolutely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff for my long / thick / dry hair and the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Even with constantly sitting on my hair, shutting it in doors, and getting it caught in drawers, I am always getting stopped both at work and out in public by people commenting on how healthy my hair looks!</li>
            <li>I use this with the oil and my hair behaves very well.  </li>
            <li>Haha..</li>
            <li>Like the aroma, but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li>and I really was hoping it would kind of tame my hair some.</li>
            <li>I loved it but not enough add on to other things.  </li>
            <li>Either way I love it, it definitely smells middle eastern.  </li>
            <li>Price seems decent for a salon-type product.</li>
            <li>WOW!!  </li>
            <li>My hair is naturally straight and fine, and this product didn&#x27;t make it feel oily or heavy</li>
            <li>This is a product that I can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>I have used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair a few times (very long, fine toddler hair) and when only part of her hair is put up, it seems to tangle more than normal.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>My hair feels amazingly soft after using this product!</li>
            <li>I have used the Marrakesh Endz a couple of times now and WoW!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll even use this on second day hair (when my ends are super dry) and it does not weight hair down and keeps my hair healthy longer.  </li>
            <li>years later, my hair is long enough to sit on, and I still have people remark on how healthy it looks and feels on a regular basis - all without so much as a trim.</li>
            <li>I have always used the clear oil as an anti-frizzer after straightening, and thought this was what I was ordering.  </li>
            <li>It may grow old over time</li>
            <li>I received a few free samples of this product from my hair stylist.</li>
            <li>Loooove the smell and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>Frizzes are controlled, hair is soft and managable.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft, but without making it feel like it has product in it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair thick and healthy.</li>
            <li>I still like this product very much, it just wasn&#x27;t clear to me if this was the oil you use when your hair is dry or not.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re serious about keeping your hair long and healthy, try this product!</li>
            <li>If they went back to just normal prime, I would get it again.</li>
            <li>not sure how much it actually does for my dry ends...seems toalmost  make them more staticy...</li>
            <li>(seriously people ask what you use on your hair), it has majorly aided my split end damage, softens my hair, I can use it wet or dry and having very very fine hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It makes the ends of my hair, which normally tend to get a little frayed when I&#x27;m in need of a haircut, curl like they have never curled before.  </li>
            <li> whether I choose to flat iron or not.</li>
            <li> The bottle is small (4oz), and this is my first one to purchase, so I am curious to see how long it will last (I have shoulder length hair).  </li>
            <li> it very soft without feeling or looking heavy.</li>
            <li> I have waist long bleached hair and this protects and repairs so well.</li>
            <li> My one complaint would be that there is a lot left in the bottle after the pump stops working; cut the bottle open and scrape the remains into your next bottle.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed less shedding on my ends and a lot of growth overall</li>
            <li> This is a cream based product which is to be used when your hair is wet.  </li>
            <li> Style as usual (for me that is blow dry and flat iron).</li>
            <li> This product worked well on dry less humid days.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I usually use oils in my hair after washing.. such as aragon oil or chi.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s any different than the leave-in.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> my frizzy without weighing down.  </li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way, so while it seem like a lot of money for a small bottle of product, that small bottle lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> We have really hard water and my hair tends to feel dry all the time, so I hope that this will help alleviate that.  </li>
            <li> I put a little bit on the ends of my hair in addition to my MoraccainOil Hydrating Style Cream which is a part of my everyday routine.</li>
            <li> And I am at least 3 months over due for a haircut.  </li>
            <li> I found that my split ends started getting really bad between 3-5 weeks after a cut and to get me by a few extra weeks</li>
            <li> Sometimes I will even run a very small amount through my hair as a refresher.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, though, it went from a prime item to an add-on and that killed it for me.  </li>
            <li> I was actually debating cutting off about six inches of it when I got a sample of this product, and my hair has never looked or felt healthier!</li>
            <li> My hair recently crossed the mark from &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;holy crap</li>
            <li> However, when the weather was rainy or humid, my hair would frizze up and look awful.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> This was recommended by my hair dresser.  The scent is strong and unusual and at this time I love it.  It may grow old over time but I have been using it every day since I received it.  I have used it in my daughter&#x27;s hair a few times (very long, fine toddler hair) and when only part of her hair is put up, it seems to tangle more than normal.</li>
            <li> The smell is OVERPOWERING! I am okay with a little bit of perfume in products, but I tried wearing this and my friends all commented and not in a good way, just avoid. I would give the product a lower score if I could!</li>
            <li> OMG!  This stuff smells great!</li>
            <li> Got a sample of this &amp; I absolutely love this product. It smells and works so good!</li>
            <li> This is a product that I can&#x27;t live without. My hair has never been healthier. I love the smell and the cream consistency. A little goes a long way. Thanks to this lotion my hair is frizz free, and most importantly, free of split-ends.</li>
            <li> Leaves a very natural, lovely sheen that is not greasy.  This product has the added bonus of helping to maintain the moisture and oil in hair extensions.</li>
            <li> This product worked well on dry less humid days.  However, when the weather was rainy or humid, my hair would frizze up and look awful.  I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Holy moly WOWZERS this stuff is out of control AMAZING! I got a sample size of this in a monthly GlossyBox use the sample for two days and even though I still had 3/4 of the sample bottle left I purchased the full size because I had fallen in love. The smell is amazing and just wonderful (seriously people ask what you use on your hair), it has majorly aided my split end damage, softens my hair, I can use it wet or dry and having very very fine hair it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for almost 2 years and I love the way it makes my hair feel! Great product!</li>
            <li> This product does what it is supposed to do. A little bit goes a long way, so while it seem like a lot of money for a small bottle of product, that small bottle lasts for a long time. My one complaint would be that there is a lot left in the bottle after the pump stops working; cut the bottle open and scrape the remains into your next bottle.</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this from my ipsy and almost immediately fell in love with it. Lots of products say they mend split ends and prevent them but don&#x27;t. This product does exactly what it claims to do, it literally mends your split ends like magic. Oh and the smell is just phenomenal, it is an amazing product for the price. Definitely would recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!! My hair stylist recommended it to me and its amazing!! Also it smells great. I&#x27;ve gotten many compliments from people saying how great my hair smells.</li>
            <li> smells divine! not sure how much it actually does for my dry ends...seems toalmost  make them more staticy...but I do love the smell so I will continue to use it if not just for the scent.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and leaves my hair smelling good and feeling smooth and shiny. Love it</li>
            <li> Just got done with a sample 1oz size and now ordered two 4oz bottles for myself. This is the perfect finishing cream for my very fine wavy hair -eliminates my frizzy without weighing down.  Need very little and the smell is delicious!  And the price was great on this bottle.</li>
            <li> Used so far for 2 weeks so pleased.  Living in the desert swimming often and helps to keep away frizz on my curly hair</li>
            <li> I received a few free samples of this product from my hair stylist. I found that my split ends started getting really bad between 3-5 weeks after a cut and to get me by a few extra weeks she had me try this. Wow! My hair looks and feels so healthy. I put a little bit on the ends of my hair in addition to my MoraccainOil Hydrating Style Cream which is a part of my everyday routine. Style as usual (for me that is blow dry and flat iron). I&#x27;m very impressed. My ends feel and look so healthy.</li>
            <li> I love the Marrakesh products.  I have always used the clear oil as an anti-frizzer after straightening, and thought this was what I was ordering.  This is a cream based product which is to be used when your hair is wet.  I still like this product very much, it just wasn&#x27;t clear to me if this was the oil you use when your hair is dry or not.</li>
            <li> This product smell so great and my ends are so healthy and amazing the product is definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I loved this stuff!  Sadly, though, it went from a prime item to an add-on and that killed it for me.  I loved it but not enough add on to other things.  It&#x27;s funny how that is - but when I go to buy a 20 dollar item, I never want to add an 11 dollar add-on.  If they went back to just normal prime, I would get it again.</li>
            <li> Loooove the smell and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair recently crossed the mark from &amp;#34;long&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;holy crap you have a lot of hair&amp;#34;, and my ends were starting to show the strain of it. I was actually debating cutting off about six inches of it when I got a sample of this product, and my hair has never looked or felt healthier! My hair is naturally straight and fine, and this product didn&#x27;t make it feel oily or heavy like so many others do. The smell is also absolutely divine -- somewhere between earthy and sweet, but not quite either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two years later, my hair is long enough to sit on, and I still have people remark on how healthy it looks and feels on a regular basis - all without so much as a trim. I definitely credit it to this product, and recommend it constantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still loving this product in 2017! Even with constantly sitting on my hair, shutting it in doors, and getting it caught in drawers, I am always getting stopped both at work and out in public by people commenting on how healthy my hair looks! I have only trimmed my hair twice since using this product, and only to keep my hair a uniform length. If you&#x27;re serious about keeping your hair long and healthy, try this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Works great on my ends, and I&#x27;ll sometimes sleep with it in my hair for an overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my hair!!!  Will absolutely buy more in the future.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes my hair smell like princess jasmine.</li>
            <li> My hair feels amazingly soft after using this product!</li>
            <li> I love how my hair feels and the way it smells, but it is not helping very much with the frizz...and I really was hoping it would kind of tame my hair some.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and it makes my hair feel healthy without weighing it down or making greasy</li>
            <li> Fantatic product. Leaves my hair thick and healthy. I have waist long bleached hair and this protects and repairs so well. Great product.</li>
            <li> Best hair cream ever!  Smooths and controls my coarse, curly hair, whether I choose to flat iron or not. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for my long / thick / dry hair and the smell is wonderful!</li>
            <li> this makes your hair so manageable, if you are debating on getting this stop debating and commit to purchase! This is by far one of my favorite products! This brand has a really come come up as my favorite productS!</li>
            <li> I initially received a sample from my stylist.  I loved the scent and I was impressed with the ingredient list.  I don&#x27;t use very many products on my hair, but this added great shine, bounce, and heat protection with minimal weight.  Sometimes I will even run a very small amount through my hair as a refresher.  I will likely repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> I use this with the oil and my hair behaves very well.  Frizzes are controlled, hair is soft and managable.  I love the smell, it&#x27;s an exotic scent.  I had heard another reviewer (must have been for shampoo) that says the smell is like Tabacco... Haha.. I think it&#x27;s like a fancy tabacco or something nutty.  Either way I love it, it definitely smells middle eastern.  I&#x27;ll even use this on second day hair (when my ends are super dry) and it does not weight hair down and keeps my hair healthy longer.  Great conditioner for ends I will repurchase this when I run out.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, and makes my color last longer.</li>
            <li> Like the aroma, but I don&#x27;t really see a difference.</li>
            <li> This works well for fine hair like mine.keeps it very soft without feeling or looking heavy.I use it on my ends.Great product!</li>
            <li> I got the kit, but this was my 1st time getting &#x27;Endz&#x27;. I&#x27;m not sure that it&#x27;s any different than the leave-in. But I love em both and use them all! Best smell ever!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Gets the tangles out of my hair plus its moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I havnt actually used this bottle yet as I am still finishing another but it came with in the week after purchasing. That made me happy!</li>
            <li> My daughter and i cannot get enough of this stuff!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product it smells good and I&#x27;ve noticed less shedding on my ends and a lot of growth overall</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair healthy and very little is taken off because it is so healthy at each appointment</li>
            <li> Amazing, exotic scent but not overpowering, creamy, effective. It makes my hair shiny and soft. The scent remains throughout the day. I will continue to buy and use this product.</li>
            <li> Made my wirery hair smooth and soft.  Love, love. love the exotic mediterrainian blend of fragrance!</li>
            <li> INTOXICATING SENSUAL SCENT... RUB ALL OVER NOT JUST FOR HAIR..SOAKS IN WELL</li>
            <li> I have used the Marrakesh Endz a couple of times now and WoW! This stuff smells so good. It reminds me of Hemp, nag champa incense, and some kind of cookie spice ... I think this must be what Amortentia would smell like to me. It&#x27;s like catnip. After I put it on my hair, I keep smelling my hands.&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t oily. It makes my hair feel soft, but without making it feel like it has product in it.&lt;br /&gt;I love it. I would probably put this in my hair even if I did not have split ends.&lt;br /&gt;Another girl said it reminded her of patchouli but... just know it will have a bit of an incense smell to it. If you you do not like those kinds of smells, this is probably not for you.</li>
            <li> Smells great, does not leave your hair oily or greasy feeling.  The bottle is small (4oz), and this is my first one to purchase, so I am curious to see how long it will last (I have shoulder length hair).  We have really hard water and my hair tends to feel dry all the time, so I hope that this will help alleviate that.  Price seems decent for a salon-type product.</li>
            <li> WOW!!  That is all I can say about this product!  It makes the ends of my hair, which normally tend to get a little frayed when I&#x27;m in need of a haircut, curl like they have never curled before.  And I am at least 3 months over due for a haircut.  I use their other products, Leave in treatment and hair styling elixir, and this one is even more fantastic.  I wish I&#x27;d ordered 2 bottles!</li>
