            <li>Still glad I bought it and will be returning to but more.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very full coverage which I love because I have acne scars</li>
            <li>I love the quality and how easy it is to apply .</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a beautiful deep brown color</li>
            <li>Black Opal is the best.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and blends well.  </li>
            <li>Overall great product</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>Like the way it goes on smooth and gives full coverage - hiding blemishes, etc.</li>
            <li>amazing def use a finishing powder or it&#x27;ll transfer but other than that I love it</li>
            <li>or if you are getting down to the end of it, it might not be as great.</li>
            <li>The only issue is sometimes the ingredients start breaking own so if not sealed correctly over</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and rarely break out.</li>
            <li>Just the right consistency of moisture.</li>

            <li>If you&#x27;re after a flawless base, this is what you need! :)</li>
            <li>Glad to find it here and the price is right, but it is a little smaller amount per tube.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s relatively cheap &amp; does the trick better than the expensive brands</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth with a little shine....but evens the skin tone out....</li>
            <li>It was still oily even after applying mac mineralized skin finish natural</li>
            <li>This foundation is super heavy and on the greasy side for me.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Use brush to apply (wet or dry) and remember, less is more.</li>

            <li> so my wife does not run in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> truly topaz was a bit pale for me .I will use as a lightener on my eyes for a natural look .</li>
            <li> Matte, not too dry.</li>
            <li> It made my face really shiny and exaggerated all of my pumps on my face.</li>
            <li> However, if you have oily skin it tends to add a little to the shine.</li>
            <li> and it was so hard T blend into my skin.</li>
            <li> This product is VERY thick, but I also suspect the one I received was past its shelf life.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Black Opal</li>
            <li> Very yellow base, hard to blend.</li>
            <li> my base color that I like to use is hazelnut</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>

            <li> Like the way it goes on smooth and gives full coverage - hiding blemishes, etc. I think it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product but I was actually trying to order the concealer stick but since I wasn&#x27;t paying close attention I go the foundation stick...</li>
            <li> To know I can get a scarce product somewhere is a good thing.  Not only did I get what I wanted but I received it in good time.</li>
            <li> its kind of oily for a foundation stick. It was still oily even after applying mac mineralized skin finish natural</li>
            <li> Saw the reviews and looked at YouTube videos. Seen soo man good reviews. The coverage was alright and it was so hard T blend into my skin. I noticed I started to break out after using this makeup. Disappointed!</li>
            <li> I love the product . It goes on smooth and blends well.  truly topaz was a bit pale for me .I will use as a lightener on my eyes for a natural look . I ordered nutmeg and it was a perrrrfect match for my skin .Thinking of ordering the hazelnut for a darker shade ...I love the product not greasy and holds well during a workout . Would recommend item to a friend ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great delivery time as well ..</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Black Opal</li>
            <li> Its great coverage  can use as undereye concealer but you need to use a setting powder  its quite oily</li>
            <li> I use this stick for contouring. It works for my skin type, which is more on the dry side. I literally use this to highlight my cheeks &amp; blend in with a sponge. The only issue is sometimes the ingredients start breaking own so if not sealed correctly over or if you are getting down to the end of it, it might not be as great. But it&#x27;s relatively cheap &amp; does the trick better than the expensive brands</li>
            <li> Full coverage makeup that makes your skin look flawless. However, if you have oily skin it tends to add a little to the shine. Overall great product and I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> i like that its oil free, good coverage....</li>
            <li> Recommended by my makeup artist-I use this as a concealer. Great product-great match color wise.</li>
            <li> Used it for years. Perfect. Light weight. Cover up.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent full coverage foundation that  doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin.It covers even the darkest hyper pigmentation spots on my skin. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I wanted to report that I had to stop using the foundation, it did start to irritate my skin, its still a great full coverage foundation but it is a bit to oily for my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> This foundation is super heavy and on the greasy side for me. I couldn&#x27;t have anything come close to my face without leaving most of my makeup on it. It made my face really shiny and exaggerated all of my pumps on my face. I will never by this foundation again...I will stick with the more expensive foundation from Sephora.</li>
            <li> I purchased Heavenly honey &amp; truly topaz together . Both were perfect matches for my skin and for my contour . I love the quality and how easy it is to apply . Both came in two days , in perfect condition .</li>
            <li> This product is always great. Matte, not too dry. Just the right consistency of moisture. If you&#x27;re after a flawless base, this is what you need! :)</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth with a little shine....but evens the skin tone out....LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;Found out about this product on UTUBE.</li>
            <li> Looks quite natural on a light skinned Afro woman. The price is affordable hence I bought three so my wife does not run in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I LOVE BLACK OPAL FOUNDATION STICK, HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS. IT GIVES MY FACE A SMOOTH AND NATURAL LOOK.</li>
            <li> Very yellow base, hard to blend. I would not consider this a oily foundation, but it definitely broke me out. I have combination skin, and rarely break out. Would not recommend :0(</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT BEEN USING IT OVER TWELVE YEARS NOW JUST CAN&#x27;T DO WITHOUT IT. PERFECT FOR WOMAN OF COLOR.</li>
            <li> This product is VERY thick, but I also suspect the one I received was past its shelf life. Have to make sure to set this foundation. Use brush to apply (wet or dry) and remember, less is more.</li>
            <li> Used along with medium finishing powder. Looks great</li>
            <li> I use this as a high light under my eyes chin t zone basically and I love it my base color that I like to use is hazelnut it&#x27;s a beautiful deep brown color and it just works so perfect with this color blends amazing def use a finishing powder or it&#x27;ll transfer but other than that I love it it&#x27;s very full coverage which I love because I have acne scars</li>
