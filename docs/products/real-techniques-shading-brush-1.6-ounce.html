            <li>I liked the face brushes, not the eye ones.</li>

            <li>Amazing quality for a brush that is much cheaper than any at Sephora.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great brush for packing on pigment or shadow to the lid, blending transition colors or just gettin&#x27; deep into the crease.</li>
            <li>im still keeping my cheap brushes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a soft brush and a good price</li>
            <li>It picks up the right amount of shadow, spreads it smoothly and has not shed yet after many washes.</li>
            <li>very useful.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, easy to clean, and the shape is nice on the eyelid.</li>

            <li>Perfect size, such soft bristles!</li>
            <li>It applies my eyeshadow so effortlessly, and I tend to use this more to soften the edges of my eyeshadow to give a more seamless look.</li>

            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>This brush dries quickly too -</li>
            <li>Much better than a pencil brush for sensitive under eyes!</li>
            <li>Real Techniques is a fabulous brand.  </li>
            <li>The brush is soft and I love the color.</li>
            <li>They are a really nice quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This brush is good to create a soft lid look because of how soft it is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;this was totally worth the price</li>
            <li>This shading brush is just right for the perfect amount of eye shadow, It&#x27;s soft but firm, and just the right size.</li>
            <li>The price was super reasonable and they were delivered really quickly.</li>
            <li>It picks up a good amount of shadow, blends extremely well, and produces virtually no falling</li>
            <li>- the price is definitely right</li>
            <li>when I spray 99% isopropyl alcohol for spot cleaning, I can see right away if the brush is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>It had a soft texture and it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Higher quality than a brush you&#x27;d spend $50 on at sephora.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually thinking about purchasing more of them.</li>
            <li>I love entire brush line!!</li>
            <li>Exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li>however i HAVE noticed it blends the concealer under my eye pretty well</li>
            <li>Bristles are soft and gentle, easy to clean, easy to dry.</li>
            <li>I love real Techniques brushes, I have several of them.  </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and the quality is just as good as more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and decided didn&#x27;t hesitate in purchasing this Shading Bush.</li>
            <li>Real techniques are the bomb.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>Not so much for blending.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Much prefer my Sephora eye shadow brush for both these purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like all the real technique brushes for any cream or liquid product.</li>
            <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t keep too much product on the brush and applies well.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Thanks Samantha Chapman</li>
            <li>it will help them this brush so much .....</li>
            <li>I own quite a few real techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li>Packs on the color better than the other Real Techniques Starter Set.</li>
            <li>i use this particular one for smudging under eye shadow or applying on the lids for intense looks.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;People who own eyes with small eyelid area Like me</li>
            <li>Size and length is nice and brush is firm yet soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good brush for a few different steps in the process of my eye shadow application.</li>
            <li>The quality of this product was high.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m a fan of Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li>I would say this brush is actually better than my Sephora brushes (at $22+) and it seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li>This brush is much smaller than the base shadow brush in the Starter Set and while it cannot cover the entire lid in a wash of color in one stroke, it is good for more precise application.</li>
            <li>This shading brush did not wow me as much as it did many other reviewers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very soft blending brush.</li>
            <li>Very soft and grabs eye shadow well.</li>
            <li>definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is not too small n not too large that u can be so precise without it taking for ever to finish your look</li>
            <li>The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a smaller brush that could precisely place colour on the inner, middle and outer lid/crease area.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a smaller brush that could precisely place color on the inner, middle and outer lid/crease area.</li>
            <li>This the third Real Techniques brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I suppose you get what you pay for, so it&#x27;s a reasonable enough brush for what you pay.</li>
            <li>So soft</li>
            <li>The are soft durable!&lt;br /&gt;In regards to pricing</li>
            <li>Nothing to go WOW over</li>
            <li>aspect I find very helpful is that the tips are white, so</li>
            <li>This brush really helps me target the inner portion, and outer portion for that matter, of my eyelid vs. the entire lid.</li>
            <li>Super soft and fluffy brush!  </li>
            <li>A little big and hard to use but good for applying eyeshadow on the lid.</li>
            <li>Not that much use as I expected.</li>
            <li>Real Techniques is a good brand, doesn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li>Just the right size for adding a little emphasis to your look.</li>
            <li>Small enough for just a touch of color at the crease or on the lid- useful tool.</li>
            <li>this brush really very practical for Tight spaces In the eye</li>
            <li>The only thing I find I don&#x27;t like is the bristles tend to flare out a little too much and cause me to put color when I don&#x27;t intend when I try getting closer to the crease.  </li>

            <li> Amazing quality for a brush that is much cheaper than any at Sephora.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great brush for packing on pigment or shadow to the lid, blending transition colors or just gettin&#x27; deep into the crease.</li>
            <li> im still keeping my cheap brushes</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a soft brush and a good price</li>
            <li> It picks up the right amount of shadow, spreads it smoothly and has not shed yet after many washes.</li>
            <li> very useful.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, easy to clean, and the shape is nice on the eyelid.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and this is now my new favorite brush!</li>
            <li> Perfect size, such soft bristles!</li>
            <li> It applies my eyeshadow so effortlessly, and I tend to use this more to soften the edges of my eyeshadow to give a more seamless look.</li>
            <li> Will be purchasing many more to complete my collection.</li>
            <li> This brush is amazing quality and is so soft!</li>

            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> This brush dries quickly too -</li>
            <li> Much better than a pencil brush for sensitive under eyes!</li>
            <li> Real Techniques is a fabulous brand.  </li>
            <li> The brush is soft and I love the color.</li>
            <li> They are a really nice quality, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> This brush is good to create a soft lid look because of how soft it is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this was totally worth the price</li>
            <li> This shading brush is just right for the perfect amount of eye shadow, It&#x27;s soft but firm, and just the right size.</li>
            <li> The price was super reasonable and they were delivered really quickly.</li>
            <li> It picks up a good amount of shadow, blends extremely well, and produces virtually no falling</li>
            <li> - the price is definitely right</li>
            <li> when I spray 99% isopropyl alcohol for spot cleaning, I can see right away if the brush is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> It had a soft texture and it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Higher quality than a brush you&#x27;d spend $50 on at sephora.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually thinking about purchasing more of them.</li>
            <li> I love entire brush line!!</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered.</li>
            <li> however i HAVE noticed it blends the concealer under my eye pretty well</li>
            <li> Bristles are soft and gentle, easy to clean, easy to dry.</li>
            <li> I love real Techniques brushes, I have several of them.  </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and the quality is just as good as more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and decided didn&#x27;t hesitate in purchasing this Shading Bush.</li>
            <li> Real techniques are the bomb.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> Not so much for blending.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Much prefer my Sephora eye shadow brush for both these purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like all the real technique brushes for any cream or liquid product.</li>
            <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t keep too much product on the brush and applies well.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Thanks Samantha Chapman</li>
            <li> it will help them this brush so much .....</li>
            <li> I own quite a few real techniques brushes.  </li>
            <li> Packs on the color better than the other Real Techniques Starter Set.</li>
            <li> i use this particular one for smudging under eye shadow or applying on the lids for intense looks.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;People who own eyes with small eyelid area Like me</li>
            <li> Size and length is nice and brush is firm yet soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush for a few different steps in the process of my eye shadow application.</li>
            <li> The quality of this product was high.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m a fan of Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> I would say this brush is actually better than my Sephora brushes (at $22+) and it seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> This brush is much smaller than the base shadow brush in the Starter Set and while it cannot cover the entire lid in a wash of color in one stroke, it is good for more precise application.</li>
            <li> This shading brush did not wow me as much as it did many other reviewers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soft blending brush.</li>
            <li> Very soft and grabs eye shadow well.</li>
            <li> definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is not too small n not too large that u can be so precise without it taking for ever to finish your look</li>
            <li> The bristles are soft.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a smaller brush that could precisely place colour on the inner, middle and outer lid/crease area.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a smaller brush that could precisely place color on the inner, middle and outer lid/crease area.</li>
            <li> This the third Real Techniques brush I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I suppose you get what you pay for, so it&#x27;s a reasonable enough brush for what you pay.</li>
            <li> So soft</li>
            <li> The are soft durable!&lt;br /&gt;In regards to pricing</li>
            <li> Nothing to go WOW over</li>
            <li> aspect I find very helpful is that the tips are white, so</li>
            <li> This brush really helps me target the inner portion, and outer portion for that matter, of my eyelid vs. the entire lid.</li>
            <li> Super soft and fluffy brush!  </li>
            <li> A little big and hard to use but good for applying eyeshadow on the lid.</li>
            <li> Not that much use as I expected.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques is a good brand, doesn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just the right size for adding a little emphasis to your look.</li>
            <li> Small enough for just a touch of color at the crease or on the lid- useful tool.</li>
            <li> this brush really very practical for Tight spaces In the eye</li>
            <li> The only thing I find I don&#x27;t like is the bristles tend to flare out a little too much and cause me to put color when I don&#x27;t intend when I try getting closer to the crease.  </li>
            <li> This brush is a lot smaller than I expected, but definitely still up to the quality of the other Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> but it is much too small to put color all over the lid.</li>
            <li> the bristles are soft yet firm enough to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> receiving this brush, I noticed that even though the bristles are synthetic, they are very soft and yet firm</li>
            <li> I have a few of the other real technique brushes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a small enough brush for my very small eyelids, I&#x27;m glad I found it and am considering buying another one!</li>
            <li> oh and it also came earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> I leave this to air dry</li>
            <li> I had been using a Jane Iredale eye shader brush (outer v dark color), a Jane Iredale eye contour brush (overall wash of color), and MAC 127 to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sisters behind Real Techniques are genius!  </li>
            <li> I wash it regularly and no hair fall down.</li>
            <li> The brush is soft and does not hurt the delicate skin under your eye.</li>
            <li> The cheaper products are sometimes harder to work with..</li>
            <li> I concur with the other reviewer who feels that this is not the brush to use when applying eye shadow all over the lid, and for outer corner application I find it</li>
            <li> I can use it in other things too than just shading.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brush (using 2 different colors, 1 per side) and my MAC 217 exclusively for the past 2 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Way too small for eyeshadow; I have to keep going back to the palette for</li>
            <li> If you wanted to use a dark color during the day, you can use this brush to soften the look.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be a little fluffier?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it everyday.</li>
            <li> I had a bit of trouble applying my eye shadows evenly.</li>
            <li> Holds the shadow well and has very little fall out.</li>
            <li> so i&#x27;m not sure how it performs in that aspect.</li>
            <li> I found it a bit too small and thick and uneven</li>
            <li> Not sure what I thought</li>
            <li> so I can pack on eyeshadow color precisely on my small eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WOW - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> Expensive brands and</li>
            <li> Cantttttttttttt go wrong with Samantha chapmen!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great item! Works very well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of Real Technique brushes for a while now, and decided didn&#x27;t hesitate in purchasing this Shading Bush. WOW - I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. This brush is amazing quality and is so soft! It applies my eyeshadow so effortlessly, and I tend to use this more to soften the edges of my eyeshadow to give a more seamless look. It&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintains it&#x27;s shape which has been a real problem for me with other brushes purchased in the past. This brush dries quickly too - I leave this to air dry and it&#x27;s good to use again within 1-2 hours. Excellent buy - I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate in recommending this brush to others and the complete Real Techniques range.</li>
            <li> Real Techniques is a fabulous brand.  The bristles are soft. The application is even and perfect.  This brush is an excellent addition to your makeup collection</li>
            <li> Real Techniques is a good brand, doesn&#x27;t disappointed. nice brush</li>
            <li> probably one of the best eyeshadow brush that works in multiple ways. It can be used as a crease brush or dome brush etc. it works wonders. def. easy to use! If i could I would get like 3 of these some time. (: oh and it also came earlier than expected. REALLY HAPPY with the product.</li>
            <li> Higher quality than a brush you&#x27;d spend $50 on at sephora. Trust me. Real techniques are the bomb.</li>
            <li> Very nice brush, I use as a crease brush.</li>
            <li> This is one of my go-to brushes for packing eyeshadow onto the eyelid. It picks up a good amount of product and does not shed.</li>
            <li> Love all the Real Techniques brushes. i use this particular one for smudging under eye shadow or applying on the lids for intense looks. Great quality and value!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good. I&#x27;m using it everyday. Love it. Next time want to try essencial eye kit. Thank you so much</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a great eye shadow brush to have on hand. I&#x27;m actually thinking about purchasing more of them. The brush is soft and I love the color.</li>
            <li> Super soft and fluffy brush!  Perfect for blending and softening the edges of your eye shadow for a more natural or smoky appearance.</li>
            <li> A little big and hard to use but good for applying eyeshadow on the lid. Not so much for blending.</li>
            <li> Cantttttttttttt go wrong with Samantha chapmen!.. I think her line may be my top 2 favorite brushes everrrrrr!!,&lt;br /&gt;I am a makeup artist myself and have used many many. Expensive brands and these are my top top favvvvvv!!!&lt;br /&gt;And I love entire brush line!!</li>
            <li> I love real Techniques brushes, I have several of them.  For the price point they are unbeatable.  I have even given them as gifts.</li>
            <li> I own quite a few real techniques brushes.  This is a good shading brush.  I bought 4 of them and they are all wonderful.  No shedding, good application, and keep their shape after continued use and washings</li>
            <li> A very nice brush, soft and effective, blend the color well. I do not have any problem with it since I bought it more than 6 month ago. I wash it regularly and no hair fall down. Even if it is a great brush, there are some more affordable ones which are as effective and pleasant than this one...</li>
            <li> it is a great eyeshadow brush&lt;br /&gt;ya it is not the best for all over the lid color in 2 sec&lt;br /&gt;but if u r like me who likes to mix the colors on the lid by haveing 2 or 3 colors there&lt;br /&gt;then this is perfect for u&lt;br /&gt;it is not too small n not too large that u can be so precise without it taking for ever to finish your look</li>
            <li> I was looking for a smaller brush that could precisely place colour on the inner, middle and outer lid/crease area. This one is just perfect for all of that. Bristles are soft and gentle, easy to clean, easy to dry. Must have in your brush collection.</li>
            <li> I use this for liquid concealer under my eyes and so far it blends awesomely. Cleaned it once and no shedding. The brush is soft and does not hurt the delicate skin under your eye. have not used this for eye shadaw so i&#x27;m not sure how it performs in that aspect.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really good and works really well! i love all the brushes of the line and it&#x27;s really cheap to. everywhone should have these brushes in their collection!</li>
            <li> This brush really helps me target the inner portion, and outer portion for that matter, of my eyelid vs. the entire lid.</li>
            <li> Amazing quality for a brush that is much cheaper than any at Sephora. The bristles are very soft, easy to clean, and the shape is nice on the eyelid. I would say this brush is actually better than my Sephora brushes (at $22+) and it seems like it&#x27;ll last a long time. Slim, attractive, and good for traveling. Easy to hold as well!</li>
            <li> Packs on the color better than the other Real Techniques Starter Set. I tried out all the shadow brushes in the Starter Set and felt something was lacking. I was looking for a smaller brush that could precisely place color on the inner, middle and outer lid/crease area. This brush is much smaller than the base shadow brush in the Starter Set and while it cannot cover the entire lid in a wash of color in one stroke, it is good for more precise application.</li>
            <li> This shading brush is just right for the perfect amount of eye shadow, It&#x27;s soft but firm, and just the right size. I love it.</li>
            <li> I thought this brush was going to be a nice eye shadow brush but it is much too small to put color all over the lid. It is however nice for putting shadow in the outer corner and it might even work for concealer under the eyes. It&#x27;s a soft brush and a good price I just wish the brush was actually bigger.</li>
            <li> Item as described. Fast shipment. Doesn&#x27;t shed. Good blender.</li>
            <li> This shading brush did not wow me as much as it did many other reviewers. I found it a bit too small and thick and uneven (the &#x27;dome&#x27;). I had a bit of trouble applying my eye shadows evenly. I concur with the other reviewer who feels that this is not the brush to use when applying eye shadow all over the lid, and for outer corner application I find it just so-so. Much prefer my Sephora eye shadow brush for both these purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But - the price is definitely right and I might use for travel.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m a fan of Real Techniques brushes. The price is reasonable and the quality is just as good as more expensive brushes.</li>
            <li> Love this brush!! Not surpising though, I love all of the Real Techniques brushes I have. It has great control for putting color right where you want it.</li>
            <li> really soft, does the job and great price.</li>
            <li> This brush is a lot smaller than I expected, but definitely still up to the quality of the other Real Techniques brushes.</li>
            <li> I just love this brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly as ordered. Pleased.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different brands of brushes, but this brand is one of my favorites.  Size and length is nice and brush is firm yet soft.</li>
            <li> I am a cosmetics professional and absolutely love the Real Techniques brushes. They are a really nice quality, especially for the price. They hold up well after washing, fit comfortably in your hand, and do a great job of applying! Make sure you check out the pixiwoo video tutorials on youtube... definitely an added bonus from the creators of Real Techniques!</li>
            <li> This brush is good to create a soft lid look because of how soft it is. If you wanted to use a dark color during the day, you can use this brush to soften the look. I thought this would be for a firmer brush when I boight this so I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.</li>
            <li> Super! Schnelle Lieferung bzw schneller als angek√ºndigt! Der Pinsel ist sehr sch√∂n, gef√§llt mir wirklich sehr gut und ich denke ich werde mir noch mehr kaufen</li>
            <li> Love love lovvveeee this brush soooo much!!!! It&#x27;s a great brush for packing on pigment or shadow to the lid, blending transition colors or just gettin&#x27; deep into the crease. Buy. this. Brushhhhhhh</li>
            <li> Love this one for under eye buffing! Much better than a pencil brush for sensitive under eyes!</li>
            <li> This the third Real Techniques brush I have purchased. It had a soft texture and it easy to use. Small enough for just a touch of color at the crease or on the lid- useful tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect brush in every way.  The entire line is the best!  Will be purchasing many more to complete my collection.</li>
            <li> Great brush for packing on your base color</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes.  These makeup brushes have great reviews on YouTube, which pushed me to buy them. They pick up makeup pretty easy and give great amounts of even coverage.</li>
            <li> I bought this brush in January and I love it. It picks up the right amount of shadow, spreads it smoothly and has not shed yet after many washes. I use this over the entire lid as well the corners of my eye with no problems. It works well with dark and light shadows, I have even used it with a cream shadow and it works great with that too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now a fan of Real Techniques and will buy more.</li>
            <li> Not bad at all. Im a fan of Real Techniques, gets the job done for sure!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok brush. I suppose you get what you pay for, so it&#x27;s a reasonable enough brush for what you pay. I liked the face brushes, not the eye ones. Will not repurchase the eye sets.</li>
            <li> I use this brush for putting primer on the eyelids or for applying and buffing out concealer, whether under the eyes or on spots. It works great. I like all the real technique brushes for any cream or liquid product.</li>
            <li> This brush is the perfect eye brush! I can use it in other things too than just shading. Love it! :)</li>
            <li> all brushes of real techniques are ideal. I am since I have this brush very happy. Price performance is ideal.</li>
            <li> good product.  Had no issues.  very useful.  What i thought I was getting.  The quality of this product was high.</li>
            <li> No complaints from my daughter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a makeup artist and this is now my new favorite brush! Perfect size that allows for more detail application! You also Can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> The cheaper products are sometimes harder to work with..&lt;br /&gt;so i figured this was something id treat myself to and BOY WAS I AMAZED. it just glides over your eyelid like butter.&lt;br /&gt;this was totally worth the price.. trust me im still keeping my cheap brushes but i also enjoy the best of both worlds.</li>
            <li> I use this brush more for the eyelid area. Works well, doesn&#x27;t keep too much product on the brush and applies well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I am a big fan of the Pixiwoo sisters on youtube. I didn&#x27;t realize when I bought them that they were Sam&#x27;s signature line of brushes. The price was super reasonable and they were delivered really quickly. This brush is really nice for detail work in the crease and under the lower eyelid. I really like it.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, such soft bristles! Use this one daily!</li>
            <li> Amazing quality. So soft</li>
            <li> This is great for shading the outer part of a lid and blending into the crease. It&#x27;s hard to find a small enough brush for my very small eyelids, I&#x27;m glad I found it and am considering buying another one!</li>
            <li> I have to say these are my favorite brushes! They are affordable! The are soft durable!&lt;br /&gt;In regards to pricing if someone is looking for good inexpensive brushes these are sooo worth the money! Highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very soft blending brush. It feels so nice on my eye lids. I am purchasing more. Thanks Samantha Chapman</li>
            <li> I did not realize what a difference a brush could make with eye shadow application.  And I cannot get over the quality of this brush, given the price.  It picks up a good amount of shadow, blends extremely well, and produces virtually no falling dust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sisters behind Real Techniques are genius!  High-quality, yet affordable brush lines.  What&#x27;s not to like?</li>
            <li> Perfect size!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Nice brush, seen at ULTA for more.</li>
            <li> if you over wash them the bristles will fall out...  other wise great!</li>
            <li> It simply does the job! Awesome!</li>
            <li> I love love love all the real techniques brushes! I own all of them, the shading brush is my fave!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon accidentally sent me 2 of these instead of the 2-pack lash and brow groomer, and I decided to keep them, so Now i have 3 shading brushes!</li>
            <li> Nice little shading brush perfect for applying lid color.  The only thing I find I don&#x27;t like is the bristles tend to flare out a little too much and cause me to put color when I don&#x27;t intend when I try getting closer to the crease.  I have corrected this by changing the angle from which I apply the shade.</li>
            <li> I have a few of the other real technique brushes. This one is wonderful for applying eye makeup. the bristles are soft yet firm enough to apply makeup.</li>
            <li> It was too fat. I needed a thinner brush</li>
            <li> Not that much use as I expected. Still a nice brush though.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Nothing to go WOW over however i HAVE noticed it blends the concealer under my eye pretty well so I guess I don&#x27;t regret it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good brush for a few different steps in the process of my eye shadow application. I thought it would be a little fluffier? Larger? Not sure what I thought but I can&#x27;t deny it is a quality brush.</li>
            <li> I had been using a Jane Iredale eye shader brush (outer v dark color), a Jane Iredale eye contour brush (overall wash of color), and MAC 127 to blend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving this brush, I noticed that even though the bristles are synthetic, they are very soft and yet firm so I can pack on eyeshadow color precisely on my small eyelids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One aspect I find very helpful is that the tips are white, so when I spray 99% isopropyl alcohol for spot cleaning, I can see right away if the brush is clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this brush (using 2 different colors, 1 per side) and my MAC 217 exclusively for the past 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Shading Brush, the Blush Brush, and the Setting Brush, and have just finalized an order for the Travel Brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> this brush really very practical for Tight spaces In the eye&lt;br /&gt;People who own eyes with small eyelid area Like me it will help them this brush so much .....</li>
            <li> Very soft and grabs eye shadow well. Also applied eye shadow uniformly. I have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the outer corner.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully! Just the right size for adding a little emphasis to your look. Holds the shadow well and has very little fall out. LOVE this brush!</li>
            <li> Way too small for eyeshadow; I have to keep going back to the palette for more so that I can cover just the eyelid.</li>
