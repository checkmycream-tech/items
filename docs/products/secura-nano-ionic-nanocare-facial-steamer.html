            <li>Fast shipping works great!</li>
            <li>Love the steam it creates and loved the fact that the supplier supports and warranties its product.</li>
            <li>My guess is that somewhere inside there is plastic in close proximity to the heating element that is infusing the steam with some kind of off-gas when heated.</li>
            <li>It almost feels like a warm cloud is flying across my face.</li>
            <li>It is handy and portable</li>
            <li>It is great for keeping your skin clean.</li>
            <li>Awesome product, would highly recommend.  </li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a great product and definitely worth the value for money.  </li>
            <li>By far one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li>Even, strong steam!</li>
            <li>but that steam comes out strong!</li>
            <li>I read tons of reviews, and all the good ones are true.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li>The design truly facilities a comfortable, refreshing experience!</li>
            <li>The steamer stops after 10 minutes, which is more than adequate time for good results.</li>
            <li>Love the fine mist!  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fine steam that comes out and a lot of steam comes out too</li>
            <li>This facial steamer is quite impressive!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to breathe this in.  </li>
            <li>but i love it</li>
            <li>the best thing is that u can add essential oils to them.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this for sure.  </li>
            <li>Love this</li>

            <li>Best Christmas present</li>
            <li>I think my skin looks better, but I know it feels better.  </li>
            <li>the steam hits my face perfectly, put on an audiobook and this has been a part of my regular routine.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>So it helps skin absorb better.</li>
            <li>This facial steamer is perfect.</li>
            <li>I find myself enjoying it for that purpose alone.</li>
            <li>This one works so much better.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li>Steam does seem to be more &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>, I can do at home love it.</li>
            <li>I love it , use 2 times a week.</li>

            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>I was considering Panasonic, but am so glad I bought this one.</li>

            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love, love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Stylish and as advertised.  </li>
            <li>The best at home facial ever!</li>
            <li>Quite and cute, you should try it.</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to maintain, too.  </li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>Great size, great spray, very quiet, heats quickly.</li>
            <li>I used it the first time straight out of the box and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>My skin feels very clean, and breakouts have lessened quite a bit.</li>
            <li>This product works, but breathing the strange smelling steam may not the best thing for your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>that time your pores are opening and more easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>works, portable, cute, good amount of steam, lasts for reasonable time.</li>
            <li>Even though the seller says its bpa free, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to breathe in something that smells of plastic.  </li>
            <li>At first I really I liked this product - the style is cute and it produces a lot of steam.</li>
            <li>Nice product, definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>It is really good .it is very convenient</li>
            <li>Easy to use and does what it suppose to.</li>
            <li>Great product and will buy others as gifts as I want my friends to have the same benefits :-)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to store.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to keep hygienic.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>Had strong plastic smell in steam.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a singer and this helps my voice stay strong and</li>
            <li>But the steam now is not as strong as it was in the beginning:</li>
            <li>time I would do it straight out of the shower to make it more effective.</li>
            <li>The Nano Iconic is absolutely the best facial steamer I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I really like this steamer because it is effective, fast to steam, does the job, and seems like good quality.</li>
            <li>Hope the steamer will live for a good amount of time....</li>
            <li>Steam is really fine.</li>
            <li>No bad smell and its working perfectly just as I expected.</li>
            <li>I like it, it says no adding essential oils, but I add 1-2 drops always.it is a lot more pleasant.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t owned any other steamers, but this one is perfect for my needs and the price is right!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m telling you this little thing is awesome.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the large amount of steam produced in a very short amount of time</li>
            <li>Good fit in my busy schedule.</li>
            <li>got this free or discounted for my unbiased feedback</li>
            <li>but, my sinuses have really benefited by the warm steam.</li>
            <li>Those cheap ones basically boil water to steam.</li>
            <li>Light weight and no hassle with filling water.</li>
            <li>Great product and cheaper than comparable Nano Ionic facial steamers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s from cheap, TOXIC plastic.</li>
            <li>- the unit is light and the steam starts to come out within 20 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy it if you do decide on this one.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I loved it and shared it with my adult children.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It gives out about 8mins steady, warm steam.</li>
            <li>Generates a steady stream of warm steam.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and works quickly.</li>
            <li>Small, perfect amount of steam for face.</li>
            <li>It Opens Up My Pores Significantly.</li>
            <li>love doing facials, but now I love it more with this facial</li>
            <li>It can get really hot, so be sure that your face isn&#x27;t too close.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love it , it doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell as some other reviews, I used for both facial &amp; hair spa , it worked great !</li>
            <li>Easy to use, just the right amount of steam and duration.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s unusual for a product to be better than advertised .</li>
            <li>My Mom love it very muchÔºÅ</li>
            <li>and not feel good enough for my face,</li>
            <li>For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised, and is quick to start after you turn on the unit.  </li>
            <li>The company sent out the unit immediately after I ordered it, and even personally followed up with me to make sure I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have been using it now for just a short time and two of my friends asked me what I was doing differently for my face as it looked so good!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this twice a week for the last several weeks and am very happy.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the product and think it is lovely.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my facial steamer.</li>
            <li>One full tank will provide about 6-8 minutes worth of steam.</li>
            <li>like that the steam generated by this unit easily covered my whole face</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simple, cute and gets the job done!</li>
            <li>, the supplier promptly shipped me a new unit and advised me not to put any oil or addends in water: I have used it - 3 times so far and looks good.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly and delivers just the right amount of steam.</li>
            <li>The fine mist of steam is also much easier to breath in while steaming.</li>
            <li>Great little steamer.</li>
            <li>Great little machine.</li>
            <li>Great little steamer.</li>
            <li>I think its well worth the price.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not inconvenient.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li>This is really a nice facial steamer, but I guess I wasn&#x27;t thinking when I choose it.</li>
            <li>Gets very hot, very fast.</li>
            <li>The steam is at the right temperature and it sprays on to my face, doesn&#x27;t scorch my skin.</li>
            <li>I use this right before I use a face mask</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and only takes about 10 min for the treatment.  </li>
            <li>However, it does what I need which is to open pores (and sinuses) with an abundant supply of directed hot steam without bubbling hot water onto me.  </li>
            <li>This works great when it works but usually stops working after about 2 months.</li>
            <li>The steamer emits a very fine steam (no sputtering)  which covers the entire face.  </li>
            <li>there,was a smell at first</li>
            <li>The steam isn&#x27;t so hot it burns the skin.</li>
            <li>I never thought these really were worth the hype</li>
            <li>First I gotta tell ya</li>
            <li>I love that I can also use this to open up my sinuses</li>
            <li>The steam comes out 3 seconds is hot but your skin is not going to fall off.</li>
            <li>Be sure to follow the directions to only use distilled water so that it doesn&#x27;t get a build-up</li>
            <li>The steam build up is efficient and consistent.</li>
            <li>I love this facial steamer.  </li>
            <li>First time user, i suggest letting it have</li>
            <li>Better than a facial!</li>
            <li>I love using this before doing facial masks.</li>
            <li>I can probably get a better facial steam by cooking pasta for my husband.</li>
            <li>exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it is just the combination of hot steam against plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was also able to skip my nightly PurMist session because the steam cleared my sinuses as I was treating myself to an at-home facial.</li>
            <li>an you can see and feel how much deeper the face mask goes!</li>
            <li>I do not like the plastic like chemical smell that comes out with the steam the first couple of minutes though.</li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>which is one reason I choose it first.</li>
            <li>I will review again if I start noticing any problems that I think people should be aware of.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t pop any hot water.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li>There really does seem to be a difference using a Ionic steamer versus the standard steamer, mist is very fine.</li>
            <li>The price is much more reasonable than other brands, yet it doesn&#x27;t seem cheaply made at all.  </li>
            <li>But other then that it is still a nice steamer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommened this product worth every penny .</li>
            <li>Great face steamer, very ligkhtweight and gives a good amount of steam for opening up your pores, my only con with this is the water tank is very small the steaming last for about 10 mins</li>
            <li>the steam comes out pretty fast</li>
            <li>it has a very plastic smell first.</li>
            <li>Easy to fill and simple to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used pure distilled water, as per the instructions.</li>
            <li>I used pure distilled water as per the instructions (note:  is says not to add oils etc to the water).  </li>
            <li>The steamer is nice and compact and takes little room on the vanity.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I absolutely KNOW this is going to help my skin so much.  </li>
            <li>Im going to save so much money from salon facials</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast and puts out loads of steam.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>This might go away after prolonged use, but after I ran it about 10 times the smell was still very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steam</li>
            <li>Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I did not have much strength.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very relaxing, and I use it every morning.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and was very worried about the smell mentioned in one review.</li>
            <li>you really don&#x27;t care about the smell like myself, then go ahead buying it</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast - no issues at all.</li>
            <li>and it really helps to freshen up the skin.</li>
            <li>very award to work with.</li>
            <li>The price is so much reasonable compare to Panasonic.</li>
            <li>It really does it&#x27;s work and fix my skin very well.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t compare it to the $179 Panasonic unit since I&#x27;ve never tried it, but I can say that I am thoroughly satisfied with this unit although I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.</li>
            <li>only good for self use not on other people.</li>
            <li>And I use it right before I put my dead sea mask on my face because the steam will open up my pores more and clean out all the gunk in it.</li>
            <li>This is a great alternative to the more expensive Panasonic Facial Steamer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quickly and provides a steady stream of warm steam for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>So far, this product works exactly as promoted.  </li>
            <li>The full tank lasts about 8 minutes which is enough time for me.  </li>
            <li>Generally speaking, It worth the price.</li>
            <li>The steamer feels like hot soft clouds rushing to your face.</li>
            <li>Used barely 4 times in less than a month and the cap of the water container broke So far going good</li>
            <li>does have a slight odor to it, but that may go away with more uses.</li>
            <li>I actually turn it on and off while I&#x27;m treating my face because it&#x27;s so quick to heat up (saves water).</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this one mainly because of the cheaper price.</li>
            <li>Steady stream of steam.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend this steamer with high kudos.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this streamer</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this little steamer.</li>
            <li>I love my little steam machine.</li>
            <li>Professional results at home!!  </li>
            <li>It did fine for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li>No complaint.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see how long will it last :)</li>
            <li>As the pores open, the moisturizer is absorbed.  </li>
            <li>I love that it is small and really compact.</li>
            <li>Be careful: 1 wait for it to cool down after usage 2, be gentle with the water tank, it seems easy to break.</li>
            <li>Live in Chicago, where we have low humidity in the winter, and this is like a breath of (humid) fresh air.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I do steam for a very long time to open up my pores so most people probably won&#x27;t have this issue</li>
            <li>instructions that came with this are very basic, but provides just the right amount of information</li>
            <li>Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool]] makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>It takes seconds to start up (no reading directions needed) each time and it gets hot enough where i can FEEL my pores widening and opening up.</li>
            <li>now I am back to square one with my hot pot and a towel over my head.</li>
            <li>I reordered it again after my first one stopped working and now my second has stopped working as well.</li>
            <li>The steam is hot enough to open my pores and I  begin to see positive results.  </li>
            <li>Gentle and comfort, won&#x27;t burn my skin, and it&#x27;s small size which could fit my desk</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this little powerful steamer!</li>
            <li>does not work unless you actually hold it in a certain position.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this little facial steamer.</li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Technology has come far.</li>
            <li>It does have some plastic smell the first few seconds each time using it, but can&#x27;t complain about the price and quality since the Panisonic one is twice as much as it with the exact same function.</li>
            <li>It produces plenty of steam and there are no problems so far.</li>
            <li>I have no problems so far and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>Although I wish it were just a tad bigger for coverage, I really like this steamer.</li>
            <li>I use bottled water rather than tap water and have not had any issues so far.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any strange smell even the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li>Let me get this straight, when you open the box, BEFORE you even turn on the device, you can smell it.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re expecting a professional spa experience, this is not it.</li>
            <li>I really want to try it with a facemask on as I&#x27;ve seem that done by a few people and want to know if it maximizes results of fresh skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right size and the water tank/reserve in the back is definitely adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelly</li>
            <li>After looking around for a facial steamer and originally considering a more expensive name-brand model, I decided on the Secura based on user recommendations for the steamer.</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money on other cheaply made facial steamer!</li>
            <li>The unit itself is small and easy to store.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fine mist similar to the cold steam that most humidifiers produce, but this steam is hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It pretty much seems to be a water boiler with a small hole to prevent splashing.</li>
            <li>I wanted a facial steamer to clear my pores and</li>
            <li>Once the water in the reserve tank is empty, you ready to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>only complaint about this product is that the steam has a strong chemical-like smell.</li>
            <li>produces small amount of steam fairly quickly for several minutes..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if clam of Nano-sized water particles can be substantiated or not (really, if they didn&#x27;t care to get a proper English translation on the box and have no instructional insert, have they really tested the size of the particles?).  </li>
            <li>Does the job - the skin feels soft and does not leave you feeling dry.</li>
            <li>The steam output is powerful for such a small appliance.</li>
            <li>I had to pass it down to my daughter because it really hurt my neck and back because I had to bend in towards it.</li>
            <li>A good stream of steam we sent back another less expensive unit.</li>
            <li>The smell did not bother me much it did smell a little like plastic</li>
            <li>Maybe the steam smelled a little strange from the container the first few uses but after a few rinses with purified water it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Half the price of other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; facial steamers that we looked at on amazon and definitely worth the price.  </li>

            <li> Fast shipping works great!</li>
            <li> Love the steam it creates and loved the fact that the supplier supports and warranties its product.</li>
            <li> My guess is that somewhere inside there is plastic in close proximity to the heating element that is infusing the steam with some kind of off-gas when heated.</li>
            <li> It almost feels like a warm cloud is flying across my face.</li>
            <li> It is handy and portable</li>
            <li> It is great for keeping your skin clean.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, would highly recommend.  </li>

            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been used for a period of time, the effect is very good really</li>
            <li> It works very good so far !!!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled :-)</li>
            <li> So far so good!!!</li>
            <li> Using A Steam Is The Best Way To Clear</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and definitely worth the value for money.  </li>
            <li> By far one of the best products out there.</li>
            <li> Even, strong steam!</li>
            <li> but that steam comes out strong!</li>
            <li> I read tons of reviews, and all the good ones are true.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> The design truly facilities a comfortable, refreshing experience!</li>
            <li> The steamer stops after 10 minutes, which is more than adequate time for good results.</li>
            <li> Love the fine mist!  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fine steam that comes out and a lot of steam comes out too</li>
            <li> This facial steamer is quite impressive!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to breathe this in.  </li>
            <li> but i love it</li>
            <li> the best thing is that u can add essential oils to them.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this for sure.  </li>
            <li> Love this</li>
            <li> This is the best home facial steamer that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  </li>
            <li> Best Christmas present</li>
            <li> I think my skin looks better, but I know it feels better.  </li>
            <li> the steam hits my face perfectly, put on an audiobook and this has been a part of my regular routine.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> So it helps skin absorb better.</li>
            <li> This facial steamer is perfect.</li>
            <li> I find myself enjoying it for that purpose alone.</li>
            <li> This one works so much better.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> Steam does seem to be more &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> , I can do at home love it.</li>
            <li> I love it , use 2 times a week.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I love this.</li>
            <li> I was considering Panasonic, but am so glad I bought this one.</li>
            <li> Better than panasonic</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Stylish and as advertised.  </li>
            <li> The best at home facial ever!</li>
            <li> Quite and cute, you should try it.</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to maintain, too.  </li>
            <li> so far so good!</li>
            <li> Great size, great spray, very quiet, heats quickly.</li>
            <li> I used it the first time straight out of the box and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very clean, and breakouts have lessened quite a bit.</li>
            <li> This product works, but breathing the strange smelling steam may not the best thing for your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> that time your pores are opening and more easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> works, portable, cute, good amount of steam, lasts for reasonable time.</li>
            <li> Even though the seller says its bpa free, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to breathe in something that smells of plastic.  </li>
            <li> At first I really I liked this product - the style is cute and it produces a lot of steam.</li>
            <li> Nice product, definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> It is really good .it is very convenient</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does what it suppose to.</li>
            <li> Great product and will buy others as gifts as I want my friends to have the same benefits :-)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to store.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to keep hygienic.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Had strong plastic smell in steam.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a singer and this helps my voice stay strong and</li>
            <li> But the steam now is not as strong as it was in the beginning:</li>
            <li> time I would do it straight out of the shower to make it more effective.</li>
            <li> The Nano Iconic is absolutely the best facial steamer I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I really like this steamer because it is effective, fast to steam, does the job, and seems like good quality.</li>
            <li> Hope the steamer will live for a good amount of time....</li>
            <li> Steam is really fine.</li>
            <li> No bad smell and its working perfectly just as I expected.</li>
            <li> I like it, it says no adding essential oils, but I add 1-2 drops always.it is a lot more pleasant.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned any other steamers, but this one is perfect for my needs and the price is right!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m telling you this little thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the large amount of steam produced in a very short amount of time</li>
            <li> Good fit in my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> got this free or discounted for my unbiased feedback</li>
            <li> but, my sinuses have really benefited by the warm steam.</li>
            <li> Those cheap ones basically boil water to steam.</li>
            <li> Light weight and no hassle with filling water.</li>
            <li> Great product and cheaper than comparable Nano Ionic facial steamers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s from cheap, TOXIC plastic.</li>
            <li> - the unit is light and the steam starts to come out within 20 seconds or so.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy it if you do decide on this one.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I loved it and shared it with my adult children.  </li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It gives out about 8mins steady, warm steam.</li>
            <li> Generates a steady stream of warm steam.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and works quickly.</li>
            <li> Small, perfect amount of steam for face.</li>
            <li> It Opens Up My Pores Significantly.</li>
            <li> love doing facials, but now I love it more with this facial</li>
            <li> It can get really hot, so be sure that your face isn&#x27;t too close.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love it , it doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell as some other reviews, I used for both facial &amp; hair spa , it worked great !</li>
            <li> Easy to use, just the right amount of steam and duration.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unusual for a product to be better than advertised .</li>
            <li> My Mom love it very muchÔºÅ</li>
            <li> and not feel good enough for my face,</li>
            <li> For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, and is quick to start after you turn on the unit.  </li>
            <li> The company sent out the unit immediately after I ordered it, and even personally followed up with me to make sure I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have been using it now for just a short time and two of my friends asked me what I was doing differently for my face as it looked so good!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this twice a week for the last several weeks and am very happy.</li>
            <li> Overall I love the product and think it is lovely.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my facial steamer.</li>
            <li> One full tank will provide about 6-8 minutes worth of steam.</li>
            <li> like that the steam generated by this unit easily covered my whole face</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simple, cute and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> , the supplier promptly shipped me a new unit and advised me not to put any oil or addends in water: I have used it - 3 times so far and looks good.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly and delivers just the right amount of steam.</li>
            <li> The fine mist of steam is also much easier to breath in while steaming.</li>
            <li> Great little steamer.</li>
            <li> Great little machine.</li>
            <li> Great little steamer.</li>
            <li> I think its well worth the price.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not inconvenient.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> This is really a nice facial steamer, but I guess I wasn&#x27;t thinking when I choose it.</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, very fast.</li>
            <li> The steam is at the right temperature and it sprays on to my face, doesn&#x27;t scorch my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this right before I use a face mask</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and only takes about 10 min for the treatment.  </li>
            <li> However, it does what I need which is to open pores (and sinuses) with an abundant supply of directed hot steam without bubbling hot water onto me.  </li>
            <li> This works great when it works but usually stops working after about 2 months.</li>
            <li> The steamer emits a very fine steam (no sputtering)  which covers the entire face.  </li>
            <li> there,was a smell at first</li>
            <li> The steam isn&#x27;t so hot it burns the skin.</li>
            <li> I never thought these really were worth the hype</li>
            <li> First I gotta tell ya</li>
            <li> I love that I can also use this to open up my sinuses</li>
            <li> The steam comes out 3 seconds is hot but your skin is not going to fall off.</li>
            <li> Be sure to follow the directions to only use distilled water so that it doesn&#x27;t get a build-up</li>
            <li> The steam build up is efficient and consistent.</li>
            <li> I love this facial steamer.  </li>
            <li> First time user, i suggest letting it have</li>
            <li> Better than a facial!</li>
            <li> I love using this before doing facial masks.</li>
            <li> I can probably get a better facial steam by cooking pasta for my husband.</li>
            <li> exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think it is just the combination of hot steam against plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was also able to skip my nightly PurMist session because the steam cleared my sinuses as I was treating myself to an at-home facial.</li>
            <li> an you can see and feel how much deeper the face mask goes!</li>
            <li> I do not like the plastic like chemical smell that comes out with the steam the first couple of minutes though.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> which is one reason I choose it first.</li>
            <li> I will review again if I start noticing any problems that I think people should be aware of.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t pop any hot water.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> There really does seem to be a difference using a Ionic steamer versus the standard steamer, mist is very fine.</li>
            <li> The price is much more reasonable than other brands, yet it doesn&#x27;t seem cheaply made at all.  </li>
            <li> But other then that it is still a nice steamer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommened this product worth every penny .</li>
            <li> Great face steamer, very ligkhtweight and gives a good amount of steam for opening up your pores, my only con with this is the water tank is very small the steaming last for about 10 mins</li>
            <li> the steam comes out pretty fast</li>
            <li> it has a very plastic smell first.</li>
            <li> Easy to fill and simple to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used pure distilled water, as per the instructions.</li>
            <li> I used pure distilled water as per the instructions (note:  is says not to add oils etc to the water).  </li>
            <li> The steamer is nice and compact and takes little room on the vanity.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I absolutely KNOW this is going to help my skin so much.  </li>
            <li> Im going to save so much money from salon facials</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast and puts out loads of steam.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> This might go away after prolonged use, but after I ran it about 10 times the smell was still very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steam</li>
            <li> Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I did not have much strength.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very relaxing, and I use it every morning.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and was very worried about the smell mentioned in one review.</li>
            <li> you really don&#x27;t care about the smell like myself, then go ahead buying it</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast - no issues at all.</li>
            <li> and it really helps to freshen up the skin.</li>
            <li> very award to work with.</li>
            <li> The price is so much reasonable compare to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> It really does it&#x27;s work and fix my skin very well.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare it to the $179 Panasonic unit since I&#x27;ve never tried it, but I can say that I am thoroughly satisfied with this unit although I&#x27;ve only used it once so far.</li>
            <li> only good for self use not on other people.</li>
            <li> And I use it right before I put my dead sea mask on my face because the steam will open up my pores more and clean out all the gunk in it.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the more expensive Panasonic Facial Steamer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quickly and provides a steady stream of warm steam for approximately 10 minutes.</li>
            <li> So far, this product works exactly as promoted.  </li>
            <li> The full tank lasts about 8 minutes which is enough time for me.  </li>
            <li> Generally speaking, It worth the price.</li>
            <li> The steamer feels like hot soft clouds rushing to your face.</li>
            <li> Used barely 4 times in less than a month and the cap of the water container broke So far going good</li>
            <li> does have a slight odor to it, but that may go away with more uses.</li>
            <li> I actually turn it on and off while I&#x27;m treating my face because it&#x27;s so quick to heat up (saves water).</li>
            <li> I decided to buy this one mainly because of the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> Steady stream of steam.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this steamer with high kudos.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this streamer</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little steamer.</li>
            <li> I love my little steam machine.</li>
            <li> Professional results at home!!  </li>
            <li> It did fine for the first few weeks.</li>
            <li> No complaint.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see how long will it last :)</li>
            <li> As the pores open, the moisturizer is absorbed.  </li>
            <li> I love that it is small and really compact.</li>
            <li> Be careful: 1 wait for it to cool down after usage 2, be gentle with the water tank, it seems easy to break.</li>
            <li> Live in Chicago, where we have low humidity in the winter, and this is like a breath of (humid) fresh air.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I do steam for a very long time to open up my pores so most people probably won&#x27;t have this issue</li>
            <li> instructions that came with this are very basic, but provides just the right amount of information</li>
            <li> Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool]] makes a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> It takes seconds to start up (no reading directions needed) each time and it gets hot enough where i can FEEL my pores widening and opening up.</li>
            <li> now I am back to square one with my hot pot and a towel over my head.</li>
            <li> I reordered it again after my first one stopped working and now my second has stopped working as well.</li>
            <li> The steam is hot enough to open my pores and I  begin to see positive results.  </li>
            <li> Gentle and comfort, won&#x27;t burn my skin, and it&#x27;s small size which could fit my desk</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this little powerful steamer!</li>
            <li> does not work unless you actually hold it in a certain position.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little facial steamer.</li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Technology has come far.</li>
            <li> It does have some plastic smell the first few seconds each time using it, but can&#x27;t complain about the price and quality since the Panisonic one is twice as much as it with the exact same function.</li>
            <li> It produces plenty of steam and there are no problems so far.</li>
            <li> I have no problems so far and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> Although I wish it were just a tad bigger for coverage, I really like this steamer.</li>
            <li> I use bottled water rather than tap water and have not had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any strange smell even the first couple of uses.</li>
            <li> Let me get this straight, when you open the box, BEFORE you even turn on the device, you can smell it.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re expecting a professional spa experience, this is not it.</li>
            <li> I really want to try it with a facemask on as I&#x27;ve seem that done by a few people and want to know if it maximizes results of fresh skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right size and the water tank/reserve in the back is definitely adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelly</li>
            <li> After looking around for a facial steamer and originally considering a more expensive name-brand model, I decided on the Secura based on user recommendations for the steamer.</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on other cheaply made facial steamer!</li>
            <li> The unit itself is small and easy to store.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fine mist similar to the cold steam that most humidifiers produce, but this steam is hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It pretty much seems to be a water boiler with a small hole to prevent splashing.</li>
            <li> I wanted a facial steamer to clear my pores and</li>
            <li> Once the water in the reserve tank is empty, you ready to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> only complaint about this product is that the steam has a strong chemical-like smell.</li>
            <li> produces small amount of steam fairly quickly for several minutes..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if clam of Nano-sized water particles can be substantiated or not (really, if they didn&#x27;t care to get a proper English translation on the box and have no instructional insert, have they really tested the size of the particles?).  </li>
            <li> Does the job - the skin feels soft and does not leave you feeling dry.</li>
            <li> The steam output is powerful for such a small appliance.</li>
            <li> I had to pass it down to my daughter because it really hurt my neck and back because I had to bend in towards it.</li>
            <li> A good stream of steam we sent back another less expensive unit.</li>
            <li> The smell did not bother me much it did smell a little like plastic</li>
            <li> Maybe the steam smelled a little strange from the container the first few uses but after a few rinses with purified water it&#x27;s perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Half the price of other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; facial steamers that we looked at on amazon and definitely worth the price.  </li>
            <li> completely disappointed with the product especially after reading so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> Only used few times, so far works as described..</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this for added moisture in our skin in the winter, for skin care throughout the year, and we love it when we have a cold or sinus infection.  </li>
            <li> Pink | Nano-e NanoCare Facial Steamer</li>
            <li> strange cause</li>
            <li> I hope this lasts as I will be using it for as long as it works.  </li>
            <li> I havent had it long</li>
            <li> I narrowed my search down to this product and a much more expensive version (Panasonic).  </li>
            <li> I place it on the back of the toilet, lay down a towel and sit backwards on the lid</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to refill every single time.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that every time I used it, there came a little bit strange smell.</li>
            <li> The return was easy, but I&#x27;m afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> about 3 times per week, it is small enough to sit on a shelf next to my vanity.  </li>
            <li> If you follow a typical at home facial routine (wash, exfoliate, steam, mask, tone, and moisturize)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s only about 10 minutes or less and works as expected.</li>
            <li> have terribly large pores from my dad, and it&#x27;s much worse on my period.</li>
            <li> You just add water to the little container and turn on - so simple.  </li>
            <li> I purchases a facial steamer from our local pharmacy at least twenty years.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the seller went so far as to lie by telling people that the smell is from ozone, or negative ions.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medical esthetician and I use this everyday in my treatment room on up to 6 clients a day</li>
            <li> I did have a VERY slight chemical smell, but after the third use, it&#x27;s gone.  </li>
            <li> friend of mine has one of the Panasonic steamers and recommended I get one to help clean dirty and clogged pores around my nose.</li>
            <li> does help to clean dirty and clogged pores.</li>
            <li> And I didn&#x27;t notice a plastic smell mentioned in other comments.</li>
            <li> The small plastic water \\&quot;tank\\&quot; pulls out of the back of the unit to fill and holds about an ounce of water.</li>
            <li> Then I did a small extraction, and finally a clay mask--all in about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> I had a bad head cold when I ordered it, and the cool mist really helped clear my sinuses.  </li>
            <li> I put plain green tea in it to get an antioxidant facial!</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me as a birthday gift because I was using other (less convenient)  methods to steam.</li>
            <li> I will admit there was a tiny bit of odor as others complained about</li>
            <li> This negative review is long due.</li>
            <li> However, after using it for half year, I noticed sometimes it started to not function well</li>
            <li> Shipped on time and cost much less than the one at the show.</li>
            <li> Worked for less than two weeks.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight burning smell to it</li>
            <li> This product was less than half the price of either Panasonic model, so I decided to take my chances and try it even though it had no reviews at the time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less dense than sauna or shower steam, for example, but there&#x27;s a lot of it and it shoots out in a hurry.</li>
            <li> I try to use the steamer but the cap is a little tight which was</li>
            <li> I have to move my face about a little to get steam all over</li>
            <li> but I feel it goes away after a few uses.</li>
            <li> a few goes before you put your face in front of it, bc</li>
            <li> Was smelly, but after few uses doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> It smells almost like burning plastic, but not quite so harsh.</li>
            <li> I just need a few breaths to of set the dryness caused by summer air conditioning as well.</li>
            <li> I did notice the slight plastic smell, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to my face.</li>
            <li> Small and compact, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I can get a small amount of odor from my $149 PurMist</li>
            <li> So I usually use rose/flora mask when using the steamer so I won&#x27;t smell</li>
            <li> water chamber was way too small.</li>
            <li> Requires small amount of water but lasts at least 10 min.</li>
            <li> (  I hardly get any steam.</li>
            <li> and she uses it at least twice a day to stay &amp;#34;hydrated.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> The design of this unit is almost identical to the Panasonic models, at least on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seriously, just obsess over it...</li>
            <li> I will say I second another reviewer who said there is an odd smell, nothing awful but odd.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s voltage (100V) does not fit US (110V) and it is expensive for me.</li>
            <li> So I take a towel and try to open the lid and this is when it happen :(</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> it is broken</li>
            <li> I did not close it tight the night before i was so sick and tired</li>
            <li> Use it for my sinus congestion and my grandsons bloody noses from our cold dry winters.</li>
            <li> Buy the expensive one don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> This product appears to be a knockoff of the prohibitively expensive Panasonic models [[ASIN:B008JB0V06</li>
            <li> steam have weird smell.</li>
            <li> I get obsessed with a beauty product, I will research it, read reviews, check prices...</li>

            <li> but I did not care I was desperate.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve had a bad cold and alot of congestion</li>
            <li> There is a very faint smell, but I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now and that smell is almost non-existent.  </li>
            <li> Bad burning smellÔºådon&#x27;t buy it.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and does what it suppose to. No complaint. Hope the steamer will live for a good amount of time....</li>
            <li> Bad burning smellÔºådon&#x27;t buy it. I can&#x27;t return it coz I lost the label and wrapper. Buy the expensive one don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to.  No issues with splattering or anything like that.  Nothing to complain about!</li>
            <li> This facial steamer is quite impressive! I noticed the difference in just one session. My skin was a lot smoother. I think its well worth the price.</li>
            <li> LOVE this steamer! does not burn my skin, opens up my pores nicely.  Highly recommend this little powerful steamer!</li>
            <li> the steam comes out pretty fast so that&#x27;s a plus.&lt;br /&gt;but there is a very strong smell of plastic and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to breathe this in.  Even though the seller says its bpa free, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s safe to breathe in something that smells of plastic.  I am not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> love this!!!  there,was a smell at first but when i used distelled water no smell.  right away people notuced that i had a glow!!!!</li>
            <li> After looking around for a facial steamer and originally considering a more expensive name-brand model, I decided on the Secura based on user recommendations for the steamer. Works as advertised, and is quick to start after you turn on the unit.  The company sent out the unit immediately after I ordered it, and even personally followed up with me to make sure I was satisfied. The rubber pads on my unit were somewhat lopsided, causing some imbalance, and when I asked the company about it, they immediately said they would send out a replacement. Can&#x27;t beat the personal service and desire to satisfy customer needs. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> pefectÔºÅ clean my face and after  use this  feel so good ! Help the skin to fully absorb nutrientsÔºÅ</li>
            <li> it is broken oneÔºåcan&#x27;t use itÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ</li>
            <li> I LOVE this little steamer. I have been using it now for just a short time and two of my friends asked me what I was doing differently for my face as it looked so good!!! I was thrilled :-) Great product and will buy others as gifts as I want my friends to have the same benefits :-)</li>
            <li> At first I really I liked this product - the style is cute and it produces a lot of steam. However, after using it for half year, I noticed sometimes it started to not function well and sometimes I needed to switch off and switch back on to make it work again. I haven&#x27;t used it for about 4 months and today when I wanted to start using it again and removed the water filter, I saw there are cracks in the bottom already. Will throw it away and buy a different product.</li>
            <li> Great face steamer, very ligkhtweight and gives a good amount of steam for opening up your pores, my only con with this is the water tank is very small the steaming last for about 10 mins but i love it</li>
            <li> Awesome unit!i love it. Use it for my sinus congestion and my grandsons bloody noses from our cold dry winters. I love the portability!</li>
            <li> I saw a similar device at the CES show. Shipped on time and cost much less than the one at the show. Works just as well!</li>
            <li> Had strong plastic smell in steam. Not the home spa experience I was looking for</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Don&#x27;t understand the review stating that the steam smelled of plastic.  My girlfriend loves it!</li>
            <li> Product works great.  I wanted a facial steamer to clear my pores and this works great.  The steam isn&#x27;t so hot it burns the skin.</li>
            <li> I washed mine with soap and water before trying and didn&#x27;t have any sort of odor.  You just add water to the little container and turn on - so simple.  I never thought these really were worth the hype but wow. First I gotta tell ya the best thing is that u can add essential oils to them.  I added tea tree oil and man my face felt great. I then used a mask since my pores were open. I love this thing.  I love that I can also use this to open up my sinuses no kidding.  After removing the mask after one use my pores are so diminished it&#x27;s amazing I would recommend this for sure.  Cleanup is a breeze and it doesn&#x27;t take up space  It&#x27;s easy to store.  I absolutely KNOW this is going to help my skin so much.  Love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this free or discounted for my unbiased feedback and I&#x27;m telling you this little thing is awesome.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Worked for less than two weeks. Had to return.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my facial steamer. The steam output is powerful for such a small appliance. It is all I have been searching for and I would highly recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is the best home facial steamer that I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Simple as pie. Just load in some distilled water (I add lemongrass essential oil) and click on. Even, strong steam! One star off for the bad plastic smell. I hope that fades. UPDATE 10/2015: The plastic smell faded a while ago.</li>
            <li> I purchases a facial steamer from our local pharmacy at least twenty years. Technology has come far. This gave me the best steam I&#x27;ve had in a while. I recommend this steamer with high kudos.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this little facial steamer. The steam comes out 3 seconds is hot but your skin is not going to fall off. It&#x27;s perfect definitely worth the money. And I use it right before I put my dead sea mask on my face because the steam will open up my pores more and clean out all the gunk in it. I hope it lasts me forever but if not I will definitely buy another one.</li>
            <li> Live in Chicago, where we have low humidity in the winter, and this is like a breath of (humid) fresh air.  Great for the skin and also for the sinusus.  I had a bad head cold when I ordered it, and the cool mist really helped clear my sinuses.  It&#x27;s very easy to use and easy to maintain, too.  Be sure to follow the directions to only use distilled water so that it doesn&#x27;t get a build-up (like what happens to an iron).</li>
            <li> Great for treating chronic eyelid inflamation</li>
            <li> It does have some plastic smell the first few seconds each time using it, but can&#x27;t complain about the price and quality since the Panisonic one is twice as much as it with the exact same function.</li>
            <li> I really loved this guy, but after about 5 uses it stopped working.  The return was easy, but I&#x27;m afraid to try it again.</li>
            <li> Best Christmas present I ever bought myself! I&#x27;m a singer and this helps my voice stay strong and my skin beautiful so I can look my best when I perform.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected. Let&#x27;s see how long will it last :)</li>
            <li> I wish it was biger container for water, I like it mini steam for ur face</li>
            <li> Great product. Plenty of steam.</li>
            <li> Nice product, definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> Awesome product, would highly recommend.  Fast shipping!!</li>
            <li> So far, this product works exactly as promoted.  I&#x27;ve been using it once a week for 5 weeks.  I think my skin looks better, but I know it feels better.  It produces plenty of steam and there are no problems so far.</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing, I&#x27;v used it 2x and already see a difference in my skin. It does have a slight burning smell to it but nothing I can&#x27;t handle. I highly recommend this streamer</li>
            <li> I enjoyed using this item and the steam is very good.I have no problems so far and delivery was prompt.</li>
            <li> I have been used for a period of time, the effect is very good really</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it. I used for a week, &amp; this morning the streamer is not working. We are processing to return it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. The steam build up is efficient and consistent. It takes about 45 secs to start issuing steam and produces steam up to 1min and 30secs. I have to move my face about a little to get steam all over but it&#x27;s not inconvenient. This product is very simple to use and yes there is a faint hot plastic smell when you first use it but I feel it goes away after a few uses. I have been using this product for over two months now and I have not had any issues with it. The shipping was prompt and product was well packaged.</li>
            <li> Although I wish it were just a tad bigger for coverage, I really like this steamer.</li>
            <li> I love my little steam machine. Great size, great spray, very quiet, heats quickly. Maybe the steam smelled a little strange from the container the first few uses but after a few rinses with purified water it&#x27;s perfectly fine. I place it on the back of the toilet, lay down a towel and sit backwards on the lid, I&#x27;ve got a short torso and the steam hits my face perfectly, put on an audiobook and this has been a part of my regular routine.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping works great!</li>
            <li> I love this facial steamer.  I am very happy with the large amount of steam produced in a very short amount of time</li>
            <li> So far so good!!! Been using this all morning. First time user, i suggest letting it have a few goes before you put your face in front of it, bc it has a very plastic smell first. But its awesome!! I put plain green tea in it to get an antioxidant facial! Im going to save so much money from salon facials</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very comfortable.</li>
            <li> Good value, works as described.</li>
            <li> Steams my face for the perfect amount of time!</li>
            <li> Half the price of other &amp;#34;higher end&amp;#34; facial steamers that we looked at on amazon and definitely worth the price.  My teenager daughter is a singer and she uses it at least twice a day to stay &amp;#34;hydrated.&amp;#34;  We are very happy with this steamer.  It is easy to use and works well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommened this product worth every penny . With this steamer I feel like I have my own lil spa at home !</li>
            <li> Was smelly, but after few uses doesn&#x27;t smell at all. I&#x27;m so glad that I bought this instead of the expensive version. I use destilled water.</li>
            <li> Very bad quality. Used barely 4 times in less than a month and the cap of the water container broke So far going good, the supplier promptly shipped me a new unit and advised me not to put any oil or addends in water: I have used it - 3 times so far and looks good. Love the steam it creates and loved the fact that the supplier supports and warranties its product.</li>
            <li> Great steamer! Small, perfect amount of steam for face. Requires small amount of water but lasts at least 10 min. Easy to use. I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for a facial steamer. And I didn&#x27;t notice a plastic smell mentioned in other comments.</li>
            <li> i gave this steamer to our daughter for Christmas. She loves this facial steamer and uses it several times a week. Wonderful product!,</li>
            <li> Great little steamer. Heats up really fast and puts out loads of steam. It&#x27;s simple to use and portable. Makes my skin feel so pampered! I really love it!</li>
            <li> It works very good so far !!!</li>
            <li> Love it , it doesn&#x27;t have the strong smell as some other reviews, I used for both facial &amp; hair spa , it worked great !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a medical esthetician and I use this everyday in my treatment room on up to 6 clients a day and it works great! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does a good job but has a gas like smell</li>
            <li> It emits plastic smell.</li>
            <li> Love this steamer - excellent product !!!</li>
            <li> I love this thing. It works really well. It is great for keeping your skin clean. Better than a facial!</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I did have a VERY slight chemical smell, but after the third use, it&#x27;s gone.  I read tons of reviews, and all the good ones are true.  If you are on the fence, just buy it.  I haven&#x27;t owned any other steamers, but this one is perfect for my needs and the price is right!</li>
            <li> This product appears to be a knockoff of the prohibitively expensive Panasonic models [[ASIN:B008JB0V06 Panasonic EH-SA32-P Pink | Nano-e NanoCare Facial Steamer 100V 50-60Hz (Japanese Import)]] and [[ASIN:B00GR4SSIY Panasonic EH-SA31VP nano Facial Steamer]]. The design of this unit is almost identical to the Panasonic models, at least on the outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend of mine has one of the Panasonic steamers and recommended I get one to help clean dirty and clogged pores around my nose. This product was less than half the price of either Panasonic model, so I decided to take my chances and try it even though it had no reviews at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used pure distilled water, as per the instructions. The small plastic water \\&quot;tank\\&quot; pulls out of the back of the unit to fill and holds about an ounce of water. One full tank will provide about 6-8 minutes worth of steam. Seconds after turning the unit on steam starts coming out. It&#x27;s a fine mist similar to the cold steam that most humidifiers produce, but this steam is hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is that the steam has a strong chemical-like smell. It smells almost like burning plastic, but not quite so harsh. My guess is that somewhere inside there is plastic in close proximity to the heating element that is infusing the steam with some kind of off-gas when heated. This might go away after prolonged use, but after I ran it about 10 times the smell was still very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steam does help to clean dirty and clogged pores. Steaming your face before using a skin tool such as [[ASIN:B001B7GJ2E Body Toolz Double Loop Facial Skin Care Tool]] makes a HUGE difference. This product works, but breathing the strange smelling steam may not the best thing for your health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic model my friend has does not suffer from the same issue, so I will be returning this unit and reluctantly forking out the cash for a more expensive steamer.</li>
            <li> Works great! Gives you about 10-15 minutes of steam! I use it when I&#x27;m sick too.</li>
            <li> Small and compact, it gets the job done. A good stream of steam we sent back another less expensive unit.</li>
            <li> I love using this before doing facial masks. Great for moisturizing your face too. I just wish it had a bigger capacity water tank because I find myself refilling it 3-4 times each use. That being said, I do steam for a very long time to open up my pores so most people probably won&#x27;t have this issue</li>
            <li> I like it, it says no adding essential oils, but I add 1-2 drops always.it is a lot more pleasant. I use it along with my hitachi n1000, and I use it when I apply serum and moisturizer. So it helps skin absorb better. I wish the water tank it bigger so I don&#x27;t have to refill every single time. Be careful: 1 wait for it to cool down after usage 2, be gentle with the water tank, it seems easy to break.</li>
            <li> This works great! Way better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This facial steamer is perfect. Doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room storing when not in use. There really does seem to be a difference using a Ionic steamer versus the standard steamer, mist is very fine. Not only do I use this for home facials but, my sinuses have really benefited by the warm steam.</li>
            <li> This Steamer Has Made, A Drastic Difference In My Skin! It Opens Up My Pores Significantly. Using A Steam Is The Best Way To Clear Your Pores &amp; Deep Cleanse Your Skin.</li>
            <li> Love it!  It&#x27;s so relaxing I find myself enjoying it for that purpose alone. To see my skin benefiting too, is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. My skin feels very clean, and breakouts have lessened quite a bit. The price is much more reasonable than other brands, yet it doesn&#x27;t seem cheaply made at all.  Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy those cheaper facial steamers. I have used them before. Those cheap ones basically boil water to steam. I can probably get a better facial steam by cooking pasta for my husband. This one works so much better. The steam is at the right temperature and it sprays on to my face, doesn&#x27;t scorch my skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased the steamer to use for colds and asthma. I just need a few breaths to of set the dryness caused by summer air conditioning as well. Great little machine. Easy to keep hygienic. Complexion improved as a by product.</li>
            <li> Love the fine mist!  My skin feels so smooth!</li>
            <li> Awesome !!!&lt;br /&gt;I love doing facials, but now I love it more with this facial steamer.&lt;br /&gt;Just exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> Gets very hot, very fast. Steam does seem to be more &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;, if that makes sense. It&#x27;s less dense than sauna or shower steam, for example, but there&#x27;s a lot of it and it shoots out in a hurry. I actually turn it on and off while I&#x27;m treating my face because it&#x27;s so quick to heat up (saves water). I use distilled water so it doesn&#x27;t clog up.</li>
            <li> Lots of steam ! I love it!</li>
            <li> steam have weird smell. it&#x27;s only work for 5 minutes after that you have to re-fill the water</li>
            <li> I was going to buy the much more expensive version by Panasonic, but gave this a try.  I don&#x27;t know if clam of Nano-sized water particles can be substantiated or not (really, if they didn&#x27;t care to get a proper English translation on the box and have no instructional insert, have they really tested the size of the particles?).  It pretty much seems to be a water boiler with a small hole to prevent splashing. However, it does what I need which is to open pores (and sinuses) with an abundant supply of directed hot steam without bubbling hot water onto me.  It&#x27;s also very cute.  For the price, not bad.</li>
            <li> Amazed at the quality of this product..Really good steamer. Very easy to use. Light weight and no hassle with filling water.</li>
            <li> so far so good! I&#x27;ve used this twice a week for the last several weeks and am very happy. It takes seconds to start up (no reading directions needed) each time and it gets hot enough where i can FEEL my pores widening and opening up. After it runs its course i use a blackhead extractor tool and scrape away my blackhead buildup on my chin that has started to plague me in my 30&#x27;s. Love it.</li>
            <li> works like a charm.  I have been paying $150 for monthly facials.  Part of the facial routine is to steam the face with moisturizer on it.  As the pores open, the moisturizer is absorbed.  So I did it myself, and followed the steaming with vitamin C serum. Professional results at home!!  The steamer stops after 10 minutes, which is more than adequate time for good results. The steamer emits a very fine steam (no sputtering)  which covers the entire face.  The steamer is nice and compact and takes little room on the vanity. I recommend this steamer.</li>
            <li> This product is GREAT!  I&#x27;ve had a bad cold and alot of congestion and I used this 3-4 times a days and it seemed to help alot.  Some comments I read prior to purchasing indicated there was not enough water in the reserve.  I did not find this to be an issue at all.  Once the water in the reserve tank is empty, you ready to be done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product.  It&#x27;s the right size and the water tank/reserve in the back is definitely adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shelly</li>
            <li> I purchased this facial steamer in June of last year.  I loved it and shared it with my adult children.  For Christmas, 2 of my daughters requested a steamer because the loved it, and one of them is an aesthetician.  My husband and I use this for added moisture in our skin in the winter, for skin care throughout the year, and we love it when we have a cold or sinus infection.  It helps to break up the congestion.  It&#x27;s size is perfect in that it stores easily, and it yet it provides a ton of steam.  All in all, I would recommend this steamer to anyone.</li>
            <li> Only used few times, so far works as described..produces small amount of steam fairly quickly for several minutes..does have a slight odor to it, but that may go away with more uses. Thanks</li>
            <li> I use this facial steamer about 3 times per week, it is small enough to sit on a shelf next to my vanity.  I use bottled water rather than tap water and have not had any issues so far.</li>
            <li> Thursday morning at around 10 am I feel so sick so I decide to boil some water and get some steam on my face. It works I feel better!! I decide to look on Amazon to see if there is a face steamer and find this one. I notice that some people said that the reservoir tends to break and that the steam smells bad. The smell did not bother me much it did smell a little like plastic but I did not care I was desperate. I like the item, it had a lot of stream! I received it at 8:15 pm on the same day so I only used it three times. The next day 7 am I try to use the steamer but the cap is a little tight which was strange cause I did not close it tight the night before i was so sick and tired I did not have much strength. So I take a towel and try to open the lid and this is when it happen :( the lid came off but it took part of the reservoir with it! Great now I am back to square one with my hot pot and a towel over my head.</li>
            <li> have been useing this for a while my skin look so good will not be without it</li>
            <li> It is really good .it is very convenient I don&#x27;t have to go spa , I can do at home love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing I love it!!</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money on other cheaply made facial steamer! Invest in this and you will not disappoint!</li>
            <li> Just received this. Super happy with purchase! Great steam flow. Excellent for skin and sinus relief.</li>
            <li> I love it , use 2 times a week. I will recommend to my friend. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love it! Heats up quickly and delivers just the right amount of steam. It&#x27;s very relaxing, and I use it every morning. I didn&#x27;t notice any strange smell even the first couple of uses. I feel it plumps up my skin. I use a moisturizer afterwards to seal in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Easy to use, just the right amount of steam and duration.  I look forward to every use.  I plan on giving the steamer as a gift to family members and friends.  Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> machine broke after two months.  Wrote to manufacturer and no response to replace or get my money back.</li>
            <li> Great product and cheaper than comparable Nano Ionic facial steamers.</li>
            <li> My husband bought this for me as a birthday gift because I was using other (less convenient)  methods to steam. I love this. It almost feels like a warm cloud is flying across my face. It&#x27;s so relaxing. The fine mist of steam is also much easier to breath in while steaming. I will say I second another reviewer who said there is an odd smell, nothing awful but odd. My skin has gotten much smoother,  softer and even with a few uses.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I was considering Panasonic, but am so glad I bought this one. Panasonic&#x27;s voltage (100V) does not fit US (110V) and it is expensive for me. I decided to buy this one mainly because of the cheaper price. I read the reviews and was very worried about the smell mentioned in one review. But I am extremely happy with what I got! No bad smell and its working perfectly just as I expected. It gives out about 8mins steady, warm steam. I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> works, portable, cute, good amount of steam, lasts for reasonable time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to write a lot of reviews, but I loved this! The steam intensity was great. I will admit there was a tiny bit of odor as others complained about but it did not detract from the job. I can get a small amount of odor from my $149 PurMist I bought for my sinus allergies, which I also dearly love! I think it is just the combination of hot steam against plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the steam generated by this unit easily covered my whole face and I found it to be quite relaxing. I was also able to skip my nightly PurMist session because the steam cleared my sinuses as I was treating myself to an at-home facial. If you follow a typical at home facial routine (wash, exfoliate, steam, mask, tone, and moisturize) your face will feel amazing afterwards!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare it to the $179 Panasonic unit since I&#x27;ve never tried it, but I can say that I am thoroughly satisfied with this unit although I&#x27;ve only used it once so far. Time will tell if the unit holds up.</li>
            <li> Has toxic plastic smell! Avoid!!!    Edit:  This negative review is long due. I was contacted by the seller after leaving a 1 star review on the smell. The seller actually told me that the smell is the odor of ozone. Ladies - ozone DOES NOT smell!!!   I cannot believe the seller went so far as to lie by telling people that the smell is from ozone, or negative ions. Let me get this straight, when you open the box, BEFORE you even turn on the device, you can smell it. It&#x27;s from cheap, TOXIC plastic. It&#x27;s as simple as that. Buy this if you want to catch lung cancer. Smoking works too but this is faster.</li>
            <li> The Nano Iconic is absolutely the best facial steamer I have ever used. It&#x27;s unusual for a product to be better than advertised . The results were amazing and I am very pleased .</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot but I can&#x27;t get rid of the chemical smell either. So I usually use rose/flora mask when using the steamer so I won&#x27;t smell it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really don&#x27;t care about the smell like myself, then go ahead buying it you won&#x27;t regret. However if you do care about the chemical smell just buy the Panasonic one (of course much more expensive)</li>
            <li> it works I used it after steaming my face or taking a shower.&lt;br /&gt;At that time your pores are opening and more easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend using the mist spay.</li>
            <li> Very good. My Mom love it very muchÔºÅ</li>
            <li> It did fine for the first few weeks. But the steam now is not as strong as it was in the beginning:(  I hardly get any steam. I am using the correct amount of water and also using bottled water.</li>
            <li> My wife is very happy with the product.  Generates a steady stream of warm steam.  Easy to fill and simple to use.  What else can you say?</li>
            <li> Does the job - the skin feels soft and does not leave you feeling dry. Definitely worth the price</li>
            <li> I use this right before I use a face mask an you can see and feel how much deeper the face mask goes! This is awesome and the steam is nice not like others which is just boiling water in your face</li>
            <li> I really like this steamer because it is effective, fast to steam, does the job, and seems like good quality. I do not like the plastic like chemical smell that comes out with the steam the first couple of minutes though.</li>
            <li> It does the work and very pleased. Easy to use. Better than panasonic</li>
            <li> My wife bought this and this is her review:  It&#x27;s a great product and definitely worth the value for money.  I was looking for something that was not open (and not splash boiling water on my face).  I narrowed my search down to this product and a much more expensive version (Panasonic).  I opted for this version and figured I would upgrade if needed.  I&#x27;m so glad I took this version!  It works great - the unit is light and the steam starts to come out within 20 seconds or so.  The full tank lasts about 8 minutes which is enough time for me.  I used pure distilled water as per the instructions (note:  is says not to add oils etc to the water).  There is a very faint smell, but I&#x27;ve used it 4 times now and that smell is almost non-existent.  I only mention the smell since others have - it doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.  Also, I only ever noticed it when I turned the unit on.  After a minute or so it wasn&#x27;t there.  The unit itself is small and easy to store.  I hope this lasts as I will be using it for as long as it works.  The delivery was fast - no issues at all.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  I love it.</li>
            <li> If anyone cares about how they look or feel this product is for them! By far one of the best products out there. I have bought my girlfriend and mother each this facial steamer and it has made them more beautiful and youthful. Their faces shine with this product.</li>
            <li> The price is very good and also works good! It is very easy to use and only takes about 10 min for the treatment.  Good fit in my busy schedule.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love that it is small and really compact. I can carry it with me when I travel in my checked-in bag and it really helps to freshen up the skin. I really want to try it with a facemask on as I&#x27;ve seem that done by a few people and want to know if it maximizes results of fresh skin. Overall I love the product and think it is lovely.</li>
            <li> does not work unless you actually hold it in a certain position. very award to work with. only good for self use not on other people.</li>
            <li> absolutely love it!! Works great and it&#x27;s atomaticly set at the purfet tempiture so it doesn&#x27;t burn your face.</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the more expensive Panasonic Facial Steamer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up really quickly and provides a steady stream of warm steam for approximately 10 minutes. It can get really hot, so be sure that your face isn&#x27;t too close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions that came with this are very basic, but provides just the right amount of information so you know how to use and care for it.</li>
            <li> It worked quite well. The only problem is that every time I used it, there came a little bit strange smell. Generally speaking, It worth the price.</li>
            <li> This is really a nice facial steamer, but I guess I wasn&#x27;t thinking when I choose it. I had to pass it down to my daughter because it really hurt my neck and back because I had to bend in towards it. So I ended up going with another that I don&#x27;t have to bend into. But other then that it is still a nice steamer. My daughter loves it. It has a nice fine steam that comes out and a lot of steam comes out too which is one reason I choose it first. I havent had it long but so far so good. I will review again if I start noticing any problems that I think people should be aware of. Enjoy it if you do decide on this one.</li>
            <li> The steam is hot enough to open my pores and I  begin to see positive results.  I love it!!</li>
            <li> Love, love it. Everything I&#x27;ve been looking for in a mini facial steamer. It is one of the reasons I would go in for a facial. I use it 3 times a week and my skin has greatly improved. Works great and so easy to use. It&#x27;s only about 10 minutes or less and works as expected. Arrived on time when I ordered it and was in perfect condition, just as advertised. Definitely recommend this steamer.</li>
            <li> Steam is really fine.The price is so much reasonable compare to Panasonic. I love it. I ordered a second one for my sister.</li>
            <li> Stylish and as advertised.  Steady stream of steam. The design truly facilities a comfortable, refreshing experience!</li>
            <li> not really recommended, smells terrible!!!!!!! and not feel good enough for my face, only use once and put back to the box</li>
            <li> Works wonderful! This steamer makes lots of steam. The best at home facial ever!</li>
            <li> Great little steamer. Easy to use and works quickly.</li>
            <li> This works great when it works but usually stops working after about 2 months. I reordered it again after my first one stopped working and now my second has stopped working as well. I only got a chance to use this one twice. I will not be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great steamer. It really does it&#x27;s work and fix my skin very well. Gentle and comfort, won&#x27;t burn my skin, and it&#x27;s small size which could fit my desk and I can keep doing my work. Quite and cute, you should try it.</li>
            <li> good stuff, my girlfriend says it works</li>
            <li> water chamber was way too small. The knob to close water was cracking and shattered after second use. completely disappointed with the product especially after reading so many positive reviews</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product. If you&#x27;re expecting a professional spa experience, this is not it. But for a convenient mini facial for 15 minutes, this is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have terribly large pores from my dad, and it&#x27;s much worse on my period. I used it the first time straight out of the box and it worked perfectly. I did notice the slight plastic smell, but it&#x27;s hardly noticeable and didn&#x27;t seem to do anything to my face. I just sat it on my dining table and sat in front of it, and it didnt feel awkward at all. Then I did a small extraction, and finally a clay mask--all in about 15 minutes. The mist lasted about 8-10 minutes as stated in the manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next time I would do it straight out of the shower to make it more effective. This is great for a portable unit, and it is at a perfect angle on my dining table. Great purchase!</li>
            <li> Amazing! It&#x27;s simple, cute and gets the job done! The steamer feels like hot soft clouds rushing to your face. The steamer takes about 40 seconds to start steaming and lasts about 7-8 minutes. The steam will immediately ceases when the water runs out. Oh man but that steam comes out strong! It also doesn&#x27;t pop any hot water. So glad I bought this &amp;#34;knock-off&amp;#34; version of the Panosonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I get obsessed with a beauty product, I will research it, read reviews, check prices... Seriously, just obsess over it... So after doing that with this item and using it, I couldn&#x27;t be more happier with the steamer! Shipping was fast too!</li>
            <li> The like the product for the following reasons&lt;br /&gt;1. It is handy and portable&lt;br /&gt;2. It produces lots of steam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took out one star because I could not confirm if I can use medicinal oil in the machine.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product.  Gives good steam.</li>
            <li> really bad quality, i just used once and it broke.....</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and works great!</li>
