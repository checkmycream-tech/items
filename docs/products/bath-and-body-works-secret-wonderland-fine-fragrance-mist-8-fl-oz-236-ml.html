            <li> Came on time and smells great.</li>
            <li> The wrong scent was delivered.  However it did reach me before anticipated.  I&#x27;m currently overseas and did not respond to the seller, so they may have fixed the issue had I pressed them.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this on Amazon, it is discontinued at the stores and I was almost out! It did cost a little more than the retail store sold it for, but I am just happy to have more.</li>
            <li> Perfect !! They discontinued this at B&amp;BW so I had to get it from here and its still great ! Cheaper too !</li>
            <li> I specifically ordered this product because the photo showed the fine mist spray bottle, with the cap that twists off. What was sent was actually a completely different bottle, the one with a cap that doesn&#x27;t twist and has a thicker spray stream. Really disappointed in the product photo and what was sent to me. It was the correct scent, but completely different perfume bottle and spray.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I asked for. 5 stars</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what to say about this product just that it smells good just as I expected it to smell like</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume and it came when it was supposed too!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance. Bath &amp; Body Works discontinued it. Bought two bottles and both were exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> im a big bath and body works fan already, and i never thought id like another fragrance besides brown sugar n fig, but this is wonderful, it smells so gud, and actully last through the day, i work at a pretty busy hospital, and im always getting compliments on it, great product, strong but not over-bearing!</li>
            <li> Soft lovely fragrance</li>
            <li> I got this for my mom, because it is her #1 favorite and they have discontinued it at our mall. There was lots of it and it smells great! She takes one in her purse and leaves the other in the car.</li>
            <li> it is my third bottle of it ,</li>
            <li> This was horrible. Smelled like alcohol. And i know what its supposed to smell like. It used to be my favorite scent. Idk if they somehow tampered with the perfume and topped it off with something else or what. But it was horrible.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, the product was in perfect condition! Love this fragrance, and Bath &amp; Body Works no longer makes it. Was so glad that Simply Blissful had it! Will definitely use them again! I get so many compliments on this body mist! Thank you so much for having it available!</li>
            <li> it doesn&amp;#34;t seem to be as strong in scent as my other bottle.  It seems like it is old. Thank you</li>
            <li> The price was excellent  and was delivered before the original delivery date</li>
            <li> Smells so darn good.Can not beat the price. It&#x27;s the perfect summer smell. It came in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li> The scent lasts a decent amount of time and smelt very good. I got this a gift and now I want this is the only scent I wear .Love it!</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful sent that lifts your mood when you wear it. I will be buying it again when i run out.</li>
            <li> I purchased 2 bottles and the spray nozzle on one was broken when I got it. The perfume was fine and didn&#x27;t leak. Packaging could have been better to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> When the bottle arrived, it appeared to have been tampered with.  The contents were not the product, it seemed that someone had added some other liquid to top off a small amount of product.</li>
            <li> This item is my wife&#x27;s favorite scent from Bath and Body, and as always they have discontinued it. So when I saw it was available on here for around $12 after shipping I had to snatch it up. It isnt a prime product, so no free 2-day shipping, but the package still arrived in a acceptable amount of time. It was in good shape, and appeared to be a new, never opened bottle. Over all a pleasant transaction.</li>
            <li> I really love its scent. This is the only fragrance so far I have been able to find that smells wonderful and that works well with my natural scent. It&#x27;s much cheaper on here than on the official cite. I do suggest that you keep an eye on the bath and body works wed site. They sometimes have cheap sales. And the best time to go to the store is in Jan. when these is plenty of clearance.</li>
            <li> smells just like my old one (i have some to compare) and its a really tall bottle, amazing really, i would suggest this to anyone who happens to love this one as much as i.</li>
            <li> It is sweet and flirty great for glirly girls or woman who like light but floral lasting fragrances. It arrived on time and it looked great and smelled even better. I would recommend it</li>
            <li> This fragrance was recently and SADLY discontinued from bath &amp; body. But honestly,its just amazing!it&#x27;s got strawberries as a fresh and sweet undertone, it&#x27;s got Jasmine for a bit of light floral that&#x27;s almost spicy... the white musk is long lasting in a lingering pleasant way,I&#x27;m not usually much on midlands but this is so light and sensual it&#x27;s Pretty much perfect. This fragrance is unique and will most likely Get you lots of complements and those lovely \\&quot;what are you wearing \\&quot;comments. Also this being both kind of sweet, but also light floral, flirty musk you will be feeling like the most sensual gal in the room... guys love this one ladies...just saying!</li>
