            <li>They arrived quickly, good quality and a great bargain.</li>
            <li>To be completely fair the odor is fading</li>
            <li>handy brushes anyway.</li>
            <li>These are nice brushes but the chemical smell</li>
            <li>Overall a great design and a great value.</li>
            <li>Brush ok.</li>
            <li>I loved this product so much I ordered 3</li>
            <li>Good for travel, and at this price point, don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li>I got a set of 2 and the mirror fell off one very quickly, but</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores, but easy to find on Amazon.</li>
            <li>smell is so strong that I can&#x27;t imagine carrying one with me.</li>
            <li>These are cheap, and that is what you get.</li>
            <li>Excellent price for three brushes, fast delivery, but brushes did have a slight petroleum smell that I&#x27;m sure will go away in time.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and was a good price, although one broke as soon as I used it the first time and another one lasted about a month before the end broke off.  </li>
            <li>I got one of these in a complimentary airline kit a dozen years ago, traveled extensively with it until it crumbled, was happy to find a replacement available.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so it was still worth the price.  </li>
            <li>These wailing wandas are just being prissy.&amp;#34;  The rude stench of these brushes just has to be experienced to be believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clever idea and good execution - other than the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got one left that&#x27;s been working fine for awhile</li>
            <li>There is a surprisingly strong chemical smell when first opened, noted by other reviewers.</li>
            <li>I saw the multiple bad reviews and though that I&#x27;m OK with not so perfect brush, as long as it is foldable and brushes hair.</li>
            <li>The 2 problems I found were they smell like new tires</li>
            <li>I wore out my old one, and missed them.</li>
            <li>What arrived was three rectangular flat brushes instead of the ones I ordered, but I didn&#x27;t mind that error given the real problem</li>
            <li>I originally ordered the round foldable combs but they replaced these instead.  </li>
            <li>These are decent quality, the same you would get at the $1 store.  </li>
            <li>#34;It&#x27;s cheap and cute and how bad can it be?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found a similar concept in a round format, but that just doesn&#x27;t fit the hand as well as this one.</li>
            <li>These are neat little brushes - exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for - except that they smell like road tar!&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Broke within the first few times I used it...</li>

            <li> Broke within the first few times I used it...</li>
            <li> And I have them in all my bags - they are a little small and wouldn&#x27;t probably work on heavy hair, but I love mine.</li>
            <li> I left them in front of an open window for a few days and the smell is no longer noticeable.</li>
            <li> I just wish the other two had lasted just as long.</li>
            <li> The rubber in these brushes smell like raw petroleum (oil) -- even 7 months later.</li>
            <li> The other two were OK, but, boy, these brushes are just not good: the smell, the weird material they are made off.</li>
            <li> The handle folds over the spikes for travel, keeping any residual hair etc away from other objects in your travel kit.</li>
            <li> Soaked in baking soda, left outside, ran through the dishwasher - now my dishwasher stinks.</li>
            <li> I got a replacement at Sephora for $7 - a neat round foldable brush.</li>
            <li> These brushes have a horrible, very strong rubber odor.  </li>
            <li> I purchased them for travel because of their small size, but I WILL NOT pack these with anything because everything will end up smelling.  </li>
            <li> Two of the three have broken at the brush flex point in less than two months.</li>
            <li> My 5 yr old broke 2 of these within a few hours.  :(</li>
            <li> These hairbrushes came with such an awful smell that even after airing them out for several days they made me nauseous.</li>
            <li> I was wrong!</li>
            <li> These stink so bad I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so bad that I can&#x27;t put them in my purse.</li>
            <li> It even made my purse smell bad.</li>
            <li> I even had to wash jeans whose pocket had held one of these brushes because the oil-refinery smell would not fade, and the hand that had held one of them smelled bad even after thorough washing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> they smell so bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>
            <li> But the smell is horrific.  </li>

            <li> I got one of these in a complimentary airline kit a dozen years ago, traveled extensively with it until it crumbled, was happy to find a replacement available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is of the soft-plastic-spikes variety, meets my needs but your mileage may vary. I&#x27;ve found a similar concept in a round format, but that just doesn&#x27;t fit the hand as well as this one. The handle folds over the spikes for travel, keeping any residual hair etc away from other objects in your travel kit. Overall a great design and a great value.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for travel. I bought them to replace a similar one I bought years ago that is disintegrating. There is a surprisingly strong chemical smell when first opened, noted by other reviewers. I left them in front of an open window for a few days and the smell is no longer noticeable. Would have been 5 stars except for that.</li>
            <li> Excellent price for three brushes, fast delivery, but brushes did have a slight petroleum smell that I&#x27;m sure will go away in time.</li>
            <li> I loved this product so much I ordered 3 sets,9 in all ,for myself and to give as Xmas gifts</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and was a good price, although one broke as soon as I used it the first time and another one lasted about a month before the end broke off.  I&#x27;ve got one left that&#x27;s been working fine for awhile so it was still worth the price.  I just wish the other two had lasted just as long.</li>
            <li> I like these brushes as they are so compact and i put them in all my purses. I got a set of 2 and the mirror fell off one very quickly, but handy brushes anyway.</li>
            <li> These stink so bad I can&#x27;t use them. They smell like burning rubber. I have tried everything to get rid of the smell. Soaked in baking soda, left outside, ran through the dishwasher - now my dishwasher stinks. I can&#x27;t use them at all.</li>
            <li> The rubber in these brushes smell like raw petroleum (oil) -- even 7 months later. For your health, do not purchase..</li>
            <li> Good for travel, and at this price point, don&#x27;t expect too much.</li>
            <li> These are great to slip into your purse. The 2 problems I found were they smell like new tires and you can&#x27;t use the mirror and the brush at the same time. To be completely fair the odor is fading but it&#x27;s been a couple months since I got them.</li>
            <li> I saw the multiple bad reviews and though that I&#x27;m OK with not so perfect brush, as long as it is foldable and brushes hair. I was wrong! One of the brushes had its mirror fall out just as I opened it. The other two were OK, but, boy, these brushes are just not good: the smell, the weird material they are made off. I don&#x27;t want to have my mood be spoiled over a brush, but these did just that, so, they ended up in the trash. I got a replacement at Sephora for $7 - a neat round foldable brush.</li>
            <li> Brush ok. Mirror became unglued.</li>
            <li> These are cheap, and that is what you get. Two of the three have broken at the brush flex point in less than two months. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
            <li> These brushes have a horrible, very strong rubber odor.  I left them outside in the sun for over a week and the smell did not diminish at all.  No one would want to carry one in a purse or in luggage.  Disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are nice brushes but the chemical smell it&#x27;s so bad that I can&#x27;t put them in my purse. They are currently outside on the porch.</li>
            <li> I wore out my old one, and missed them. Couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores, but easy to find on Amazon. This was the best buy,&lt;br /&gt;About $4 for package of 3. They arrived quickly, good quality and a great bargain. Similar ones were about $10 apiece!</li>
            <li> These are decent quality, the same you would get at the $1 store.  But the smell is horrific.  I&#x27;ve had them for 5 months and they still smell.  I&#x27;ve tried setting them outside for weeks at a time and the smell still won&#x27;t go away.  It even made my purse smell bad.</li>
            <li> And I have them in all my bags - they are a little small and wouldn&#x27;t probably work on heavy hair, but I love mine.</li>
            <li> These are neat little brushes - exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for - except that they smell like road tar!&lt;br /&gt;The smell is so strong that I can&#x27;t imagine carrying one with me. I&#x27;ve tried running them through my dishwasher, soaking them in Clorox, etc. They still stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like them aside form the odor. Clever idea and good execution - other than the smell.</li>
            <li> These are great for the car</li>
            <li> This item is for 2 sets of 3 combs.  I originally ordered the round foldable combs but they replaced these instead.  My 5 yr old broke 2 of these within a few hours.  :(</li>
            <li> Broke within the first few times I used it...</li>
            <li> What arrived was three rectangular flat brushes instead of the ones I ordered, but I didn&#x27;t mind that error given the real problem: These should be reported to the United Nations as chemical weapons.  I tried to reduce the stench of these Brushes of Mass Destruction, but nothing worked.  I even had to wash jeans whose pocket had held one of these brushes because the oil-refinery smell would not fade, and the hand that had held one of them smelled bad even after thorough washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know what you&#x27;re thinking-- &amp;#34;It&#x27;s cheap and cute and how bad can it be?  These wailing wandas are just being prissy.&amp;#34;  The rude stench of these brushes just has to be experienced to be believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three of them are now stinking up a landfill somewhere.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even bring these in my house they smell so bad. I purchased them for travel because of their small size, but I WILL NOT pack these with anything because everything will end up smelling.  These are obviously made of LOW grade plastic and rubber(petro derivative)</li>
            <li> These hairbrushes came with such an awful smell that even after airing them out for several days they made me nauseous. I don&#x27;t know if I just got a lemon or want, but I wouldn&#x27;t order them again.</li>
