    <ol>
            <li>I have to say I&#x27;m not overly impressed, but it basically works as you&#x27;d expect for an inexpensive shaver.    </li>
            <li>well that seemed to work great!!!  </li>
            <li>Works great fo me.</li>
            <li>Happy Shaving.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great</li>
            <li>But as I stated This was a refurbished razor in my opinion, and it has been a good while</li>
            <li>feels good across my face and feels good in my hands...</li>
            <li>Its not a close resemblance to a Norelco, but its still a good razor.</li>
            <li>no problem...very very satisfied with this product...strongly recommend it...</li>
            <li>Amazing logistics.</li>
            <li>I am glad I made that decision.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s not junk; but, it&#x27;s also not a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>After a couple of uses, you&#x27;ll have an idea of how many shaves you get per charge.  </li>
            <li>I bought this shaver to replace a foil type Remington that I&#x27;ve owned for 15 or so years and still works OK but wanted to try using a rotary shaver.</li>
            <li>But there were more plastic and cardboard inserts than there was product, just to make it look like you were getting more than you were.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>The shave is OK.</li>
            <li>many, many times and never broke or stopped working.</li>
            <li>still Has all original parts and still holds its charge and dose a nice job cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li>This shaver is a great price and just overall gives me a clean pleasant shave</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s does pretty good compared to razors twice the price.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a pretty good value.  </li>
            <li>The thing is very light and feels cheap.</li>
            <li>The price was fair and does a fair job, but with differant cutters ,it does not do the job my other razor does.</li>
            <li>not as good a shave as I got from my Norelco when it was new</li>
            <li>If your in the market for better bells and whistles, look to a higher model and pay more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure using a manual razor without any shaving cream would be more tolerable than this piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>Had this razor for 2 years and it works fine.  </li>
            <li>If I could say anything nice, it&#x27;s that the battery holds a good, long charge.</li>
            <li>If you have a day&#x27;s worth of stubble when you use it, you&#x27;ll have stubble when you&#x27;re done, just with your skin slightly more irritated.</li>
            <li>When I saw this one I thought it was a fabulous value.</li>
            <li>I think it is great to use overall.</li>
            <li>The skin is smooth but it&#x27;s in pain.  </li>
            <li>Everything about it is cheap.</li>
            <li>You could easily fit 10 of these things in the box.</li>
            <li>(cheap)  </li>
            <li>The charging light on the unit tell you when it needs charging</li>
            <li>This is the first razor that I&#x27;ve paid more than 20 bux for.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, I&#x27;m pretty sure Satan himself had an unwashed hand in its development.</li>
            <li>Tryed to clean it once.</li>
            <li>but I get a close, quick comfortable shave with this razor.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really a good product as long as u don&#x27;t try to shave off more than a days worth of stubble....</li>
            <li>Battery wise, you can actually tell when it&#x27;s running out.</li>
            <li>Good basic shaver for the US market.  </li>
            <li>It has a low price which is surprising for how well it performs.</li>
            <li>but I have only good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>and I love that it is Dual voltage because it really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>The top flips open and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It has never really given a good clean cut.  </li>
            <li>since the model I own (labeled just as R4130) has a flip-open head that&#x27;s permanently attached by hinge, and the rotors seem to be locked in, so you can seemingly only clean them through the cage.  </li>
            <li>I followed the instructions and charged it up first for a full 24 hours</li>
            <li>Quite honestly the only thing it is shavng is load sof its quarterly profits with a product like this.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>by far this one dissapointed me the most of any one I have purchase.......</li>
            <li>The second I took this thing out of its packaging I could immediately tell by its light and cheap plastic design that it was going to be garbage.</li>
            <li>I shaved have my face with my decade old low-end Norelco (with original blades), then performed the identical pattern (I&#x27;m pretty good at this now...can even do it while doing other things around the bathroom, etc.)</li>
            <li>some say I get a pretty good shave with little irritation</li>
            <li>For some reason it is just not cutting any of my face hairs very well</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is my first electric razor, and it seems to work for me.</li>
            <li>Unless you pull on your skin to shave (and risk getting razor bumps) and go over it multiple times (which takes more time).  </li>
            <li>My old Remington has now become my travel kit shaver - it deserves to enjoy its retirement.</li>
            <li>Enough cut hair storage for a month or more from my face    </li>
            <li>If it lasts two years as warrantied I would give it 3 stars if it only costs most people $15, but at $35 bucks you can do a lot better with a low end Norelco.  </li>
            <li>The higher end</li>
            <li>If you have anything more than stubble, it is a grueling 20 minute process in which you feel each individual hair being ripped off your face.</li>
            <li>The first time it happened, I thought I broke the unit.</li>
            <li>at first.    </li>
            <li>and  since it has rinsable head, I decided to try using it wet.... warm water on face and a just touch of shaving cream to lubricate the beard........</li>
            <li>it cuts well and holds a charge pretty well, but I would have preferred a metal hydride battery over a niCad.  </li>
            <li>After several months&#x27; use, I am pleased that this Remington is lighter-weight (having plastic parts), it has a quieter motor, and shaves TWICE as fast and smooth as any of the Norelco shavers I have used over a 40 year period (even after putting in new replacement Norelco rotor blades).  </li>
            <li>Gave a nice clean shave and didn&#x27;t have to worry about pressing too hard or going over the same area many times.  </li>
            <li>However, I will not buy another Remington, even if it worked better, simply because the packaging upset me so much.</li>
            <li>Remington&#x27;s appear to use the same head design as this one, which suggests they are not really any better (just include more gimmicks).</li>
            <li>The price is right (cheaper than new cutters for my old Norelco), and if you are not completely mechanically illiterate (like it appears the majority of the whiners are), it is easy to used and to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I like the way it follows your face contours - making for a close fast shave.</li>
            <li>so i didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li>I charged up the R4130 for about 12 hours (it came part way charged, which was better than expected) and then gave it a try.  </li>
            <li>Power cord and socket in the bottom of the razor do not mate very well   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never understand how someone thought this was fit to release to the public - they should all be recalled.    </li>
            <li>Shaver slid over face and gave a very close shave.  </li>
            <li>It had miss matched cutters, and really noisy motor.</li>
            <li>Do not know if the problem is at the top of the charger that goes to the razor, or are contacts of the razor, but you have to push the cable until it begins to turn on the charging status lights and then carefully quietecito leave without move it.</li>
            <li>Recall, the Remington titanium blades were brand new, the Norelco&#x27;s stainless blades have survived 10 years of steady use.  </li>
            <li>I have owned five previous rotary head Norelco shavers and this Remington is the better of those.</li>
            <li>and I still can not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li>I have had the same norelco for 10 years, pretty cheap back then, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li>Since I was in high school (2001)</li>
            <li>My granddaughter who is about 3 ft high has drop my razor twice from what maybe 2 ft.</li>
            <li>I have even felt this before on just longer normal hairs.  </li>
            <li>definitely get your ones worth plus some</li>
            <li>&quot; to kind of slow mode and goes on like that for a while.</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift to replace a 10 year old Norelco that cost probably twice as much when it was new.</li>
            <li>But I thought I would try a new one unit instead of just replacing the blades.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll just buy new blades for the trusty norelco.</li>
            <li>Well I was just looking for a new head for this shaver when I came across this sight.</li>
            <li>I ordered a replacement head for this razor, and it was a new factory one and shaved like a champ.</li>
            <li>tugs and pulls even with new blades</li>
            <li>only con is that it&#x27;s not &#x27;world wide&#x27;...but for the price i paid, i will buy an additional shaver (5130)...and that price is just $10 more...</li>
            <li>It takes longer to shave than an electric one obviously, but I can get away with skipping one or even two days without shaving and still look half decent :)  </li>
            <li>It maybe cheap online, but not worth it.</li>
            <li>but I feel as though this does the same exact job</li>
            <li>It shaves fine for me, but just slightly closer than the 10 year old Norelco, which never had the blades replaced.</li>
            <li>Not a very good shaver, much better options out there.</li>
            <li>Since the R4130 completes my shave so very fast and smooth, the recharging issue is not a problem, since by the time I hear the motor start to slow, I am nearly finished with the shave anyway.</li>
            <li>Well, 10 years later and my Norelco is still going strong, but not quite as sharp on the edges and doesn&#x27;t have quite the stamina it used to (perhaps they age in dog years?).  </li>
            <li>Whoever developed this thing needs to be fired.</li>
            <li>It does not disappoint and is smoother and quieter than my old recipro model.</li>
            <li>I had to shave my beard directly on the heads and it pulled every hair one by one.</li>
            <li>It can run plugged in and still makes the grade as far as blade RPMS.  </li>
            <li>g) Can&#x27;t run directly off the cord    </li>
            <li>My old one was over 10 years old</li>
            <li>It is a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; one, so perhaps the refurbishers fixed the problem of the head falling off.</li>
            <li>I have forcefully tried to pull the head off and it is firmly fixed.</li>
            <li>The shaver drags across one&#x27;s face like that rusty old push mower your parents used to make you cut the lawn with.</li>
            <li>I am surprised it&#x27;s still 60$...</li>
            <li>If you have more than a few days growth, you&#x27;ll feel it physically ripping the hair out of your face.</li>
            <li>Was well packaged and arrived as expected no problems and if the price is right with this merchant I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li>when you shave you have left many small hairs that you have to remove with a disposable razor</li>
            <li>lasts a long time to charge the battery, but fast download.</li>
            <li>I saw the new Remingtons and decided that because my last Remington shaver lasted years, I should try another one.  </li>
            <li>So if you purchase take note weather it is new or refurbished, even if it was refurbished, the threecutters should have been a matched set to shave properly.</li>
            <li>I wanted to avoid any new surprises so after 3 to 4 years of use, I bought another one of the same model.</li>
            <li>I wish it were possible to give NEGATIVE stars, because that&#x27;s the most this hunk of junk deserves.</li>
            <li>Ten years of new technology development must mean the ~40 range Remington is decent right?  </li>
            <li>Seems very cheaply constructed  and hard to shave with a dry face.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks and have had no problems, but I&#x27;ll be surprised if it lasts a year.    </li>
            <li>I also received this as a gift, when I was looking for a replacement razor for a one-year old(!)</li>
            <li>Every time Norelco \\&quot;improves\\&quot; their design, it gets worse, but Remington keeps getting better; this is just one example of their continuing product improvement process.</li>
            <li>Not only does it cause major shaving burns</li>
            <li>Close or relatively close compared to Norelco rotary and electric shavers in general.</li>

            <li> Remington&#x27;s appear to use the same head design as this one, which suggests they are not really any better (just include more gimmicks).</li>
            <li> The price is right (cheaper than new cutters for my old Norelco), and if you are not completely mechanically illiterate (like it appears the majority of the whiners are), it is easy to used and to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I like the way it follows your face contours - making for a close fast shave.</li>
            <li> so i didn&#x27;t expect much.  </li>
            <li> I charged up the R4130 for about 12 hours (it came part way charged, which was better than expected) and then gave it a try.  </li>
            <li> Power cord and socket in the bottom of the razor do not mate very well   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never understand how someone thought this was fit to release to the public - they should all be recalled.    </li>
            <li> Shaver slid over face and gave a very close shave.  </li>
            <li> It had miss matched cutters, and really noisy motor.</li>
            <li> Do not know if the problem is at the top of the charger that goes to the razor, or are contacts of the razor, but you have to push the cable until it begins to turn on the charging status lights and then carefully quietecito leave without move it.</li>
            <li> Recall, the Remington titanium blades were brand new, the Norelco&#x27;s stainless blades have survived 10 years of steady use.  </li>
            <li> I have owned five previous rotary head Norelco shavers and this Remington is the better of those.</li>
            <li> and I still can not get a decent shave.</li>
            <li> I have had the same norelco for 10 years, pretty cheap back then, nothing fancy.</li>
            <li> Since I was in high school (2001)</li>
            <li> My granddaughter who is about 3 ft high has drop my razor twice from what maybe 2 ft.</li>
            <li> I have even felt this before on just longer normal hairs.  </li>
            <li> definitely get your ones worth plus some</li>
            <li> &quot; to kind of slow mode and goes on like that for a while.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift to replace a 10 year old Norelco that cost probably twice as much when it was new.</li>
            <li> But I thought I would try a new one unit instead of just replacing the blades.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll just buy new blades for the trusty norelco.</li>
            <li> Well I was just looking for a new head for this shaver when I came across this sight.</li>
            <li> I ordered a replacement head for this razor, and it was a new factory one and shaved like a champ.</li>
            <li> tugs and pulls even with new blades</li>
            <li> only con is that it&#x27;s not &#x27;world wide&#x27;...but for the price i paid, i will buy an additional shaver (5130)...and that price is just $10 more...</li>
            <li> It takes longer to shave than an electric one obviously, but I can get away with skipping one or even two days without shaving and still look half decent :)  </li>
            <li> It maybe cheap online, but not worth it.</li>
            <li> but I feel as though this does the same exact job</li>
            <li> It shaves fine for me, but just slightly closer than the 10 year old Norelco, which never had the blades replaced.</li>
            <li> Not a very good shaver, much better options out there.</li>
            <li> Since the R4130 completes my shave so very fast and smooth, the recharging issue is not a problem, since by the time I hear the motor start to slow, I am nearly finished with the shave anyway.</li>
            <li> Well, 10 years later and my Norelco is still going strong, but not quite as sharp on the edges and doesn&#x27;t have quite the stamina it used to (perhaps they age in dog years?).  </li>
            <li> Whoever developed this thing needs to be fired.</li>
            <li> It does not disappoint and is smoother and quieter than my old recipro model.</li>
            <li> I had to shave my beard directly on the heads and it pulled every hair one by one.</li>
            <li> It can run plugged in and still makes the grade as far as blade RPMS.  </li>
            <li> g) Can&#x27;t run directly off the cord    </li>
            <li> My old one was over 10 years old</li>
            <li> It is a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; one, so perhaps the refurbishers fixed the problem of the head falling off.</li>
            <li> I have forcefully tried to pull the head off and it is firmly fixed.</li>
            <li> The shaver drags across one&#x27;s face like that rusty old push mower your parents used to make you cut the lawn with.</li>
            <li> I am surprised it&#x27;s still 60$...</li>
            <li> If you have more than a few days growth, you&#x27;ll feel it physically ripping the hair out of your face.</li>
            <li> Was well packaged and arrived as expected no problems and if the price is right with this merchant I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Been</li>
            <li> when you shave you have left many small hairs that you have to remove with a disposable razor</li>
            <li> lasts a long time to charge the battery, but fast download.</li>
            <li> I saw the new Remingtons and decided that because my last Remington shaver lasted years, I should try another one.  </li>
            <li> So if you purchase take note weather it is new or refurbished, even if it was refurbished, the threecutters should have been a matched set to shave properly.</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid any new surprises so after 3 to 4 years of use, I bought another one of the same model.</li>
            <li> I wish it were possible to give NEGATIVE stars, because that&#x27;s the most this hunk of junk deserves.</li>
            <li> Ten years of new technology development must mean the ~40 range Remington is decent right?  </li>
            <li> Seems very cheaply constructed  and hard to shave with a dry face.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks and have had no problems, but I&#x27;ll be surprised if it lasts a year.    </li>
            <li> I also received this as a gift, when I was looking for a replacement razor for a one-year old(!)</li>
            <li> Every time Norelco \\&quot;improves\\&quot; their design, it gets worse, but Remington keeps getting better; this is just one example of their continuing product improvement process.</li>
            <li> Not only does it cause major shaving burns</li>
            <li> Close or relatively close compared to Norelco rotary and electric shavers in general.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son to use, however he complained that it did not give him the clean shave that he expected.</li>
            <li> Slightly faster cut provided by equally fast motor and slightly more cutting area on the blade heads    </li>
            <li> It does hold a charge for a long time but it does not give a warning when it is low and it will not work when plugged in.</li>
            <li> and it last a long time before having to recharge.</li>
            <li> The battery charge takes a long time, does not last very long and the razor \\&quot;weakens\\</li>
            <li> a) PULLED longer stubble enough to cause sharp pains when moving over contours (not a problem on flat areas of the face).  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sufficient, as long as you don&#x27;t mind a 5 or even 3 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> I shaved in emergencies with the remaining two heads, but have gone back to wet shaving.</li>
            <li> Of course I actually thought this piece of garbage was broken the first day I used it because it doesn&#x27;t work when plugged in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this worthless piece of cheap junk for a couple of months and the trimmer stopped working completely, the rotaries work intermitently, and the shaver \\&quot;buzzes\\</li>
            <li> The humming will start to quiet down, so you know it&#x27;s time to charge.</li>
            <li> One of the most painful expreriences ever.</li>
            <li> Nope, not really.      </li>
            <li> try using it as \\&quot; wet razor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The clear plastic cover is the only bad part and is difficult to put on and take off without opening the shaver top, so I leave it off.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about.</li>
            <li> on the other side with the Remington.      </li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> It happened about every other time I shaved.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the other reviewers&#x27; saying their head and rotors fell off,</li>
            <li> Then the plastic flexy bits pop apart, releasing angry little rotating knives of doom right against your skin.</li>
            <li> Probably not that bad if you pick it up cheap</li>
            <li> This is not worth even 1 star.</li>
            <li> It cost less than I had guessed.  </li>
            <li> You have to go over the same spot a ridiculous amount of times to remove the slightest bit of hair.</li>
            <li> but it was about half the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m mailing it back to Remington (along with an angry letter) because it can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires of Mount Doom from whence it was forged.</li>
            <li> I wish that this could actually be used when plugged into the outlet in case the battery gets weak.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I dropped it and broke it.  </li>
            <li> a few years now since I purchased this shaver  </li>
            <li> I use everyday</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work if you want to just plug it in if it&#x27;s completely dead.  </li>
            <li> It is not easy to reconnect the head to the body of the razor.  </li>
            <li> As of the past couple months I have noticed it missing several areas on my neck causing long hairs to grow and it is nearly impossible for it to cut them.  </li>
            <li> Flexible neck and contouring blade heads fail to actually keep the blades level against your face</li>
            <li> After it shaves about 3 times, it seems to slow down, and the shave gets worse: catches on hairs etc.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to shave, falls apart, hard to reassemble.</li>
            <li> Part of it at least, don&#x27;t even think about a close shave.  </li>
            <li> I do not know what all the whiners giving this shaver negative reviews are complaining about.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint about this unit is that the head pop off all the time while shaving.</li>
            <li> Ps: I also wish they were negative stars to rate this product</li>
            <li> Never having a beard, I don&#x27;t know how it would be about pulling on a beard, as some have complained.  </li>
            <li> I have tolerated the poor shaves for almost six months and can take it no more.</li>
            <li> With only one track in each head the blades cutting performance is poor.</li>
            <li> I have read the bad reviews on this product and it is completely opposite of my experience.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the single worst product I have bought in my entire life.</li>
            <li> Weak weak weak don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> &quot; I found my self half shaven and unable to use the shaver when it was plugged in( it wont work!)</li>
            <li> I tried dragging a disposable around my face and just was not happy with that.  </li>
            <li> You drag/push it across your face with poor results.  </li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t use it plugged in, the plastic body feels like it will break if dropped, and the bending head is poorly made.    </li>
            <li> Then to make matters worse</li>
            <li> I have been shaving 2-4X per week with a Norelco Reflex Plus base model that set me back about $40 in 2001.  </li>
            <li> Product is of poor quality.  </li>
            <li> Each time resulted in a broken head.</li>
            <li> Takes 4 times as long as a manual razor because it so weak and worthless.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a real thick beard.  </li>
            <li> The connection spring that holds the cutting head on is weak and can come apart when cleaning the hairs out of the razor.</li>
            <li> The body feels substantial; but the heads are contained in a cheesy plastic along with ann anemic release spring.</li>
            <li> so I know it wasnt him being careless.</li>
            <li> This is simply the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> Despite all the plastic flexy bits, it still somehow manages to completely fail to contour to one&#x27;s face.</li>
            <li> This was very irritating.  </li>
            <li> Worst 50 dollars i ever spent!!!</li>
            <li> What a horrible waste of material.</li>
            <li> &quot; like crazy off and on at will.</li>
            <li> It makes me incredibly mad every time I use it.</li>
            <li> It pulls on your hair so bad you have turn it off and on</li>
            <li> A worthless piece of technology.</li>
            <li> It is also tremendously annoying that this unit will not work when plugged in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this crap.    </li>
            <li> If it were to cut them it would do it in a way that feels horrible as it rips it out of your skin.  </li>
            <li> This is without question the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I have had a horrible experience with this shaver.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have used a Remington electric shaver for years.  A few weeks ago I dropped it and broke it.  I tried dragging a disposable around my face and just was not happy with that.  I searched for electric razors on Amazon.com (where else would you go?)  I saw the new Remingtons and decided that because my last Remington shaver lasted years, I should try another one.  I am glad I made that decision.  It cost less than I had guessed.  It was supposed to be delivered in 4 days, yet it got here only 2 days after I ordered it. Amazing logistics. I followed the instructions and charged it up first for a full 24 hours and now it used daily. Buying this shaver could not of been easier.</li>
            <li> I think I am finally going to give up on this product.  I wish that this could actually be used when plugged into the outlet in case the battery gets weak.  It will only operate on the battery.  As of the past couple months I have noticed it missing several areas on my neck causing long hairs to grow and it is nearly impossible for it to cut them.  If it were to cut them it would do it in a way that feels horrible as it rips it out of your skin.  I have even felt this before on just longer normal hairs.  It has never really given a good clean cut.  For some reason it is just not cutting any of my face hairs very well so I&#x27;ll be getting a different model and probably from a different manufacturer this time.  Not a very good shaver, much better options out there.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not terrible, it&#x27;s not junk; but, it&#x27;s also not a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;This budget razor does feel like a step below its competitor&#x27;s budget model.  The body feels substantial; but the heads are contained in a cheesy plastic along with ann anemic release spring. Nothing is pivoting 360 and the flexing head and cutters just don&#x27;t seem to do as well s the Norelco floating head design.  Beyond those points, the shave quality is only  marginally inferior.  Probably not that bad if you pick it up cheap</li>
            <li> This is the first razor that I&#x27;ve paid more than 20 bux for. I&#x27;ve had it for just under a year now and haven&#x27;t had any issues. The head hasn&#x27;t come off like some say I get a pretty good shave with little irritation and I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about. My only gripe is that there&#x27;s no low battery indication and you can&#x27;t use it while its plugged in.</li>
            <li> A worthless piece of technology. Takes 4 times as long as a manual razor because it so weak and worthless. It makes me incredibly mad every time I use it. You have to go over the same spot a ridiculous amount of times to remove the slightest bit of hair. Part of it at least, don&#x27;t even think about a close shave.  Weak weak weak don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> This is without question the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever used. If you have more than a few days growth, you&#x27;ll feel it physically ripping the hair out of your face. If you have a day&#x27;s worth of stubble when you use it, you&#x27;ll have stubble when you&#x27;re done, just with your skin slightly more irritated. Of course I actually thought this piece of garbage was broken the first day I used it because it doesn&#x27;t work when plugged in. Whoever developed this thing needs to be fired.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used disposable razors, simply because I like the close shave. It takes longer to shave than an electric one obviously, but I can get away with skipping one or even two days without shaving and still look half decent :)  Anyway, this is my first electric razor, and it seems to work for me. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months now.  I agree that if you haven&#x27;t shaved in like a week, it will pull on your hair and feel like it&#x27;s ripping it out. Definitely not for shaving beards...  I think overall it&#x27;s sufficient, as long as you don&#x27;t mind a 5 or even 3 o&#x27;clock shadow. Unless you pull on your skin to shave (and risk getting razor bumps) and go over it multiple times (which takes more time).  Battery wise, you can actually tell when it&#x27;s running out. The humming will start to quiet down, so you know it&#x27;s time to charge. After a couple of uses, you&#x27;ll have an idea of how many shaves you get per charge.  I&#x27;m still weary about cleaning the blades with water, even though it says you can do that...  And don&#x27;t forget to drop some oil on the blades every month or so.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver to replace a foil type Remington that I&#x27;ve owned for 15 or so years and still works OK but wanted to try using a rotary shaver. I didn&#x27;t want a Norelco because the Remington has been so reliable. When I saw this one I thought it was a fabulous value. It does not disappoint and is smoother and quieter than my old recipro model. I like the way it follows your face contours - making for a close fast shave. I&#x27;ve used it for 2-3 weeks since charging it. The top flips open and is easy to clean. The clear plastic cover is the only bad part and is difficult to put on and take off without opening the shaver top, so I leave it off. I think it is great to use overall. My old Remington has now become my travel kit shaver - it deserves to enjoy its retirement.</li>
            <li> I have tolerated the poor shaves for almost six months and can take it no more. Into the trash it goes. It takes forever to shave, falls apart, hard to reassemble. It does hold a charge for a long time but it does not give a warning when it is low and it will not work when plugged in.</li>
            <li> I have had a horrible experience with this shaver. The tiny spring popped out and could not be found, so one of the blades was not usuable.  You drag/push it across your face with poor results.  One has to keep going over the same spots and it turns yer face red.</li>
            <li> I have had the same norelco for 10 years, pretty cheap back then, nothing fancy. But I thought I would try a new one unit instead of just replacing the blades.  I knew this was the cheapest model so i didn&#x27;t expect much.  But after two shaves my face feels like it&#x27;s been roughed up with sand paper.  The skin is smooth but it&#x27;s in pain.  It&#x27;s been 6 hours since I shaved this morning and my chin still hurts from the shave.      Everything about it is cheap. you can&#x27;t use it plugged in, the plastic body feels like it will break if dropped, and the bending head is poorly made.    Even though the entire razor is about the price of replacement blades, I&#x27;m taking it back and I&#x27;ll just buy new blades for the trusty norelco.</li>
            <li> Quite honestly the only thing it is shavng is load sof its quarterly profits with a product like this. Not only does it cause major shaving burns, it dies on you within a month. I bought it last year. A month in, the trimmer stops working. I had to shave my beard directly on the heads and it pulled every hair one by one. One of the most painful expreriences ever. Then to make matters worse the heads stop working in another 2 weeks. Worst 50 dollars i ever spent!!!</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift to replace a 10 year old Norelco that cost probably twice as much when it was new. I have to say I&#x27;m not overly impressed, but it basically works as you&#x27;d expect for an inexpensive shaver.    It shaves fine for me, but just slightly closer than the 10 year old Norelco, which never had the blades replaced. The thing is very light and feels cheap. The blades pivot of course, but flimsily. I&#x27;ve only had it for 2 weeks and have had no problems, but I&#x27;ll be surprised if it lasts a year.    However, I will not buy another Remington, even if it worked better, simply because the packaging upset me so much. What a horrible waste of material. The box contained the razor, AC adapter, and a plastic charging stand. But there were more plastic and cardboard inserts than there was product, just to make it look like you were getting more than you were. You could easily fit 10 of these things in the box.</li>
            <li> Since I was in high school (2001) I have been shaving 2-4X per week with a Norelco Reflex Plus base model that set me back about $40 in 2001.  Well, 10 years later and my Norelco is still going strong, but not quite as sharp on the edges and doesn&#x27;t have quite the stamina it used to (perhaps they age in dog years?).  It can run plugged in and still makes the grade as far as blade RPMS.  I picked up a Remington R4130 titanium blade version because the local grocery chain (Kroger) was just about giving them away for $14.99.  Ten years of new technology development must mean the ~40 range Remington is decent right?  Nope, not really.      I charged up the R4130 for about 12 hours (it came part way charged, which was better than expected) and then gave it a try.  I shaved have my face with my decade old low-end Norelco (with original blades), then performed the identical pattern (I&#x27;m pretty good at this now...can even do it while doing other things around the bathroom, etc.) on the other side with the Remington.      Here is my comparison to the Norelco:    Pros:   a) Slightly faster cut provided by equally fast motor and slightly more cutting area on the blade heads    b) Enough cut hair storage for a month or more from my face    Cons:  a) PULLED longer stubble enough to cause sharp pains when moving over contours (not a problem on flat areas of the face).  This was very irritating.  b) Flexible neck and contouring blade heads fail to actually keep the blades level against your face (perhaps why the blades start pulling hair)  c) Feels insubstantial in the hand (cheap)  d) Hinges holding the head to the body look very fragile  e) Power cord and socket in the bottom of the razor do not mate very well   f) The Remington side of my face was noticeably irritated (red) compared to the Norelco side.  Recall, the Remington titanium blades were brand new, the Norelco&#x27;s stainless blades have survived 10 years of steady use.  g) Can&#x27;t run directly off the cord    Two stars because it is functional.  If it lasts two years as warrantied I would give it 3 stars if it only costs most people $15, but at $35 bucks you can do a lot better with a low end Norelco.  The higher end Remington&#x27;s appear to use the same head design as this one, which suggests they are not really any better (just include more gimmicks).</li>
            <li> This is the worst razor I have tried. I&#x27;ve been using it for over six months and I still can not get a decent shave. A fifteen minute session with it still leaves me with a noticable stubble over eighty percent of my face and neck. All the so called advance technology (floating heads, pivoting head, etc.) do nothing to the performance of this razor. Guys, save your money and buy something else. This is nothing but junk!</li>
            <li> I do not know what all the whiners giving this shaver negative reviews are complaining about. I have used rotatory shavers (both Norelco and Remington) for over 30 years. Every time Norelco \\&quot;improves\\&quot; their design, it gets worse, but Remington keeps getting better; this is just one example of their continuing product improvement process. The price is right (cheaper than new cutters for my old Norelco), and if you are not completely mechanically illiterate (like it appears the majority of the whiners are), it is easy to used and to keep clean. I love it.</li>
            <li> Product is of poor quality.  The connection spring that holds the cutting head on is weak and can come apart when cleaning the hairs out of the razor. It is not easy to reconnect the head to the body of the razor.  It only works in the cordless mode meaning you cannot plug the charging cord into AC and get the razor to run.  With only one track in each head the blades cutting performance is poor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son. He would share my shaver (Norelco) He kept complaining that it didnt shave close enough. He also said the head kept falling off, eventially breaking after 1 month of use. He has been using my shaver for about 1 1/2 so I know it wasnt him being careless. Well I was just looking for a new head for this shaver when I came across this sight. I think we will just pitch it and go get him a Norelco.</li>
            <li> Good basic shaver for the US market.  Charge ac power block to dc.  Charging is not done while shaving. Cleaning does require reading the manual. If your in the market for better bells and whistles, look to a higher model and pay more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son to use, however he complained that it did not give him the clean shave that he expected. He had to use the disposable razor afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure using a manual razor without any shaving cream would be more tolerable than this piece of garbage. If you have anything more than stubble, it is a grueling 20 minute process in which you feel each individual hair being ripped off your face. The second I took this thing out of its packaging I could immediately tell by its light and cheap plastic design that it was going to be garbage. Pay the extra $5 bucks and actually buy a functional razor.</li>
            <li> Tryed to clean it once. Could not get the head back on. Tossed it. The cleaning procedure is a pain.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on other reviews. It was a substitute for purchasing replacement blades for a norellco shaver I had been using. The quality of shave is not the same and with not much of a  \\&quot;Low battery\\&quot; I found my self half shaven and unable to use the shaver when it was plugged in( it wont work!) and after charging for 10 minutes, the shaver only ran about 30 seconds.  I&#x27;m going to get replacement blades for my Norellco.</li>
            <li> Works great fo me. I have no problem recomending this shaver. It has a low price which is surprising for how well it performs. I would buy anotgher if some one stole mine after seeing how well it works.</li>
            <li> not as good a shave as I got from my Norelco when it was new but it was about half the price.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Well worth the price. Was well packaged and arrived as expected no problems and if the price is right with this merchant I will purchase again.&lt;br /&gt;Been a few years now since I purchased this shaver  I use everyday still Has all original parts and still holds its charge and dose a nice job cutting.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
            <li> This is simply the worst razor I&#x27;ve ever had. It pulls on your hair so bad you have turn it off and on so it does not rip your hairs out. I used it for two shaves and then threw it away. It maybe cheap online, but not worth it.</li>
            <li> lasts a long time to charge the battery, but fast download. when you shave you have left many small hairs that you have to remove with a disposable razor</li>
            <li> I also received this as a gift, when I was looking for a replacement razor for a one-year old(!) Norelco that died. It was not my choice, but I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. The shave is OK. Close or relatively close compared to Norelco rotary and electric shavers in general. It doe snot do well with areas of the beard (under the chin) which grow in multiple directions. My biggest complaint about this unit is that the head pop off all the time while shaving. The first time it happened, I thought I broke the unit. Head and blades come flying out into the sink. Then I realized that the cap just turned while I was shaving. It happened about every other time I shaved. Then one day it happened and the head and blade went into the drain. Well that was that. I shaved in emergencies with the remaining two heads, but have gone back to wet shaving. I do not recommend this shaver at all. It is also tremendously annoying that this unit will not work when plugged in. The battery charge takes a long time, does not last very long and the razor \\&quot;weakens\\&quot; to kind of slow mode and goes on like that for a while. After it shaves about 3 times, it seems to slow down, and the shave gets worse: catches on hairs etc. because it is rotating slower.</li>
            <li> My granddaughter who is about 3 ft high has drop my razor twice from what maybe 2 ft. off the ground. Each time resulted in a broken head. I&#x27;m currently using it with one head. My old one was over 10 years old and I have dropped it from 4ft. to 6ft. many, many times and never broke or stopped working. My 1st and last Remington.This is not worth even 1 star.</li>
            <li> I have read the bad reviews on this product and it is completely opposite of my experience. I have had it only a couple of weeks but I have only good things to say about it. It is a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; one, so perhaps the refurbishers fixed the problem of the head falling off. I have forcefully tried to pull the head off and it is firmly fixed. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard but I get a close, quick comfortable shave with this razor. I&#x27;m thinking the problem with those who have it is in manufacturers quality control. I have owned five previous rotary head Norelco shavers and this Remington is the better of those. Go figure.</li>
            <li> This shaver is a great price and just overall gives me a clean pleasant shave and I love that it is Dual voltage because it really gets the job done. I had a more expensive shaver of Remington a but I feel as though this does the same exact job</li>
            <li> I wish it were possible to give NEGATIVE stars, because that&#x27;s the most this hunk of junk deserves. This is without a doubt the single worst product I have bought in my entire life. Ever. Period.    If I could say anything nice, it&#x27;s that the battery holds a good, long charge. Beyond that, I&#x27;m pretty sure Satan himself had an unwashed hand in its development. The shaver drags across one&#x27;s face like that rusty old push mower your parents used to make you cut the lawn with. Despite all the plastic flexy bits, it still somehow manages to completely fail to contour to one&#x27;s face. At all. Then the plastic flexy bits pop apart, releasing angry little rotating knives of doom right against your skin. I&#x27;ll never understand how someone thought this was fit to release to the public - they should all be recalled.    I&#x27;m mailing it back to Remington (along with an angry letter) because it can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires of Mount Doom from whence it was forged.</li>
            <li> Is the worst product I ever bought. I don&#x27;t recommend anyone to buy this crap.    Ps: I also wish they were negative stars to rate this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of electric razors over the years.....by far this one dissapointed me the most of any one I have purchase.......at first.    The unit will not function when plugged in so the unit must be fully charged before using .  Seems very cheaply constructed  and hard to shave with a dry face.   Well, rather that just give up on it and  since it has rinsable head, I decided to try using it wet.... warm water on face and a just touch of shaving cream to lubricate the beard........well that seemed to work great!!!  Gave a nice clean shave and didn&#x27;t have to worry about pressing too hard or going over the same area many times.  Shaver slid over face and gave a very close shave.  Since heads can be rinsed under water...no problem with cleanup.... .    So my advice to those of  you out that feel like tossing it ....try using it as \\&quot; wet razor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this worthless piece of cheap junk for a couple of months and the trimmer stopped working completely, the rotaries work intermitently, and the shaver \\&quot;buzzes\\&quot; like crazy off and on at will. I can&#x27;t believe they haven&#x27;t pulled this joke off the shelves yet! I guess they don&#x27;t care about a quality image anymore.</li>
            <li> I believe this was a refurbished razor. It had miss matched cutters, and really noisy motor.The price was fair and does a fair job, but with differant cutters ,it does not do the job my other razor does. I ordered a replacement head for this razor, and it was a new factory one and shaved like a champ. But as I stated This was a refurbished razor in my opinion, and it has been a good while since I purchased it. I do not remember it stating it was a refurbished model. So if you purchase take note weather it is new or refurbished, even if it was refurbished, the threecutters should have been a matched set to shave properly.</li>
            <li> feels good across my face and feels good in my hands...noticed no hair pulling under chin...only con is that it&#x27;s not &#x27;world wide&#x27;...but for the price i paid, i will buy an additional shaver (5130)...and that price is just $10 more...no problem...very very satisfied with this product...strongly recommend it...</li>
            <li> After several months&#x27; use, I am pleased that this Remington is lighter-weight (having plastic parts), it has a quieter motor, and shaves TWICE as fast and smooth as any of the Norelco shavers I have used over a 40 year period (even after putting in new replacement Norelco rotor blades).  Never having a beard, I don&#x27;t know how it would be about pulling on a beard, as some have complained.  I don&#x27;t understand the other reviewers&#x27; saying their head and rotors fell off, since the model I own (labeled just as R4130) has a flip-open head that&#x27;s permanently attached by hinge, and the rotors seem to be locked in, so you can seemingly only clean them through the cage.  Since the R4130 completes my shave so very fast and smooth, the recharging issue is not a problem, since by the time I hear the motor start to slow, I am nearly finished with the shave anyway.</li>
            <li> Had this razor for 2 years and it works fine.  I don&#x27;t have a real thick beard.  The charging light on the unit tell you when it needs charging and it last a long time before having to recharge. It doesn&#x27;t work if you want to just plug it in if it&#x27;s completely dead.  It just takes like an hour and it&#x27;s fully charged.  Hey, it&#x27;s under $30 bucks!  It&#x27;s does pretty good compared to razors twice the price.  I think it&#x27;s a pretty good value.  Happy Shaving.</li>
            <li> Do not know if the problem is at the top of the charger that goes to the razor, or are contacts of the razor, but you have to push the cable until it begins to turn on the charging status lights and then carefully quietecito leave without move it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had the same razor for over five years...  it&#x27;s really a good product as long as u don&#x27;t try to shave off more than a days worth of stubble....tugs and pulls even with new blades but it&#x27;s great i might recharge mine between once every couple weeks to once a month I am surprised it&#x27;s still 60$...I&#x27;ve just got the r4130 model .........definitely get your ones worth plus some</li>
            <li> I wanted to avoid any new surprises so after 3 to 4 years of use, I bought another one of the same model.</li>
            <li> In not trying to sway one&#x27;s opinion of the R4130nb, I found it an ample rotory razor for the price.... it cuts well and holds a charge pretty well, but I would have preferred a metal hydride battery over a niCad.  Its not a close resemblance to a Norelco, but its still a good razor.</li>
