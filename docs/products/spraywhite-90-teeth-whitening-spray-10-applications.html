            <li>/&gt;Planning to buy more kits to see if my teeth will get any more whiter and also as a maintenance measure.</li>
            <li>easy to use, directions easy to read, results are fast and great</li>
            <li>so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement but it does whitten somewhat.</li>
            <li>ps i was a heavy smoker and coffee drinker now a movie star smile!!!!!!</li>
            <li>The original bottles lasted about 90 days.  </li>
            <li>The WOW powder is nice, but I would not use it instead of brushing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not too enthusiastic about he WOW Mints.  </li>
            <li>This product works better than high priced whiteners</li>
            <li>Pretty sure the product they hook you with is much stronger because both my husband and I saw NO difference after 3 uses.</li>
            <li>The dry mouthwash is amazing too.</li>
            <li>I am glad that I was able to pay less for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s tolerable, the second step of the WOW crystals actually tastes pretty good and makes my mouth feel really clean!</li>
            <li>love my white teeth and can not stop smiling.</li>
            <li>After using trays for several years, was hoping for an easier, more convenient option.  </li>
            <li>love this stuff, will definitely use this again.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it requires continuing use after the first 10 applications to see results - perhaps.</li>
            <li>Product didn&#x27;t do anything it said it would.. was better off painting my teeth white..</li>
            <li>Being an ex-smoker and a religious coffee drinker, I was glad I came across this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My teeth were 3 shades lighter after the first treatment and another 3 shades after the whole 10 days.  </li>
            <li>The shade guide is a real joke.  </li>
            <li>It causes too much pain for me.</li>
            <li>It really hurt my husbands gums, not mine as much.</li>
            <li>This product is nothing; but a high priced can of hydrogen peroxide!</li>
            <li>The Main reason I got</li>
            <li>I like the fact that it is easy and convenient to use, and I don&#x27;t have to wait a whole half hour.  </li>
            <li>Taste like bleach and it really doesn&#x27;t white your teeth as fast</li>
            <li>the next day the remaining 5 ate no colored foods for 24 hrs and boom done and so white in 2 days please use vasoline all over your lips outside and in to keep from getting blisters if feel sore apply more</li>
            <li>but I drink lots of coffee and eat blueberries daily and even after first time I saw difference.</li>
            <li>the packets they sent were nothing more than sugar like candy when I called them to complain they were rude &amp; of no help</li>
            <li>I tried this product twice so far.  </li>
            <li>the wow wash did it 5 times in a row</li>
            <li>It does all that it claims to do and is even usable by people with sensitive teeth.  </li>
            <li>it was of my Extremely Sensitive gums, it did Not hurt my gums like those strip whiteners.</li>
            <li>the strips cause my gums and teeth to be sensitive</li>
            <li>WELL WHEN YOU ARE BUSY</li>
            <li>I have purchased this product several times directly from the manufacturer and through Walmart.  </li>

            <li> I am not particularly sensitive, either.  </li>
            <li> My lower front teeth/gums are sensitive, probably from the years of scrubbing them too hard.  </li>
            <li> For what you get in the bottles sold by Walmart or Amazon, the name should be changed to Spraywhite 7 because after a week the bottle is empty.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice the results that I&#x27;ve seen with my other SprayWhites.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SprayWhite before from other retailers and this one came with MUCH less solution</li>
            <li> The amount of product you receive is not worth the money it costs.</li>
            <li> No problems the first time, but painful lower teeth/gums after the second time.</li>
            <li> I have to drop this product down to one star.  </li>
            <li> Every one of the shades is brown - my teeth are stained yellow/green due to tea, but are still whiter than the whitest shade!  </li>
            <li> Spend $45 on a gallon of food grade hydrogen peroxide (35%) and pour a little on your toothbrush.  </li>
            <li> , the spray tastes a little like peroxide</li>
            <li> waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I will give it a go again in a few days.  </li>
            <li> n was upset i wasted my $$.....</li>
            <li> i saw very very little inprovement in the whiteness of my teeth.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> another sucker bites the dust.  </li>
            <li> Sorry to say but after using this product, my wife tells me that it made little noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> the worst product I EVER brought,useless junk</li>

            <li> I have purchased this product several times directly from the manufacturer and through Walmart.  The original bottles lasted about 90 days.  For what you get in the bottles sold by Walmart or Amazon, the name should be changed to Spraywhite 7 because after a week the bottle is empty.  That&#x27;s why they can sell it so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. Spend $45 on a gallon of food grade hydrogen peroxide (35%) and pour a little on your toothbrush.  It works just as well.  Do not take a swig or swallow it because it will burn the inside of your mouth just like Spraywhite.  Read the warnings on food grade hydrogen peroxide and keep it were kids can not reach it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used SprayWhite before from other retailers and this one came with MUCH less solution and I didn&#x27;t notice the results that I&#x27;ve seen with my other SprayWhites. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying from this retailer.</li>
            <li> the product arrived &amp; the tiny  spray can they sent was  was empty &amp; the packets they sent were nothing more than sugar like candy when I called them to complain they were rude &amp; of no help the worst product I EVER brought,useless junk</li>
            <li> This product works better than high priced whiteners&lt;br /&gt;I love my white teeth and can not stop smiling. I get asked all the time what product I use. Spray White!</li>
            <li> Over rated, over priced.The amount of product you receive is not worth the money it costs. There are much better cheaper products out there. Don&#x27;t wast your money</li>
            <li> i bought a 20 day supply and used it according to the instructions. i saw very very little inprovement in the whiteness of my teeth. i would never purchase it again or tell my friends about it.</li>
            <li> Taste like bleach and it really doesn&#x27;t white your teeth as fast</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with this product.  After using trays for several years, was hoping for an easier, more convenient option.  The whitening power is just not there with this spray.  Also, did not like the feel of the spray in my mouth.  Would not recommend.  Sherry</li>
            <li> I used this according to the package instructions for 90 seconds.  It made no difference to the color of my teeth, maybe they were shinier.  But the next morning, the inside of my lower lip was burning.  Its been 2 days and I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll attempt it again for 30-60 seconds.  I am not particularly sensitive, either.  The shade guide is a real joke.  Every one of the shades is brown - my teeth are stained yellow/green due to tea, but are still whiter than the whitest shade!  People who say they whitened their teeth 13 shades must have had teeth that looked like baked beans.  The WOW powder is nice, but I would not use it instead of brushing.  Hopefully this system will work for you....</li>
            <li> another sucker bites the dust.  save your moolah.</li>
            <li> love this stuff, will definitely use this again.  easy to use, directions easy to read, results are fast and great</li>
            <li> Sorry to say but after using this product, my wife tells me that it made little noticeable difference. I don&#x27;t know if it requires continuing use after the first 10 applications to see results - perhaps.</li>
            <li> My lower front teeth/gums are sensitive, probably from the years of scrubbing them too hard.  I tried this product twice so far.  No problems the first time, but painful lower teeth/gums after the second time. I will give it a go again in a few days.  The staff at my hair salon swear by it so it must work if one can stick with it.  Update:  I have to drop this product down to one star.  It causes too much pain for me.</li>
            <li> This is the best ever and i have had zoom from my dentist for 500 bucks!!! I used three pumps of the spray then followed with the wow wash did it 5 times in a row ate no colored foods did it the next day the remaining 5 ate no colored foods for 24 hrs and boom done and so white in 2 days please use vasoline all over your lips outside and in to keep from getting blisters if feel sore apply more this is now all i will ever use!!!!  Buy it you wont regret it buy it now ps i was a heavy smoker and coffee drinker now a movie star smile!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I receive my spraywhite 90 today and instantly it showed results. I will be buying this product again. I don&#x27;t have to wait till 10 days.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product...It does all that it claims to do and is even usable by people with sensitive teeth.  Great results</li>
            <li> It worked for me! It might not work for everyone but I drink lots of coffee and eat blueberries daily and even after first time I saw difference. The Main reason I got it was of my Extremely Sensitive gums, it did Not hurt my gums like those strip whiteners. The dry mouthwash is amazing too. I consider it an Excellent product that does not hurt the mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried this in a salon and was very impressed so I decided to purchase from Amazon. Pretty sure the product they hook you with is much stronger because both my husband and I saw NO difference after 3 uses. It really hurt my husbands gums, not mine as much. I will stick with Crest White Strips from here on out.</li>
            <li> I have braces on my teeth and no matter what type of toothpaste I use, they look &amp;#34;dingy&amp;#34;. I used to use the stick-on type of whitener but obviously can&#x27;t with the braces so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy, the spray tastes a little like peroxide but it&#x27;s tolerable, the second step of the WOW crystals actually tastes pretty good and makes my mouth feel really clean! For me, there is no sensitivity issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My teeth don&#x27;t whiten as well as with the strips but it definitely makes a difference and the strips cause my gums and teeth to be sensitive so I prefer this.</li>
            <li> Product didn&#x27;t do anything it said it would.. was better off painting my teeth white.. i heard ppl said it worked so gave it a try n was upset i wasted my $$.....DONT BUY</li>
            <li> THIS WORKS SO WELL WHEN YOU ARE BUSY</li>
            <li> I used it twice and it seems very very good. My teeth are already showing results. I like it!!! its a 10.</li>
            <li> This product is nothing; but a high priced can of hydrogen peroxide! It didn&#x27;t work, lift a shade or anything! Shame on you!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see a huge improvement but it does whitten somewhat. I am glad that I was able to pay less for it on Amazon!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through the 10-day treatment, and I must say I am quite pleased.  My teeth were 3 shades lighter after the first treatment and another 3 shades after the whole 10 days.  I like the fact that it is easy and convenient to use, and I don&#x27;t have to wait a whole half hour.  My teeth are not blaring white, but you definitely see the difference.  Being an ex-smoker and a religious coffee drinker, I was glad I came across this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not too enthusiastic about he WOW Mints.  It leaves a terrible aftertaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Planning to buy more kits to see if my teeth will get any more whiter and also as a maintenance measure.</li>
