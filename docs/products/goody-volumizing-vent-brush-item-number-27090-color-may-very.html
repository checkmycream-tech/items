    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>it&#x27;s one of the best styling tools I have</li>
            <li>I received my hair brush in the best amount of time.</li>
            <li>Great brushes for layered hair.</li>
            <li>Works great if that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li>Great brush.  </li>
            <li>Excellent hair volumizing brush love it</li>
            <li>so I guess that&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li>Wish i had ordered more.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying many more.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable when brushing you hair ,, not all brushes  give you that nice comfortable hair brushing sensation ,,good to find them still online my local store no longer  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed this brush very very much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a few of these over the years, but can&#x27;t find them in stores anymore, so I was happy to find them here and bought 3 of them just to make sure I never have to do without.  </li>
            <li>Just the right number and spacing of bristles for my hair, and the bristle ends are comfortable on the skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this same type of hairbrush for many, many years.  </li>
            <li>Just exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>Granted, my hair is pretty long and curly, so tends to have some knots in it, but the bristles on this brush bent and then broke off very easily.</li>
            <li>The brush I received was fine, but I wound up receiving a blue brush, not the faux wood style.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a brush that really serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>So surprised to receive a brush very close in size to the one made to carry in your purse.</li>
            <li>Maybe Goody still makes the old style of brush, but it&#x27;s not this one!</li>
            <li>Wish I had read the reviews first because I would&#x27;ve ordered something different.</li>
            <li>I have an old brush that looks like this, but the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are considerably sturdier, which is what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find a replacement for the old brush.</li>
            <li>It was probably 20 years old and maybe the plastic was brittle.  </li>
            <li>When it came to outfitting our new travel trailer, I immediately decided to purchase this one because it is the same as the one I have at home.</li>
            <li>Way too small and the bristles are not as good as Goody had in the past.</li>
            <li>I have owned several of these brushes through out the years, and I must say these brushes are worth the money because they last a long time.</li>
            <li>My old brush had seven tall bristles and seven short bristles per row.  </li>
            <li>I use them on my wigs and they don&#x27;t get caught in the hair, nor do the little black balls on the brush fall off like most brushes like these tend to do.</li>
            <li>Smaller than the previous brushes of the exact same style  years ago.</li>

            <li> Been hunting for these specific brushes in stores forever. Finally decided to try Amazon, and there they were. A bit pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a brush that really serves it&#x27;s purpose. Functional, volumizing  and a really terrific buy. Goody never lets you down!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for layered hair.</li>
            <li> This brush broke after only a few uses. I have long curly hair and I bought this brush to use in the shower when I have conditioner in my hair. Granted, my hair is pretty long and curly, so tends to have some knots in it, but the bristles on this brush bent and then broke off very easily. It  might work well enough for someone with thin, straight hair, but it was a waste of money for me.</li>
            <li> I have an old brush that looks like this, but the &amp;#34;bristles&amp;#34; are considerably sturdier, which is what I wanted. I can&#x27;t find a replacement for the old brush.</li>
            <li> I was expecting the same vent brush I had back in 1977.  This one is a tad smaller and the bristles are different.  This brush has seven bristles per row all the same height.  My old brush had seven tall bristles and seven short bristles per row.  But it was difficult to tell what the bristles look like from the photo. Maybe Goody still makes the old style of brush, but it&#x27;s not this one!</li>
            <li> Very comfortable when brushing you hair ,, not all brushes  give you that nice comfortable hair brushing sensation ,,good to find them still online my local store no longer  has this style ....</li>
            <li> Your standard, basic vent brush - no bells or whistles. Works great if that&#x27;s all you need.</li>
            <li> I have used this same type of hairbrush for many, many years.  The one I am currently using was a replacement for one I dropped and broke.  It was probably 20 years old and maybe the plastic was brittle.  When it came to outfitting our new travel trailer, I immediately decided to purchase this one because it is the same as the one I have at home.</li>
            <li> Smaller than the previous brushes of the exact same style  years ago. Wish I had read the reviews first because I would&#x27;ve ordered something different. It does provide volume when brushing your hair. Recommend for a child, preferably one who has wavy hair to prevent tangling.</li>
            <li> The picture advertised a faux wood appearance for the brush, which is what I wanted. The brush I received was fine, but I wound up receiving a blue brush, not the faux wood style. To me, that&#x27;s false advertising.</li>
            <li> I run it over my head and it brushes my hair.....so I guess that&#x27;s good...</li>
            <li> This is totally not worth the money.  I mean, it&#x27;s a decent vent brush, but I&#x27;ll bet if I looked in the dollar store, I&#x27;d find an identical one.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair volumizing brush love it it&#x27;s one of the best styling tools I have I recommend it for all types of hair</li>
            <li> So surprised to receive a brush very close in size to the one made to carry in your purse. Way too small and the bristles are not as good as Goody had in the past. I would not buy this again. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Just what i wanted. Wish i had ordered more.</li>
            <li> I received my hair brush in the best amount of time. I enjoyed this brush very very much. I plan on buying many more. Thank you so much.</li>
