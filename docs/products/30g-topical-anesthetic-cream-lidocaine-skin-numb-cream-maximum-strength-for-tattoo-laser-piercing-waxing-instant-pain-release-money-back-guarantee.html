            <li>This cream did an excellent job.</li>

            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to stop using it because I wanted to give it a fair chance and see it it could work</li>
            <li>I thought this would be really good for numbing face skin before using dermaroller.</li>
            <li>Compared to the competition, this is a really good</li>
            <li>So, when i was offered to test this cream for an honest review, I was happy to do so.  </li>

            <li>This cream works fast and the best thing is that it literally works and does what it promises</li>
            <li>The reason I rated it 4 stars is that although this product by description has 5% lidocaine, it was not as effective as I hoped.</li>

            <li>It worked great in numbing my skin, I&#x27;m no chicken</li>
            <li>This one is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>This product couldn&#x27;t have arrived at a better time since we were headed to the beach for our annual vacation and my best friend had already been talking about getting a new piercing.  </li>
            <li>I got mines in three days and its pretty great...</li>
            <li>after trying this i am able to use it more often and have seen better results because i am no longer weary of the pain.</li>
            <li>but I really felt I had to because this stuff is great~ no robot.</li>
            <li>I still have many laser treatments ahead of me to have</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews are for tattoos and waxing, but it can be used with epilators as well.</li>
            <li>shot on top of my already three a day.</li>
            <li>now I ordered more so</li>
            <li>Now, for the most part I can take a lot of pain</li>
            <li>I am glad to report that I haven&#x27;t had any reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>What I love about this cream is that it uses Lidocaine for pain relief rather than capsaicin.</li>
            <li>I also love that there is not a medicinal scent to this cream.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this to use before using the roller on my face.</li>
            <li>Very happy with this topical ointment.</li>
            <li>this makes derma rolling so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I was glad that I had this cream when I used the Derma Roller, I wouldn&#x27;t have felt comfortable using it without it.</li>
            <li>Turn around time was very quick as well.</li>
            <li>did one layer on light spots like my face or hair removal and light scars for deeper scars I made sure I did two layers.</li>
            <li>It works best to allow it about half an hour to forty five minutes.</li>
            <li>When I used two, then I was 100% pain free.  </li>
            <li>Advanced Numbing Cream is NOT MADE IN THE USA.</li>
            <li>The cream is smooth.</li>
            <li>I know everyone is different in their response to things, but the MyM Cream worked great for me.</li>
            <li>this is a sweet little tube of magic!!!</li>
            <li>On a side note, my future daughter in law gets sun burned very easily and for the most part aloe works</li>
            <li>So far, this is just as effective as anything I have gotten over the counter.</li>
            <li>is still very sore, I will seek a better product</li>
            <li>It burned,  and it lasted one full week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than the use with the derma roller I have not had to use this for anything else, but over all I am happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>therefore putting it in the same price range as more reputable lidocaine creams.</li>
            <li>I love when products are completely risk free.</li>
            <li>I used my derma roller right away then, and it was amazing that I didn&#x27;t really feel much of anything when I did my procedure</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this  product!!!</li>
            <li>put some on a freshly alcohol wiped area and waited about a minute.</li>
            <li>It does not numb as well as it should...</li>
            <li>Usually, I have a issue with breaking out in a rash if something isn&#x27;t all natural but this worked great!</li>
            <li>The cream is easy to apply and very easy to wipe off, there is no strong odor.</li>
            <li>The cream is easy to apply and very easy to wipe off, there is no strong odor.</li>
            <li>All it does is burn and really does not numb my skin very much.</li>
            <li>The tubes contains 30 g and can be used for many different body treatments.</li>
            <li>so it should give more than enough uses..</li>
            <li>I have to say this has helped so much!</li>
            <li>Now I have this for so many different uses.</li>
            <li>I am one very well prepared mom!</li>
            <li>I am finally able to properly care for my feet.</li>
            <li>Really helps to take the edge off ripping the hair from your body!</li>
            <li>Another reason to absolutely love this product is that is comes with a money back guarantee.</li>
            <li>it comes at a great value compared to other similar products and is easy on my skin with no harsh scent.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of derma rolling treatments for my cellulite and after some treatments my skin got super sensitive, so when I saw this cream I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>I use a portion about the size of a quarter to large fifty cent piece when I use it on my knee.</li>
            <li>I have a pretty high tolerance for pain</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Advanced Numbing Cream is a topical anesthetic cream and contains 5% lidocainc.  </li>
            <li>and I feel all numb - perfect for derma rolling!</li>
            <li>It can be very painfull after a while</li>
            <li>and she said she never felt a thing during either piercing and even ended up repeating the procedure the next day to get her rook and anti-tragus pierced, all pain free.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I gave myself my first new shot.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised after using this the first time that it helped dull the pain so much that I was able to enjoy my session with the torture device.</li>
            <li>Ok not so much but indefinitely could see myself not using it much due to the discomfort..</li>
            <li>I ordered this to use with my dermaroller, I&#x27;m new to this dermaroller thing and when I tried it without the numbing cream 1 week ago, I wanted to die!</li>
            <li>Everybody is different, perhaps it is still worth a try.</li>
            <li>It is useful for multiple conditions.</li>
            <li>I use it primarily for three reasons: for the derma rolling treatments, for facial waxes of my eyebrows and upper lip and also for temporary pain relief of my arthritic knee.</li>
            <li>The first time I only put on one layer</li>
            <li>My first impression was to expect a tiny bottle that would be for a couple uses and then have to buy another one, but that was not the case.</li>
            <li>This is a million times better than other topical creams I have.</li>
            <li>I used this prior to trying my derma roller for the first time.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this to see if the torture would be just a bit less.</li>
            <li>I even went a little deeper with my rolling since I felt nothing, really (yayyy!!!)</li>
            <li>and my guess is that I am too sensitive to the pain.</li>
            <li>I used this topical anesthetic cream and it makes it so much easier to use in those areas.</li>
            <li>When I checked the expiration date, it looks as if the seller re-labeled over an old expiration date.</li>
            <li>i didn&#x27;t feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;i had tried before similar creams and none of them really worked.</li>
            <li>I was a bit nervous about using this because I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Once you apply it and it completely dries you wont feel anything except the relief it provides.</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a topical anesthetic cream like I was.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any side effects from putting this on with all my different products I use on my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I cannot use capsaicin because my skin is so sensative, so bengay and icy hot are not products that I can use personally.</li>
            <li>i love using my derma roller because it helps so much on my stretch marks and scars but it can definitely be a bit uncomfortable.</li>
            <li>In fact, I cannot detect a smell neither pleasant nor unpleasant.</li>
            <li>You receive and decent sized bottle for the money spent.</li>
            <li>For me it works about 2 to 2 and a half hours, but each application can last for about 4 hours depending on how much you use.</li>

            <li> teenage mistake tattoos removed and this is a great (cheaper) alternative to the other things that I have found to help with the painful process.</li>
            <li> I used the cream exactly as specified, two thick layers applied liberally to brow area before electrolysis.  </li>
            <li> I was completely swollen and covered in little red bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money and will be asking for a refund and ordering a different one.</li>
            <li> As long as you follow the directions on amazon the cream should work, just wished they would put the directions on the box or tube.</li>
            <li> I gave four stars because they have raised the price by $10, (I paid $19.99 for mine) since I bought it not too long ago...</li>
            <li> and the result was a week long nightmare .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, but now I am sold!!</li>
            <li> I used Saran Wrap on the treated areas so it wouldn&#x27;t dry out (as per my YouTube tutorials)</li>
            <li> and I normally do not use any numbing creams.</li>
            <li> I was kinda down when I left his office</li>
            <li> and when it&#x27;s starting to wear off a little-</li>
            <li> Still used the dermaroller and felt absolutely no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I never really thought about there being any solution to it before.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to kick in and it definitely dulls the pain.</li>
            <li> If you find that it doesnt work for you or didnt work like you expected</li>
            <li> I am planning to get a tattoo and the last 2 I got was very painful, if I am able to use the derma roller no problem I will definitely putting this cream on before I go in for my tattoo.</li>
            <li> Bought it to use with a dermaroller and put a thin layer on first and waited a few mins.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not getting the other orders</li>
            <li> and I would not suggest any other buyers to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I love my derma roller but going in areas that are very sensitive is painful and just scary to go to those areas.</li>
            <li> , never felt my skin numb , I felt no difference at all, and for the amount I paid it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how long the numbing will last, but you can actually feel when you&#x27;re going numb</li>
            <li> Ended up waiting another half hour and kept poking my face but still felt everything.  </li>
            <li> We arrived at the piercing place about an hour and a half after the application</li>
            <li> I do not like and will not buy it again because I did exactly as instructed and permeability than 1 hour to numb the customer</li>
            <li> At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but after about 20 minutes the areas around my lips felt numb</li>
            <li> Put a little thicker layer on and waited another few minutes.  </li>
            <li> but she was getting her ear pierced in 2 places - the helix and tragus so that was simply not a possibility but didn&#x27;t seem to make a big difference because the area was completely numb after about 45 minutes</li>
            <li> Give it a few mins to seep in.</li>
            <li> everyday anyway</li>
            <li> I can to alleviate unnecessary suffering, especially when our vacation is at stake.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re planning on getting tattoos in a few weeks and will be using Lidocaine once again</li>
            <li> Seems to only work after the skin is broken.</li>
            <li> For the same price, I would rather buy a product with a longer history and less scary packaging.</li>
            <li> A couple days later at my regular apointment with my doctor, he told me bad news</li>
            <li> I have to apply a thick layer of the cream twice, and I felt a little numbing soon after I applied this cream, but I still felt some pain.</li>
            <li> You give it a few minutes and then go to work!</li>
            <li> I followed the instructions given on Amazon page and tested it on small area.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;m not sure if it numbs at all.</li>
            <li> I spread a small amount all over my face and let it absorb and then applied another &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; and waited.</li>
            <li> so disappointed in this product, especially after how expensive it was for such a little amount of cream.</li>
            <li> So I hardly ever compelled to write an online review</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make you completely numb but enough so that you can tolerate the discomfort</li>
            <li> Need to apply at least 20 minutes before procedure.</li>
            <li> the creme doesn&#x27;t numb my skin enough and it hurts to derma roll my skin.</li>
            <li> You will physically feel the cream working because the area goes numb.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and hate needles but need to use needles for some sort of treatment I highly recommend getting this cream.</li>
            <li> There are other uses for it including making a tattoo less painful or for the use of laser piercing.</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a very disappointing experience</li>
            <li> apply thin layer</li>
            <li> She has been undergoing a lot of labwork and she is a really difficult stick.</li>
            <li> add a thicker layer to completely numb</li>
            <li> People say it isn&#x27;t numb until 5-10 mins into the tattoo.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to numb my face before dermarolling.</li>
            <li> I would like to mention that this cream does not leave your skin feeling dirty or greasy.</li>
            <li> Took a lot to numb the area.</li>
            <li> A sticker is used to determined the FAKE expiration date!</li>
            <li> but she had gotten really badly burned on her shoulders</li>
            <li> I had heard that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt as bad if I used an anesthetic.</li>
            <li> I will always use this before I do anything that might be sore or painful to my face.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t numb my skin in the slightest!</li>
            <li> The cream took about 5 minutes to numb and made the pain from the needles bearable!</li>
            <li> When I received this for review I was so thankful because with out this cream that Dermapen would have been dreadfully painful!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Horrible product.</li>
            <li> It gave me a terrible allergy!!</li>

            <li> Works as promised. Give it a few mins to seep in. I use it with my derma roller. Doesn&#x27;t make you completely numb but enough so that you can tolerate the discomfort</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work at all!  Bought it to use with a dermaroller and put a thin layer on first and waited a few mins.  Put a little thicker layer on and waited another few minutes.  Ended up waiting another half hour and kept poking my face but still felt everything.  Still used the dermaroller and felt absolutely no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Package doesn&#x27;t come with directions either so that didn&#x27;t help.  Complete waste of money and will be asking for a refund and ordering a different one.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Need to apply at least 20 minutes before procedure.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly. Just as described. Thanks</li>
            <li> MyM is a numbing cream for external use and is in maximum strength.  Advanced Numbing Cream is a topical anesthetic cream and contains 5% lidocainc.  The tubes contains 30 g and can be used for many different body treatments. It can be used with roller treatment, collagen induction therapy, micro needling treatment, tattooing, body waxing and piercing. You can take it with you to the tattoo parlor, the spa or use it for at home treatments. Great product to use for our many body treatments.</li>
            <li> Bought this for using my derma roller.  The first time I only put on one layer and it still hurt.  When I used two, then I was 100% pain free.  Didn&#x27;t experience any side effects or breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing again soon.</li>
            <li> I used this product with a derma roller, and it worked well. I had no pain what so ever. The tube was a lot larger than I thought it would be. My first impression was to expect a tiny bottle that would be for a couple uses and then have to buy another one, but that was not the case. You receive and decent sized bottle for the money spent. Other than the use with the derma roller I have not had to use this for anything else, but over all I am happy with the purchase. Turn around time was very quick as well.</li>
            <li> this makes derma rolling so much more comfortable. i love using my derma roller because it helps so much on my stretch marks and scars but it can definitely be a bit uncomfortable. after trying this i am able to use it more often and have seen better results because i am no longer weary of the pain. it comes at a great value compared to other similar products and is easy on my skin with no harsh scent.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of derma rolling treatments for my cellulite and after some treatments my skin got super sensitive, so when I saw this cream I gave it a try. Well let me tell you I followed the instructions on Amazon listing page and those are spot on, I apply a creame and wait about 30 minutes and I feel all numb - perfect for derma rolling!</li>
            <li> The product works great, but I signed up for automatic deliveries but I&#x27;m not getting the other orders</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting, never felt my skin numb , I felt no difference at all, and for the amount I paid it wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Ok. So I hardly ever compelled to write an online review but I really felt I had to because this stuff is great~ no robot. No paid comment~ just honest feedback. So the item was scheduled to arrive within 2 days but it made it here in about 5, no big deal, we&#x27;ve been dealing with all sorts of weather conditions here in NY that could have affected delivery. Ordered about a week ago, didn&#x27;t try it until today. I ordered this to use with my dermaroller, I&#x27;m new to this dermaroller thing and when I tried it without the numbing cream 1 week ago, I wanted to die! Ok not so much but indefinitely could see myself not using it much due to the discomfort.. I didn&#x27;t want to stop using it because I wanted to give it a fair chance and see it it could work but I couldn&#x27;t see myself using without some aid! I learned about numbing cream on some YouTube videos and decided to try and see if it would help me with my dermaroller... Picked this product here at Amazon solely based on the best reviews and it did not disappoint! This cream works fast and the best thing is that it literally works and does what it promises, I&#x27;m so glad I found this product! I used Saran Wrap on the treated areas so it wouldn&#x27;t dry out (as per my YouTube tutorials) Lol! You give it a few minutes and then go to work! Best feeling to dermaroll and feel nothing! I can&#x27;t say how long the numbing will last, but you can actually feel when you&#x27;re going numb and when it&#x27;s starting to wear off a little- for me it was about 30 minutes-more than enough time to what I needed to do.. It worked great in numbing my skin, I&#x27;m no chicken but I could not take dermarolling without this cream, it did it&#x27;s job! I even went a little deeper with my rolling since I felt nothing, really (yayyy!!!) Wish the tube was slightly larger but I guess it&#x27;s not something that I&#x27;m going to use  everyday anyway so it should give more than enough uses.. I do plan to re-order and save for later- I highly recommend this  product!!!</li>
            <li> the creme doesn&#x27;t numb my skin enough and it hurts to derma roll my skin. All it does is burn and really does not numb my skin very much. This product on one to ten is a 3.</li>
            <li> I got mines in three days and its pretty great... Works perfectly... I love it!!</li>
            <li> I received this product for quality testing and review and my guess is that I am too sensitive to the pain. I thought this would be really good for numbing face skin before using dermaroller. I followed the instructions given on Amazon page and tested it on small area. To make it work on my face I have to apply a thick layer of the cream twice, and I felt a little numbing soon after I applied this cream, but I still felt some pain. The reason I rated it 4 stars is that although this product by description has 5% lidocaine, it was not as effective as I hoped. I gave it to my friend and she said this cream worked for her. Everybody is different, perhaps it is still worth a try.</li>
            <li> So far, this is just as effective as anything I have gotten over the counter. I still have many laser treatments ahead of me to have teenage mistake tattoos removed and this is a great (cheaper) alternative to the other things that I have found to help with the painful process. Compared to the competition, this is a really good product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Tried Discounted Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]</li>
            <li> I love my derma roller but going in areas that are very sensitive is painful and just scary to go to those areas. I used this topical anesthetic cream and it makes it so much easier to use in those areas. I am planning to get a tattoo and the last 2 I got was very painful, if I am able to use the derma roller no problem I will definitely putting this cream on before I go in for my tattoo. The cream is easy to apply and very easy to wipe off, there is no strong odor. If you are like me and hate needles but need to use needles for some sort of treatment I highly recommend getting this cream. Makes beauty treatments bearable. As long as you follow the directions on amazon the cream should work, just wished they would put the directions on the box or tube.</li>
            <li> Product did not work for me.. I will try again though!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this product. When I checked the expiration date, it looks as if the seller re-labeled over an old expiration date. This makes me think this numbing cream is already expired and no longer efficient in use. A valid expiration date is not even printed on the box! A sticker is used to determined the FAKE expiration date! I would not expect Amazon to allow this for any products sold on their website. This product also did not have a child safety lock on the cap and this is against U.S. Lidocaine laws. I have kids in the house and would not want to have the chance that they could get into this cream. Advanced Numbing Cream is NOT MADE IN THE USA. Overall, this was a very disappointing experience and I would not suggest any other buyers to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> I needed to get this because I was doing a lot of derma rolling to get rid of some acne scars. I have to say this has helped so much! The cream is smooth. I didn&#x27;t have any side effects from putting this on with all my different products I use on my sensitive face. Usually, I have a issue with breaking out in a rash if something isn&#x27;t all natural but this worked great! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a topical anesthetic cream like I was. Now I have this for so many different uses. I am one very well prepared mom! This is a million times better than other topical creams I have. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The amount of lidocaine in this Creme indeed numbs the desired area in minutes. I am finally able to properly care for my feet. I have Plantar fasciitis and helps so i can massage my feet every morning so i can walk without pain.  The cream is easy to apply and very easy to wipe off, there is no strong odor.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions to a T, and it worked well! Most of the reviews are for tattoos and waxing, but it can be used with epilators as well. Really helps to take the edge off ripping the hair from your body! I will buy it again for sure!</li>
            <li> Well I have to give this cream 5 stars!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am a diabetic, and i also have Factor 5 (a blood clotting disease) and have to give myself insulin shots and blood thinners in my stomach every day. It can be very painfull after a while and I never really thought about there being any solution to it before. So, when i was offered to test this cream for an honest review, I was happy to do so.  A couple days later at my regular apointment with my doctor, he told me bad news and I would have to start taking a WEEKLY insulin  shot on top of my already three a day. He told me it might be a bit painfull as it was a big suringe and needle.  I was kinda down when I left his office but when I got home, there was a package from Amazon with this cream in it waiting for me!  I opened the cream put some on a freshly alcohol wiped area and waited about a minute. I gave myself my first new shot.  nothing!! absolutley nothing!! now I ordered more so I can have one in my purse, my bedroom and kitchen!  I was skeptical at first, but now I am sold!! this is a sweet little tube of magic!!!</li>
            <li> i bought it last week and used it for my laser hair removal session. it works like magic!! i didn&#x27;t feel a thing.&lt;br /&gt;i had tried before similar creams and none of them really worked. This one is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> This product couldn&#x27;t have arrived at a better time since we were headed to the beach for our annual vacation and my best friend had already been talking about getting a new piercing.  Now, for the most part I can take a lot of pain but when it comes to piercings and tattoos I&#x27;d rather take whatever steps I can to alleviate unnecessary suffering, especially when our vacation is at stake.  She followed the directions and washed the aread thoroughly then applied the Lidocaine as instructed.  The instructions suggest covering the lidocaine with saran wrap but she was getting her ear pierced in 2 places - the helix and tragus so that was simply not a possibility but didn&#x27;t seem to make a big difference because the area was completely numb after about 45 minutes so we headed to the boardwalk to do the deed.  We arrived at the piercing place about an hour and a half after the application and she said she never felt a thing during either piercing and even ended up repeating the procedure the next day to get her rook and anti-tragus pierced, all pain free.  We&#x27;re planning on getting tattoos in a few weeks and will be using Lidocaine once again, I would definitely recommend this product.  On a side note, my future daughter in law gets sun burned very easily and for the most part aloe works but she had gotten really badly burned on her shoulders so I applied the lidocaine and instant relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted price or the item was supplied to me at no cost in order to evaluate and share my experience. All opinions are 100% my own and they reflect my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. One may or may not have the same results as myself when using this product</li>
            <li> It does not numb as well as it should...Sometimes I&#x27;m not sure if it numbs at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff Rocks you do need to follow directions apply thin layer let it sit then add a thicker layer to completely numb the are for example I did micro needing treatments on my face and stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;I did one layer on light spots like my face or hair removal and light scars for deeper scars I made sure I did two layers.</li>
            <li> Numbing creams are often used by women and men who epilate or wax. I have a pretty high tolerance for pain and I normally do not use any numbing creams. I received this Topical Anesthetic Cream for quality testing and review and I thought it would be great to try it remove pain and discomfort. I applied a generous layer 30 minutes prior to using the epilator. Just left it on your skin, without rubbing it in. It takes a while to kick in and it definitely dulls the pain. It takes my pain level from an 8 to a 4. I find the numbing effect wears off after about an hour and another application of Topical Anesthetic Cream may be needed. Haven&#x27;t tried it for tattooing yet.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great! I gave four stars because they have raised the price by $10, (I paid $19.99 for mine) since I bought it not too long ago...therefore putting it in the same price range as more reputable lidocaine creams. For the same price, I would rather buy a product with a longer history and less scary packaging.</li>
            <li> 3 layers and it didn&#x27;t numb my skin in the slightest! Horrible product.</li>
            <li> I do not like and will not buy it again because I did exactly as instructed and permeability than 1 hour to numb the customer is still very sore, I will seek a better product</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Seems to only work after the skin is broken. I&#x27;ve been testing it out doing tattoos. People say it isn&#x27;t numb until 5-10 mins into the tattoo.</li>
            <li> I have just recently acquired a dermaroller. Now, if you haven&#x27;t seen one, they are like a torture device. I had heard that it wouldn&#x27;t hurt as bad if I used an anesthetic. I was excited to try this to see if the torture would be just a bit less. I was surprised after using this the first time that it helped dull the pain so much that I was able to enjoy my session with the torture device. I was a bit nervous about using this because I do have sensitive skin. I am glad to report that I haven&#x27;t had any reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have 4 children ages 4-7 and that means there is always someone with a scratch or a boo boo that is just &amp;#34;killing&amp;#34; them. I used this several times on my son who is learning to ride his bike. Within seconds of applying it, he was no longer crying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely a product that will stay in stock in our household.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this for a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to numb my face before dermarolling. It gave me a terrible allergy!! I was completely swollen and covered in little red bumps all over my face. It burned,  and it lasted one full week.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to test it before you use it .  I didn&#x27;t and the result was a week long nightmare .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband used it too and he didn&#x27;t get any allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to a friend.</li>
            <li> I used the cream exactly as specified, two thick layers applied liberally to brow area before electrolysis.  There was no numbing effect at all. Nothing. I tried the product twice and had the same results both times. This was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It numbed my skin for about 60% even if I applied it twice &amp; cling wrapped my skin for an hour.</li>
            <li> I use this when I&#x27;m using my Derma Roller, works great!!</li>
            <li> I received this topical anesthetic cream for a consumer review. I love this cream. It is useful for multiple conditions. I use it primarily for three reasons: for the derma rolling treatments, for facial waxes of my eyebrows and upper lip and also for temporary pain relief of my arthritic knee. There are other uses for it including making a tattoo less painful or for the use of laser piercing. What I love about this cream is that it uses Lidocaine for pain relief rather than capsaicin. I cannot use capsaicin because my skin is so sensative, so bengay and icy hot are not products that I can use personally. I also love that there is not a medicinal scent to this cream. In fact, I cannot detect a smell neither pleasant nor unpleasant. It is suggested that you rub a thick amount of cream onto a dry and clean area of skin. I use a portion about the size of a quarter to large fifty cent piece when I use it on my knee. When I use it for facial waxing or the derma roller I apply about the size of a nickel to quarter to each area, so three nickels to three quarters for those treatments. It works best to allow it about half an hour to forty five minutes. You will physically feel the cream working because the area goes numb. For me it works about 2 to 2 and a half hours, but each application can last for about 4 hours depending on how much you use. My daughter likes to use this before we have to go to her doctor appointments. She has been undergoing a lot of labwork and she is a really difficult stick. She likes to apply some cream before we leave to her appointments so that she is not so uncomfortable when they have to stick her, especially when they have to stick her more than once. I would like to mention that this cream does not leave your skin feeling dirty or greasy. Once you apply it and it completely dries you wont feel anything except the relief it provides. I do not like feeling any residue on my skin from a cream or a lotion. Another reason to absolutely love this product is that is comes with a money back guarantee. If you find that it doesnt work for you or didnt work like you expected then you can get your money back. I love when products are completely risk free.</li>
            <li> This cream did an excellent job. I did not know what to expect since I had never used a numbing cream before that wasn&#x27;t used in the doc&#x27;s office but I was pleasantly surprised. I used this prior to trying my derma roller for the first time. I spread a small amount all over my face and let it absorb and then applied another &amp;#34;coating&amp;#34; and waited. At first I thought it wasn&#x27;t going to work, but after about 20 minutes the areas around my lips felt numb and I could tell it had kicked in, so I used my derma roller right away then, and it was amazing that I didn&#x27;t really feel much of anything when I did my procedure ( did at home in my bathroom following directions explicitly). I could tell I was using my derma roller but could feel what I was doing in the way that I was rolling something on my face, but I did not feel pin pricks or pain at all. It started to wear off after an hour. I am so glad I bought this to use before using the roller on my face. I know everyone is different in their response to things, but the MyM Cream worked great for me. I will always use this before I do anything that might be sore or painful to my face.</li>
            <li> When I received this for review I was so thankful because with out this cream that Dermapen would have been dreadfully painful! The cream took about 5 minutes to numb and made the pain from the needles bearable! Very happy with this topical ointment.</li>
            <li> nice cream...it&#x27;s work for me...</li>
            <li> Took a lot to numb the area.</li>
            <li> After applying, I did not feel any help with reducing my pain during the derma rolling procedure. Junk that cost a lot of money.</li>
            <li> Cream helped reduce the prickly feel of the 540 needles Derma Roller. The cream did not break my face out either. I was glad that I had this cream when I used the Derma Roller, I wouldn&#x27;t have felt comfortable using it without it. I will purchase product again to use with the derma roller.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to help lessen the pain during waxing and followed the instructions to the point.. this does NOT work!!!! AT ALL!! I feel ripped off, do not buy this! so disappointed in this product, especially after how expensive it was for such a little amount of cream.</li>
