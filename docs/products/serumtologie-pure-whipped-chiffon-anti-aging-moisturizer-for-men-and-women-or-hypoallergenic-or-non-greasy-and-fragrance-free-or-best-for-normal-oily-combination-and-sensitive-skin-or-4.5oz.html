            <li>I just know that this product is working nicely whether I am wearing makeup or not.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know if this product was meant to reduce oiliness of the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li>This was a good buy :)</li>
            <li>skin&#x27;s dry&lt;br /&gt;And to be effective in moisturizing force from using this product</li>

            <li>liked that</li>
            <li>Was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>and I can honestly say it&#x27;s for all skin types.</li>
            <li>/&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li>I will update when I&#x27;m finished with jar but as for now I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>When it is first applied, it feels very nice on the skin and seems to have a good amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>The more I use it the more results I get!</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used this item yet, but looking forward to it since I LOVE their Vitamin C serum:) Thank you!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li>It is definitely better than the chemical laden body butters I own now.</li>
            <li>and itsnt too strong!</li>
            <li>It really does do an excellent job of moisturizing - and feels light on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It applies so smoothly and absorbs nicely without leaving a greasy residue but a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Decided to try this new product when I purchased another bottle of the C serum 22 (another very good product in the Serumtologie line).  </li>
            <li>This lotion is very light, not oily, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li>Also It goes on very smooth and you don&#x27;t even have to use a lot.</li>
            <li>There is a very light fragrance which I like.</li>
            <li>The silkiness of this moisturizer is phenominal and very light.</li>
            <li>Very light and moisturizes well</li>
            <li>The products are priced very fairly and have a nice feel to them - the added Vitamin C was a big motivator for me.  </li>
            <li>As a mid-range priced moisturizer, I&#x27;m not fully sold after two weeks of using it, since I could double up on Loreal&#x27;s VitaLift for men which is excellent at the price point.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li>This product seems to work well with most people.  </li>
            <li>I love how moisturizing this cream is.</li>
            <li>I love that it has olive oil, aloe, &amp; shea butter as some of the ingredients</li>
            <li>A fantastic buy!</li>
            <li>I am over 70 and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li>thankful and pleased for the opportunity to try this product to review and think you will be satisfied with your results also.</li>
            <li>This is light amazing cream</li>
            <li>I truly love this moisturizer</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had to apply more because it made my face matte</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>This is great,I love this product</li>
            <li>This is one perfect moisturizer  and will make you so happy after is applied , your skin just sucks it up and feels like baby skin .</li>
            <li>I love serumtologie products.</li>
            <li>Nice, light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I got this moisturizer in a promotion and I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the feel of this moisturizer .</li>
            <li>I cannot give it a whole-hearted recommendation, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Honestly what may have helped is I am also using some serums that are light exfoliators which may be allowing this cream to penetrate my skin better.</li>
            <li>(more so than before I apply it)</li>
            <li>, so I have gotten in a habit of always putting on another layer of ultra-moisturizing lotion on top to balance it out.</li>
            <li>I love the whipped texture</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with this one.  </li>
            <li>Could be better, but it works alright.</li>
            <li>Before I found your product I used Kheils for many years.</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY love this product.</li>
            <li>It was given to me for free or either at a substantial discount, in which I have to give my honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I love this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product to test but the opinion is my own.</li>
            <li>But this moisturizer was non-greasy and LIGHT!</li>
            <li>I like it much more than many I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>I love a product that is moisturizing without being too greasy.</li>

            <li>Just a day of using it I can feel the difference​ :)</li>
            <li>It is light and airy and smells nice.</li>
            <li>I love the consistency of this cream</li>
            <li>but I still need a heavier and more potent face cream.</li>
            <li>I just like my creams to have a more proven ingredients in them.</li>

            <li>This product is fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It is very light and easy to apply to your skin and you can feel the moisture in it as you apply it.  </li>
            <li>Best of all; my makeup glides on effortlessly and stays radiant all day long.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been doing the search for the perfect face serum for a long time</li>
            <li>I was very excited to unbox the Serumtologie Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer Cream today because of all the good reviews on Amazon.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and a bit more hydrated than before, but it should be a lot more hydrated from this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great after the sauna or steam room also because it hydrates my skin instantly and absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very economical because you get four ounces of this wonderful product compared to I.7 oz of similar products.</li>
            <li>feels very light on which is important for my oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It also works great making my hands look young again.</li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s fragrance free</li>
            <li>I was looking for paraben free products and am so glad I came  across PWC.I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>It gives my face a nice smooth cool feeling .</li>
            <li>I am rating these products a 5 primarily because of the company&#x27;s outstanding customer service.  </li>
            <li>It is refreshing to deal with a company that genuinely cares about their customers.</li>
            <li>Really lovely light moisturiser that penetrates easily and does not clog the pores.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>It very quickly absorbs and does not leave a greasy feel to your skin.  </li>
            <li>In June I received this free jar of reformulated PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer (PURE Whipped) from serumtologie with a request to give an honest and fair review of the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cool and refreshing</li>
            <li>New discovery of a good cosmetic brand.</li>
            <li>and it is fine there.</li>
            <li>I would be fine if you would put through a charge since I am using the product to some degree.</li>
            <li>It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>It is light, non scented and it absorbs very quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>and it seems to reduce my fine lines.</li>
            <li>In my 60 days experience combined with serumtologie serum 22, there were no firming effects and no diminishing of fine lines.  </li>
            <li>It is light and airy with a a very mild sent.</li>
            <li>OMG what a combination!!!&lt;br /&gt;My fine lines and pores are diminish and my skin is glowy.</li>
            <li>It is very soft on the skin and feels good.</li>
            <li>After the very first application, my face felt AMAZINGLY smooth!</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant to use in the AM, but it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t create any excess shine or oils!!</li>
            <li>I received my package which was very nice and easy to open.</li>
            <li>I just received this product and was super excited to try it, been using the Serum for about a month now and love it as well.  </li>
            <li>I still use this on days I just need a light moisturiser and with that I WILL add that this is a great lotion for people that don&amp;#34;t need extra help.</li>

            <li>After inquiring how I was enjoying the serum, I responded that I had to stop using it (for 3 weeks) because of a skin reaction (not the fault of this product) and they offered to send me a complimentary jar of the moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light yet hydrating.</li>

            <li>In winter especially, I really need the benefits of a skin moisturizer that has the rejuvenating quality that whipped chiffon provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much for developing such a wonderful product that I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>so far so good-</li>
            <li>It really is one of the best hydrating facial moisturizers I have tried.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s an impressive product particularly at this low Amazon price!</li>
            <li>That said, for whatever reason this is an awesome product to take a dab of and work it through your hair as the consistency is similar to a high quality grooming cream.  </li>
            <li>Has a light, clean scent.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased to see how fast it absorbed and did not leave my skin feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Personally I have been enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to use this product, but I&#x27;m underwhelmed</li>
            <li>From Tucson, AZ&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try out this whipped moisturizer as I have never used a whipped formula.</li>
            <li>I received this full size jar FREE as a promotional trial</li>
            <li>I do love the soothing and healing quality of this cream&#x27;s first ingredient (Organic Aloe Vera).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know though that I would pay the original retail price for it.  </li>
            <li>*edit to my original review</li>
            <li>As with all the items I have ordered from serumtologie, PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily provides excellent value at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and silky and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>So far I love it!</li>
            <li>It has a very nice, simple, and fresh smell.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer really hydrates your skin and is very light.</li>
            <li>The fine lines on my forehead, my crows feet, and laugh</li>
            <li>I have been using it more as a body butter than a face cream because I need certain ingredients in my creams.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s important to me to use more natural products because the more chemicals you put on your skin, the more sensitive it gets.</li>
            <li>This one is different but in a good way.  </li>
            <li>The whipped chiffon texture is cool.  </li>
            <li>Different but good consistency.  </li>
            <li>It is a wonderful creamy moisturizer, without feeling the least bit oily/greasy.  </li>
            <li>The product is said to be \\&quot;light-as-air,\\&quot; which is completely true.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s thick and creamy, perfect for night routines.</li>
            <li>This cream is all natural and has a nice whipped consistency.</li>
            <li>Love the thickness of the cream to me it feels like it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li>Really cool product.</li>
            <li>This is not a bad product, but I am not blown away by it either.</li>
            <li>I have dry sensitive skin and this product is wonderful!  </li>
            <li>WOW - I had no idea how good a moisturizer could feel until I tried Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer by Serumtologie.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, shipped extremely fast&lt;</li>
            <li>I will continue to use Serumtologie products due to great products, the value, and customer support.</li>
            <li>It goes on so smoothly and is so light and absorbing.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and works well.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s perfect for summer months - it is really light textured, in the winter it may not be enough if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and the softness lasts.</li>
            <li>Serumtologie provided tremendous customer support, as always.  </li>
            <li>Was amazed at how quickly this came in.  </li>
            <li>Applies like a dream and absorbs quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li>This product was supplied to me complimentary in return for an honest and clear review.</li>
            <li>My wife saw quick results and encouraged me to use the products myself.</li>
            <li>I love this combo highly recomended if u are looking for a beutiful skin and quick results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as well as my super dry hands (although it is kind of pricey to use on the hands); it soaks into the skin, rather than sitting on top of it, and doesn&#x27;t need constant reapplying, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li>After the first application I knew the light and moist cream was just what my skin needed.</li>
            <li>The wrinkles have been greatly reduced as well as the dark circles  under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>However, I do recommend this cream to younger people who don&#x27;t need as many anti aging ingredients and to anyone who wants a great, natural body butter.</li>
            <li>Soft scent, light to feel and helped my skin feel very smooth after first use.</li>
            <li>All natural though is very desirable and healthy.eople who don&#x27;t need as many anti aging ingredients and to anyone who wants a great, natural body butter.</li>
            <li>This cream has a pleasant minimal fragrance and did not break me out as some products do.</li>
            <li>This is beneficial for anyone who might be allergic to strong smelling lotions because you really have to put it up to your nose to smell the scent.</li>
            <li>Many of these natural Amazon moisturizers&#x27; jars are about 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been delighted by the moisturizing benefits of the cream and the wrinkle reduction benefits of the serum since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li>Very nice cream, soft and smooth and need a few more weeks of usage to judge it.</li>
            <li>While the appearance of this looks like something that would break my very sensitive skin out, I&#x27;ve had no problems and actually love the lotion.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very nourishing towards my face!!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, I like that!!</li>
            <li>I love the whip texture and it makes my face super soft.</li>
            <li>I tried the PURE whipped moisturizer because I believe in Vanessa&#x27;s products; however, it was too light for me and didn&#x27;t leave my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>the item itself, the moisturizer was white with a very light fragrance (fragrance free).</li>
            <li>This whipped facial moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li>I really like how light but moisturizing</li>
            <li>The fact that it is fragrance free is a real plus for me as well.</li>
            <li>I love that it’s natural and vegan and has improved the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my face feels.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice texture that is different than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li>it worth it....</li>
            <li>It made my skin smooth and soft, while feeling light on the face as if nothing was there.</li>
            <li>The cream is not oily or heavy, which is a good thing and goes on light with no smell.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth a try  </li>
            <li>Love this face lotion, goes on smooth, not oily &amp; last.</li>
            <li>Be sure not to get that near your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;during winter might be not enough but we have not too many of those).&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free</li>
            <li>I love how my skin instantly absorbed it and felt soft.</li>
            <li>The jar is a pretty good size and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for almost a week now, and I must say my face feels soft, smooth, and I am breakout free.</li>
            <li>been using the C serum for a month and a half now and is amazing!</li>
            <li>However, this product does not leave that heavy oily feeling on your face and that&#x27;s what I LOVE about this product!!</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan, but the best part is that this stuff lasts because a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li>You can feel it working right away.  </li>
            <li>It has just the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>When I noticed a discount for this cream, I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li>cream settles right into your skin.</li>
            <li>The beautiful blue jar is pretty enough to display on your dresser.</li>
            <li>They hydrate, which is a big part of looking youthful, but there aren&#x27;t antioxidants to ward off free radicals nor are there acids and vitamins that are proven to help with the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product goes on and feels wonderful on my skin, you only need a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I use it  with their fantastic C Serum , The New Cream is the lightest soufle of miracles.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer absorbed completely after lightly rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>I liked this product and yes it is smooth and goes on with no film or heavy feeling of your pores being clogged up</li>
            <li>All natural though is very desirable and healthy.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>skin feels  soft and looks smooth and its a light not heavy cream</li>
            <li>This moisturizer was pretty lightweight  </li>
            <li>First off I was given this product at a reduced rate for my review.  </li>
            <li>and I could see a difference in my skin after the first week I will defiantly by using this from now on.</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t aware if it was moisturizing</li>
            <li>First of all, I was given this product to sample by a classmate who asked me to try it.</li>
            <li>Soft and light.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I prefer to use a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; style versus in a jar, since bacteria is more likely to enter the jar from opening and closing it than through a pump.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I consider when I pick any skin product is ingredients.</li>
            <li>I received a cute yellow box, which had the Minions (promoting the Minion&#x27;s movie) on it.</li>
            <li>When I first put it on, I thought I didn&#x27;t put anything on.</li>
            <li>You can not go wrong using this great BRAND!</li>
            <li>First I must tell you</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this moisturizer and would definitely repurchase this!</li>
            <li>I also love that the ingredient list is simple and each item&#x27;s purpose is explained.</li>
            <li>My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>also likely be able to buy again</li>
            <li>The shipping was quite fast!</li>
            <li>Okay ladies, I&#x27;ve just ordered Whipped Chiffon Daily Moisturizer and haven&#x27;t received it yet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product but the whipped cream is thick for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I love the outside</li>
            <li>I just used it the first time this morning, (I am 62) and I could already see a decrease in the lines in my face.  </li>
            <li>This is more for folks with dry to extra dry skin, also good for your hands!</li>
            <li>This all natural/vegan/paraben free whipped moisturizer is so light &amp; fluffy but it actually hydrates &amp; leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a faint pleasant smell, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very creamy, soft, and light.</li>
            <li>My skin looks really vibrant and fresh.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is reasonably priced compared to similar products.  </li>
            <li>Because it is whipped, you don&#x27;t need very much for your whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li>The Serumtologie Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer came in a 4 oz., beautiful dark blue container with a silver cap.</li>
            <li>I am positive that with continued use, they will be gone too.</li>
            <li>The quality of your ingredients is as good (if not better) than Lancome</li>
            <li>soft cool cream.</li>
            <li>Something good enough to eat surely is good enough to apply to the delicate skin on your face, no?</li>
            <li>Leaves my face feeling super soft but w/o the heaviness that is often associated w/ moisturizers and sunscreens.  </li>
            <li>I am very healthy and still like to be outside as much as possible.</li>
            <li>So you&#x27;re considering purchasing serumtologie&#x27;s PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer?</li>
            <li>I have to admit, looks can certainly be deceiving.  </li>
            <li>The box was packed with large, protection air packets.</li>
            <li>The Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer is hypoallergenic, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and does not leave my face shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have been using PURE Whipped (overnight) for 4.5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>and I look for certain ingredients that have been proven to work.</li>
            <li>The large pores around my nose and chin have just disappeared.</li>
            <li>I purchased sérumtologié® PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer and sérumtologié® C serum º22 for my wife at the suggestion of a trusted friend.</li>
            <li>Love my new product and it has become my one and only moisturizer for daytime.</li>
            <li>Lovely and super hydrating on sensitive and very dry skin ....</li>
            <li>;) HIGHLY  </li>
            <li>It comes in a huge 4 ounce jar which I have never seen facial products come in.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Natural ingredients which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;Suits me very well as a day moisturiser ( maybe a bit too light for the night)</li>
            <li>I am really picky about products I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>That being said, I also don&#x27;t moisturize my face much - unless it&#x27;s winter.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use much either so</li>
            <li>and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I feel so refreshed and ready to face the day after applying this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li>and it really does feel tighter &#x27;</li>
            <li>; I very seldom give compliments on patients but your skin looks fantastic&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I am allergic to artificial fragrances, so this one fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Opening boxes are so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I feel smooth and moisturized for the entire day, don&#x27;t need to reapply at any time of the day</li>
            <li>A real plus for me.   </li>
            <li>It may be that I&#x27;m using too much product at times.  </li>
            <li>I really like the product</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion....</li>
            <li>The feel of it is very luxurious....</li>
            <li>These has really made my skin glow.  </li>
            <li>This is like HEAVEN in a jar, really.</li>
            <li>so even my husband has been able to use on some rough patches of skin.</li>
            <li>I will be trying  the&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C serum 22 very soon.</li>
            <li>and he really loves it too.</li>
            <li>Goes on light, moisturizes just enough without making skin oily throughout the day!!!</li>
            <li>I rode horses for 30 years and spent those and more years on a boat every weekend  with my family.</li>
            <li>does work very well (for me) along with Serumtologie Vit C</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>As I said, it&#x27;s very luxurious and ultra moisturizing</li>
            <li>It is not oily and my skin has not broken out.</li>
            <li>I use this along with serumtologie&#x27;s c serum, it Works really well together.</li>
            <li>Really makes your face feel like it is moisturized.</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>I was really bummed when my VERY acne prone skin broke out after using this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>This feels like almost nothing but is still very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I got off Kheils products and was put on some topical medications to correct the many rashes that had developed.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the cream, as I had been using several name brand creams that cost far more.</li>
            <li>I first thought this moisturizer would be a lot more creamier when you put it on your face, but it comes on really matte on your face but still a little creamy.</li>
            <li>This is a nice light weight moisturizer and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>I like it much better than some of the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star to begin with because I love their other product so well....</li>
            <li>I use daily after I clean my face.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and left my face soft with visibly fewer lines.</li>
            <li>far I&#x27;m in love with Serumtologie and if it does what it says it will, then I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for a long time!</li>
            <li>This is a very soft and fast absorbing moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I overall liked the lotion, but the texture is kind of weird</li>
            <li>Skin feels instantly hydrated and cool.</li>
            <li>The packaging is so beautiful and makes the product look expensive.</li>
            <li>The first thing I looked for the product was the organic natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>First of all let me tell you that I am 75 years old.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not BAD, but I definitely do not find it to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I very much like this product but like it in the following combination.....  C Serum 22, Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer, then Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Fluid Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>New Formula!</li>
            <li>New Formula!</li>
            <li>It is light enough that i can put it on liberally without being greasy or oily at all (and i&#x27;m sensitive to oily products) and it wakes my face up by making my skin feel tighter after i use it.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, the ingredients, while nourishing, really don&#x27;t target fine lines and other aging signs.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Have been using this product for one month after switching from a high end pricey cream.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Would recommend highly</li>
            <li>The fact that this high end line would choose Palm oil changes my opinion of Serumtologie</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>this product highly over my 100.00 cream.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended .</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>I like something a little more hydrating for nights.</li>
            <li>It also isn&#x27;t heavily perfumed, so that is a HUGE plus!</li>
            <li>It really helps to hydrate my sensitive skin without breaking me out or causing irritation.</li>
            <li>I wanted to give this more than 3 stars but after using this a few times now, it just does not seem to give me the moisture I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed the product isn&#x27;t immediately absorbed into the skin, but rather appears as an opaque finish while it soothes and hydrates, before finally disappearing into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I feel that my face has become drier than normal this winter and no matter what I tried,  nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I received Serumtologie cream a few days ago and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>so I am always hesitant to try new products.</li>
            <li>I try something new</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and new products tend to make my face break out.</li>
            <li>I do live in Florida</li>
            <li>The packaging is high end and the interior lid has a  little handle for easy access.</li>
            <li>I spent most of my life outside.</li>
            <li>When putting it on, I first use the C 22 serum, let it dry and then apply the Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I just have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>very sensitive skin ans have not noticed any issues, or clogging of my pores.</li>
            <li>I love the whipped aspect &amp; I have to use very little.  </li>
            <li>My skin is usually on the dry side and this has made my skin looking good.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also really soft!</li>
            <li>My skin is mostly normal with a tendency to be sensitive depending on which wrinkle treatment</li>
            <li>My skin is looking better without any allergies what I usually get.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t sound like much, you only need a little amount for your whole face.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer itself is thick but goes on pretty smooth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also started using it on my super rough elbows and heels</li>
            <li>Putting just a little bit goes a long way because your face just feels smooth right after.</li>
            <li>The box is huge and last for very long time.</li>
            <li>PURE Whipped works especially well for me with serumtologie&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum 22.  </li>
            <li>Obviously I was not obligated to rate in any certain way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok non greasy, but no significant visual difference in skin after use.</li>
            <li>- Ihave a huge very dark spot on my hand that is now getting lighter and lighter  and soon will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is not heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s lightly scented - and after a few moments the smell goes away.</li>
            <li>My face feels so soft afterwards</li>
            <li>it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a week and my face feels soft.</li>
            <li>but yet it looks soft and dewey.</li>
            <li>Put it on every morning and it makes my face soft</li>
            <li>It leaves soft and velvety feel to my skin</li>
            <li>It is so light and fluffy...</li>
            <li>I am 50+ yeaars old.  </li>
            <li>But this cream make me feel moisture and soft.  </li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Also there is no heavy smell, no eye burning , I use this on my lids as well.</li>
            <li>But I so mind looking old</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and supple for hours after application.  </li>
            <li>It makes my face feel moisturized all day and has not irritated my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s silky soft and I look forward to putting it on.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It seems like my skin is getting softer so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 6 days and can&#x27;t believe how baby soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li>The ingredients are good, don&#x27;t get me wrong,</li>
            <li>Acts a a wonderful makeup base, does not leave you shiney but with a soft bit of dew on the skin.</li>
            <li>My skin tends not to absorb moisturizers well, but this one sinks right in.</li>
            <li>It went on smoothly, there is no strong smell</li>
            <li>My face was really dry in the winter and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This facial cream was recommended by a friend who is a couple of years older than me.</li>
            <li>I notice my pores is smaller and fine lines around my mouth is less visible</li>
            <li>I feel like I still need to apply more because my face feels a little dry afterwards.</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this cream for younger women !</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the use of these products especially if you been searching high and low for these types of solutions to no avail.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I opened this generously sized (4oz) blue jar was the absence of color and fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I apply it morning and night but can be applied more for dry skin because it isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li>However, the product has been exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>It dries matte and absorbs quickly while still being very hydrating , a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>I am 44 and have been using the Serumtologie C Serum 22 with PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily since mid November of 2014.</li>
            <li>[[ASIN:B00QQIMZJO serumtologie® PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer Cream.</li>
            <li>B00QQIMZJO serumtologie® PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer Cream.</li>
            <li>My skin tends to become really dry or really oily.  </li>
            <li>I am very picky when it comes to facial lotions especially with having combination skin.</li>
            <li>After I use Serumtologie pure whipped chiffon moisturizer cream 2-3 days,  I feel my skin keep soft longer than other cream.  </li>
            <li>very dry skin was still very moist.</li>
            <li>and I expect to see some results due to the number of positive reviews these products have received.  </li>
            <li>I was in complete shock that a moisturizer can actually do its job without making me feel and look greasy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how the longterm effects will be just yet, but I can say that the cream left my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>I was fishing with my brother when I was old enough to follow him around.</li>
            <li>This whipped chiffon is really thick, but once you put it on it absorbs really well, keeping skin really hydrate and soft.</li>
            <li>Not dry</li>
            <li>I wash my face first and leave it a little damp.</li>
            <li>I use Ponds daily moisturizer every day, but, I have to say this is much softer  than the other one.</li>
            <li>I have used it for 30 straight days and noticed my skin is not as dry and small light wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li>but again it depends where you live ( for the states with minus temperatures</li>
            <li>I have dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have natural dry skin with an oily T-zone.</li>
            <li>I havnt used it long enough to know if it does the job of reducing wrinkles,  but it makes my skin so soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li>I live in a very dry climate and am approaching</li>
            <li>I have very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I also have noticed a slight decrease in acne scars on my face but nothing too dramatic, but I definitely noticed that my face is much more evened out and clearer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hesitant with trying new moisturizers because I&#x27;m scared of that &amp;#34;oily&#x27; feeling that other moisturizers leave.  </li>

            <li> I just know that this product is working nicely whether I am wearing makeup or not.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know if this product was meant to reduce oiliness of the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This was a good buy :)</li>
            <li> skin&#x27;s dry&lt;br /&gt;And to be effective in moisturizing force from using this product</li>

            <li> /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW</li>
            <li> I will update when I&#x27;m finished with jar but as for now I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> When it is first applied, it feels very nice on the skin and seems to have a good amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> The more I use it the more results I get!</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used this item yet, but looking forward to it since I LOVE their Vitamin C serum:) Thank you!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the results so far.  </li>
            <li> It is definitely better than the chemical laden body butters I own now.</li>
            <li> and itsnt too strong!</li>
            <li> It really does do an excellent job of moisturizing - and feels light on your face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It applies so smoothly and absorbs nicely without leaving a greasy residue but a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Decided to try this new product when I purchased another bottle of the C serum 22 (another very good product in the Serumtologie line).  </li>
            <li> This lotion is very light, not oily, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Also It goes on very smooth and you don&#x27;t even have to use a lot.</li>
            <li> There is a very light fragrance which I like.</li>
            <li> The silkiness of this moisturizer is phenominal and very light.</li>
            <li> Very light and moisturizes well</li>
            <li> The products are priced very fairly and have a nice feel to them - the added Vitamin C was a big motivator for me.  </li>
            <li> As a mid-range priced moisturizer, I&#x27;m not fully sold after two weeks of using it, since I could double up on Loreal&#x27;s VitaLift for men which is excellent at the price point.</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well with most people.  </li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this cream is.</li>
            <li> I love that it has olive oil, aloe, &amp; shea butter as some of the ingredients</li>
            <li> A fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> I am over 70 and my skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> thankful and pleased for the opportunity to try this product to review and think you will be satisfied with your results also.</li>
            <li> This is light amazing cream</li>
            <li> I truly love this moisturizer</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had to apply more because it made my face matte</li>
            <li> I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> love how it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> This is great,I love this product</li>

            <li> I got this moisturizer in a promotion and I love it.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this moisturizer .</li>
            <li> I cannot give it a whole-hearted recommendation, but it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Honestly what may have helped is I am also using some serums that are light exfoliators which may be allowing this cream to penetrate my skin better.</li>
            <li> (more so than before I apply it)</li>
            <li> , so I have gotten in a habit of always putting on another layer of ultra-moisturizing lotion on top to balance it out.</li>
            <li> I love the whipped texture</li>
            <li> and I fell in love with this one.  </li>
            <li> Could be better, but it works alright.</li>
            <li> Before I found your product I used Kheils for many years.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this product.</li>

            <li> I received a free sample of this product to test but the opinion is my own.</li>

            <li> I love the consistency of this cream</li>
            <li> but I still need a heavier and more potent face cream.</li>
            <li> I just like my creams to have a more proven ingredients in them.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s so cool and refreshing</li>
            <li> New discovery of a good cosmetic brand.</li>
            <li> and it is fine there.</li>

            <li> It is light, non scented and it absorbs very quickly into my skin.</li>

            <li> so I was hesitant to use in the AM, but it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t create any excess shine or oils!!</li>
            <li> I received my package which was very nice and easy to open.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and was super excited to try it, been using the Serum for about a month now and love it as well.  </li>

            <li> From Tucson, AZ&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try out this whipped moisturizer as I have never used a whipped formula.</li>
            <li> I received this full size jar FREE as a promotional trial</li>
            <li> I do love the soothing and healing quality of this cream&#x27;s first ingredient (Organic Aloe Vera).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know though that I would pay the original retail price for it.  </li>
            <li> *edit to my original review</li>
            <li> As with all the items I have ordered from serumtologie, PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily provides excellent value at a very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and silky and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> So far I love it!</li>
            <li> It has a very nice, simple, and fresh smell.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer really hydrates your skin and is very light.</li>
            <li> The fine lines on my forehead, my crows feet, and laugh</li>
            <li> I have been using it more as a body butter than a face cream because I need certain ingredients in my creams.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important to me to use more natural products because the more chemicals you put on your skin, the more sensitive it gets.</li>
            <li> This one is different but in a good way.  </li>
            <li> The whipped chiffon texture is cool.  </li>
            <li> Different but good consistency.  </li>
            <li> It is a wonderful creamy moisturizer, without feeling the least bit oily/greasy.  </li>
            <li> The product is said to be \\&quot;light-as-air,\\&quot; which is completely true.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick and creamy, perfect for night routines.</li>
            <li> This cream is all natural and has a nice whipped consistency.</li>
            <li> Love the thickness of the cream to me it feels like it&#x27;s really working.</li>
            <li> Really cool product.</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product, but I am not blown away by it either.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and this product is wonderful!  </li>
            <li> WOW - I had no idea how good a moisturizer could feel until I tried Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer by Serumtologie.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, shipped extremely fast&lt;</li>
            <li> I will continue to use Serumtologie products due to great products, the value, and customer support.</li>
            <li> It goes on so smoothly and is so light and absorbing.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and works well.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s perfect for summer months - it is really light textured, in the winter it may not be enough if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and the softness lasts.</li>
            <li> Serumtologie provided tremendous customer support, as always.  </li>
            <li> Was amazed at how quickly this came in.  </li>
            <li> Applies like a dream and absorbs quickly with no residue.</li>
            <li> This product was supplied to me complimentary in return for an honest and clear review.</li>
            <li> My wife saw quick results and encouraged me to use the products myself.</li>
            <li> I love this combo highly recomended if u are looking for a beutiful skin and quick results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as well as my super dry hands (although it is kind of pricey to use on the hands); it soaks into the skin, rather than sitting on top of it, and doesn&#x27;t need constant reapplying, which is a nice bonus.</li>
            <li> After the first application I knew the light and moist cream was just what my skin needed.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles have been greatly reduced as well as the dark circles  under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> However, I do recommend this cream to younger people who don&#x27;t need as many anti aging ingredients and to anyone who wants a great, natural body butter.</li>
            <li> Soft scent, light to feel and helped my skin feel very smooth after first use.</li>
            <li> All natural though is very desirable and healthy.eople who don&#x27;t need as many anti aging ingredients and to anyone who wants a great, natural body butter.</li>
            <li> This cream has a pleasant minimal fragrance and did not break me out as some products do.</li>
            <li> This is beneficial for anyone who might be allergic to strong smelling lotions because you really have to put it up to your nose to smell the scent.</li>
            <li> Many of these natural Amazon moisturizers&#x27; jars are about 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been delighted by the moisturizing benefits of the cream and the wrinkle reduction benefits of the serum since I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream, soft and smooth and need a few more weeks of usage to judge it.</li>
            <li> While the appearance of this looks like something that would break my very sensitive skin out, I&#x27;ve had no problems and actually love the lotion.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nourishing towards my face!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, I like that!!</li>
            <li> I love the whip texture and it makes my face super soft.</li>
            <li> I tried the PURE whipped moisturizer because I believe in Vanessa&#x27;s products; however, it was too light for me and didn&#x27;t leave my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> the item itself, the moisturizer was white with a very light fragrance (fragrance free).</li>
            <li> This whipped facial moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li> I really like how light but moisturizing</li>
            <li> The fact that it is fragrance free is a real plus for me as well.</li>
            <li> I love that it’s natural and vegan and has improved the look of my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my face feels.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice texture that is different than anything I&#x27;ve used before.</li>
            <li> it worth it....</li>
            <li> It made my skin smooth and soft, while feeling light on the face as if nothing was there.</li>
            <li> The cream is not oily or heavy, which is a good thing and goes on light with no smell.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth a try  </li>
            <li> Love this face lotion, goes on smooth, not oily &amp; last.</li>
            <li> Be sure not to get that near your eyes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;during winter might be not enough but we have not too many of those).&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free</li>
            <li> I love how my skin instantly absorbed it and felt soft.</li>
            <li> The jar is a pretty good size and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for almost a week now, and I must say my face feels soft, smooth, and I am breakout free.</li>
            <li> been using the C serum for a month and a half now and is amazing!</li>
            <li> However, this product does not leave that heavy oily feeling on your face and that&#x27;s what I LOVE about this product!!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan, but the best part is that this stuff lasts because a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> You can feel it working right away.  </li>
            <li> It has just the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li> When I noticed a discount for this cream, I ordered it right away.</li>
            <li> cream settles right into your skin.</li>
            <li> The beautiful blue jar is pretty enough to display on your dresser.</li>
            <li> They hydrate, which is a big part of looking youthful, but there aren&#x27;t antioxidants to ward off free radicals nor are there acids and vitamins that are proven to help with the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product goes on and feels wonderful on my skin, you only need a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I use it  with their fantastic C Serum , The New Cream is the lightest soufle of miracles.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer absorbed completely after lightly rubbing it in.</li>
            <li> I liked this product and yes it is smooth and goes on with no film or heavy feeling of your pores being clogged up</li>
            <li> All natural though is very desirable and healthy.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin feel very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> skin feels  soft and looks smooth and its a light not heavy cream</li>
            <li> This moisturizer was pretty lightweight  </li>
            <li> First off I was given this product at a reduced rate for my review.  </li>
            <li> and I could see a difference in my skin after the first week I will defiantly by using this from now on.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t aware if it was moisturizing</li>
            <li> First of all, I was given this product to sample by a classmate who asked me to try it.</li>
            <li> Soft and light.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels so smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I prefer to use a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; style versus in a jar, since bacteria is more likely to enter the jar from opening and closing it than through a pump.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I consider when I pick any skin product is ingredients.</li>
            <li> I received a cute yellow box, which had the Minions (promoting the Minion&#x27;s movie) on it.</li>
            <li> When I first put it on, I thought I didn&#x27;t put anything on.</li>
            <li> You can not go wrong using this great BRAND!</li>
            <li> First I must tell you</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this moisturizer and would definitely repurchase this!</li>
            <li> I also love that the ingredient list is simple and each item&#x27;s purpose is explained.</li>
            <li> My skin feels so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> also likely be able to buy again</li>
            <li> The shipping was quite fast!</li>
            <li> Okay ladies, I&#x27;ve just ordered Whipped Chiffon Daily Moisturizer and haven&#x27;t received it yet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the whipped cream is thick for my skin.  </li>
            <li> I love the outside</li>
            <li> I just used it the first time this morning, (I am 62) and I could already see a decrease in the lines in my face.  </li>
            <li> This is more for folks with dry to extra dry skin, also good for your hands!</li>
            <li> This all natural/vegan/paraben free whipped moisturizer is so light &amp; fluffy but it actually hydrates &amp; leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a faint pleasant smell, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very creamy, soft, and light.</li>
            <li> My skin looks really vibrant and fresh.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it is reasonably priced compared to similar products.  </li>
            <li> Because it is whipped, you don&#x27;t need very much for your whole face and neck.  </li>
            <li> The Serumtologie Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer came in a 4 oz., beautiful dark blue container with a silver cap.</li>
            <li> I am positive that with continued use, they will be gone too.</li>
            <li> The quality of your ingredients is as good (if not better) than Lancome</li>
            <li> soft cool cream.</li>
            <li> Something good enough to eat surely is good enough to apply to the delicate skin on your face, no?</li>
            <li> Leaves my face feeling super soft but w/o the heaviness that is often associated w/ moisturizers and sunscreens.  </li>
            <li> I am very healthy and still like to be outside as much as possible.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re considering purchasing serumtologie&#x27;s PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer?</li>
            <li> I have to admit, looks can certainly be deceiving.  </li>
            <li> The box was packed with large, protection air packets.</li>
            <li> The Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer is hypoallergenic, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and does not leave my face shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have been using PURE Whipped (overnight) for 4.5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> and I look for certain ingredients that have been proven to work.</li>
            <li> The large pores around my nose and chin have just disappeared.</li>
            <li> I purchased sérumtologié® PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer and sérumtologié® C serum º22 for my wife at the suggestion of a trusted friend.</li>
            <li> Love my new product and it has become my one and only moisturizer for daytime.</li>
            <li> Lovely and super hydrating on sensitive and very dry skin ....</li>
            <li> ;) HIGHLY  </li>
            <li> It comes in a huge 4 ounce jar which I have never seen facial products come in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Natural ingredients which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;Suits me very well as a day moisturiser ( maybe a bit too light for the night)</li>
            <li> I am really picky about products I put on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> That being said, I also don&#x27;t moisturize my face much - unless it&#x27;s winter.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use much either so</li>
            <li> and I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I feel so refreshed and ready to face the day after applying this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> and it really does feel tighter &#x27;</li>
            <li> ; I very seldom give compliments on patients but your skin looks fantastic&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I am allergic to artificial fragrances, so this one fits the bill perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Opening boxes are so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel smooth and moisturized for the entire day, don&#x27;t need to reapply at any time of the day</li>
            <li> A real plus for me.   </li>
            <li> It may be that I&#x27;m using too much product at times.  </li>
            <li> I really like the product</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion....</li>
            <li> The feel of it is very luxurious....</li>
            <li> These has really made my skin glow.  </li>
            <li> This is like HEAVEN in a jar, really.</li>
            <li> so even my husband has been able to use on some rough patches of skin.</li>
            <li> I will be trying  the&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C serum 22 very soon.</li>
            <li> and he really loves it too.</li>
            <li> Goes on light, moisturizes just enough without making skin oily throughout the day!!!</li>
            <li> I rode horses for 30 years and spent those and more years on a boat every weekend  with my family.</li>
            <li> does work very well (for me) along with Serumtologie Vit C</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> As I said, it&#x27;s very luxurious and ultra moisturizing</li>
            <li> It is not oily and my skin has not broken out.</li>
            <li> I use this along with serumtologie&#x27;s c serum, it Works really well together.</li>
            <li> Really makes your face feel like it is moisturized.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  </li>
            <li> I was really bummed when my VERY acne prone skin broke out after using this moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> This feels like almost nothing but is still very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> I got off Kheils products and was put on some topical medications to correct the many rashes that had developed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the cream, as I had been using several name brand creams that cost far more.</li>
            <li> I first thought this moisturizer would be a lot more creamier when you put it on your face, but it comes on really matte on your face but still a little creamy.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light weight moisturizer and a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I like it much better than some of the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star to begin with because I love their other product so well....</li>
            <li> I use daily after I clean my face.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and left my face soft with visibly fewer lines.</li>
            <li> far I&#x27;m in love with Serumtologie and if it does what it says it will, then I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for a long time!</li>
            <li> This is a very soft and fast absorbing moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I overall liked the lotion, but the texture is kind of weird</li>
            <li> Skin feels instantly hydrated and cool.</li>
            <li> The packaging is so beautiful and makes the product look expensive.</li>
            <li> The first thing I looked for the product was the organic natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> First of all let me tell you that I am 75 years old.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not BAD, but I definitely do not find it to be moisturizing.</li>
            <li> I very much like this product but like it in the following combination.....  C Serum 22, Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer, then Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Fluid Sunscreen.  </li>
            <li> New Formula!</li>
            <li> New Formula!</li>
            <li> It is light enough that i can put it on liberally without being greasy or oily at all (and i&#x27;m sensitive to oily products) and it wakes my face up by making my skin feel tighter after i use it.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However, the ingredients, while nourishing, really don&#x27;t target fine lines and other aging signs.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for one month after switching from a high end pricey cream.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Would recommend highly</li>
            <li> The fact that this high end line would choose Palm oil changes my opinion of Serumtologie</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> this product highly over my 100.00 cream.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended .</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> I like something a little more hydrating for nights.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t heavily perfumed, so that is a HUGE plus!</li>
            <li> It really helps to hydrate my sensitive skin without breaking me out or causing irritation.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this more than 3 stars but after using this a few times now, it just does not seem to give me the moisture I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed the product isn&#x27;t immediately absorbed into the skin, but rather appears as an opaque finish while it soothes and hydrates, before finally disappearing into the skin.  </li>
            <li> I feel that my face has become drier than normal this winter and no matter what I tried,  nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I received Serumtologie cream a few days ago and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> so I am always hesitant to try new products.</li>
            <li> I try something new</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and new products tend to make my face break out.</li>
            <li> I do live in Florida</li>
            <li> The packaging is high end and the interior lid has a  little handle for easy access.</li>
            <li> I spent most of my life outside.</li>
            <li> When putting it on, I first use the C 22 serum, let it dry and then apply the Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I just have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> very sensitive skin ans have not noticed any issues, or clogging of my pores.</li>
            <li> I love the whipped aspect &amp; I have to use very little.  </li>
            <li> My skin is usually on the dry side and this has made my skin looking good.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also really soft!</li>
            <li> My skin is mostly normal with a tendency to be sensitive depending on which wrinkle treatment</li>
            <li> My skin is looking better without any allergies what I usually get.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t sound like much, you only need a little amount for your whole face.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer itself is thick but goes on pretty smooth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also started using it on my super rough elbows and heels</li>
            <li> Putting just a little bit goes a long way because your face just feels smooth right after.</li>
            <li> The box is huge and last for very long time.</li>
            <li> PURE Whipped works especially well for me with serumtologie&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum 22.  </li>
            <li> Obviously I was not obligated to rate in any certain way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok non greasy, but no significant visual difference in skin after use.</li>
            <li> - Ihave a huge very dark spot on my hand that is now getting lighter and lighter  and soon will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is not heavy or oily.  </li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s lightly scented - and after a few moments the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> My face feels so soft afterwards</li>
            <li> it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week and my face feels soft.</li>
            <li> but yet it looks soft and dewey.</li>
            <li> Put it on every morning and it makes my face soft</li>
            <li> It leaves soft and velvety feel to my skin</li>
            <li> It is so light and fluffy...</li>
            <li> I am 50+ yeaars old.  </li>
            <li> But this cream make me feel moisture and soft.  </li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light and fluffy.</li>
            <li> Also there is no heavy smell, no eye burning , I use this on my lids as well.</li>
            <li> But I so mind looking old</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and supple for hours after application.  </li>
            <li> It makes my face feel moisturized all day and has not irritated my sensitive skin at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s silky soft and I look forward to putting it on.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> It seems like my skin is getting softer so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 6 days and can&#x27;t believe how baby soft my skin feels.  </li>
            <li> The ingredients are good, don&#x27;t get me wrong,</li>
            <li> Acts a a wonderful makeup base, does not leave you shiney but with a soft bit of dew on the skin.</li>
            <li> My skin tends not to absorb moisturizers well, but this one sinks right in.</li>
            <li> It went on smoothly, there is no strong smell</li>
            <li> My face was really dry in the winter and this is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This facial cream was recommended by a friend who is a couple of years older than me.</li>
            <li> I notice my pores is smaller and fine lines around my mouth is less visible</li>
            <li> I feel like I still need to apply more because my face feels a little dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this cream for younger women !</li>
            <li> I highly recommend the use of these products especially if you been searching high and low for these types of solutions to no avail.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I opened this generously sized (4oz) blue jar was the absence of color and fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I apply it morning and night but can be applied more for dry skin because it isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> However, the product has been exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It dries matte and absorbs quickly while still being very hydrating , a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I am 44 and have been using the Serumtologie C Serum 22 with PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily since mid November of 2014.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00QQIMZJO serumtologie® PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer Cream.</li>
            <li> B00QQIMZJO serumtologie® PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer Cream.</li>
            <li> My skin tends to become really dry or really oily.  </li>
            <li> I am very picky when it comes to facial lotions especially with having combination skin.</li>
            <li> After I use Serumtologie pure whipped chiffon moisturizer cream 2-3 days,  I feel my skin keep soft longer than other cream.  </li>
            <li> very dry skin was still very moist.</li>
            <li> and I expect to see some results due to the number of positive reviews these products have received.  </li>
            <li> I was in complete shock that a moisturizer can actually do its job without making me feel and look greasy.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how the longterm effects will be just yet, but I can say that the cream left my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> I was fishing with my brother when I was old enough to follow him around.</li>
            <li> This whipped chiffon is really thick, but once you put it on it absorbs really well, keeping skin really hydrate and soft.</li>
            <li> Not dry</li>
            <li> I wash my face first and leave it a little damp.</li>
            <li> I use Ponds daily moisturizer every day, but, I have to say this is much softer  than the other one.</li>
            <li> I have used it for 30 straight days and noticed my skin is not as dry and small light wrinkles are less noticeable.</li>
            <li> but again it depends where you live ( for the states with minus temperatures</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have natural dry skin with an oily T-zone.</li>
            <li> I havnt used it long enough to know if it does the job of reducing wrinkles,  but it makes my skin so soft and hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> I live in a very dry climate and am approaching</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I also have noticed a slight decrease in acne scars on my face but nothing too dramatic, but I definitely noticed that my face is much more evened out and clearer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant with trying new moisturizers because I&#x27;m scared of that &amp;#34;oily&#x27; feeling that other moisturizers leave.  </li>
            <li> I am an active 66 year old/really young male.</li>
            <li> This cream is nearly scentless which I like when I am putting other scented items on.</li>
            <li> Initially your face feels a little dry after you put it on, but soon after it feels very silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also gentle enough for my sensitive skin and feels cooling with a little wake-me-up zing to it (probably the green tea ingredient).</li>
            <li> A tiny bit goes a very long way, Extremely long lasting, plumping,very very moisturising without that heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> - it does not make my face &#x27;sweat&#x27; with heavy grease - it is light and fluffy but does ease my very dry aging skin.</li>
            <li> I did have a dark sun spot the size of a dime on my cheek, but it has almost completely disappeared.</li>
            <li> I have now purchased my second jar, and it lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t feel I have been using it long enough to give my &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Total effects has helped bring a softness back that had been missing far too long.</li>
            <li> 6 hours later, my skin is still so soft, without the dryness that usually comes after about an hour with my more expensive creams.</li>
            <li> especially luxurious and silky for dry under eye area.  </li>
            <li> However, it wasn&#x27;t moisturing enough for my dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to others who are looking for a new product that keeps your face moisturized without leaving a heavy and oily residue!</li>
            <li> and I could see that I was starting to loose the battle.</li>
            <li> The reality of this moisturizer is that it goes on without being greasy and it does help retain moisture long term in my skin.</li>
            <li> I spent my teen age years baking in the sun smothered with baby oil.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It has been my go to cream everyday so far.</li>
            <li> but it, along with several others that have now found their way into my &amp;#34;Anti-Aging Graveyard Medicine Cabinet,&amp;#34; left my skin slightly oily and shiny looking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; Little did he know that it was not due to his product that I had stopped after finding PWC.</li>
            <li> It doesn’t leave it greasy, and it doesn’t dry my skin out.  </li>
            <li> I have lots of dry skin that will use this for.  </li>
            <li> Too dry .</li>
            <li> 10 minutes after I apply it, the skin feels so parched and dry</li>
            <li> One of the reasons I started looking for a better cream than my previous over the counter product was because my neck was starting to look like the skin of a plucked chicken.</li>
            <li> I am 65, with dry skin and wrinkles around my eyes, mouth and creases on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I always feel my face so dry.  </li>
            <li> I gave to my sister with really dry skin</li>
            <li> Within 3 weeks,  this product has softened the wrinkles and moisturized the dry areas around my mouth.</li>
            <li> and  get dry patches.</li>
            <li> this moisturizer was a whipped creamy consistency but my skin felt dry after using it</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way so this size bottle will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> My skin was very dry, so I switched to this lotion.</li>
            <li> The lotion is very dry and doesn&#x27;t do any of the benefits that were mentioned in the product description.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> The reason for the upgrade is after using other moisturizers for so long</li>
            <li> I have been using the Whipped Chiffon Daily for about a month and cannot get over how little you need to apply.</li>
            <li> but I did not really like the smell.</li>
            <li> It neither makes my skin feel oily or dry and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long ways with this product..</li>
            <li> Is not greasy and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> In fact, my face feels dry, or sort of tight, after using it.</li>
            <li> very similar to the olay brand that she usually buys.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need to use a very small amount, as it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The reasons for the five star rating are due to their customer service.</li>
            <li> I do use serums containing Vitamin C and hyraluranic acid among other things</li>
            <li> I had tried c serum from other companies but was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> A small scar on my nose is only seen&lt;</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Within a few days all traces of both Dry and Oil had disappeared and have left me with a softly glowing, radiant mug that random strangers are drawn to touch (not really, but it IS Skin sooo</li>
            <li> I have spent a little fortune in the process.</li>
            <li> None of them kept the wrinkles and freckles or dark spots away.  </li>
            <li> The freckles and dark spots are gone</li>
            <li> The product is so thick and dies not contain a lot of extra water as filler</li>
            <li> /&gt;I discovered a Moisturizer that handled my newly acquired Middle Aged (I just turned 40) curious and annoying combination of Oily and Dry Skin on my face with care and grace.</li>
            <li> The one down side is that it comes in a jar rather than a pump.  </li>
            <li> It feels so heavenly putting it on - and you only need a very small amount.  </li>
            <li> Previous review:  </li>
            <li> I typically use this moisturizer in the morning after a shower.</li>
            <li> what I read and understood by using this product I would notice less lines in area</li>
            <li> My skin felt tight and it had a slight tingle for a couple minutes.</li>
            <li> serum reacted immediately making my face feel tight.</li>
            <li> and I felt like my face was hydrated in as little as a week of using it.</li>
            <li> Due to the consistency of this product serumtologie may want to consider providing a small paddle with each jar for product retrieval.</li>
            <li> I am not rich and I am a doctor phobic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a few days now</li>
            <li> We have been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> After it dried I used my Chiffon cream.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like heavy perfumes in any cosmetics.</li>
            <li> Non greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> No more brown spots, rashes but now a glowing and tight complexion.</li>
            <li> By the way, my wife saw such dramatic results with my skin</li>
            <li> However, my skin is normally not a dry type but the cream has been unable to retain moisture.</li>
            <li> Also, a little goes a loooong way!</li>
            <li> This is a little thick for a daytime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> You need very little to moisturize face and neck.</li>
            <li> It is thick and luxurious but does not leave you feeling greasy or heavy.  </li>
            <li> I was a smoker for 16 years and still have some small wrinkles around my mouth, but the Serumtologie has reduced the size of them a lot.</li>
            <li> I tend to put globs of Olay on my face until my skin feels smooth and covered, but I always hated the feel of lotion on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not a magic potion, of course, but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday!</li>
            <li> The day I received this cream, I washed my face using my usual cleanser and applied the serumtologie cream.</li>
            <li> They are usually under 2 ounces.</li>
            <li> It goes on well, but I don&#x27;t feel it is as moisturizing as some other products I&#x27;ve tired in the past.</li>
            <li> I got dry patches and unfortunately had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> I think with any beauty product you need to use it for at least a month if not longer.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine ANYONE not loving this cream.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the product to be so thick.  </li>
            <li> I just hate the feeling of something wet and creamy on my face, while having to wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> unfortunately, I just need something a little heavier.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very thick and luxurious.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky, greasy feeling behind.</li>
            <li> It softens my skin and leaves no residue behind.</li>
            <li> I just received my face cream and am very disappointed to see that the main oil used is Palm oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I thought it would work well to moisturize my face but ended up with dark, painful burn patches as a result.</li>
            <li> /o any difficultly.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> and I like that there is nothing artificial in it.</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this purchase and your face will thank you!</li>
            <li> Burned my skin so badly.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed in reviews that claimed there was a firming effect.</li>
            <li> Ive used a ton of moisturizers over the years from the inexpensive crap to Prevage.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve noticed it helps my base makeup stay on longer.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Ive used a ton of moisturizers over the years from the inexpensive crap to Prevage.  This one is different but in a good way.  The whipped chiffon texture is cool.  You can feel it working right away.  That said, for whatever reason this is an awesome product to take a dab of and work it through your hair as the consistency is similar to a high quality grooming cream.  I have no idea if I should be doing this but I&#x27;m a rebel.  Ha!  So I may buy it again as a hair product.  As a mid-range priced moisturizer, I&#x27;m not fully sold after two weeks of using it, since I could double up on Loreal&#x27;s VitaLift for men which is excellent at the price point.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product a couple weeks. It&#x27;s not BAD, but I definitely do not find it to be moisturizing. In fact, my face feels dry, or sort of tight, after using it. It is not creamy or light. I was really excited to use this product, but I&#x27;m underwhelmed</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this lotion. It glides on the skin and never feels greasy. It has made my skin feel very soft and smooth. The only thing I wish is that it had sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I overall liked the lotion, but the texture is kind of weird and I still cant get used to it.</li>
            <li> I am really picky about products I put on my skin.  I have very oily skin and very sensitive skin all at the same time.  I have used this product for two weeks and have to say that it is the perfect balance for my skin. It doesn’t leave it greasy, and it doesn’t dry my skin out.  It has just the right amount of moisture. I love that it’s natural and vegan and has improved the look of my skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Smells good and feels good</li>
            <li> This product seems to work well with most people.  My skin tends to become really dry or really oily.  I was looking for a product that can help moisturize my skin and give me a glow.  The company is great at addressing my problems.  Try it out!</li>
            <li> Had a drying effect. Would not use again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nourishing towards my face!! Love it!! This was part of a deeply discounted promotion.</li>
            <li> I love how moisturizing this cream is. It really helps to hydrate my sensitive skin without breaking me out or causing irritation. I&#x27;ve been using it on my face as well as my super dry hands (although it is kind of pricey to use on the hands); it soaks into the skin, rather than sitting on top of it, and doesn&#x27;t need constant reapplying, which is a nice bonus. I love that it has olive oil, aloe, &amp; shea butter as some of the ingredients and it is NOT tested on animals. I will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have lots of dry skin that will use this for.  I like that it is a big jar.</li>
            <li> realy great product, works well skin feels  soft and looks smooth and its a light not heavy cream</li>
            <li> Fabulously light and no greasy feeling. Penetrates into the skin so make up goes on&lt;br /&gt;w/o any difficultly.  I highly suggest this cream for younger women ! It is the perfect&lt;br /&gt;cream for all seasons but winter. A fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok non greasy, but no significant visual difference in skin after use.</li>
            <li> My face was really dry in the winter and this is exactly what I needed. This moisturizer was pretty lightweight  and I felt like my face was hydrated in as little as a week of using it. Love this product!</li>
            <li> WOW!! I used to use OleHenriksen Truth Creme Advanced Hydration exclusively along with their Truth Serum Vitamin C Serum. It&#x27;s a great moisturizer but it, along with several others that have now found their way into my &amp;#34;Anti-Aging Graveyard Medicine Cabinet,&amp;#34; left my skin slightly oily and shiny looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After lots of research and review reading, I decided to try the Serumtologie Whipped Moisturizer and Vitamin C Serum. After the very first application, my face felt AMAZINGLY smooth! I was in complete shock that a moisturizer can actually do its job without making me feel and look greasy. My skin felt tight and it had a slight tingle for a couple minutes. The moisturizer absorbed completely after lightly rubbing it in. I took some before pictures so I can wait to see the 30/60/90 day results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;m in love with Serumtologie and if it does what it says it will, then I&#x27;ll be a repeat customer for a long time!</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  Good moisturizing without a shine or greasy look.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this by a friend over 60. I am over 70 and my skin has never looked better. I am using with Vitamin C Serum 22.</li>
            <li> Love this! The texture is heavenly, and makes my skin feel silky smooth after application. Only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because I didn&#x27;t like the fragrance of the product. It smelt sort of clinical if that makes any sense. Reguardless of smell though I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> This is wonderful..immediately felt a difference..it felt hydrated and lasted all day.</li>
            <li> So you&#x27;re considering purchasing serumtologie&#x27;s PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer? Well let me tell you my personal experience with this product before you make your decision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you open the jar you have an immediate, childlike desire to dip your fingers into the creamy-fluffy, icing like texture of the Moisturizer... And lick them, because the scent is light, delicious and lovely. Something good enough to eat surely is good enough to apply to the delicate skin on your face, no? I think Yes. I did it.&lt;br /&gt;I discovered a Moisturizer that handled my newly acquired Middle Aged (I just turned 40) curious and annoying combination of Oily and Dry Skin on my face with care and grace. Within a few days all traces of both Dry and Oil had disappeared and have left me with a softly glowing, radiant mug that random strangers are drawn to touch (not really, but it IS Skin sooo soft!).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thankful and pleased for the opportunity to try this product to review and think you will be satisfied with your results also.</li>
            <li> I liked this product and yes it is smooth and goes on with no film or heavy feeling of your pores being clogged up I Guess that I am use to a thicker facial moisturiser than this one is and I felt the need to use another one at times that my skin felt drier.  I still use this on days I just need a light moisturiser and with that I WILL add that this is a great lotion for people that don&amp;#34;t need extra help.</li>
            <li> First off I was given this product at a reduced rate for my review.  This is light amazing cream and I could see a difference in my skin after the first week I will defiantly by using this from now on.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for one month after switching from a high end pricey cream.  I had so wanted this one to be as effective? It isn&#x27;t and I will be switching back to PR  or continue the search for yet another product?</li>
            <li> This feels so good on my face! It&#x27;s not greasy like some moisturizer and has no perfumy smell. I have very sensitive skin and this is one product that I can use daily with no irritation. Skin feels instantly hydrated and cool. vegan formula and no animal testing makes it just perfect. I truly love this moisturizer</li>
            <li> Lovely and super hydrating on sensitive and very dry skin ....especially luxurious and silky for dry under eye area.  Love this stuff ;) HIGHLY  recommend for especially aging and retin A users.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It feels great on my skin.  It is not heavy or oily.  The whipped consistency is really nice.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> From Tucson, AZ&lt;br /&gt;I was really excited to try out this whipped moisturizer as I have never used a whipped formula. When I opened the container, the cream looked and felt like whip cream on my fingers. I first thought this moisturizer would be a lot more creamier when you put it on your face, but it comes on really matte on your face but still a little creamy. I thought I had to apply more because it made my face matte and I wasn&#x27;t aware if it was moisturizing but you actually don&#x27;t need a lot for your face to be moisturized! It keeps my face matte and moisturized! I also have noticed a slight decrease in acne scars on my face but nothing too dramatic, but I definitely noticed that my face is much more evened out and clearer! I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Great feeling product! So far I love it!</li>
            <li> I just received this product today.  I can&#x27;t say how the longterm effects will be just yet, but I can say that the cream left my skin so soft.  It&#x27;s a good consistency.  It also isn&#x27;t heavily perfumed, so that is a HUGE plus!</li>
            <li> Thought this might be one of those products where they pay for good reviews. Nope. This is just awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> First of all, I was given this product to sample by a classmate who asked me to try it. That being said, I also don&#x27;t moisturize my face much - unless it&#x27;s winter. But, I would use this product again for a couple of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;1. It really does do an excellent job of moisturizing - and feels light on your face.&lt;br /&gt;2. It is vegan and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has a very nice, simple, and fresh smell. Plus, it&#x27;s lightly scented - and after a few moments the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> Soft scent, light to feel and helped my skin feel very smooth after first use.</li>
            <li> This is a great cream. It is light on the skin so there is no &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; feel like with some creams. Also, a little goes a loooong way! Has a light, clean scent. I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> Good product although I prefer a moisturizer with sunscreen....but Serumtologie serum is the GREATEST!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer.  It feels so heavenly putting it on - and you only need a very small amount.  I was very pleased to see how fast it absorbed and did not leave my skin feeling greasy.  I am very happy with this and I will be continuing on this for sure!</li>
            <li> What a great  product .ni love how it makes my skin feel. I havnt used it long enough to know if it does the job of reducing wrinkles,  but it makes my skin so soft and hydrated all day. Its even making my rough  elbows soft and im been searchingnforever for a product to do that. Recommended</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my face feels.  My wrinkles aren&#x27;t as noticeable.  Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Soft and light.  Goes on without a greasy feel.  My face feels so soft afterwards</li>
            <li> This is great,I love this product</li>
            <li> Smooth on my face. I love this serum!</li>
            <li> I very much like this product but like it in the following combination.....  C Serum 22, Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer, then Anthelios 60 Ultra Light Fluid Sunscreen.  Leaves my face feeling super soft but w/o the heaviness that is often associated w/ moisturizers and sunscreens.  I received the product as part of a promotion in return for my feedback and will very likely continue using it for daytime.  I like something a little more hydrating for nights.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is excellent! It does not sting or burn. I mix it with TiZO3 sunscreen for daytime use and I use it over this company&#x27;s serum at night. Both are great! Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is one perfect moisturizer  and will make you so happy after is applied , your skin just sucks it up and feels like baby skin . Thank you for the wonderful creation .</li>
            <li> Omg, my skin feels amazing since using this!! I use this everyday and have gotten so many compliments on my skin lately. My skin feels so smooth and soft. It absorbs well into the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave any sticky, greasy feeling behind. You don&#x27;t have to use much either so this should last you for a bit. I love serumtologie products.</li>
            <li> I love this! it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and oily.</li>
            <li> I loved the instantaneous silky moisture I felt when applied to my face.  Nice, light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Wife loved it and looks great.</li>
            <li> I got this moisturizer in a promotion and I love it. I am very picky when it comes to facial lotions especially with having combination skin. This lotion is very light, not oily, and doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. It gives the perfect amount of moisture even when applying make up afterwards. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I regret that you returned my money. I have been using the cream on my neck and throat and it is fine there. I just have very sensitive skin and it did not work on my face. I would be fine if you would put through a charge since I am using the product to some degree.</li>
            <li> I received this full size jar FREE as a promotional trial and I really like this product.  It is very light and easy to apply to your skin and you can feel the moisture in it as you apply it.  It very quickly absorbs and does not leave a greasy feel to your skin.  Because it is whipped, you don&#x27;t need very much for your whole face and neck.  I recommend this product.......</li>
            <li> This creme is AKAZING..I am amazed at how nice it makes my face feel and the results are very noticable. .Please give this creme a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of this moisturizer .</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product. The more I use it the more results I get! Would recommend highly</li>
            <li> I am 65 and bought this along with the Serumtologie C serum 22.and it is wonderful! It neither makes my skin feel oily or dry and a little goes a long way! It has a nice texture that is different than anything I&#x27;ve used before. My skin feels firmer and I&#x27;ve noticed it helps my base makeup stay on longer. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is not a bad product, but I am not blown away by it either. As everyone else has said, it is not greasy. It goes on well, but I don&#x27;t feel it is as moisturizing as some other products I&#x27;ve tired in the past. This is definitely not a go-to, must-have staple product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the packaging and the welcome card that greeted me upon opening the box. That was a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say try it out for yourself. I cannot give it a whole-hearted recommendation, but it&#x27;s ok. I wish I could say more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serumtologie provide this sample for testing and review with no guarantee of a favorable review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I continue to use this moisturizer and I am really starting to like it so I am am upgrading to 4 stars. The reason for the upgrade is after using other moisturizers for so long I think I just became accustomed to how I &amp;#34;thought&amp;#34; moisturizers should feel. The reality of this moisturizer is that it goes on without being greasy and it does help retain moisture long term in my skin. Honestly what may have helped is I am also using some serums that are light exfoliators which may be allowing this cream to penetrate my skin better. I just know that this product is working nicely whether I am wearing makeup or not.</li>
            <li> Too dry . Not moisturizing .</li>
            <li> Feels really light to face</li>
            <li> Previous review:  I didn&#x27;t expect the product to be so thick.  Not something I can use on my face.  After running out of my regular facial moisturizer I figured I should give this one a try just in case.  I have to admit, looks can certainly be deceiving.  While the appearance of this looks like something that would break my very sensitive skin out, I&#x27;ve had no problems and actually love the lotion.  It&#x27;s been a week now.  It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery. Haven&#x27;t used this item yet, but looking forward to it since I LOVE their Vitamin C serum:) Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a little thick for a daytime moisturizer. I would suggest using it at night if you have oily skin.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week and my face feels soft. Love this product! I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> When it is first applied, it feels very nice on the skin and seems to have a good amount of moisture. As everyone else has said, it is non-greasy and feels good on the skin. However, my skin is normally not a dry type but the cream has been unable to retain moisture. 10 minutes after I apply it, the skin feels so parched and dry (more so than before I apply it), so I have gotten in a habit of always putting on another layer of ultra-moisturizing lotion on top to balance it out. Considering how well it has worked for others, perhaps it is just not for me.</li>
            <li> Great items. my mom loves it. very similar to the olay brand that she usually buys.</li>
            <li> WOW - I had no idea how good a moisturizer could feel until I tried Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer by Serumtologie. I love the whipped texture and I think of it as my morning &amp;#34;drink of moisture&amp;#34; for my face. I feel so refreshed and ready to face the day after applying this moisturizer. It&#x27;s also gentle enough for my sensitive skin and feels cooling with a little wake-me-up zing to it (probably the green tea ingredient). I highly recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, shipped extremely fast&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is great as a morning moisturizer, before makeup type of moisturizer. It dries matte and absorbs quickly while still being very hydrating , a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Product is very light and goes onto and into the skin perfectly</li>
            <li> I love Serumtologie!  Not only does it work to improve skin texture and reduce the appearance of wrinkles, it&#x27;s non toxic.  I also love the fact that it is reasonably priced compared to similar products.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> love it! smells good! and itsnt too strong! also you dont need to use alot.. a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This cream is nearly scentless which I like when I am putting other scented items on. It is smooth and silky and dries quickly. It softens my face and makes applying make up easier. It also seems to stay put and definitely lasts all day.  A little goes a long ways with this product.. Love it!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! I used it at night with a vitamin C serum.  It&#x27;s a great product that feels &amp;#34;light&amp;#34; but is also very effective in keeping my skin moisturized.  I&#x27;m always hesitant with trying new moisturizers because I&#x27;m scared of that &amp;#34;oily&#x27; feeling that other moisturizers leave.  However, this product does not leave that heavy oily feeling on your face and that&#x27;s what I LOVE about this product!! The one down side is that it comes in a jar rather than a pump.  I prefer to use a &amp;#34;pump&amp;#34; style versus in a jar, since bacteria is more likely to enter the jar from opening and closing it than through a pump.  I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to others who are looking for a new product that keeps your face moisturized without leaving a heavy and oily residue!</li>
            <li> I am a face cream junkie and I fell in love with this one.  It applies so smoothly and absorbs nicely without leaving a greasy residue but a nice glow. My skin feels hydrated all day.</li>
            <li> This facial moisturizer is really great for any part of the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not greasy at all and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the consistency of whipped cream or a light soufflé.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need to use a very small amount, as it goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a faint pleasant smell, but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming in any way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, my girlfriend loves this moisturizer, especially for her neck.</li>
            <li> Great consistency and texture! Good for winter months!!</li>
            <li> This whipped facial moisturizer is amazing. I&#x27;m so happy it&#x27;s not greasy, especially since I have oily skin. I&#x27;ve applied this on my face before putting my makeup on and haven&#x27;t had a shiny face and it&#x27;s been humid in California this summer. I honestly don&#x27;t know if this product was meant to reduce oiliness of the skin but it has for me. In addition to that, it&#x27;s been an awesome moisturizer. The moisturizer itself is thick but goes on pretty smooth and it has no scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it worth it....yes&lt;br /&gt;Would I purchase again....yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> What a fabulous moisturizer!!! It goes on so smoothly and is so light and absorbing.Your face doesn&#x27;t become shiny by the end of the day but yet it looks soft and dewey. Love my new product and it has become my one and only moisturizer for daytime.</li>
            <li> This is a very soft and fast absorbing moisturizer. It smells amazing.  Got as sample to review.</li>
            <li> Love this!!  Put it on every morning and it makes my face soft and it really does feel tighter &#x27;</li>
            <li> My skin was very dry, so I switched to this lotion.My face feels smooth and a bit more hydrated than before, but it should be a lot more hydrated from this product. Could be better, but it works alright.</li>
            <li> Softest skin ever!  I reordered this product at a great price and see the difference in my skin texture every day!</li>
            <li> WOW! I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how great your product is. I am an active 66 year old/really young male. Before I found your product I used Kheils for many years. What I didn&#x27;t realize is that the Kheils products I was using were drying out my skin to the point where eventually I had to visit a dermatologist.I got off Kheils products and was put on some topical medications to correct the many rashes that had developed. Next step was the plastic surgeons office where they put me on a regiment to correct the problem somewhat. Then came PWC! After the first application I knew the light and moist cream was just what my skin needed. It has been about 4 months that I have been using PWC and the results are miraculous! As a matter of fact I stopped in to the plastic surgeons office to pick up a product and the doctor looked at me and said &amp;#34; I very seldom give compliments on patients but your skin looks fantastic&amp;#34; Little did he know that it was not due to his product that I had stopped after finding PWC. No more brown spots, rashes but now a glowing and tight complexion. People have asked..&amp;#34;did you have something done?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for developing such a wonderful product that I will continue to use. By the way, my wife saw such dramatic results with my skin she now is using it.</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Very impressed with the look of the product and it was packaged well. I am very happy with the results so far.  I have been putting the lotion on my neck as well as face and have noticed a definite improvement.  It smoothed out the lines in my face and actually tightened my neck resulting in a much younger looking me. The quality of your ingredients is as good (if not better) than Lancome and I have been using Lancome for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product to a friend.  Your description of the product on Amazon is what convinced me to give it a try. Thank you for making a lotion that actually does what the description claims it will do!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer and not greasy at all! I like it much better than some of the other moisturizers I&#x27;ve used and I like the ingredients used.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY love this product. It was given to me for free or either at a substantial discount, in which I have to give my honest feedback.&lt;br /&gt;I just tried this &amp; I have to say it&#x27;s the best i have ever tried. I use Ponds daily moisturizer every day, but, I have to say this is much softer  than the other one. I love the whipped aspect &amp; I have to use very little.  Definitely will re order</li>
            <li> I purchased the vitamin C serum and was given this on a free trial.  It pairs nicely with the serum and feels great on your skin!  It is thick and luxurious but does not leave you feeling greasy or heavy.  I would definitely purchase!</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this more than 3 stars but after using this a few times now, it just does not seem to give me the moisture I need. I do however feel like this would be a great moisturizer to use during the summertime. With it being winter now I feel like I still need to apply more because my face feels a little dry afterwards. It is light, non scented and it absorbs very quickly into my skin. Since I have 2 of these I will try this again when the weather gets warmer and I will provide another update then.  Update: 6/15 - I&#x27;ve been using this for some time now and it is definitely a good moisturizer to use in the warmer months so I&#x27;ve added another star.</li>
            <li> The first thing I consider when I pick any skin product is ingredients. I don’t want any chemical stuff to go on my skin and would rather have nothing. The list of ingredients for this product is great and just for that I will give four stars. I like how light this cream feels on my face. It leaves soft and velvety feel to my skin and I love it! So that makes it five stars. Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> I have dry and sensitive skin so I am always hesitant to try new products. This cream has a pleasant minimal fragrance and did not break me out as some products do. However, it wasn&#x27;t moisturing enough for my dry skin. I got dry patches and unfortunately had to stop using it.</li>
            <li> soft cool cream. Overallt great product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is great!  Even for my oily skin.  It is so light and fluffy... I don&#x27;t feel like I have anything on and my skin is looking great! I definitely recommend this moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Do not like the way my face feels after application.  Feels like I still need to apply a moisturizer</li>
            <li> Different but good consistency.  It goes on well and I like the results</li>
            <li> So light going on. Feels great</li>
            <li> The lotion is very dry and doesn&#x27;t do any of the benefits that were mentioned in the product description.</li>
            <li> moisturizing and feels good on skin</li>
            <li> I received it within 2 days.  I am using it daily but have not seen any results yet.  It has only been a week.</li>
            <li> I just received my face cream and am very disappointed to see that the main oil used is Palm oil. Not only is using it environmentally insensitive to the issues about palm oil and the destruction to rain forest habitat it causes, but the oil is the cheapest oil a product can contain. The fact that this high end line would choose Palm oil changes my opinion of Serumtologie and I will not be ordering any of their products again.</li>
            <li> The Serumtologie products used in combination are amazing! I am 44 and have been using the Serumtologie C Serum 22 with PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily since mid November of 2014. The fine lines on my forehead, my crows feet, and laugh/frown lines at my mouth are gone. One of the reasons I started looking for a better cream than my previous over the counter product was because my neck was starting to look like the skin of a plucked chicken. I am very happy to say that Serumtologie has taken care of that! I was a smoker for 16 years and still have some small wrinkles around my mouth, but the Serumtologie has reduced the size of them a lot. I am positive that with continued use, they will be gone too. I did have a dark sun spot the size of a dime on my cheek, but it has almost completely disappeared. It also works great making my hands look young again. I am a huge fan, but the best part is that this stuff lasts because a little bit goes a long way. It has been 8 months and I&#x27;m only opening my second container.</li>
            <li> Light weight moisturizer without a greasy feel. I will be a repeat customer.</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizing cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this with a discount code but I did not really like the smell. It is very soft on the skin and feels good.</li>
            <li> Thus stuff is amazing! My skin looks really vibrant and fresh. It&#x27;s also really soft! I like this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Per Amazon policy I received a coupon to review this product. It in no way has effected my opinions.</li>
            <li> Wonderful feeling cream!! I&#x27;ve only used it For a week so I&#x27;ll give an update in a couple of months. I&#x27;m using it with the facial serum by the same company. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell, I like that!!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer.  I am allergic to artificial fragrances, so this one fits the bill perfectly.  It is a wonderful creamy moisturizer, without feeling the least bit oily/greasy.  You will not be disappointed in this product.  I have now purchased my second jar, and it lasts a long time too.</li>
            <li> This product has a wonderful feel to it. Very creamy, soft, and light. It absorbs quickly and works well. I received a free sample of this product to test but the opinion is my own.</li>
            <li> OUTSTANDING!!! Just love this Product, has to be the Best on the Market!</li>
            <li> I am always looking for anti wrinkle creams. When I noticed a discount for this cream, I ordered it right away. It went on smoothly, there is no strong smell and it seems to reduce my fine lines. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f30df49e18a8dd6649216734f0ef67fe]] [[ASIN:B00QQIMZJO serumtologie® PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer Cream. New Formula! Huge 4 OZ Jar.]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I was very excited to unbox the Serumtologie Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer Cream today because of all the good reviews on Amazon. Opening boxes are so much fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a cute yellow box, which had the Minions (promoting the Minion&#x27;s movie) on it. The box was packed with large, protection air packets. The moisturizer came in a smaller box with the name of the product, ingredients, directions, and a description of the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the white box, a pamphlet is included to give a description of the moisturizer, key benefits, and how each feature ingredient is beneficial for the face. The Serumtologie Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer came in a 4 oz., beautiful dark blue container with a silver cap. No animals were tested. The moisturizer is vegan, paraben free, and the ingredients were written on the side of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the item itself, the moisturizer was white with a very light fragrance (fragrance free). This is beneficial for anyone who might be allergic to strong smelling lotions because you really have to put it up to your nose to smell the scent. The product is said to be \\&quot;light-as-air,\\&quot; which is completely true. I use Olay on a daily basis, which has a thicker, creamier feel. I have natural dry skin with an oily T-zone. I tend to put globs of Olay on my face until my skin feels smooth and covered, but I always hated the feel of lotion on my face. I just hate the feeling of something wet and creamy on my face, while having to wait for it to dry. But this moisturizer was non-greasy and LIGHT! When I first put it on, I thought I didn&#x27;t put anything on. Putting just a little bit goes a long way because your face just feels smooth right after. Even though 4 oz. doesn&#x27;t sound like much, you only need a little amount for your whole face. Unlike before, I kept putting on lotion until my face felt smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my face and put on the moisturizer in the morning and night only. I feel smooth and moisturized for the entire day, don&#x27;t need to reapply at any time of the day (But it is recommended to put on sunscreen if you plan to go out, since this moisturizer does not include SPF). The Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer is hypoallergenic, doesn&#x27;t clog pores, and does not leave my face shiny at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not use this moisturizer with their serumtologie C serum 22. Overall, the moisturizer came as described on Amazon. It made my skin smooth and soft, while feeling light on the face as if nothing was there. This moisturizer will change how you look and feel. It is a great gift for family and friends!</li>
            <li> In June I received this free jar of reformulated PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer (PURE Whipped) from serumtologie with a request to give an honest and fair review of the product.  I have been using PURE Whipped (overnight) for 4.5 weeks.  My skin is mostly normal with a tendency to be sensitive depending on which wrinkle treatment I&#x27;m using at the time.  The first thing I noticed when I opened this generously sized (4oz) blue jar was the absence of color and fragrance.  A real plus for me.   I&#x27;ve noticed the product isn&#x27;t immediately absorbed into the skin, but rather appears as an opaque finish while it soothes and hydrates, before finally disappearing into the skin.  It may be that I&#x27;m using too much product at times.  I do love the soothing and healing quality of this cream&#x27;s first ingredient (Organic Aloe Vera).  PURE Whipped works especially well for me with serumtologie&#x27;s Vitamin C Serum 22.  Due to the consistency of this product serumtologie may want to consider providing a small paddle with each jar for product retrieval.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I like it much more than many I&#x27;ve tried - it does not make my face &#x27;sweat&#x27; with heavy grease - it is light and fluffy but does ease my very dry aging skin. Here in the South we struggle with humidity, so this is a big deal to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not a magic potion, of course, but I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Along with the AWESOME SERUM this PACKED w/THE BEST INGREDIENTS out there....is a GREAT combo!! You can not go wrong using this great BRAND! The quality, price AND CUSTOMER SERVICE is the best out here! This product WILL BE going places😊!!!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is light and breathable. It feel great on my skin. It is not at all sticky,great for the summer heat.</li>
            <li> I love a product that is moisturizing without being too greasy. Health issues had robbed me of my moisture Total effects has helped bring a softness back that had been missing far too long.</li>
            <li> Not greasy..my face feels good</li>
            <li> Love it. I use it everyday! It&#x27;s not oily and leaves my skin really smooth.</li>
            <li> This facial cream was recommended by a friend who is a couple of years older than me. I decided to try the cream, as I had been using several name brand creams that cost far more. I am 65, with dry skin and wrinkles around my eyes, mouth and creases on my forehead. The day I received this cream, I washed my face using my usual cleanser and applied the serumtologie cream. The feel of the cream was heavenly. It absorbed quickly and left my face soft with visibly fewer lines. 6 hours later, my skin is still so soft, without the dryness that usually comes after about an hour with my more expensive creams. It is wonderful!</li>
            <li> I really like the product and I am using it religiously. The results are very good. My skin is looking better without any allergies what I usually get. The box is huge and last for very long time. You need very little to moisturize face and neck. It does feel like chiffon on the skin. I recommended the product to many friends. Customer service is very good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, A.P.</li>
            <li> I gave it five stars which may be misleading for the moment. First I must tell you I relieved this product for free. The reasons for the five star rating are due to their customer service. ABSOLUTLEY. Outstanding. The product doesn&#x27;t have a smell (which I love) it&#x27;s thick and creamy, perfect for night routines. I don&#x27;t use this in the morning because it makes my skin a tad bit shiny.  However I don&#x27;t feel I have been using it long enough to give my &amp;#34;expert&amp;#34; opinion. I think with any beauty product you need to use it for at least a month if not longer.  However, the product has been exactly what I expected. I don&#x27;t know though that I would pay the original retail price for it.  I will follow up with another review in about three weeks when I have been using the cream for over a month</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s perfect for summer months - it is really light textured, in the winter it may not be enough if you have dry skin. My skin tends not to absorb moisturizers well, but this one sinks right in. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> I really like how light but moisturizing this cream feels. It has no fragrance from what I can tell, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Comes in a sturdy jar with an extra plastic cover underneath the lid. Personally I really liked the packaging and was very impressed by the quality of this cream.</li>
            <li> I have dry sensitive skin and this product is wonderful!  I use both the serum and the chiffon moisturizer and they work beautifully.  My skin drinks in the product and is left hydrated but not oily or sticky. Best of all; my makeup glides on effortlessly and stays radiant all day long.  Definitely a Must-Have for me.  Love this product!!!</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion....I purchased on a Lightening Deal so the price was excellent.  The feel of it is very luxurious....really light on your face and neck.  I do think I see improvement on my neck sagging.  One thing to note, this doesn&#x27;t contain any sunscreen so I use it at night before bed and use a retinol creme in the morning before going out.</li>
            <li> I just received this product after finding a coupon and I am eager to use it. I have tried it for the last week once per day and so far so good- my skin feels smooth and it does not have a sticky feeling like some creams. The packaging is so beautiful and makes the product look expensive. I will update my review after 30 days to see what the difference is if any.</li>
            <li> Love this moisturizer! It&#x27;s airy light! Love that luxury looking container too. New discovery of a good cosmetic brand.</li>
            <li> After I use Serumtologie pure whipped chiffon moisturizer cream 2-3 days,  I feel my skin keep soft longer than other cream.  May I am 50+ yeaars old.  I always feel my face so dry.  But this cream make me feel moisture and soft.  Thanks! I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCTS AT DISCOUNT PRICE IN EXCHANGE MY REVIEW.</li>
            <li> These has really made my skin glow.  I used it on my face, neck and elbows.  I wear it under my make up and it seems to help my foundation go on better and stay.  Definitely buying this again. **edit to my original review - I started breaking out and had to discontinue this product. I gave to my sister with really dry skin and she loves it and had no problems, but I have comb skin and think it was clogging my pores.**</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin. I break out EVERYTIME I try something new and I can&#x27;t afford to have that especially on my face!! The first thing I looked for the product was the organic natural ingredients. It&#x27;s important to me to use more natural products because the more chemicals you put on your skin, the more sensitive it gets. I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a few days now and it&#x27;s only improving my skin! I noticed it making my face brighter! Also It goes on very smooth and you don&#x27;t even have to use a lot. I could tell this would last me awhile. I LOVE this moisturizer and would definitely repurchase this! This was a good buy :)</li>
            <li> Very happy with this moisturizer.  No greasy feel.  Absorbs quickly and the softness lasts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it. It is light enough that i can put it on liberally without being greasy or oily at all (and i&#x27;m sensitive to oily products) and it wakes my face up by making my skin feel tighter after i use it. I also love that the ingredient list is simple and each item&#x27;s purpose is explained. Highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> This is like HEAVEN in a jar, really. I love the texture of this. It&#x27;s so light and fluffy. It is hydrating, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make my oily skin greasy or breakout. Fragrance free as well which is always a plus in my book.</li>
            <li> I enjoy having this product in my routine. I typically use this moisturizer in the morning after a shower. It&#x27;s great after the sauna or steam room also because it hydrates my skin instantly and absorbs nicely.The cream is not oily or heavy, which is a good thing and goes on light with no smell. I did notice that my skin looks refreshed when I use this in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer! Easy to apply, smells good and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. I&#x27;d recommend to others as well as repurchase.</li>
            <li> I use this with the Serumtologie C serum and it works great. My skin feels so soft and smooth. I&#x27;ve also started using it on my super rough elbows and heels and I&#x27;m starting to see some results. I have only been using a short time, but notice the benefits. I love that it&#x27;s fragrance free so even my husband has been able to use on some rough patches of skin. Since it was made with all skin types in mind, you won&#x27;t end up with breakouts on your face.</li>
            <li> Packing state of the product was better&lt;br /&gt;Although the purchase as my wife gifts,&lt;br /&gt;Although skin&#x27;s dry&lt;br /&gt;And to be effective in moisturizing force from using this product&lt;br /&gt;Next also likely be able to buy again</li>
            <li> I am a faithful serumtologie C serum user.  I tried the PURE whipped moisturizer because I believe in Vanessa&#x27;s products; however, it was too light for me and didn&#x27;t leave my skin hydrated.  It&#x27;s very light and feels great on - unfortunately, I just need something a little heavier.  Serumtologie provided tremendous customer support, as always.  They emailed me asking my opinion about the product and I told them. Theyprovided me a refund that same day!  I will continue to use Serumtologie products due to great products, the value, and customer support.</li>
            <li> I love this cream and seller has been helpful in how I use cream.</li>
            <li> This product was free to me. I love the whip texture and it makes my face super soft. I love it. It&#x27;s also not oily at all.</li>
            <li> This product is a nice addition to the serumtologie line. I use the serum and then apply the cream after it. After inquiring how I was enjoying the serum, I responded that I had to stop using it (for 3 weeks) because of a skin reaction (not the fault of this product) and they offered to send me a complimentary jar of the moisturizing cream. I am very impressed with the customer service.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quite fast! Just a day of using it I can feel the difference​ :)</li>
            <li> This cream is all natural and has a nice whipped consistency. It is light and airy and smells nice. It comes in a huge 4 ounce jar which I have never seen facial products come in. They are usually under 2 ounces. I love the consistency of this cream and I like that there is nothing artificial in it. However, the ingredients, while nourishing, really don&#x27;t target fine lines and other aging signs. They hydrate, which is a big part of looking youthful, but there aren&#x27;t antioxidants to ward off free radicals nor are there acids and vitamins that are proven to help with the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and sagging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a moisturizer, this one is good. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it doesn&#x27;t cause my skin any irritation. I have been using it more as a body butter than a face cream because I need certain ingredients in my creams. It works beautifully as a body butter. It softens my skin and leaves no residue behind. It&#x27;s light yet hydrating. For younger skin, this is great on the face. I am 50 and I look for certain ingredients that have been proven to work. I do use serums containing Vitamin C and hyraluranic acid among other things but I still need a heavier and more potent face cream. I will continue to use this beautifully whopped cream on my body and may buy more. It is definitely better than the chemical laden body butters I own now. I will also use it on my face from time to time as it does a nice job of hydrating without being greasy and and it is gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to go with my gut though and rate this 3 stars only because it doesn&#x27;t have what my aging skin needs to help hold back the ends of time. The ingredients are good, don&#x27;t get me wrong, just not what I personally look for in an anti aging facial cream. But for the body? It&#x27;s like buttah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for my evaluation and honest review. Obviously I was not obligated to rate in any certain way and I rated as I felt I should. However, I do recommend this cream to younger people who don&#x27;t need as many anti aging ingredients and to anyone who wants a great, natural body butter. It may also work for aging facial skin. I just like my creams to have a more proven ingredients in them. All natural though is very desirable and healthy.eople who don&#x27;t need as many anti aging ingredients and to anyone who wants a great, natural body butter. It may also work for aging facial skin.

            <li> Creamy. Smooth light. Great!</li>
            <li> As someone who has had 2 bouts with skin cancer a can tell you I am loving&lt;br /&gt;this product. I was looking for paraben free products and am so glad I came  across PWC.I&#x27;ve already noticed a difference...my comlexion looks brighter  and feels smoother.  I appreciate the prompt arrival of the  product and loved  the packaging.  I also appreciate you taking the time to&lt;br /&gt;check in and make sure your product is up to par.  I will be trying  the&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C serum 22 very soon.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have aging skin. I feel that my face has become drier than normal this winter and no matter what I tried,  nothing worked. Serumtologie worked!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick and luxurious.  I wash my face first and leave it a little damp. The product is so thick and dies not contain a lot of extra water as filler so I think a bit of water on your skin helps it absorb fully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an impressive product particularly at this low Amazon price! Definitely worth a try  I hope you have good results. I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> Love this face lotion, goes on smooth, not oily &amp; last. My skin looks younger. I use daily after I clean my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this a 5 star to begin with because I love their other product so well....Okay ladies, I&#x27;ve just ordered Whipped Chiffon Daily Moisturizer and haven&#x27;t received it yet but I want to say that I use their Serum and I LOVE it. I&#x27;ve been doing the search for the perfect face serum for a long time and I found it. Now I&#x27;m crossing my fingers on this moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;So, keep looking for my review when I start using this product and if it&#x27;s as good as their serum then you will hear from me.</li>
            <li> This is a nice light weight moisturizer and a little goes a long way.  Initially your face feels a little dry after you put it on, but soon after it feels very silky.</li>
            <li> great light cream. light. if you have a drier skin type, may need to use additional cream. I am still trying it out. I have been using clinique for 20 years.</li>
            <li> This is the lightest feeling moisturizer I have ever used. And combined with Sermtologie C serum 22 my skin is brighter and firmer.  I&#x27;m looking good these days.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the miracle in a jar.</li>
            <li> Soft creamy and makes your skin bright</li>
            <li> Nice texture and aroma.  Makeup goes over very nicely without beading up.  That&#x27;s about it.  Disappointed in reviews that claimed there was a firming effect. In my 60 days experience combined with serumtologie serum 22, there were no firming effects and no diminishing of fine lines.  They are very nicely textured products but the anti-aging benefits just aren&#x27;t there.</li>
            <li> I received Serumtologie cream a few days ago and I really love it.  I noticed that soon after I apply the moisturizer I get a wonderful tightening effect.  I apply it to my face, neck, décolletage and also the tops of my hands. I live in a very dry climate and am approaching 50 so when I wake up with glowing moisturized skin I am very happy!  I even have my husband using it and he really loves it too.</li>
            <li> VERY NICE PRODUCT, WORKS LIKE ADVERTISED</li>
            <li> The product is absolutely great</li>
            <li> This is a great whipped face cream. I can feel it tighten and it moisturizes well!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product but the whipped cream is thick for my skin.  This is more for folks with dry to extra dry skin, also good for your hands!</li>
            <li> A Dream Come true, The moisturiser is a wonderful product. I use it  with their fantastic C Serum , The New Cream is the lightest soufle of miracles. A tiny bit goes a very long way, Extremely long lasting, plumping,very very moisturising without that heavy feeling. Acts a a wonderful makeup base, does not leave you shiney but with a soft bit of dew on the skin. I put this on at 6am and at 9pm very dry skin was still very moist.I also have very sensitive skin ans have not noticed any issues, or clogging of my pores. I just love this product, Using both their C product with The whipped cream is a wonderful combo for a day night routine.Also there is no heavy smell, no eye burning , I use this on my lids as well. I would recommend[[ASIN:B00QQIMZJO serumtologie® PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily Facial Moisturizer Cream. New Formula! Huge 4 OZ Jar.]] this product highly over my 100.00 cream. As well as Its 4 ounces!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this moisturizer for about 1 1/2 weeks, both morning and night.  It is very light and melts into your skin...feels really great on the skin, as it is not greasy.  I also use the wonderful serumtologie C serum 22 and follow with this awesome moisturizer.  I have recently added an oil-free sunscreen on over the moisturizer before applying my makeup and am very happy with the results (using a sunscreen is always a good idea anyway!)  Overall I am very impressed with this line of skin care!  I think my skin looks better and firmer since using these products, and their customer service is exceptionally good!!  Thank you for your great products!!  Melissa Miles</li>
            <li> Goes on light, moisturizes just enough without making skin oily throughout the day!!!</li>
            <li> We have been using it for a few weeks. Excellent product. Texture and application are nice with no oily residue. Highly recommended . Well packaged in a beautiful jar</li>
            <li> I have received this product in exchange of a review.  I absolutely love this product!!  It does wonders on my face and feels so smooth.  Will order again!</li>
            <li> Well I have been using this product for 1 month I thought I could notice something but I am not, what I read and understood by using this product I would notice less lines in area applied  but I have not. I don&#x27;t think I would reorder this as of now.</li>
            <li> First of all let me tell you that I am 75 years old. I spent most of my life outside. I was fishing with my brother when I was old enough to follow him around. I spent my teen age years baking in the sun smothered with baby oil. I rode horses for 30 years and spent those and more years on a boat every weekend  with my family. I love the outside but I have fair freckled skin so I have always tried to keep up with the latest beauty &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; products. You name it I have used it. None of them kept the wrinkles and freckles or dark spots away.  I don&#x27;t mind being 75. I am very healthy and still like to be outside as much as possible. But I so mind looking old and I could see that I was starting to loose the battle. I have spent a little fortune in the process. Night cream, day cream, cover this cover that , mud masks whatever. I am not rich and I am a doctor phobic. So I saw this cream and decided to give it a try.  My last hope.  Here is what I found after just about one month.&lt;br /&gt;This cream settles right into your skin. No sticky greasy residue. Love that. It gives my face a nice smooth cool feeling . Not dry just comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;I liked that so I added C serum o22 also sold by serumtologie. I had tried c serum from other companies but was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;This serum reacted immediately making my face feel tight. After it dried I used my Chiffon cream. I swear I could feel it working.&lt;br /&gt;Now I do the same procedure morning and  night.  Simple - same cream day and night.  The only thing I have  added is  Neutrogena age shield sunscreen before I go outside. Be sure not to get that near your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;So now what do I see in the mirror ?  The large pores around my nose and chin have just disappeared. A small scar on my nose is only seen&lt;br /&gt;with my magnifier mirror.  The wrinkles have been greatly reduced as well as the dark circles  under my eyes.  I don&#x27;t even wear foundation anymore and I am proud of my skin. The freckles and dark spots are gone - Ihave a huge very dark spot on my hand that is now getting lighter and lighter  and soon will be gone.&lt;br /&gt;This company does a wonderful follow up .  I couldn&#x27;t be more happy.</li>
            <li> 5 stars.  Within 3 weeks,  this product has softened the wrinkles and moisturized the dry areas around my mouth.</li>
            <li> Really lovely light moisturiser that penetrates easily and does not clog the pores.&lt;br /&gt;It does work very well (for me) along with Serumtologie Vit C serum.&lt;br /&gt;Natural ingredients which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;Suits me very well as a day moisturiser ( maybe a bit too light for the night) but again it depends where you live ( for the states with minus temperatures&lt;br /&gt;during winter might be not enough but we have not too many of those).&lt;br /&gt;Fragrance free which is lovely too.&lt;br /&gt;Personally I have been enjoying it very much.</li>
            <li> You need to try this love it.</li>
            <li> Was amazed at how quickly this came in.  Was packaged nicely. I just received this product and was super excited to try it, been using the Serum for about a month now and love it as well.  This product goes on and feels wonderful on my skin, you only need a little bit and it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.  Can&#x27;t wait to see the results after I have been using for a longer period of time.  Thank you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This all natural/vegan/paraben free whipped moisturizer is so light &amp; fluffy but it actually hydrates &amp; leaves my face feeling smooth and moisturized!! I have very oily skin so I was hesitant to use in the AM, but it absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t create any excess shine or oils!!</li>
            <li> Decided to try this new product when I purchased another bottle of the C serum 22 (another very good product in the Serumtologie line).  I have been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and have been very pleased. Applies like a dream and absorbs quickly with no residue. My skin is soft and supple for hours after application.  The fact that it is fragrance free is a real plus for me as well.</li>
            <li> I love this Moisturizer it is so light and creamy. My face has never felt so smooth and hydrated. I love this moisturizer. I will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin. I was scared to use it.  But,  I&#x27;m glad I did.  It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  My favorite part is the texture and it feels great on my face. Great product!</li>
            <li> The moisturizer is like meringue, it goes on smoothly and my skin just soaks it up I love it. It&#x27;s light and airy and my make up goes on perfectly over it. Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> I received my package which was very nice and easy to open. I have used it twice a day immediately after washing my face in the morning and in the evening before bedtime. There is a very light fragrance which I like. I don&#x27;t like heavy perfumes in any cosmetics. The silkiness of this moisturizer is phenominal and very light. I do not feel a heaviness or an oily film. It makes my face feel moisturized all day and has not irritated my sensitive skin at all. It has been great under my mineral makeup, too. No caking or making my pores clogged. I will be recommending this to all of my friends, men and women. This product was supplied to me complimentary in return for an honest and clear review.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful facial moisturizer.  I have very dry skin and  get dry patches. This moisturizer really hydrates your skin and is very light. Non greasy or heavy. I love how my skin instantly absorbed it and felt soft. Works great under makeup as well. The jar is a pretty good size and lasts a long time. I apply it morning and night but can be applied more for dry skin because it isn&#x27;t heavy. You feel your skin being hydrated instantly after applying.  Great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different brands of moisturizer and this is THE BEST.  Teamed with the Serum that I LOVE it does a wonderful job.  I just used it the first time this morning, (I am 62) and I could already see a decrease in the lines in my face.  My skin has a healthy glow and I do not look 62!&lt;br /&gt;$30.00 is a fantastic price and I just ordered another jar!</li>
            <li> This is a luxurious moisterizer that is whipped but is dense. This company doesn&#x27;t scrimpt. I was impressed to so see the jar filled to the very top. Many of these natural Amazon moisturizers&#x27; jars are about 3/4 full. It&#x27;s very economical because you get four ounces of this wonderful product compared to I.7 oz of similar products. Enough about this. The beautiful blue jar is pretty enough to display on your dresser. Now, the product. As I said, it&#x27;s very luxurious and ultra moisturizing and I can honestly say it&#x27;s for all skin types. Not oily greasy and not so light that it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything. It&#x27;s so soothing and no irritants or toxins. I use it all over, face and body. It&#x27;s silky soft and I look forward to putting it on. Now, I&#x27;m going to try the vitamin C serum because of the quality of this cream. When I browse the Internet about vitamin c serums it is at the top of the list and I make sure it&#x27;s an unbiased site. I&#x27;ll review the serum next after I&#x27;ve tried it out. I can&#x27;t imagine ANYONE not loving this cream.</li>
            <li> Very nice cream, soft and smooth and need a few more weeks of usage to judge it.</li>
            <li> Just received product, have used it twice, and already like it a lot.  Non greasy, and so moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product goes a long way. It feels smooth and silky when applied to your skin. I could see a difference in my skin after a week of using it.</li>
            <li> This is very nice face cream. It moisturizes without being greasy. I have sensitive skin and I can use it without any problems.</li>
            <li> It is amazing! It is whipped, light and glides on. It is not oily and my skin has not broken out. I have used it for 30 straight days and noticed my skin is not as dry and small light wrinkles are less noticeable. It really is one of the best hydrating facial moisturizers I have tried. The packaging is high end and the interior lid has a  little handle for easy access. A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This product was gifted to me and I LOVE IT!!. I have the hardest time finding product that dose not break me out,  leave my skin oily or just feels like something is on it. I have been using the Whipped Chiffon Daily for about a month and cannot get over how little you need to apply. It is light and airy with a a very mild sent. You cannot go wrong with this purchase and your face will thank you!</li>
            <li> I am still in a trial period with both the C serum and the whipped facial moisturizer and I expect to see some results due to the number of positive reviews these products have received.  The products are priced very fairly and have a nice feel to them - the added Vitamin C was a big motivator for me.  I am rating these products a 5 primarily because of the company&#x27;s outstanding customer service.  They strive for customer satisfaction and take the necessary steps to ensure the individual concerns and/or needs are met.  It is refreshing to deal with a company that genuinely cares about their customers.</li>
            <li> I use this along with serumtologie&#x27;s c serum, it Works really well together. This whipped chiffon is really thick, but once you put it on it absorbs really well, keeping skin really hydrate and soft. I notice my pores is smaller and fine lines around my mouth is less visible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT IN EXCHANGE FOR MY HONEST REVIEW***</li>
            <li> Thank you for letting me try your product free for my review. I absolutely love your product. Love the thickness of the cream to me it feels like it&#x27;s really working. It seems like my skin is getting softer so far. I will update when I&#x27;m finished with jar but as for now I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> Love that it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy. Very light and moisturizes well</li>
            <li> This cream is so yummy! Feels so great going on.  Really makes your face feel like it is moisturized.</li>
            <li> Burned my skin so badly. I purchased this because I thought it would work well to moisturize my face but ended up with dark, painful burn patches as a result.</li>
            <li> Have seen some improvement in the wrinkles. Around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  My skin feels more hydrated.</li>
            <li> I love the texture and consistency of this moisturizer.  There was no appreciable smell after application, which is plus in my book.  I was really bummed when my VERY acne prone skin broke out after using this moisturizer.  I am going to keep it and try it again next winter when my skin is drier, and keep it away from my &amp;#34;problem areas&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with your product.  I see improvement in my skin after just&lt;br /&gt;a few weeks.  I like the way in feels and everything about it!  I am so&lt;br /&gt;glad I chose it when I was trying to decide which moisturiser to purchase.&lt;br /&gt;Phyllis Morris</li>
            <li> love this product I recommend this!</li>
            <li> this moisturizer was a whipped creamy consistency but my skin felt dry after using it</li>
            <li> Amazing cream! Feels so good on my skin!</li>
            <li> Feels nice, works good</li>
            <li> I am so pleased I tried this moisturizer! I have been looking for a non-greasy moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t cost an arm and a leg. As a lover of the serum, I gave this a try. I have combination skin and new products tend to make my face break out. I have been using this for almost a week now, and I must say my face feels soft, smooth, and I am breakout free. It almost feels like it has a powder finish. Really cool product. Soaks in but feels like it&#x27;s hydrating all day. I do live in Florida so I pair it with a sunscreen when I use during daytime. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased sérumtologié® PURE Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer and sérumtologié® C serum º22 for my wife at the suggestion of a trusted friend. My wife saw quick results and encouraged me to use the products myself. I&#x27;ve been delighted by the moisturizing benefits of the cream and the wrinkle reduction benefits of the serum since I have dry skin. I&#x27;ve made them both a part of my daily routine. I highly recommend the use of these products especially if you been searching high and low for these types of solutions to no avail. Thank you sérumtologié®!</li>
            <li> As with all the items I have ordered from serumtologie, PURE Whipped Chiffon Daily provides excellent value at a very reasonable cost. In winter especially, I really need the benefits of a skin moisturizer that has the rejuvenating quality that whipped chiffon provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Their customer service and response time to product inquiries is exceptional for an on-line provider.</li>
            <li> i ordered this moisturizer 2 weeks ago and I have to say  I love it. Is not greasy and a little bit goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I been using the C serum for a month and a half now and is amazing! so I decided to try this moistirizer and OMG what a combination!!!&lt;br /&gt;My fine lines and pores are diminish and my skin is glowy.I love this combo highly recomended if u are looking for a beutiful skin and quick results</li>
            <li> Good Moisture with no greasy or oily feel.  feels very light on which is important for my oily skin.  This feels like almost nothing but is still very moisturizing.  Will continue using.  Happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Great compliment to Serum 22!</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!  I have been using it for 6 days and can&#x27;t believe how baby soft my skin feels.  When putting it on, I first use the C 22 serum, let it dry and then apply the Pure Whipped Chiffon Moisturizer.  You can feel the product working.  It&#x27;s so cool and refreshing and you can feel it working plumping up and tightening the skin.  I use these 2 products together in the morning and evening.  I&#x27;ve tried many products for aging skin and these 2 are great.  Try it...you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> This product shipped and was delivered as promised.  It goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling oily.  A little goes a long way so this size bottle will last a long time.  My skin is usually on the dry side and this has made my skin looking good.  It has been my go to cream everyday so far.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has been using this product and loves it! He says it hydrates his skin without making it oily.</li>
