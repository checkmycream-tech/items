            <li>So it is a good cream to use during the winter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I just have to use creams and lotions, but not all of them work as good as this one.</li>
            <li>So, off to rub some more in!</li>
            <li>I really love the Mee Beauty&#x27;s Honey Enriched Hand Cream!</li>
            <li>I also love that it&#x27;s organic and made in the USA!  </li>

            <li>/&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li>This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I make some of my own products</li>
            <li>/&gt;After she received her gift and tried the lotion she also confirmed that she loved it and has thrown it in her purse.</li>
            <li>Very light orange scent.</li>
            <li>So glad I found it now.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.</li>
            <li>Love this hand cream.</li>
            <li>I wish there were more companies like this in this world of ours.</li>
            <li>Mee Beauty&#x27;s Honey Enriched Hand Cream is quite possibly the world&#x27;s best hand cream.</li>
            <li>also love the scent of this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Basically you will fall in love with this hand cream as I have.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found it.</li>
            <li>most products break my skin out</li>
            <li>i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic!</li>
            <li>will be a returning customer for sure.</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this hand cream and</li>
            <li>Am I ever glad.</li>
            <li>This cream is possibly the world&#x27;s best hand cream I have ever found.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad that I found this lotion at a discounted price because it has become a favorite among 2 people.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s not mention this is made with natural ingredients, which is always a good thing!</li>
            <li>It is perfect to use in the dry season of winter.</li>
            <li>This proves to me that this cream is also effective to keep moisture</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily and leaves no oily or greasy residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;overly strong</li>
            <li>Honey is a natural humectant so this is not surprise and Shea Butter is the most amazing thing in the world for skin</li>
            <li>it fantastic to find a product that has a label you can read and products you can recognize?!&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to see a company actually listen to their customers.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it was fragrance free.</li>
            <li>but yet flows smoothly and is well absorbed into the skin in seconds!</li>
            <li>This rich cream keeps my hands smooth</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Love the Shea Butter, Pure Honey, Glycerin, and Cocoa Butter&lt;br /&gt;in</li>
            <li>I love it and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I love the tube it comes in as it can stand up on its lid ready to go when I need it.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous hand creams at all different price levels and I think this is the best value for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am to say the least impressed how well it works and feel safe to use being made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>The bottle for this hand cream is really pretty!</li>
            <li>The cream is very thick and smells wonderful, almost with a smidgen of orange.</li>
            <li>It works amazing as a longer lasting moisturizer out beating my lotion by hours.</li>
            <li>The cream itself sinks deeply into your skin nourishing and protecting perfectly.</li>
            <li>I expected it to have a light smell and was kind of hoping it would</li>
            <li>They were kind enough to send me a complimentary gift with the new easy to squeeze tube.  </li>
            <li>It is helping my hands heal from the assault of the other lotion, and I feel confident that if I&#x27;d found it sooner, I would have been much better off.  </li>
            <li>so Mee got it right with this combo.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll rub right into the skin.</li>
            <li>but, right after using it, I can pick up my cell phone and use the touchscreen without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>So when I was offered this Premium Ultra Thick Hand Cream from Mee Beauty for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a tube.</li>
            <li>Makes my hands really moist and soft without any greasy residue, with a sweet very mild smell</li>
            <li>I used to much at first so start small and work your way up (great value for the money).</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!!  </li>
            <li>For the most part I forgot that I even had it on besides the fact that my hands felt really soft and had a nice little smell to them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will most definitely reorder.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would love to give five stars, but until Mee Beauty does something about the scent, I&#x27;ll probably be buying a different hand cream.</li>
            <li>first thing I did when I received the package was smell it because that would be a deal breaker.</li>
            <li>It’s thick and creamy but it gets absorbed very quickly without leaving any oily residue and it feels very light on my skin.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin super soft and silky!</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like the cheap suntan lotion you would find at a dollar mart and the scent lingers long after the product has been absorbed into the skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very high quality&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are very dry and this lotion has them feeling fabulous!</li>
            <li>Since I always forget to wear gloves, my hands never heal fast and always hurt.</li>
            <li>I find it to be very soothing and moisturizing on</li>
            <li>never heard of this brand, but it has been perfect for my purse with this brutally cold winter.  </li>
            <li>Very calming.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way which makes me happy.  </li>
            <li>Why would I want a lesser product full of chemicals?  </li>
            <li>The rough skin is soft and I love how it feels when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend the product and their consideration of the honey bees.  </li>
            <li>Some of the biggest things that she looks for in a hand cream is to have a very light smell or no smell at all, not greasy and stay moisturized for a few hours.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick but goes on so well.</li>
            <li>I have no problem squeezing the hand cream out of the new tube.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>There is a slight hint of lavender and citrus, which is fine with me.  </li>
            <li>I suffer from chronic dry skin and usually apply lotion 5 times a day but this product I can get away with 2 at very most 3 applications per day.</li>
            <li>I rubbed a small dime size amount onto my wrist to see how it absorbed into my skin and was pleasantly surprised that within a couple of minutes my skin was left smooth but not greasy.</li>
            <li>Of course I checked it before giving it to her since she only likes certain qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is not oily at all and leaves my hands soft.</li>
            <li>I literally had to cover my hands twice because they were so dry when I first got it.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is one thick rich hand cream!</li>
            <li>It is so thick and rich!</li>
            <li>i have very sensitive skin and have found my main problem is the dry skin.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t want to live without</li>
            <li>I received this product at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it for everybody with dry or damaged skin.</li>
            <li>The tube was a little difficult to squeeze the cream out because it&#x27;s so thick, but it is worth it to be able to use this fine hand cream on my hands.</li>
            <li>Very thick and rich and leaves my hands feeling soft, not greasy</li>
            <li>It is still a very thick hand cream but is easily applied once out of the tube.  </li>

            <li> I have eczema, which turns into really BAD eczema on my hands in the winter.  To find hand creams/lotions that are free of the &amp;#34;dirty dozen&amp;#34; commonly used carcinogens, is difficult.  To find one that WORKS is nearly impossible.  I had one that was doing an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; job; it would take care of my dry skin for 5-10 minutes at a time.  But recently I had a bad reaction to it, making my eczema even worse; my hands were covered in hives and burning, on top of the already dry cracking and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Mee Beauty Bee Moisturized, stage left.  It is helping my hands heal from the assault of the other lotion, and I feel confident that if I&#x27;d found it sooner, I would have been much better off.  So glad I found it now.  This should be sold in 15-packs.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of products with honey in them. I was excited to try this product. It is a little hard to squeeze but easy to apply a little goes a long way. I used to much at first so start small and work your way up (great value for the money). It works amazing as a longer lasting moisturizer out beating my lotion by hours. I suffer from chronic dry skin and usually apply lotion 5 times a day but this product I can get away with 2 at very most 3 applications per day.</li>
            <li> Wow! I am so happy with this cream! When I was offered at a great discount to try it and share my honest opinion I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. This cream dos not disappoint! It is thick but yet flows smoothly and is well absorbed into the skin in seconds! Makes my hands really moist and soft without any greasy residue, with a sweet very mild smell it is very pleasant. I am to say the least impressed how well it works and feel safe to use being made with natural ingredients. Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> I am a bartender so my hands are always in the water, they are very very dry, calloused and this lotion is amazing! Makes my skin super soft and silky! I received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> Love this hand cream. Very thick and rich and leaves my hands feeling soft, not greasy</li>
            <li> This hand cream is wonderful and is environmentally effective.  The company has now changed the tube to be an easier to squeeze tube.  It is still a very thick hand cream but is easily applied once out of the tube.  I highly recommend the product and their consideration of the honey bees.  I wish there were more companies like this in this world of ours.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hands that are always cracking and hurt because I wash bottles and dishes all day long. I have a family of 6 and someone needs to do the dishes. Since I always forget to wear gloves, my hands never heal fast and always hurt. So when I was offered this Premium Ultra Thick Hand Cream from Mee Beauty for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a tube. I have been using it for just over a week now and my hands are not cracked anymore and the spots that were cracked are all healed up!! The rough skin is soft and I love how it feels when I put it on. The Cream isn&#x27;t greasy either. I definitely recommend this Ultra Thick Hand Cream from Mee Beauty for anyone who has rough dry cracked hands.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is wonderful! The bottle for this hand cream is really pretty! The smell of this hand cream is really nice! It&#x27;s not strong at all but you can definitely smell it and it&#x27;s really nice! I also like that it&#x27;s not sticky and that it absorbs really good. For the most part I forgot that I even had it on besides the fact that my hands felt really soft and had a nice little smell to them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have this hand cream in my purse so that way I can have it no matter where I am and will even share with friends or family if they need a little moisture to their hands! I would DEFINITELY recommend this hand cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product. My husband confiscated it after having used it on his hands. He has a lot of difficulty finding hand creme that will take care of his tiny cuts ,rough ,dry skin. Just a tiny bit is sufficient. Very light orange scent. Absorbs well . I will most definitely reorder.</li>
            <li> Mee Beauty&#x27;s Honey Enriched Hand Cream is quite possibly the world&#x27;s best hand cream. I have tried numerous hand creams at all different price levels and I think this is the best value for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never before has any hand cream had such a calming and soothing effect on me. The cream itself sinks deeply into your skin nourishing and protecting perfectly. When you wash your hands after using this cream you will notice the water beading off. This proves to me that this cream is also effective to keep moisture in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is made with honey, and honey is a humectant, moisture will tend to be attracted to your skin instead of repelled. Honey is also anti-bacterial, anti-viral and anti-fungal. So it is a good cream to use during the winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the scent of this product. It is like a buttery honey with hints of orange. To me this cream is the ultimate in dry skin relief. You may also want to use it on your feet. I felt that this cream calms the spirit as well as hydrates the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically you will fall in love with this hand cream as I have. It is perfect to use in the dry season of winter. I personally don&#x27;t want to live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this cream in exchange for a review. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> This hand lotion by Mee is made in the US, contains honey from the US and was formulated by a beekeeper from NY.  It contains Organic Aloe and Shea Butter.  Those three ingredients (honey, aloe and shea butter) scream moisture to me so I accepted a promo offer to test and review this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s thick.  It is luxurious and it absorbs within 30 seconds so your hands are not greasy.  A little goes a long way which makes me happy.  The tube will last longer.  There is a slight hint of lavender and citrus, which is fine with me.  Again, it is a hint of a fragrance.  It does not overwhelm.  My hands get dry at night and wake me up.  I know, that&#x27;s crazy but it is true.  I keep this by my bed, put a small amount on before going to sleep and my hands stay moisturized all night.  Honey is a natural humectant so this is not surprise and Shea Butter is the most amazing thing in the world for skin so Mee got it right with this combo.  Good job!  Great product!</li>
            <li> This rich cream keeps my hands smooth</li>
            <li> Wow, this is one thick rich hand cream! I find it to be very soothing and moisturizing on&lt;br /&gt;my poor dry stinging hands. I had never heard of this brand and stumbled upon it just&lt;br /&gt;by chance surfing around on amazon. I&#x27;m really glad I found it. It&#x27;s a very high quality&lt;br /&gt;product and it&#x27;s long lasting. Love the Shea Butter, Pure Honey, Glycerin, and Cocoa Butter&lt;br /&gt;in it for the moisturizing benefits. Just to let everyone know that it does have a fragrance. It has&lt;br /&gt;Sweet Orange and Lavender essential oils and Rosemary extract. I didn&#x27;t find the fragrance to be&lt;br /&gt;overly strong but I like essential oils and use them, or other products with them already included,&lt;br /&gt;just about everyday.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream I have tried</li>
            <li> this product has done wonders for my skin. i have very sensitive skin and have found my main problem is the dry skin. most products break my skin out but this was very nice. it is so thick and luxurious. you dont use much and theres no overwhelming scent but theres no denying that this comes from coconut oil. it reminds me of a product ive used containing beeswax. (scentwise) i absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> This hand cream is divine! It is so thick and rich! It rubs in easily and leaves no oily or greasy residue. It is fantastic! As a mom and a painter, I am constantly using my hands and washing them. They are very dry and this lotion has them feeling fabulous! Let&#x27;s not mention this is made with natural ingredients, which is always a good thing! I am happy to recieve this product to review. I love it and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Easily the best hand lotion I&#x27;ve EVER used. No exaggeration! It&#x27;s nice and thick but goes on so well. My dry skin just sucks it up! I literally had to cover my hands twice because they were so dry when I first got it. Even though it&#x27;s thick, you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being oily or greasy in any way. It&#x27;ll rub right into the skin. I noticed my hands were so moisturized that they had a glow to them but, right after using it, I can pick up my cell phone and use the touchscreen without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;If that&#x27;s not enough for you, wait until you smell it. Oh my! It&#x27;s loaded with&amp;#34;Extra Thick Premium Honey&amp;#34; and it smells so luscious and delicious.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also full of all natural, organic aloe vera, shea butter, cocoa butter, mango butter and essential oils and doesn&#x27;t contain any &amp;#34;parabens, sulfates, phthalates, or artificial colors&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Isn&#x27;t it fantastic to find a product that has a label you can read and products you can recognize?!&lt;br /&gt;But, if that still isn&#x27;t enough for you, this and all her products are MADE IN THE USA! Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;I will be a returning customer for sure. Why would I want a lesser product full of chemicals?  That&#x27;s why I make some of my own products but they don&#x27;t even stand up to this and it&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;Treat yourself! Oh... and it&#x27;s anti-aging! Women, we all know our hands show our age. So, off to rub some more in!</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this hand cream and how moisturizing it is, but I can&#x27;t get over the smell!  It smells exactly like the cheap suntan lotion you would find at a dollar mart and the scent lingers long after the product has been absorbed into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would love to give five stars, but until Mee Beauty does something about the scent, I&#x27;ll probably be buying a different hand cream.</li>
            <li> never heard of this brand, but it has been perfect for my purse with this brutally cold winter.  not too oily, but enough glycerine to make a difference</li>
            <li> I really love the Mee Beauty&#x27;s Honey Enriched Hand Cream! It’s thick and creamy but it gets absorbed very quickly without leaving any oily residue and it feels very light on my skin. My hands get really dry during winter time so I just have to use creams and lotions, but not all of them work as good as this one. It’s one of the best creams I’ve ever tried! It also has a very nice honey smell. I like everything about this product! In addition, the company uses our local honey from the U.S., so it’s something we are accustomed to which makes a chance of having any adverse reactions much smaller. I received this product at a promotional price for testing and reviewing purposes and I highly recommend it for everybody with dry or damaged skin.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful hand cream but I agree with other reviewers that it&#x27;s extremely difficult to get out of the tube.  I have arthritis in my hands and it was painful to squeeze the thick cream out of the tube.  Also has a wonderful smell that is not too strong.  I give the cream five stars and the tube one star.  They need to put this cream in a jar type container.  I also love that it&#x27;s organic and made in the USA!  6/22/15:  So happy to find out that Mee Beauty changed their container for this product.  They were kind enough to send me a complimentary gift with the new easy to squeeze tube.  I have no problem squeezing the hand cream out of the new tube.  Thanks so much!!  It&#x27;s great to see a company actually listen to their customers.</li>
            <li> My hands get horribly dry during the winter time. I&#x27;ve went through tons of hand creams and have never found anything that really worked until I was asked to purchase for a small fee, try and review the Hand Cream by Mee Beauty.  Am I ever glad. This cream is possibly the world&#x27;s best hand cream I have ever found. I love the tube it comes in as it can stand up on its lid ready to go when I need it. The cream is very thick and smells wonderful, almost with a smidgen of orange. Very calming. The creams seems to soften and protect my hands against the elements of winter in the Midwest. The product is not oily at all and leaves my hands soft. The tube was a little difficult to squeeze the cream out because it&#x27;s so thick, but it is worth it to be able to use this fine hand cream on my hands.</li>
            <li> I came across this Mee Beauty hand cream while searching for a gift for my mother in law. Some of the biggest things that she looks for in a hand cream is to have a very light smell or no smell at all, not greasy and stay moisturized for a few hours. She lives in a very cold climate so her skin stays dry during the winter months. Of course I checked it before giving it to her since she only likes certain qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing I did when I received the package was smell it because that would be a deal breaker. To my surprise it was fragrance free. I expected it to have a light smell and was kind of hoping it would but no smell is better than a bad smell though! I then checked the consistency. It is a thicker cream that held its place when you turn the bottle upside down. Personally, I like this because I feel that it penetrates into your skin longer. I rubbed a small dime size amount onto my wrist to see how it absorbed into my skin and was pleasantly surprised that within a couple of minutes my skin was left smooth but not greasy. I almost thought that since it was so thick that there would be a build up but it soaked in perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After she received her gift and tried the lotion she also confirmed that she loved it and has thrown it in her purse. I&#x27;m so glad that I found this lotion at a discounted price because it has become a favorite among 2 people.</li>
