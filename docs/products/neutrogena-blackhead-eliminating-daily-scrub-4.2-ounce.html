            <li>I use this inbetween the times I use Biotherm which is really the best product I have used for cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li>And let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
            <li>Works nicely as a pre-shave scrub as well.</li>
            <li>Even if this is as good as the results get, I&#x27;m already satisfied.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many Neutrogena and have gotten better results on my face with them all... until this day when I tried this one!</li>
            <li>After I use this my face feels clean and it gets rid of a lot of oil (it also smells really good).</li>
            <li>It works better then others I used, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>I asked my dermatologist what I should use and it turns out that I needed a better moisturizer.</li>

            <li>I love any and all Neutrogena products; they are quality products.  </li>
            <li>but I am satisfied &amp; would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I use a variety of different brands, but Origins seems to have the best stuff when it comes to exfoliating and getting rid of impurities.</li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products to get rid of the whitehead bumps on my face.</li>
            <li>It is ok but have found better products.</li>
            <li>Do not know the suit will be better.</li>
            <li>woyld redommend to most of my friends.</li>
            <li>, I love this scrub and would buy it again.</li>
            <li>Makeup goes on and stays better.</li>
            <li>but since getting off birth control I began to break out here and there, and my pores became much more noticable with blackheads peering out.</li>
            <li>and i do recomend buying this product :) :) :)</li>
            <li>All girls know the more make up you put on to cover it</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>If you have blackhead problems but otherwise healthy skin, then try this scrub...</li>

            <li>Good deep cleansing scrub for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my face looks great and feels soft.</li>
            <li>It scrubs the top of the blackhead off-makes your skin smooth but doesn&#x27;t penetrate into the pore.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it has plenty of scrubbing grit with lather, but without the strong smell that &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; beauty products have.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It was fine for cleaning my face but didn&#x27;t achieve what it claims.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great daily cleanser and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>and I can already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li>RECOMMENDED 100% smoothly.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, Warm greetings from VENEZUELA</li>
            <li>I have had more success with Cerave cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>As I read, some reviewers are writing here how happy they are with it as a scrub, not what it actually advertises, which is removing blackheads.  </li>
            <li>did give it 3 stars because my skin really does look nice.  </li>
            <li>It even seems to help smooth out some of my existing wrinkles.  </li>

            <li>well, and does not leave the skin feeling too dry (although this could also translate to an uncleansed feeling for the face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating effect of this face wash is nice, leaves a nice refreshed complexion after using.</li>
            <li>I used to get a lot of blackheads on my cheeks and chin and the scrub has significantly reduced them.</li>
            <li>The price difference is significant, but it works.</li>
            <li>After just ONE use I know this product will be a favorite, my skin is soft and smooth and the product smells fantastic!</li>

            <li>Chances are he comes from the same recessive-gene tree my people sprout from, so being able to detail my pores is a nice benefit to a</li>
            <li>The two stares are only there because it did have a nice refreshing feeling when I used it</li>
            <li>I do have to use a washcloth to completely wipe it all off, it doesn&#x27;t seem to just rinse clean on its own.</li>
            <li>This is a good facial cleanser!</li>
            <li>I now only use BB cream &amp; bronzer on my face for makeup because my skin looks so good.</li>
            <li>Its a good facial scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Virtually no hint of a medicine in the sweet scent.</li>
            <li>My wife even remarked how quickly my skin cleared up.  </li>
            <li>I am very fond of her, although not completely clear, but I feel much better than the original better, light some.love</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh chemical smell, which is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  </li>
            <li>Amazon product helps your sling feel young and refreshed, within a week you will start to look the results having smooth skin free from acne</li>
            <li>and I can already say it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li>works well, like better than most other products.  </li>
            <li>right after I use the blackhead eliminating scrub.</li>
            <li>and if you work out, I recommend using it right afterwards when you shower.</li>
            <li>I noticed right away</li>
            <li>This really gets the face clean,</li>
            <li>I was surprised (pleasantly) with this Daily Scrub</li>
            <li>Gives a good scrub and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face out too much.  </li>
            <li>I first used the scrub in the shower right after my workout in the morning.</li>
            <li>The wash is deep, refreshing and most importantly does not make my skin dry.</li>
            <li>The abrasive element in the product is fairly gently, but the area you use it on will kind of buzz following the application, letting you know it was working.</li>
            <li>I wash my forehead and face daily (or almost daily) and have been happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Works good but not on black heads.</li>
            <li>thank you very much ...&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li>I have no complaints about the service but the product is no more effective than cheap hand soap.</li>
            <li>leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>to be consistent and do it twice a day though.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li>When I got home from work (about 9 hours after my first use)</li>
            <li>Seems to have some mild effect in treating blackheads, although the effect seems to be mainly as a result of mechanical scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>I tried cleansers, multiple masks, and more Biore nose strips than I can count.</li>
            <li>I pair mine with Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it an &amp;#34;eliminator&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>After using this product as a mask for the first time, I saw immediate results -</li>
            <li>Eveyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you may just have to give it a shot if you want to know for sure it it will work for YOU.</li>
            <li>I tried for first time...</li>
            <li>If you have many noticeable blackheads, you&#x27;ll need to unclog the pores on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the biore cleaning pore strips, but they only remove the top part of clogged pores.</li>
            <li>This product has been very helpful to reduce the skin reaction right below my hairline caused by hair gel getting onto my skin.  </li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t have the right set up right now to do this everyday like I should</li>
            <li>far this is a great little cleanser -</li>
            <li>This product is sometimes hard to find in stores, therefore I&#x27;m glad I am able to purchase it online.</li>
            <li>And, Clean and Clear does not compare anymore to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>She says it leaves her face feeling clean, and soft.</li>
            <li>That really seems to help out the whole \\&quot;de-gunking\\&quot; process!</li>
            <li>Most facewash make my skin go dry.</li>
            <li>but this clear your face quick</li>
            <li>After 10ish days the blackheads no longer look \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; but most of the pores on my nose are still larger than normal.  </li>
            <li>One of the best face wash product I have tried, definitely same me a lot of money from going the the facial salon to have the black heads removed</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone most of my life with super clear skin on my face and never much worried about products.</li>
            <li>Now I use it everyday, it&#x27;s amazing to prevent blackhead,</li>
            <li>I did not notice much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li>and it works really well</li>
            <li>both as a cleanser or intense mask</li>
            <li>Just remember that this is a scrub and not so much a cleanser.</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m starting to sound like a walking billboard for Origins products, but I assure you I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li>hence I didn&#x27;t really consider the \\&quot;Blackhead</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>, works really well if use twice a day.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t like it so much, can&#x27;t stand the film it leaves on my skin</li>
            <li>It has exfoliating beads in it, but they don&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li>There wasn&#x27;t really much difference before</li>
            <li>Still searching for a real solution.</li>
            <li>Almost all of my nose was smooth and clean - just a few dots remained on the very tip.</li>
            <li>I just got this today, and already I am excited about washing my face with it twice daily.</li>
            <li>I have blackheads on my nose that I am using this to try and get rid of, and a week later my nose already looks significantly clearer</li>
            <li>i am also using the Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/Mask</li>
            <li>B003QOTDB4 Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/mask, 6 Ounce (</li>
            <li>However, the reason I did not give this one star is because I&#x27;ve begun to use this simply as something to clean my face with.</li>
            <li>Not really a good scrub or good for blackheads.</li>
            <li>It also has a good texture; abrasive enough to properly exfoliate without leaving my skin red.</li>
            <li>I love the slight tingling sensation you get when you use it.  </li>
            <li>I still have many black heads on my nose and cheek area, but it help get my skin clearer.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly to treat my blackheads.</li>
            <li>Is not a simple Scrub, your skin changes quickly, getting softer and reduce blackheads.</li>
            <li>My skin got significantly clearer, but it did not clear up blackheads as it claimed.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I have used this scrub since I was in high school, about 15 years.  </li>
            <li>i only use neutrogena products because i found that for me it works more effictively than other products and regimens, the cost here in the caribbean are sometimes resonable and other times very high and the products are here for about a year or more depending how it sells then</li>
            <li>I use this item daily on face and neck for clean, clear skin.</li>
            <li>The product generally works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I recommend this as something to get rid of oils and to make your face feel clean without making it feel really dry, but I do not recommend this as a blackhead eliminator.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t REALLY eliminate blackheads completely.</li>
            <li>I am now an adult in my 30&#x27;s and this scrub does not over dry my skin, but it really feels clean when I am done using it.</li>
            <li>Killed many blackheads.</li>
            <li>She has tried a few others, but this is her favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how much better my skin looks in a few weeks.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday at night and results were astonishing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the oil free acne washes, masques, bars, pads, oxy, astringents, even other blackhead scrubs.</li>
            <li>Very large, very affordable, blackhead effect is not immediate, I bought a single branch.</li>
            <li>I prefer Thanks for your review of Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser much better at least for me.</li>
            <li>I bought this after seeing generally good reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much overall since I haven&#x27;t had much luck with products similar to this in the past.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many other products and thought Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub would be the one.  </li>
            <li>I started using this about a week and a half ago for a blackhead problem that was primarily on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>I also love how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much or makes it feel tight.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty normal (not too oily or dry)</li>
            <li>The course granules are too large and feel as though they have potential too</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this every night paired with a light moisturizer and every morning I see little improvements.  </li>
            <li>I think this product is more for blemishes due to oily skin rather than blackheads which are caused by dry skin.</li>
            <li>It does have salicylic acid, which helps with all pimples, but for blackheads, I recommend Origins Clear Improvement Charcoal Mask.</li>
            <li>I guess I wanted complete eliminating of the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li>I have done everything; proativ, professional dermatologist, and the list goes on and on.</li>
            <li>and they are almost completely gone, about 95% clear</li>
            <li>Look for natural exfoliating ingredients</li>
            <li>It makes your skin feels soft after use.</li>
            <li>problems near eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>It also leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely sold on this product, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It took no longer than 24 hours for the effects of the Daily Scrub to initially show - I was budgeting more time based upon the info given by other reviewers.</li>
            <li>It is worth trying because like20 girls said it did work on black heads.</li>
            <li>It runs out awfully quick if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li>this item broke me out and my face never felt clean, perhaps its a reaction to the menthol or to the SA i am not sure</li>
            <li>If you have very dry skin, I would recommend Origins Modern Friction.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again, but at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li>I purchased this face scrub in hopes that it would clear up my blackheads, I&#x27;ve been using it daily for awhile and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li>This does a decent job of exfoliating dry skin for the price.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my skin any better or worse.</li>
            <li>/&gt;THE REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much more to say about the Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub other than it eliminated troublesome dark pores on my nose when used daily as a scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li>was that it left my skin feeling so smooth, if a little dry.  </li>
            <li>not dry skin</li>
            <li>Not a miracle cure, but you will notice an improvement, especially with daily or near daily usage.</li>
            <li>You know that old guy at the bar with the big red shiny nose and bloodshot blue eyes?</li>
            <li>I am in my early 30 &#x27;s and have a new black head issue.</li>
            <li>I give this a four because it dries out my skin, but I have dry sensitive skin anyways.</li>

            <li> It works just as good as products.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena is a good brand</li>
            <li> its a good product....</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> , good price:</li>
            <li> Love it !</li>
            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really effective.</li>
            <li> I use this inbetween the times I use Biotherm which is really the best product I have used for cleaning my face.  </li>
            <li> And let&#x27;s be honest.</li>
            <li> Works nicely as a pre-shave scrub as well.</li>
            <li> Even if this is as good as the results get, I&#x27;m already satisfied.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many Neutrogena and have gotten better results on my face with them all... until this day when I tried this one!</li>
            <li> After I use this my face feels clean and it gets rid of a lot of oil (it also smells really good).</li>
            <li> It works better then others I used, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I asked my dermatologist what I should use and it turns out that I needed a better moisturizer.</li>
            <li> i use it like 2-3 times a week mostly at nights before bed</li>
            <li> I use it every morning in the shower and it makes my skin feel so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Its a good overal facial cleaner it fits great for my cleaning needs.</li>
            <li> I love any and all Neutrogena products; they are quality products.  </li>
            <li> but I am satisfied &amp; would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I use a variety of different brands, but Origins seems to have the best stuff when it comes to exfoliating and getting rid of impurities.</li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to get rid of the whitehead bumps on my face.</li>
            <li> It is ok but have found better products.</li>
            <li> Do not know the suit will be better.</li>
            <li> woyld redommend to most of my friends.</li>
            <li> , I love this scrub and would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Makeup goes on and stays better.</li>
            <li> but since getting off birth control I began to break out here and there, and my pores became much more noticable with blackheads peering out.</li>
            <li> and i do recomend buying this product :) :) :)</li>
            <li> All girls know the more make up you put on to cover it</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> If you have blackhead problems but otherwise healthy skin, then try this scrub...</li>
            <li> This scrub smells great and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> live my skin smouth and fresh... and smell delicious...</li>
            <li> Amazing product, worked great for me and for me its cheaper here than at my local Target.</li>
            <li> Good deep cleansing scrub for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my face looks great and feels soft.</li>
            <li> It scrubs the top of the blackhead off-makes your skin smooth but doesn&#x27;t penetrate into the pore.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has plenty of scrubbing grit with lather, but without the strong smell that &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; beauty products have.  </li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was fine for cleaning my face but didn&#x27;t achieve what it claims.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great daily cleanser and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li> and I can already see a huge difference.</li>
            <li> RECOMMENDED 100% smoothly.</li>

            <li> I have had more success with Cerave cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> As I read, some reviewers are writing here how happy they are with it as a scrub, not what it actually advertises, which is removing blackheads.  </li>
            <li> did give it 3 stars because my skin really does look nice.  </li>
            <li> It even seems to help smooth out some of my existing wrinkles.  </li>

            <li> I do have to use a washcloth to completely wipe it all off, it doesn&#x27;t seem to just rinse clean on its own.</li>
            <li> This is a good facial cleanser!</li>

            <li> and I can already say it was worth the buy.</li>
            <li> works well, like better than most other products.  </li>
            <li> right after I use the blackhead eliminating scrub.</li>
            <li> and if you work out, I recommend using it right afterwards when you shower.</li>
            <li> I noticed right away</li>
            <li> This really gets the face clean,</li>
            <li> I was surprised (pleasantly) with this Daily Scrub</li>
            <li> Gives a good scrub and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face out too much.  </li>
            <li> I first used the scrub in the shower right after my workout in the morning.</li>
            <li> The wash is deep, refreshing and most importantly does not make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> The abrasive element in the product is fairly gently, but the area you use it on will kind of buzz following the application, letting you know it was working.</li>
            <li> I wash my forehead and face daily (or almost daily) and have been happy with the results.  </li>
            <li> Works good but not on black heads.</li>
            <li> thank you very much ...&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the service but the product is no more effective than cheap hand soap.</li>
            <li> leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> to be consistent and do it twice a day though.&lt;br /&gt;Did</li>
            <li> When I got home from work (about 9 hours after my first use)</li>
            <li> Seems to have some mild effect in treating blackheads, although the effect seems to be mainly as a result of mechanical scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> I tried cleansers, multiple masks, and more Biore nose strips than I can count.</li>
            <li> I pair mine with Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it an &amp;#34;eliminator&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> After using this product as a mask for the first time, I saw immediate results -</li>
            <li> Eveyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you may just have to give it a shot if you want to know for sure it it will work for YOU.</li>
            <li> I tried for first time...</li>
            <li> If you have many noticeable blackheads, you&#x27;ll need to unclog the pores on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the biore cleaning pore strips, but they only remove the top part of clogged pores.</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpful to reduce the skin reaction right below my hairline caused by hair gel getting onto my skin.  </li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t have the right set up right now to do this everyday like I should</li>
            <li> far this is a great little cleanser -</li>
            <li> This product is sometimes hard to find in stores, therefore I&#x27;m glad I am able to purchase it online.</li>
            <li> And, Clean and Clear does not compare anymore to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> She says it leaves her face feeling clean, and soft.</li>
            <li> That really seems to help out the whole \\&quot;de-gunking\\&quot; process!</li>
            <li> Most facewash make my skin go dry.</li>
            <li> but this clear your face quick</li>
            <li> After 10ish days the blackheads no longer look \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; but most of the pores on my nose are still larger than normal.  </li>
            <li> One of the best face wash product I have tried, definitely same me a lot of money from going the the facial salon to have the black heads removed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone most of my life with super clear skin on my face and never much worried about products.</li>
            <li> Now I use it everyday, it&#x27;s amazing to prevent blackhead,</li>
            <li> I did not notice much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  </li>
            <li> and it works really well</li>
            <li> both as a cleanser or intense mask</li>
            <li> Just remember that this is a scrub and not so much a cleanser.</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m starting to sound like a walking billboard for Origins products, but I assure you I&#x27;m not.</li>
            <li> hence I didn&#x27;t really consider the \\&quot;Blackhead</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> , works really well if use twice a day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it so much, can&#x27;t stand the film it leaves on my skin</li>
            <li> It has exfoliating beads in it, but they don&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
            <li> There wasn&#x27;t really much difference before</li>
            <li> Still searching for a real solution.</li>
            <li> Almost all of my nose was smooth and clean - just a few dots remained on the very tip.</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and already I am excited about washing my face with it twice daily.</li>
            <li> I have blackheads on my nose that I am using this to try and get rid of, and a week later my nose already looks significantly clearer</li>
            <li> i am also using the Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/Mask</li>
            <li> B003QOTDB4 Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/mask, 6 Ounce (</li>
            <li> However, the reason I did not give this one star is because I&#x27;ve begun to use this simply as something to clean my face with.</li>
            <li> Not really a good scrub or good for blackheads.</li>
            <li> It also has a good texture; abrasive enough to properly exfoliate without leaving my skin red.</li>
            <li> I love the slight tingling sensation you get when you use it.  </li>
            <li> I still have many black heads on my nose and cheek area, but it help get my skin clearer.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to treat my blackheads.</li>
            <li> Is not a simple Scrub, your skin changes quickly, getting softer and reduce blackheads.</li>
            <li> My skin got significantly clearer, but it did not clear up blackheads as it claimed.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub since I was in high school, about 15 years.  </li>
            <li> i only use neutrogena products because i found that for me it works more effictively than other products and regimens, the cost here in the caribbean are sometimes resonable and other times very high and the products are here for about a year or more depending how it sells then</li>
            <li> I use this item daily on face and neck for clean, clear skin.</li>
            <li> The product generally works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I recommend this as something to get rid of oils and to make your face feel clean without making it feel really dry, but I do not recommend this as a blackhead eliminator.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t REALLY eliminate blackheads completely.</li>
            <li> I am now an adult in my 30&#x27;s and this scrub does not over dry my skin, but it really feels clean when I am done using it.</li>
            <li> Killed many blackheads.</li>
            <li> She has tried a few others, but this is her favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how much better my skin looks in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday at night and results were astonishing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the oil free acne washes, masques, bars, pads, oxy, astringents, even other blackhead scrubs.</li>
            <li> Very large, very affordable, blackhead effect is not immediate, I bought a single branch.</li>
            <li> I prefer Thanks for your review of Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser much better at least for me.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing generally good reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much overall since I haven&#x27;t had much luck with products similar to this in the past.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other products and thought Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub would be the one.  </li>
            <li> I started using this about a week and a half ago for a blackhead problem that was primarily on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> I also love how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much or makes it feel tight.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty normal (not too oily or dry)</li>
            <li> The course granules are too large and feel as though they have potential too</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this every night paired with a light moisturizer and every morning I see little improvements.  </li>
            <li> I think this product is more for blemishes due to oily skin rather than blackheads which are caused by dry skin.</li>
            <li> It does have salicylic acid, which helps with all pimples, but for blackheads, I recommend Origins Clear Improvement Charcoal Mask.</li>
            <li> I guess I wanted complete eliminating of the pores on my nose.</li>
            <li> I have done everything; proativ, professional dermatologist, and the list goes on and on.</li>
            <li> and they are almost completely gone, about 95% clear</li>
            <li> Look for natural exfoliating ingredients</li>
            <li> It makes your skin feels soft after use.</li>
            <li> problems near eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Need</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> It also leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely sold on this product, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It took no longer than 24 hours for the effects of the Daily Scrub to initially show - I was budgeting more time based upon the info given by other reviewers.</li>
            <li> It is worth trying because like20 girls said it did work on black heads.</li>
            <li> It runs out awfully quick if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> this item broke me out and my face never felt clean, perhaps its a reaction to the menthol or to the SA i am not sure</li>
            <li> If you have very dry skin, I would recommend Origins Modern Friction.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again, but at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I purchased this face scrub in hopes that it would clear up my blackheads, I&#x27;ve been using it daily for awhile and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference.</li>
            <li> This does a decent job of exfoliating dry skin for the price.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my skin any better or worse.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much more to say about the Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub other than it eliminated troublesome dark pores on my nose when used daily as a scrub.&lt;br</li>
            <li> was that it left my skin feeling so smooth, if a little dry.  </li>
            <li> not dry skin</li>
            <li> Not a miracle cure, but you will notice an improvement, especially with daily or near daily usage.</li>
            <li> You know that old guy at the bar with the big red shiny nose and bloodshot blue eyes?</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30 &#x27;s and have a new black head issue.</li>
            <li> I give this a four because it dries out my skin, but I have dry sensitive skin anyways.</li>
            <li> After using this product on my face for 3 weeks it has neither cleared up any of the acne spots left behind from old blemishes or had any positive effect on clearing away the blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product, in combination with the Neutrogena Achne wash does a terrific jon in keeping your skin clear of black heads and achne.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much blackhead control the Neutrogena gives you.</li>
            <li> i cant use it too often because my skin is left dry</li>
            <li> I suggest if you want a clear face don&#x27;t get this, its a waste of money and</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would not purchase again, I bought this in hopes to eliminate the blackheads covering my nose Ive had for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> If you have a MINOR blackhead problem, this will help.</li>
            <li> My pores are smaller, and the blackheads are half the size they were earlier today.</li>
            <li> I tried the Cetaphil Cleanser (the one designed for oily skin) and it makes my skin feel tight and slightly oily, which does not feel particularly good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I feel totally ridiculous for wasting my time with other products until this one, but at least I&#x27;ve found it now. :)</li>
            <li> BUT, you have to use it with a moisturizer, otherwise it will dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li> So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> bought this yesterday and was totally amazed when about half of my blackheads were gone after just one use.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product because I wanted an exfoliating cleanser that I can use everyday.</li>
            <li> It did seem harder to rinse off than other scrubs I&#x27;ve used, even other Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is that when it is \\&quot;full\\&quot; it only seems to be about half full--like a bag of pototo chips.</li>
            <li> Very little is needed to do the job so a single tube lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Even reading other product reviews.</li>
            <li> ...I do not like when it came, it seemed half empty...?</li>
            <li> work outdoors in dusty environments and come from a long line of big-nosed European winos.</li>
            <li> Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Thought it was good, but threw it away after reading about the terrible effect of the plastic microbes on fish and wildlife and environment.</li>
            <li> You just have to scrub a little harder to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> it seems to slightly muscle the dirt and residue out of my face.</li>
            <li> black heads started clearing after a week of use...apply any acne cream that has 2 percent salicylic acid also at&lt;br /&gt;night</li>
            <li> My break outs stopped after less than a week of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Most recommended.</li>
            <li> It made the blackheads slightly less black after using as instructed.</li>
            <li> The scrubbing granules in it may be a little rougher than is necessary, so I try to wash my face carefully with it to avoid making my skin worse by inflaming any pimples, for example.</li>
            <li> Like some other reviewers, my nose is usually riddled with dozens of little black dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little overpowering and it lingers even after I wash it off.  </li>
            <li> I like how the little beads are inside this product</li>
            <li> /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells a little fruity.</li>
            <li> (that may be what this is judging by the pumice chunks) with a little ovarian essence worked into the mix:</li>
            <li> /&gt;MY LITTLE BLACKHEADS,</li>
            <li> Stinks like a bucket of Fast Orange</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I think it would help my face if I could just do it everyday.</li>
            <li> BUT ALSO A FEW WHITEHEADS&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and after I used it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday and have for years.  </li>
            <li> This product actually made the issue worse since it was too harsh and was making my skin even dryer.</li>
            <li> Kinda disappointed, but I still gave it 3 stars because it might clear up someone else&#x27;s skin since everyone is different.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a very slight difference.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be helping, and at the very least it isn&#x27;t making my skin worse.</li>
            <li> is also fully of little chunks of...something...that is hard to rinse off if you are trying to do it over a sink.  </li>
            <li> so not sure how it would affect those skin types</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 6 months.</li>
            <li> cause small scrapes.  </li>
            <li> Not satisfied, will not recommend or repurchase.</li>
            <li> not contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which is a big plus after my unpleasant experience with other products containing Sodium Lauryl</li>
            <li> Then this year, my nose started getting absolutely covered in blackheads and getting horrible irritated red spots.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying it&#x27;s hard for me to tell how well this product works</li>
            <li> Once I put this on, two days later my face broke out like crazy :,(  </li>
            <li> (So bad it talked me into wearing make up again, and if you knew how good I can handle not putting on make up you&#x27;d be shocked of what that bad result may have</li>
            <li> I have very difficult skin to deal with, and I haven&#x27;t been using it very long.</li>
            <li> you make it worse.</li>
            <li> and i either have to look around or shop online but other than that i havent had a bad experience using Neutrogena&#x27;s product at all.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried so many other products and thought Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub would be the one.  I guess I wanted complete eliminating of the pores on my nose. It works better then others I used, so I will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the service but the product is no more effective than cheap hand soap. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> excellent product, good quality very good dispatch received everything the right way. RECOMMENDED 100% smoothly. THANKS FOR EVERYTHING, Warm greetings from VENEZUELA</li>
            <li> This did not eliminate any of my blackheads. I have always had issues with blackheads, especially on my nose. I thought if I purchased a product that was specifically geared toward my problem I would get some results. I saw no change in the appearance of blackheads. It was fine for cleaning my face but didn&#x27;t achieve what it claims. I asked my dermatologist what I should use and it turns out that I needed a better moisturizer. This product actually made the issue worse since it was too harsh and was making my skin even dryer. I have had more success with Cerave cleanser and moisturizer. I think this product is more for blemishes due to oily skin rather than blackheads which are caused by dry skin.</li>
            <li> I did not notice much of a difference at all.</li>
            <li> One of the best face wash product I have tried, definitely same me a lot of money from going the the facial salon to have the black heads removed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year now.&lt;br /&gt;It is great for scrubbing out those large pores and your skin feels soft and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand what all the hype is about.  As I read, some reviewers are writing here how happy they are with it as a scrub, not what it actually advertises, which is removing blackheads.  It did not remove any blackheads for me.  As a scrub, it&#x27;s excellent!  leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This product is so awesome..i use it like 2-3 times a week mostly at nights before bed i cant use it too often because my skin is left dry and i work in an air conditioned enviornment every day... i am also using the Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/Mask (link: [[ASIN:B003QOTDB4 Neutrogena Deep Clean Long-Last Shine Control, Cleanser/mask, 6 Ounce (Pack of 2)]] on mornings before work and it works really well both as a cleanser or intense mask and i would recommed it to anyone. i only use neutrogena products because i found that for me it works more effictively than other products and regimens, the cost here in the caribbean are sometimes resonable and other times very high and the products are here for about a year or more depending how it sells then the store doesn&#x27;t supply it anymore and i either have to look around or shop online but other than that i havent had a bad experience using Neutrogena&#x27;s product at all.  you guys can purchase it from and beauty or department store and give it a try</li>
            <li> This product is really great. I use it every morning in the shower and it makes my skin feel so nice and smooth. I used to get a lot of blackheads on my cheeks and chin and the scrub has significantly reduced them. In so doing this it has also made my pores smaller. Just remember that this is a scrub and not so much a cleanser. So I use Oxy maximum strength acne wash right after I use the blackhead eliminating scrub.</li>
            <li> I like the way that this scrub makes my skin look but it is too abrasive to use twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also fully of little chunks of...something...that is hard to rinse off if you are trying to do it over a sink.  It is a lot easier to use in the shower. I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell.  It is a little overpowering and it lingers even after I wash it off.  It strikes me a somewhat \\&quot;feminine\\&quot; scent which obviously isn&#x27;t great if you are a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did give it 3 stars because my skin really does look nice.  It even seems to help smooth out some of my existing wrinkles.  But I&#x27;ll probably be looking to try a different brand for the reasons mentioned above.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my mid 30&#x27;s and have been dealing with acne and blackheads since my teens. I have done everything; proativ, professional dermatologist, and the list goes on and on. If its been out there, I&#x27;ve tried it. Nothing has even come close to doing what this product did for my face in just a couple of weeks. I was riddled with blackheads across my nose, chin and cheeks and they are almost completely gone, about 95% clear and my pores seem to have shrank. I only used this product once per day, in the shower, it is too abrasive for the twice daily recommendation on the label in my opinion. This was the only acne product I was using, washing with cetaphil twice daily besides this. Amazing product, worked great for me and for me its cheaper here than at my local Target. I dont take a lot of time out to write reviews, especially on hygiene products, but this one worked so well, I had to let people know.</li>
            <li> Its a good overal facial cleaner it fits great for my cleaning needs. I have some zits from now and then. I&#x27;ve had a lot of oily blackheads and dirty residue on my face. I also work at a shop and getting my face cleaned after work is always a priority. I like how the little beads are inside this product it seems to slightly muscle the dirt and residue out of my face. Since cleaning my face it felt healthier and cleaner not like before. Killed many blackheads. I highly recommend this product it&#x27;s good</li>
            <li> Used it daily for a week and already notice the blackheads on my nose disappearing.  Hopefully, all of them will be gone in another week or two.  Very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Amazon product helps your sling feel young and refreshed, within a week you will start to look the results having smooth skin free from acne</li>
            <li> I love any and all Neutrogena products; they are quality products.  I use this item daily on face and neck for clean, clear skin.</li>
            <li> It works. I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> This is a good facial cleanser! I use it every morning and every so often before bed &amp; my skin has looked so great since using it. It doesn&#x27;t actually get rid of all the blackheads but there is a very big difference before &amp; after. I now only use BB cream &amp; bronzer on my face for makeup because my skin looks so good. My skin is pretty normal (not too oily or dry) so not sure how it would affect those skin types but I am satisfied &amp; would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thought it was good, but threw it away after reading about the terrible effect of the plastic microbes on fish and wildlife and environment. Look for natural exfoliating ingredients</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t have the right set up right now to do this everyday like I should but I did end up trying it in the shower on my back since I get blackheads there and it worked rather well. I think it would help my face if I could just do it everyday.</li>
            <li> Most facewash make my skin go dry. This one has been perfect. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past 6 months. The wash is deep, refreshing and most importantly does not make my skin dry.</li>
            <li> been using it for couple weeks now. i dont see a big change so it may not work on me but would work on you.</li>
            <li> This does a decent job of exfoliating dry skin for the price. If you have very dry skin, I would recommend Origins Modern Friction. The price difference is significant, but it works. I&#x27;m not sure how much blackhead control the Neutrogena gives you. It does have salicylic acid, which helps with all pimples, but for blackheads, I recommend Origins Clear Improvement Charcoal Mask. I know I&#x27;m starting to sound like a walking billboard for Origins products, but I assure you I&#x27;m not. I use a variety of different brands, but Origins seems to have the best stuff when it comes to exfoliating and getting rid of impurities. I do recommend the Neutrogena if you&#x27;re on a budget. You just have to scrub a little harder to remove the dead skin.</li>
            <li> Goupy,  bit or a weird smell.  The course granules are too large and feel as though they have potential too cause small scrapes.  I would recommend a scrub with finer granules.</li>
            <li> It works just as good as products. It makes your skin feels soft after use. It does not remove blackheads though.</li>
            <li> The product generally works pretty well. Not a miracle cure, but you will notice an improvement, especially with daily or near daily usage. The abrasive element in the product is fairly gently, but the area you use it on will kind of buzz following the application, letting you know it was working.</li>
            <li> thank you very much ...&lt;br /&gt;all ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products to get rid of the whitehead bumps on my face. I&#x27;ve even seen a dermatologist. But this product works the best!! Results immediately!!!!</li>
            <li> albeit a bit slower than I&#x27;d like.  But clearing gunk that may have taken decades to accumulate will take time (not to mention is kinda gross to think about!).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m been using this product for two months and it did not remove any of my blackheads. However, the reason I did not give this one star is because I&#x27;ve begun to use this simply as something to clean my face with. After I use this my face feels clean and it gets rid of a lot of oil (it also smells really good). I also love how it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much or makes it feel tight. I tried the Cetaphil Cleanser (the one designed for oily skin) and it makes my skin feel tight and slightly oily, which does not feel particularly good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I recommend this as something to get rid of oils and to make your face feel clean without making it feel really dry, but I do not recommend this as a blackhead eliminator.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really effective. Now I use it everyday, it&#x27;s amazing to prevent blackhead,</li>
            <li> Cleans and removes blackheads and makes my face feel refreshed smooth and clean, I would buy again once it runs out.</li>
            <li> It is ok but have found better products. Neutrogena is a good brand but this did not work like I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Its a good facial scrub.&lt;br /&gt;Hydrolized granules in soap/moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;No problems near eyes.&lt;br /&gt;Need to be consistent and do it twice a day though.&lt;br /&gt;Did not dry skin</li>
            <li> I like this product because it has plenty of scrubbing grit with lather, but without the strong smell that &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; beauty products have.  I use this inbetween the times I use Biotherm which is really the best product I have used for cleaning my face.  And, Clean and Clear does not compare anymore to Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I was a disbeliever but this clear your face quick</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this product because I wanted an exfoliating cleanser that I can use everyday. I figured that I was covered in the blackhead realm with my Biore facial strips - hence I didn&#x27;t really consider the \\&quot;Blackhead Eliminating\\&quot; aspect of this product. My plan was to keep using the facial strips if Neutrogena&#x27;s product didn&#x27;t pan out on the blackhead front. I was surprised (pleasantly) with this Daily Scrub and I&#x27;ve decided to use it in place of those facial strips from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took no longer than 24 hours for the effects of the Daily Scrub to initially show - I was budgeting more time based upon the info given by other reviewers. I first used the scrub in the shower right after my workout in the morning. When I got home from work (about 9 hours after my first use) I used the product again. The next morning, I used it and then checked my nose in the mirror afterwards. Almost all of my nose was smooth and clean - just a few dots remained on the very tip. Like some other reviewers, my nose is usually riddled with dozens of little black dots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far this is a great little cleanser - and if you work out, I recommend using it right afterwards when you shower. That really seems to help out the whole \\&quot;de-gunking\\&quot; process!</li>
            <li> ...I do not like when it came, it seemed half empty...? And let&#x27;s be honest. Doesn&#x27;t REALLY eliminate blackheads completely.</li>
            <li> This scrub smells great and leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Works nicely as a pre-shave scrub as well.</li>
            <li> Great product !! I strongly recommend it. Smooth skin with visibly less blackheads and with the bonus of a very pleasant fragrance. Love it !</li>
            <li> Very large, very affordable, blackhead effect is not immediate, I bought a single branch.Do not know the suit will be better.I am very fond of her, although not completely clear, but I feel much better than the original better, light some.love it</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to treat my blackheads. Seems to have some mild effect in treating blackheads, although the effect seems to be mainly as a result of mechanical scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does not contain Sodium Lauryl Sulfate, which is a big plus after my unpleasant experience with other products containing Sodium Lauryl Sulfate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleans well, and does not leave the skin feeling too dry (although this could also translate to an uncleansed feeling for the face)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliating effect of this face wash is nice, leaves a nice refreshed complexion after using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone most of my life with super clear skin on my face and never much worried about products. Then this year, my nose started getting absolutely covered in blackheads and getting horrible irritated red spots. I tried cleansers, multiple masks, and more Biore nose strips than I can count. Nothing made the slightest difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this yesterday and was totally amazed when about half of my blackheads were gone after just one use. Wow. I feel totally ridiculous for wasting my time with other products until this one, but at least I&#x27;ve found it now. :)</li>
            <li> Very Nice. Is not a simple Scrub, your skin changes quickly, getting softer and reduce blackheads.</li>
            <li> This product is sometimes hard to find in stores, therefore I&#x27;m glad I am able to purchase it online. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 1 year. Yes it works and Yes I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> its a good product....black heads started clearing after a week of use...apply any acne cream that has 2 percent salicylic acid also at&lt;br /&gt;night time</li>
            <li> works well, like better than most other products.  Makes my skin feel soft and clean.  woyld redommend to most of my friends.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Works to clean my pores well.&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells a little fruity. Literally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;- Good deep cleansing scrub for a good price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RATING BREAKDOWN:&lt;br /&gt;- Good product, good price: 5 Stars.&lt;br /&gt;- Stinks like a bucket of Fast Orange (that may be what this is judging by the pumice chunks) with a little ovarian essence worked into the mix: -1 Star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#x27;t much more to say about the Neutrogena Blackhead Eliminating Daily Scrub other than it eliminated troublesome dark pores on my nose when used daily as a scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work outdoors in dusty environments and come from a long line of big-nosed European winos. You know that old guy at the bar with the big red shiny nose and bloodshot blue eyes? Chances are he comes from the same recessive-gene tree my people sprout from, so being able to detail my pores is a nice benefit to a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This scrub hits the nail on the [black]head.</li>
            <li> I really like this, works really well if use twice a day. My break outs stopped after less than a week of using this product.&lt;br /&gt;Most recommended.</li>
            <li> works well and no werid smells etc. use it in summer and will clear you up its a good product</li>
            <li> This product works well..my only complaint is that when it is \\&quot;full\\&quot; it only seems to be about half full--like a bag of pototo chips. It runs out awfully quick if you use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS NEUTROGENA BLACKHEAD ELIMINATING&lt;br /&gt;DAILY SCRUB AND IT&#x27;S NOT ONLY GOT RID OF&lt;br /&gt;MY LITTLE BLACKHEADS, BUT ALSO A FEW WHITEHEADS&lt;br /&gt;I HAD  -  IT&#x27;S MADE MY PORES SMALLER AROUND&lt;br /&gt;MY NOSE  -  NOW MY SKIN IS SOFTER AND ALSO&lt;br /&gt;SMOOTHER AROUND MY NOSE  -  I CAN&#x27;T&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENT THIS PRODUCT ENOUGH</li>
            <li> I started using this about a week and a half ago for a blackhead problem that was primarily on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;What I noticed right away was that it left my skin feeling so smooth, if a little dry.  I love the slight tingling sensation you get when you use it.  If you&#x27;re looking for an overnight fix for your blackhead problem, this isn&#x27;t it.  I&#x27;ve been using this every night paired with a light moisturizer and every morning I see little improvements.  After 10ish days the blackheads no longer look \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; but most of the pores on my nose are still larger than normal.  I did notice this morning that they are starting to get smaller.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this scrub and would buy it again. It&#x27;s a great daily cleanser and leaves my skin feeling smooth.  BUT, you have to use it with a moisturizer, otherwise it will dry out your skin.  I pair mine with Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer for sensitive skin and it&#x27;s perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Waking up in the morning with soft, bright skin is amazing![[ASIN:B000052YOX Neutrogena Oil-Free Moisture, Sensitive Skin, 4 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this. She has tried a few others, but this is her favorite. She says it leaves her face feeling clean, and soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn t works for me.</li>
            <li> This really gets the face clean,</li>
            <li> I got this for my pores.  Used twice a day for several weeks.  Need to give this a bit to show results. Pores smaller skin smoother. Makeup goes on and stays better.</li>
            <li> I just got this today, and already I am excited about washing my face with it twice daily. I never had bad acne but since getting off birth control I began to break out here and there, and my pores became much more noticable with blackheads peering out. After just ONE use I know this product will be a favorite, my skin is soft and smooth and the product smells fantastic! Virtually no hint of a medicine in the sweet scent.</li>
            <li> After using this product on my face for 3 weeks it has neither cleared up any of the acne spots left behind from old blemishes or had any positive effect on clearing away the blackheads on my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again, I bought this in hopes to eliminate the blackheads covering my nose Ive had for as long as I can remember.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like it so much, can&#x27;t stand the film it leaves on my skin I prefer Thanks for your review of Neutrogena Pore Refining Cleanser much better at least for me.</li>
            <li> this.product is the only blackhead treatment that worked for me and i do recomend buying this product :) :) :)</li>
            <li> Even after all these years my skin is susceptible to blackheads ... this is very effective and when used with BMC Facial Skin Care Beauty Untrasoft Pore cleansing Spa brush my face looks great and feels soft.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call it an &amp;#34;eliminator&amp;#34;. It scrubs the top of the blackhead off-makes your skin smooth but doesn&#x27;t penetrate into the pore.</li>
            <li> Not really a good scrub or good for blackheads. It has exfoliating beads in it, but they don&#x27;t seem to do much. There wasn&#x27;t really much difference before and after I used it for a few weeks. It didn&#x27;t make my skin any better or worse. It did seem harder to rinse off than other scrubs I&#x27;ve used, even other Neutrogena products. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again, but at least it was cheap.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend who has body acne on his cheast. He&#x27;s been using it twice a week for about six weeks and the blackheads in the mddle of his cheast are just about disapeared completly! It also leaves the skin soft.</li>
            <li> I bought this after seeing generally good reviews, but I wasn&#x27;t expecting much overall since I haven&#x27;t had much luck with products similar to this in the past. I&#x27;ve been using this daily for about a week now and I can already say it was worth the buy. I have blackheads on my nose that I am using this to try and get rid of, and a week later my nose already looks significantly clearer and it makes the skin look and feel smoother. Even if this is as good as the results get, I&#x27;m already satisfied.</li>
            <li> After using this product as a mask for the first time, I saw immediate results - I know, I didn&#x27;t believe it either! This product is amazing! My pores are smaller, and the blackheads are half the size they were earlier today. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how much better my skin looks in a few weeks. I&#x27;m completely sold on this product, and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This product, in combination with the Neutrogena Achne wash does a terrific jon in keeping your skin clear of black heads and achne.  Very little is needed to do the job so a single tube lasts a long time.  The best price we found was from Amazon.</li>
            <li> I use this each morning to wash my face.  Gives a good scrub and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my face out too much.  I do have to use a washcloth to completely wipe it all off, it doesn&#x27;t seem to just rinse clean on its own.</li>
            <li> This is the only face cleansing scrub I use and I use it everyday and have for years.  Definitly recommend.</li>
            <li> After going through a variety of facial scrubs/cleansers, I find this scrub very effective I use it everyday at night and results were astonishing. My skin got significantly clearer, but it did not clear up blackheads as it claimed. I still have many black heads on my nose and cheek area, but it help get my skin clearer.</li>
            <li> I am SO disappointed!!! I have tried so many Neutrogena and have gotten better results on my face with them all... until this day when I tried this one! Once I put this on, two days later my face broke out like crazy :,(  (So bad it talked me into wearing make up again, and if you knew how good I can handle not putting on make up you&#x27;d be shocked of what that bad result may have been).&lt;br /&gt;So I suggest if you want a clear face don&#x27;t get this, its a waste of money and it just adds up the pimples/acne to your face.</li>
            <li> The two stares are only there because it did have a nice refreshing feeling when I used it but it made me break out like crazy! Not worth it.</li>
            <li> Let me begin by saying it&#x27;s hard for me to tell how well this product works becuase I have very difficult skin to deal with, and I haven&#x27;t been using it very long. They say you have to use a product for several weeks before you should expect to see results. I&#x27;ve been using it once a day (at night) and a different cleanser in the morning. The scrubbing granules in it may be a little rougher than is necessary, so I try to wash my face carefully with it to avoid making my skin worse by inflaming any pimples, for example. It doesn&#x27;t have a harsh chemical smell, which is great. So far it seems to be helping, and at the very least it isn&#x27;t making my skin worse. Eveyone&#x27;s skin is different, so you may just have to give it a shot if you want to know for sure it it will work for YOU.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this face wash for about a week now and I can already see a huge difference. I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I tried for first time... and I love it! live my skin smouth and fresh... and smell delicious... It a great product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this face scrub in hopes that it would clear up my blackheads, I&#x27;ve been using it daily for awhile and haven&#x27;t noticed any difference. Kinda disappointed, but I still gave it 3 stars because it might clear up someone else&#x27;s skin since everyone is different. I also don&#x27;t like how it makes my skin feel after I rinse it off, I always follow up with a regular face wash because it almost leaves an oily feeling. Not satisfied, will not recommend or repurchase.</li>
            <li> I give this a four because it dries out my skin, but I have dry sensitive skin anyways. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone with dry skin.</li>
            <li> great value buying them this way. works too</li>
            <li> this item broke me out and my face never felt clean, perhaps its a reaction to the menthol or to the SA i am not sure..left my face red and irritated and with a residue..i gave it away.</li>
            <li> This product has been very helpful to reduce the skin reaction right below my hairline caused by hair gel getting onto my skin.  I wash my forehead and face daily (or almost daily) and have been happy with the results.  My wife even remarked how quickly my skin cleared up.  It also has a good texture; abrasive enough to properly exfoliate without leaving my skin red.</li>
            <li> It made the blackheads slightly less black after using as instructed. I&#x27;ve been using for several weeks and it&#x27;s a very slight difference. The clogged pores remain clogged. In addition, it dries the heck out of your skin. If you want to solve the blackhead problem, you have to unclog the pores. This doesn&#x27;t do that. If you have a MINOR blackhead problem, this will help. If you have many noticeable blackheads, you&#x27;ll need to unclog the pores on a regular basis. I&#x27;ve tried the biore cleaning pore strips, but they only remove the top part of clogged pores. The pores remain clogged. Still searching for a real solution.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30 &#x27;s and have a new black head issue. It is out of control.Ive never had oil skin either until now. I guess your skin changes. I have tried everything. I was so upset because it was so out of control you could see it. All girls know the more make up you put on to cover it you make it worse. FINALLY this product works. Even reading other product reviews. Works good but not on black heads. Everyone is different one or two girls said it didn&#x27;t work for them. It is worth trying because like20 girls said it did work on black heads.</li>
            <li> For years I&#x27;ve been looking for a product to get rid of the blackheads on my cheeks. I&#x27;ve tried the oil free acne washes, masques, bars, pads, oxy, astringents, even other blackhead scrubs. But nothing ever worked. When I found the Neutrogena blackhead scrub, I had my hopes up that maybe, just maybe it would work. Well, after about a week of use, almost all of my blackheads were gone! I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;ve tried products that were much more expensive and they didn&#x27;t even come close. I love this stuff. If you have blackhead problems but otherwise healthy skin, then try this scrub...I can all but guarantee it will work for you.</li>
            <li> I have used this scrub since I was in high school, about 15 years.  I am now an adult in my 30&#x27;s and this scrub does not over dry my skin, but it really feels clean when I am done using it.</li>
