    <ol>
            <li>but this brush is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Did a wonderful job, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a good brush and this was not it.</li>
            <li>I did good buy</li>
            <li>Brush is amazing.</li>
            <li>Children are loving ..</li>
            <li>Does a good job, but not the &amp;#34;pain free detangler&amp;#34; it&#x27;s advertised to be.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this brush, she did not complain once,  the tangles came out with ease and her hair looked great.</li>
            <li>My Daughter loves it, she is able to get the knots out of her hair quicker and with almost no discomfort</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t already thrown away it&#x27;s original packaging, I would have returned the brush.</li>
            <li>quick delivery and Quality</li>
            <li>Thank you so much Michel Mercier for making such a great product-well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I just wanted to say that this brush REALLY works!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work and better than a regular brush.</li>
            <li>I was not expecting too much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay, not quite what was expected.</li>
            <li>but I see she is going back to her old hairbrush as her standby goes through her hair top and bottom without sectioning out her hair.</li>
            <li>Does a decent job though.</li>
            <li>I have no idea if this is normal</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for your sensitive, curly haired kids!</li>
            <li>We have super long hair</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re working with no more than an inch-wide section of hair at a time, it&#x27;s okay, but I could do the same with a normal brush with about the same detangling success.</li>
            <li>My 5 year old says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s hateful.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work well for thick curly hair and make sure it doesn&#x27;t get dropped or it will break.</li>
            <li>The only thing it did was make her hair soft.</li>
            <li>The brush does not detangle any better than a regular brush and the small bristles are sharp on your scalp.</li>
            <li>My daughter was so excited to get this brush for her long, thick hair.</li>

            <li> My daughter was so excited to get this brush for her long, thick hair.</li>
            <li> It hurt her head just like all the other brushes.</li>
            <li> The whole brush is made of hard plastic with no give or cushion; it&#x27;s super uncomfortable, even painful, for any scalp, but especially a kid&#x27;s head!?</li>
            <li> This brush was not very strong.</li>
            <li> She fusses everyday when I do her hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s still messy and it takes me like 2 hours .-.</li>
            <li> No more pulling hair.</li>
            <li> My daughter is biracial so her hair is thick and curly.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and worthless, I do not recommend, it should only cost $5.00 or less!</li>
            <li> The brush is hard plastic, which is uncomfortable to use and no grip for hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard, so it&#x27;s uncomfortable to brush my daughters hair.</li>
            <li> But when we used it we were greatly disappointed.</li>
            <li> My daughter hated it.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It was horrible..... couldn&#x27;t even detangle my hair...</li>

            <li> My granddaughter uses it but I see she is going back to her old hairbrush as her standby goes through her hair top and bottom without sectioning out her hair.</li>
            <li> My Daughter loves it, she is able to get the knots out of her hair quicker and with almost no discomfort</li>
            <li> This brush was not very strong. I was looking for a good brush and this was not it.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this brush. It is junk and does not work. My daughter hated it. It hurt her head just like all the other brushes.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to say that this brush REALLY works! My granddaughter loves it-she doesn&#x27;t even need detangling spray (once she got her hair cut and the HUGH knot taken out). Thank you so much Michel Mercier for making such a great product-well worth the money.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it hurts her head and pulls her hair. I have no idea if this is normal or she&#x27;s just complaining to complain. Either way, it&#x27;s not used anymore. We have super long hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has kinky hair.  Did a wonderful job, and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> This brush does NOT work like it says it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s very hard, so it&#x27;s uncomfortable to brush my daughters hair. It doesn&#x27;t work and better than a regular brush. Save your money and buy something different.</li>
            <li> Children are loving .. I did good buy</li>
            <li> Does a good job, but not the &amp;#34;pain free detangler&amp;#34; it&#x27;s advertised to be.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well for thick curly hair and make sure it doesn&#x27;t get dropped or it will break.</li>
            <li> Wow! I was not expecting too much but this brush is awesome.  My daughter is biracial so her hair is thick and curly. She fusses everyday when I do her hair.

            <li> Brush is amazing. Daughter loves it.  No more pulling hair.</li>
            <li> Pulls out my daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> It was horrible..... couldn&#x27;t even detangle my hair... it&#x27;s still messy and it takes me like 2 hours .-.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay, not quite what was expected. Does a decent job though.</li>
            <li> My kids still have knots.</li>
            <li> My daughter was so excited to get this brush for her long, thick hair. But when we used it we were greatly disappointed. The brush does not detangle any better than a regular brush and the small bristles are sharp on your scalp. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not what was promised on commercial and advertising! It still hurts my daughters hair and still pulls her hair out and hair is in the brush. The only thing it did was make her hair soft. The brush is hard plastic, which is uncomfortable to use and no grip for hand.</li>
            <li> The whole brush is made of hard plastic with no give or cushion; it&#x27;s super uncomfortable, even painful, for any scalp, but especially a kid&#x27;s head!? My 5 year old says &amp;#34;it&#x27;s hateful.&amp;#34; And as for its function as a detangler? If you&#x27;re working with no more than an inch-wide section of hair at a time, it&#x27;s okay, but I could do the same with a normal brush with about the same detangling success. If I hadn&#x27;t already thrown away it&#x27;s original packaging, I would have returned the brush. We threw it away after 2 weeks of trying to make it work. DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> quick delivery and Quality</li>
            <li> Overpriced and worthless, I do not recommend, it should only cost $5.00 or less!</li>
