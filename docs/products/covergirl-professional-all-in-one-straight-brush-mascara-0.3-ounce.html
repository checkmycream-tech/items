            <li>For the excellent price this worked quite well.  </li>
            <li>delivery was great</li>
            <li>i love covergirl, but i am not a fan of the curved brush!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best if you just want a very light coating of mascara.</li>
            <li>It is a great price, and looks good on.</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.</li>
            <li>so applying takes a bit more time,</li>
            <li>I love this mascara.  </li>
            <li>Love that this is an add on item.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>a good consistent flow of mascara</li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Washes off easily with water.</li>
            <li>Stick with the straight brush and you will love this stuff for the price!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very consistent and and well made product!</li>
            <li>Love stocking up when the price is right</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and lasts all day.</li>
            <li>If you prefer a clean, natural-yet-enhanced look for your eyelashes, this is for you.</li>
            <li>If you are wanting super long, full lashes, it works great.</li>
            <li>Strange as it sounds, people ask me what kind of mascara I use!</li>
            <li>I combine it with another brand if I want really full lashes for the evening.</li>
            <li>I purchased this item based on the good reviews and low price.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a basic mascara that is safe for a person wearing contacts, then this is it!</li>
            <li>This worked great for a few days</li>
            <li>Mascara seems quite dry and takes a couple layers for it to show nicely.</li>
            <li>Tried and true, consistent and reliable, this is the one I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s a straight brush or a curved one, the mascara goes on the individual lashes to darken and lengthen, but without every clumping two or more lashes together to look like spider legs.  </li>
            <li>Even CoverGirl offers more expensive types of mascara, but this basic lower priced one is the best.</li>
            <li>I like the curved brush, but it comes in a straight brush if you prefer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very simple, light mascara.</li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>Gentle on my eyes - does not stir up my allergies</li>
            <li>Non-clumping, long wear, easy removal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl curved mascara for years - but not without having tried MANY other mascaras advertised as &amp;#34;extra length&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;extra fullness&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;extra coverage&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;no clumps&amp;#34; or whatever!  </li>
            <li>I love this mascara but the curved brush makes it REALLY hard to get the mascara on your bottom lashes without getting it on your skin.</li>
            <li>Love the curved brush and the dark black color.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is a decent everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> It stays on for a long time and is my go to product.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but always come back to this.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brands.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like its dry or almost empty.  </li>
            <li> ,it is very dry</li>
            <li> I will not use any other mascara going forward.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on the other name brands with all their fancy brushes and so-called features.</li>
            <li> i try to get all the little lashes on the corners of my eyes, and with this brush i just end up poking myself in the eye</li>
            <li> It does not smudge or run even when crying.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not clumpy and actually isn&#x27;t messy.</li>
            <li> When I received the item and used it, it was so dried out that it was unusable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan.</li>
            <li> No more eyelashes stuck together with gunky black sludge.</li>
            <li> well its just not fun!!</li>
            <li> I could hardly see it on my lashes.  </li>
            <li> this mascara is not good at all.  </li>
            <li> Not too dramatic, but does accentuate lashes.</li>
            <li> I thought the curved brush is difficult to maneuver around the eyelashes.</li>
            <li> if you dont get along with your brush your eyes will look terrible!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands of mascara, but I always end up coming back to this one. Love the curved brush and the dark black color. Strange as it sounds, people ask me what kind of mascara I use!</li>
            <li> I love this mascara. If you are wanting super long, full lashes, it works great. I will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing this brand of mascara for 30 years. I have tried other brands but always come back to this. Non-clumping, long wear, easy removal. It does not smudge or run even when crying. Best priced too. Don&#x27;t waste your money on more expensive brands. Even CoverGirl offers more expensive types of mascara, but this basic lower priced one is the best. I like the curved brush, but it comes in a straight brush if you prefer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Goes on clean and lasts all day. Excellent value. I will not use any other mascara going forward.</li>
            <li> The curved brush didn&#x27;t bother me like some ppl. You just have to get used to apply it. It&#x27;s a very simple, light mascara. I combine it with another brand if I want really full lashes for the evening.</li>
            <li> I wanted waterproof and it was not what I received</li>
            <li> This is a decent everyday mascara.</li>
            <li> I love this mascara but the curved brush makes it REALLY hard to get the mascara on your bottom lashes without getting it on your skin. Stick with the straight brush and you will love this stuff for the price!</li>
            <li> Not a huge fan. Mascara seems quite dry and takes a couple layers for it to show nicely. Will use it up but won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought the curved brush is difficult to maneuver around the eyelashes. Didn&#x27;t realize I had ordered the curved brush. I wouldn&#x27;t do it again.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a basic mascara that is safe for a person wearing contacts, then this is it!</li>
            <li> Quality mascara. Easy to apply. Not too dramatic, but does accentuate lashes.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. it&#x27;s not clumpy and actually isn&#x27;t messy. I underestimated this product. Would buy again</li>
            <li> This worked great for a few days then it started to clump.</li>
            <li> may be the item I received or this is how it is,it is very dry&lt;br /&gt;not a good consistent flow of mascara so applying takes a bit more time,</li>
            <li> I love this mascara.  It stays on for a long time and is my go to product.  Love stocking up when the price is right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using CoverGirl curved mascara for years - but not without having tried MANY other mascaras advertised as &amp;#34;extra length&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;extra fullness&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;extra coverage&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;no clumps&amp;#34; or whatever!  THIS is the best mascara there is. Whether it&#x27;s a straight brush or a curved one, the mascara goes on the individual lashes to darken and lengthen, but without every clumping two or more lashes together to look like spider legs.  Even after buying $25 mascaras, I return to CoverGirl. It&#x27;s affordable, and it works. I wouldn&#x27;t waste my money again on the other name brands with all their fancy brushes and so-called features. Tried and true, consistent and reliable, this is the one I highly recommend. Always.</li>
            <li> Love that this is an add on item. It beats walmarts price</li>
            <li> this mascara is not good at all.  I could hardly see it on my lashes.  I had to go over it with another brand and ended up throwing it away.  It&#x27;s almost like its dry or almost empty.  It&#x27;s best if you just want a very light coating of mascara.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally dozens of mascaras in my life. If you prefer a clean, natural-yet-enhanced look for your eyelashes, this is for you. It lengthened, separated, and did not leave ANY clumps, making lashes look longer and darker without over-doing it. This is the perfect &amp;#34;day time&amp;#34; mascara. No more eyelashes stuck together with gunky black sludge. No flakes. Washes off easily with water.</li>
            <li> For the excellent price this worked quite well.  Would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this mascara for over a decade. It&#x27;s a very consistent and and well made product! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I judge my mascara by the &amp;#34;Gloppiness factor.&amp;#34; This passes. It is a great price, and looks good on. Lasts all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item based on the good reviews and low price. When I received the item and used it, it was so dried out that it was unusable.&lt;br /&gt;DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> i love covergirl, but i am not a fan of the curved brush!! i try to get all the little lashes on the corners of my eyes, and with this brush i just end up poking myself in the eye and... well its just not fun!! its all about the brush! if you dont get along with your brush your eyes will look terrible! :) delivery was great and so was packaging!</li>
            <li> truly waterproof, doesn&#x27;t smear. Gentle on my eyes - does not stir up my allergies</li>
