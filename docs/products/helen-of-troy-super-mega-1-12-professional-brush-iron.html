            <li>The Helen of Troy Brush Iron is a great product.  </li>

            <li>IT WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li>Imagine my excitement for it to be a Helen of Troy product at a great price.</li>
            <li>Great curling iron.</li>
            <li>Really enjoying the product!!</li>
            <li>This does more than a great job!</li>
            <li>Just not an enthusiastic yes!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried others over many years, and this is the best!</li>
            <li>This is the best thing for fine hair that has a tendency to frizz at the end.   </li>
            <li>This works but you have to let it heat up for a good five minutes.  </li>
            <li>so I knew that it was a good product...</li>
            <li>The product does now have the \\&quot;solid\\&quot; feel of a good styling tool.  </li>
            <li>Good for added volume.  </li>
            <li>good for fine/medium or damaged hair, so</li>
            <li>Good product</li>
            <li>They work good.  </li>
            <li>The model has been updated, but all good.</li>
            <li>But what good is a curling brush if it doesn&#x27;t curl??</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Favorite hair accessory!</li>
            <li>I just love this product!  </li>
            <li>I just love it!</li>
            <li>and I sure hope Helen of Troy keeps making them!  </li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Sure wish it could be found in a retail outlet!  </li>
            <li>Someone please come out with a 1 1/2 inch hot brush!!!!</li>
            <li>The large barrel creates the perfect style for my hair.  </li>
            <li>This product heats up well, and is one of a kind in terms of barrel width.</li>
            <li>Excellent heating element, never quits, lasts forever, a must have for straight hair.  </li>
            <li>it would be nice if there was an auto-shut off timer that turned the iron off after an hour or so of no use.</li>
            <li>the kind you put on the bottoms of chair legs</li>
            <li>honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything at all for my hair.</li>
            <li>It does a good job gripping my hair, and my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled in it once.</li>
            <li>thanks for the flawless transaction!</li>
            <li>I liked the 1-1/2&amp;#34; barrel -</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for, smoothes my hair, curls my hair and helps it good great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and will purchase more items from this company when the need arises.</li>
            <li>Handles very easily</li>
            <li>Very easy to roll on and off the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have always liked using a curling brush more than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Price is right and it heats up great.  </li>
            <li>It is perfect for the style I want -- not curls, but large, smooth waves with curve-under at the ends.  </li>
            <li>Also it is almost to hot, it would be great if it had adjustable temp control.</li>
            <li>It does a great job of smoothing out frizziness I get after blow drying (which I have to do to get any body, what a process we go through...)  ; ).</li>
            <li>However, it is a fair price and came quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used this brush for many years.</li>
            <li>I packed this in a suitcase (not overstuffed), and so many of the teeth broke off</li>
            <li>Light is good - but this is too light.    </li>
            <li>Glad I found it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to make sure I had a backup</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this curling iron for MANY years</li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Love, love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love the size of this curling iron - 1-1/2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but now they have made it better</li>
            <li>AS WELL, IT IS MORE LIKE A CURLING IRON, BUT I WAS NONE</li>
            <li>Much better for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling brush.  </li>
            <li>I am not the most coordinated when it comes to styling my hair and</li>
            <li>This brush is ok.  </li>
            <li>LOVE Helen of Troy curling brushes/brush irons</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>I do love the brush</li>
            <li>My hair does get caught in the bottom of the barrel sometimes, but still glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>I just love it...............</li>
            <li>If you have nothing to compare it to I guess it would be ok.  </li>
            <li>Today my hair looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li>its okay.</li>
            <li>Love the size, however my hair gets stuck and pulled out where the handle meets the Iron.</li>
            <li>They should make the teeth thicker or use bristles or something to make them more durable.</li>
            <li>But these are great - it&#x27;s just like brushing your hair - or using the old fashioned kind of curlers.  </li>
            <li>I think its okay because it does do shorter hair</li>
            <li>This brush iron is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li>However,  I was able to add some volume by using volumizing mousse and this brush.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way her hair looks</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Helen of Troy curling iron brush.</li>
            <li>Just love this curling brush.</li>
            <li>I used to love this product....would use nothing else.  </li>
            <li>Was really expecting great things from this.</li>
            <li>Was hoping for more.</li>
            <li>It would be much better with a slimmer handle and a rubber grip.</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>The product was shipped quickly and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>The darn thing is EXACTLY what I hoped for!!!  </li>
            <li>This brush iron works well - even with very fine hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and gives my hair a nice smooth finish while turning under the ends.  </li>
            <li>Works wonderful for long hair, and because of the brush no burning of the face and neck as the heated barrel does not touch the skin, also helps to hold air in place while processing the curls.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li>This is a good hot curling brush.</li>
            <li>The Mega Barrel curling iron is excellent for long curly/fuzzy hair.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled with my Helen of Troy Super Mega Brush.</li>
            <li>The barrel heats up to a nice, but not hair-scorching temperature and it heats fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>As seen works, well not too hot, so doesn&#x27;t damage my very fine hair!</li>
            <li>This curling iron is excellent for loose curls.</li>
            <li>So far this is great.  </li>
            <li>I Love how it gives a smooth curl</li>
            <li>It heats quickly and is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>Not only was the price great, but I love the ability to take the tines out and clean them!</li>
            <li>The cord rotates easily ,and the support beneath it keeps it off any surface area.</li>
            <li>This is the most useful styling tool of many I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This takes time to heat up and the switch is easy to shut off inadvertantly while using.</li>
            <li>They are great, gentle on my hair, and worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>The joint was an EASY fix.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li>so when you are trying to style your hair, it is too easy to push the button into the off position.</li>
            <li>My original 13 year old one STILL WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li>and this is perfect for the roller look without having to weigh down your head and have it poked or pulled for hours.  </li>
            <li>The older model had longer bristles and I liked it so much better.  </li>
            <li>I received it in good time but the item itself doesn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li>, it works fine.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and there was basically no body to it at all.</li>
            <li>I think &#x27;super mega&#x27; should be more than 1.5 inches</li>
            <li>If there is a brush out there that holds the hair a little tighter (like a curling iron) it would be perfect.</li>
            <li>This is cheap, works great for big curls on the ends of your hair.   </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why this tool isn&#x27;t readily available in stores.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more powerful curling iron.</li>
            <li>and I feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li>Shame on the maker for making such a fictitious claim and a pox on their house for spoiling an otherwise great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/23/2011  </li>
            <li>This one is the best I could find for everyday use.  </li>
            <li>For those w/fine/medium/normal hair, this is a GREAT TOOL to use daily and NOT DAMAGE your hair.</li>
            <li>This is because the handle is so smooth, it slips.</li>
            <li>Still a great product and I am now using it almost daily.</li>
            <li>You wrap a section of hair around it and hold it there for a few seconds and Voila&#x27; - great looking hair!</li>
            <li>It was cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>The handle is cheap plastic which feels like if you drop it once it will shatter into a thousand pieces.</li>
            <li>I guess these two things were fixed by the manufacturer which is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It takes quite a while to heat to full capacity, more than 30 minutes, and that&#x27;s not even very hot.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to manipulate without burning you fingers, no tangled hair and heats quickly.</li>
            <li>Heat quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>i like quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, does not snag hair and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have long hair and it performs great for me..........</li>
            <li>I still use my ancient Conair hot air brush more often.</li>
            <li>I just love this hot curling iron..</li>
            <li>I really like this product, my hair is longer and this size is great for soft waves and curls.</li>
            <li>The only problem is that the bristles (or more precisely, teeth) break off very easily.  </li>
            <li>However, my favorite and most used model is the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron.  </li>
            <li>This is a pretty good curling iron except for the fact that the heating element took a dump and the thing wasn&#x27;t that old!</li>
            <li>product came as expected, and was delivered in great time.  </li>
            <li>one gives you a nice, soft curl.  </li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
            <li>The conair brush I had before was much sturdier and the settings button more rigid.</li>
            <li>Loved the bigger size Barrell.</li>
            <li>The iron itself never heated up well enough to set my hair and it took a good deal of time for it to even get to</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to love this but had to return it.</li>
            <li>It turns out that a 1 1/2&amp;#34; brush is very large!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a 1 1/2\\&quot; hot brush for some time; there used to be a fair selection but the Helen of Troy brush seems to be the only one available.  </li>
            <li>and they are a much better product in the older brush.  </li>
            <li>In fact, I have one in almost every size; I use the size most appropriate for my then current hair style.  </li>
            <li>I had been searching stores, big box and specialty beauty stores for this type of curling brush, I was very happy to find one at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li>At first it appeared to work ok, then it literally fell apart upon first use &amp; heating element was also broken.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have used this particular curling iron brush before and had been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>The cord does not tangle, it heat quickly and maintains a level heat throughout the sytling process.  </li>
            <li>B0001IVKYG Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\</li>
            <li>The tines of the brush quickly broke off.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with my second Super brush Iron...............</li>
            <li>Nice iron in general.  </li>
            <li>I had used a product similar to this for quite some time and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>, it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li>I thought this would be a nice way to give my hair some shape and smooth out the frizzies instead of pulling a flat iron through or even a curling iron with the clamp...</li>
            <li>Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li>This is my new \\&quot;favorite thing!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This brush works very well though - heats well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I bought the Helen of Troy 1.5\\&quot; curling brush several years ago via Amazon.com and love it!  </li>
            <li>This does exactly what I want it to do!  </li>
            <li>BUY THEM in duplicate and tell HOT not to stop manufacturing!</li>
            <li>the troy hot air brush is the one you want!</li>
            <li>It really controls frizz and helps make your hair super smooth.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a large brush and they are so hard to find, I was very happy to find this one.  </li>
            <li>The large, smooth 1-1/2\\&quot; barrel with built-in brush holds hair and smooths hair - if you don&#x27;t want curls or if you are fighting frizzy hair from humidity.</li>
            <li>It helps tame the frizzies when my hairstyle is a smooth one and is ideal for attaining just the right curve when my hair is styled in a modified bob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this particular model for almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>I love Helen of Troy Professional Brush Irons.  </li>
            <li>Did someone cleverly design this thing so the tines could be easily removed for cleaning?</li>
            <li>And at $20 bucks, it was worth the gamble.</li>
            <li>it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li>Whoever buys it will probably pay 2 dollars for it and that is about what is was worth to me.  </li>
            <li>Loads of nice big waves and curls.  </li>
            <li>I received it   early, have used it often &amp; am completrely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I ended up just not using it because it didn&#x27;t work as good as the standard straight iron does.</li>
            <li>This curling iron has just the right size teeth to grip you hair and comb it out while you curl, and the barrel is large enough to create those big beautiful curls that look so great with long hair!  </li>
            <li>, the new version is much improved - heats up more quickly, is hotter and the switch doesn&#x27;t accidentally move.  </li>
            <li>do have to use the high setting even though my hair is fine.</li>
            <li>The tip is hot -very hot.</li>
            <li>It is WONDERFUL for straight hair to give lift and volume at the roots and to give soft turn up or down at the tips.  </li>
            <li>The on/off switch is right where your hand goes</li>
            <li>and it lays right in that groove.</li>
            <li>barrel size is right, the heat is right</li>
            <li>I have no big gripes about this iron, except that it needs improvement on the   warm up time (takes about 10 minutes to get hot).</li>
            <li>It is soooo much easier to use than a normal smooth curling iron!  </li>
            <li>This seems to be the only kind manufactured almost at all anymore - bought my first one about 13 years ago-Helen of Troy -STILL WORKS</li>
            <li>The only thing it kind of works on is to turn under the ends of my 2 year old&#x27;s baby fine hair.........</li>
            <li>This works GREAT on my baby fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li>Even my hair dresser couldn&#x27;t find one with a barrel this large!  </li>
            <li>Came in mail super fast, too.</li>
            <li>I like tools that make it easier - this one is pretty good, but my hair is not really long enough to get the full benefit.  </li>
            <li>Love it just what I wanted to curl and tame my hair heats up quickly and is easy to use</li>
            <li>I finally found a styling tool that works for my stubborn fine hair!</li>
            <li>I will use this occasionally, but I am still searching for the one I can use every day, quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Was shipped very fast and the whole   thing is a very positive experience.</li>
            <li>I absolutely swear by it!  </li>
            <li>If it heated up to a higher temperature maybe I could deal with the bristles.  </li>
            <li>It gets really hot.........</li>
            <li>Even my stylist complements me on how much volume I get in my hair!</li>
            <li>I love this product BUT noticed in the last couple weeks that the teeth in the brush are breaking off.  </li>
            <li>This curling brush iron is exactly what I was wanting.  </li>
            <li>The plastic on my first one became brittle from the heat and a number of bristles broke off.  </li>
            <li>A word of caution: the metal does get hot enough to burn your ear&#x27;s top if you happen to accidently rest it there.  </li>
            <li>And when it does is not too hot.</li>
            <li>The only thing better is a hairdresser.</li>
            <li>This item came up when I was searching for hot air brushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Also must be aware of the on switch.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, highlighted and shoulder length, and wanted  a curling iron just to smooth out the dry edges and give it body.  </li>
            <li>and I burned myself this first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>I only paid about $20 with shipping, but I should have went out to eat with that money, I would have gotten more for my money.</li>
            <li>thinking it would MAYBE work better with shorter and thinner hair (my hair is fairly coarse).</li>
            <li>and it was my mistake by not reading the full description more carefully before I bought.</li>
            <li>First, there is a plastic tip</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I have the conair 1 1/4 inch hot brush</li>
            <li>I have had so many of these curlers in my lifetime, but not in the last 2 decades.</li>
            <li>It DOES take a while to get REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li>It was ok, but there were several things I did not like.</li>
            <li>It also does not get hot at all.</li>
            <li>I received this item yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li>Recently I dropped mine and shattered the top which holds in the rows of teeth.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this item and the bristles started breaking off after the first use.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>This brush with its larger barrel diffuses the heat better and gives my hair a bit of lift.  </li>
            <li>I am not one to use rushes and irons so hot that they cannot be touched and where your hair is damaged, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything blazing hot.  </li>
            <li>In all my years, I have never had an iron or brush that didn&#x27;t get hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought it because I wanted something that was gentle to my hair, not something that would grab it and not let go!</li>
            <li>Thanks for having this one!</li>
            <li>-- my fine, thin, shoulder-length hair has never looked so full and lovely!  </li>
            <li>It quickly makes my frizzy, coarse, lumpy hair silky smooth and can put in curls, waves or straighten it.</li>
            <li>I am not very good using a curling iron, on myself anyway, so this product is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li>When this finally came back in stock I was thrilled and ordered right away!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why I even decided to give this a try because I own 2 other Helen of Troy products</li>
            <li>But I love a brush iron and they are so hard to find and was glad to get this one.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery and item in new condition when received.  </li>
            <li>I am now replacing my second Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron since the top has cracked and is in danger of coming apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Barely heats up - does not work well even on my fine, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li>If you have at least 1 hour to use the brush maybe ok for you otherwise better to look for another one.</li>
            <li>I HAVE VERY WAVY SLIGHTLY THICK HAIR, I LOVE THIS HOT BRUSH BECAUSE THE HOT BARREL SMOOTHES FRIZZ AND MAKES MY HAIR SHINY AND HEALTHY LOOKING.  </li>
            <li>good enough quality for the low price.</li>
            <li>Also, the product is made so you can slide each row of teeth out for cleaning, which is a great feature, but it&#x27;s very hard to slide the rows out and back in again without breaking more teeth.  </li>
            <li>Great, cheap product that actually works-use HIGH setting, no idea what LOW would do - likely nothing.</li>
            <li>First, the bristles are too short to grip my fine, blunt cut hair.</li>
            <li>It would be perfect if it just heated up a cooled down a little faster, but I can deal with it.</li>
            <li>The only drawbacks are that it is easy to accidentally shut off while curling your hair and your hair gets caught in the barrel and pulls.</li>
            <li>I read the reviews and bought it, slightly worried about the hair catching in the joint.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and has hi and low heat settings and auto turn off.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a curling brush with a large barel.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it to make large curls and straightening.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice curling brush, except that it doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to actually curl hair.  </li>
            <li>And Helen of Troy if you ever make a decent quality curling brush iron, you owe me one!</li>
            <li>I am always suspicious when I read good reviews of a product that they were written by the manufacturer, well this one has been written by a hard to please consumer.</li>
            <li>[...]   Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t wrap around the hair very well.  </li>
            <li>even then it doesn&#x27;t hold the curl very well.  </li>
            <li>I really like this curling iron.</li>
            <li>Just so my hair wasn&#x27;t straight as a board.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this curling brush styles my hair.  </li>
            <li>I have definitely accomplished that control.</li>
            <li>Much easier to avoid burns than with a curling iron.</li>
            <li>Very disappinting.  </li>
            <li>get absolutely NOTHING fro this iron.  </li>
            <li>-probably wouldn&#x27;t help curly hair straighten much at all</li>
            <li>but it was just too much hassle to use it.</li>
            <li>I have found that the newer version heats up MUCH faster, is hotter, and I have no problem with the switch accidentally moving from one position to another.  </li>
            <li>I really like how this styles my hair.  </li>
            <li>but it takes longer than a straight iron does.</li>
            <li>Even using volumizing shampoo doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>Helen of Troy redesigned it and made the bristles much shorter.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t heat up much at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this brush iron but</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair manageable and real curly....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much..........</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s 1 1/2&amp;#34; BUT it would NOT stay heated.  </li>
            <li>Cons: no light to say when it&#x27;s ready, and the tip does get quite warm</li>
            <li>However, it has to be warm enough to actually curl hair.  </li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the job quickly.  </li>
            <li>At first I needed a new one every 2 years</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not always easy to buy a gift such as a curling iron for your better half.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is such a rare find these days!  </li>
            <li>Other than that,  I love it.  </li>
            <li>Also I gave myself a little burn putting my hand on the tip when I first used it, but have been able to avoid repeating this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other irons and This Is The One For Me, try it, you&#x27;ll love it...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat up much, I can still touch it when it&#x27;s on high, which is unusual for a hair iron.</li>
            <li>Smaller versions with 3/4 inch barrels are available, though not a lot of them, but this larger 1 1/2 inch barrel is good for volume when you don&#x27;t want tight curls.</li>
            <li>I did not experience the issue with the hot tip that others have complained about, nor the issue of hair catching at the handle.  </li>
            <li>I heats up quickly and gives your hair soft, natural wave and curl.</li>
            <li>My hair normally takes to these brushes very well.</li>
            <li>I have thin and fine hair that is scorched by most curling irons.  </li>
            <li>They last a long time and makes styling my hair very easy.</li>
            <li>They need to update the photo to represent the \\&quot;new design\\&quot; -- as indicated on the box -- not in the photo!</li>
            <li>THE LESS PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li>I have an older one and compared the teeth</li>
            <li>Frankly, this is the only 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel curling brush on the market from what I could find, so it&#x27;s lucky</li>
            <li>This is the only l 1/2&amp;#34; curling brush I have been able to find in the last 12 yrs or so.  </li>
            <li>so I had only one choice which was the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1 1/2&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Probably very similar to something currently offered on t.v. ads for much more money.</li>
            <li>However, don&#x27;t think it really gets hot enough to do much.</li>
            <li>Obviously not for very short hair, but good for medium to long layers.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I do plug the brush in and turn it on high when I get in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product/name brand to anyone.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get hot enough, took a long time to heat up, and the switch easily moved from the low/high position to off.  </li>
            <li>It feel cheap and not very sturdy.  </li>
            <li>Not hard to avoid once I realized that I needed to.</li>
            <li>I do like the new switch as it does not switch off with normal handling.</li>
            <li>My hair is long enough to just cover the barrel, and it works great for providing a little movement.</li>
            <li>My hair is fairly short and fine,  and the 1-1/2\\&quot; barrel gives it enough body, without curls.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to find one of the new ceramic or ion(?) type irons, but no luck.  </li>
            <li>I managed to fry my curling brush in Italy &amp; needed a new one ASAP.</li>
            <li>I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li>My new curling brush iron is a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li>Time for a new one.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair, I strongly recommend this product only.    </li>
            <li>Only problem is that the end is plastic, and gets too hot to touch.  </li>
            <li>This does not get hot enough!!  </li>
            <li>The tip is the only part that gets hot.....too hot to touch.  </li>
            <li>It took ages to heat up and just never go hot enough.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t quite get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It gets hot enough, but my hair won&#x27;t stay wrapped in it.</li>
            <li>It does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li>It never gets hot enough to affect my hair style at all.</li>
            <li>This does not get hot enough to make an impact on my hair.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li>There is a cool tip, but I have a habit of adjusting my hair, so have to be careful not to touch the barrel.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the fact that the heat is not so intense that it will damage your hair, even when used daily.  </li>
            <li>I took my old iron apart and slid its rows of longer bristles into the new brush.</li>
            <li>Second, the rows of bristles are so far apart that it is easy for my fingers to slip and land on hot iron instead of firm bristles.</li>
            <li>Even better news is that it doesn&#x27;t constantly shut down or blow fuses as the old one did.</li>
            <li>These are very hard to find in the stores and it is nice to order online and have delivered to my door.</li>
            <li>and then it is not at all hot enough to curl hair, no \\&quot;safe\\&quot; area to hold end of brush away from hot curling barrel (hot enough to burn your fingers, but not very hot to curl hair).  </li>
            <li>this product pretty much operates as the other Helen of Troy burshes.  </li>
            <li>I do not like the large handle as it is too big for my hand.</li>
            <li>I would have liked it fine, but there was a bad connection in the cord and it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that has no natural volume.  </li>
            <li>There are ionic stylers in stores that are similar to this (Perfector and InStyler) but the ions are too much for my fine hair and make it limp.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s probably not as hard on my hair as a curling iron or my In-Styler (which I LOVE).</li>
            <li>- it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough even on high and the bristles are very short.</li>
            <li>The reviews on this item seemed very favorable and it looked quite similar to the device already in use.</li>
            <li>Your hair never looks like an iron has touched it - totally natural results.</li>
            <li>Curling irons give me waves that go in unintended directions and take much longer because each clump of hair must be inserted individually.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for to curl my long layered hair..</li>
            <li>Only giving 4 as if it could be a BIT hotter but still adjustable that would be ideal/5, but thanks for not letting me fry my hair.  </li>
            <li>If you want a soft, feathered look to your hair, this is the ticket.  </li>
            <li>&quot; Professional Brush Iron]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you are looking for a well made, long lasting styling tool you may want to consider the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron.  </li>
            <li>At the tip end, I found a grove such that one of the tine strips (blue thingies) could slide right out.</li>
            <li>I red complaints about the tip being too hot before I bought - the tip seems big enough to me, and I certainly didn&#x27;t burn myself</li>
            <li>Perhaps I was being extra cautious in light of those other reviews.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Really a disappointment, because it is otherwise a very nice brush.  </li>
            <li>The large barrel curling iron was exactly what I was looking for but could not fine in stores.</li>
            <li>Plus any other large barrel curling irons are all those clamping style that leave big horizontal bars on your hair and burn way too hot.  </li>
            <li>The rows themselves are not long enough but it works a little better.  </li>
            <li>The low setting doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to create volume.</li>
            <li>I removed the teeth from the older and smaller brush and put them in the newer one.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for many years in the past and will continue to do so in the future.</li>
            <li>I use it pretty much every day and my hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out or singed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this same problem with the smaller Helen of Troy hot brush (1 1/4\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a large curly iron brush for a long time, Can&#x27;t find them that don&#x27;t blow air, this one does not.  </li>
            <li>High and low temps.  </li>
            <li>There are two settings:  High and Low.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stand this new wave of modern curling brushes that blow hot air and frizz up your hair, and most other curling iron brushes have too small a diameter, and way too big of teeth to make the big curvy turn under that I like with my long hair.  </li>
            <li>The plastic tip stays cool enough to touch, so styling is simple and the bristles are close enough together to make curling even my baby-fine locks possible.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many things that just didn&#x27;t work to create lasting volume or were too hard to use.</li>
            <li>It came in new condition, and in only a couple of days!</li>
            <li>Of course my daughter is thrilled when I try another flat iron because she knows she will be getting it for her super thick, coarse hair within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li>Every time it gets bumped or falls on the floor it loses teeth so easily.</li>
            <li>But I recently got a short bob that doesn&#x27;t require much styling</li>
            <li>only problem I see is that you aren&#x27;t going to really get enough heat for major styling.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why there are not other products like this out there.</li>
            <li>Makes for big soft curls...</li>
            <li>The cool tip at the end is too small and I kept burning my finger tips.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m already going to have to replace it because so many of the comb-like teeth have broken off already.  </li>
            <li>The only reason that I bought a new one is that I left mind on vacation which seems to have \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; when I called to ask if they found it in the condo.  </li>
            <li>My hair (I have fine hair) kept getting caught in the little riser on the center of the iron.  </li>
            <li>this product lacks in most areas; it does not get very hot, the on/off switch is in a bad location so as when you are trying to roll your hair around the brush, you inadvertently shut it off,it takes forever to heat up</li>
            <li>Not super hot</li>
            <li>Very economical and usually lasts for several years of daily use.    </li>
            <li>Another downside is the static left behind.  </li>
            <li>And the main thing wrong is that the heat given is much too hot....too hot to touch hair after a brush through.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this style in stores anymore, except hot air brushes and those do not give me as firm a curl.</li>
            <li>It takes a while to get hot and the brush size is just a little too big for my hair.  </li>
            <li>&quot; really gripped my hair, but it would just take me too long as it doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li>love the 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel size but am disappointed that the bristles are much too short and the curling iron brush takes much too long to heat up</li>
            <li>A little too large for my length hair</li>
            <li>I have found that plugging it in for only a few minutes does not allow the brush to get hot enough to do what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just the right diameter - curls aren&#x27;t too tight or loose.</li>
            <li>The only downfall is that the tip is not long enough.</li>
            <li>I get so much volume without the look of tight unruly curls from smaller barrel brushes.</li>
            <li>I do not like straight irons or those little barreled irons.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It works good on my thin hard to wave hair by giving body that lasts through the day but again-</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> I have been very happy with the Helen of Troy Brush Irons ordered.  </li>
            <li> If you have shoulder-length hair, or longer, and don&#x27;t want curls - this is the best &#x27;curling iron&#x27; going.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  </li>
            <li> I use it as my every day styling aid to great looking hair!  </li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t found one like that yet, so the Helen of Troy Brush Iron is really a very good one.  </li>
            <li> This brush iron is great.  </li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy curling iron that I purchased is great.....</li>
            <li> The barrel is a great size and the \\&quot;teeth\\</li>
            <li> So happy I found this at Amazon; it exceeds my expectations.  </li>
            <li> I was so happy to find the 1</li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy curling brush is a great tool for styling hair.  </li>
            <li> I was happy to find this one online.</li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy Brush Iron is a great product.  </li>
            <li> but I always buy one for reserve too lol.  </li>
            <li> This item is great if you want a looser curl.</li>
            <li> Happy</li>
            <li> IT WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Imagine my excitement for it to be a Helen of Troy product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron.</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the product!!</li>
            <li> This does more than a great job!</li>
            <li> Just not an enthusiastic yes!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others over many years, and this is the best!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing for fine hair that has a tendency to frizz at the end.   </li>
            <li> This works but you have to let it heat up for a good five minutes.  </li>
            <li> so I knew that it was a good product...</li>
            <li> The product does now have the \\&quot;solid\\&quot; feel of a good styling tool.  </li>
            <li> Good for added volume.  </li>
            <li> good for fine/medium or damaged hair, so</li>
            <li> Good product</li>
            <li> They work good.  </li>
            <li> The model has been updated, but all good.</li>
            <li> But what good is a curling brush if it doesn&#x27;t curl??</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Favorite hair accessory!</li>
            <li> I just love this product!  </li>
            <li> I just love it!</li>
            <li> and I sure hope Helen of Troy keeps making them!  </li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Sure wish it could be found in a retail outlet!  </li>
            <li> Someone please come out with a 1 1/2 inch hot brush!!!!</li>
            <li> The large barrel creates the perfect style for my hair.  </li>
            <li> This product heats up well, and is one of a kind in terms of barrel width.</li>
            <li> Excellent heating element, never quits, lasts forever, a must have for straight hair.  </li>
            <li> it would be nice if there was an auto-shut off timer that turned the iron off after an hour or so of no use.</li>
            <li> the kind you put on the bottoms of chair legs</li>
            <li> honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything at all for my hair.</li>
            <li> It does a good job gripping my hair, and my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled in it once.</li>
            <li> thanks for the flawless transaction!</li>
            <li> I liked the 1-1/2&amp;#34; barrel -</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for, smoothes my hair, curls my hair and helps it good great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and will purchase more items from this company when the need arises.</li>
            <li> Handles very easily</li>
            <li> Very easy to roll on and off the hair.  </li>
            <li> I have always liked using a curling brush more than a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Price is right and it heats up great.  </li>
            <li> It is perfect for the style I want -- not curls, but large, smooth waves with curve-under at the ends.  </li>
            <li> Also it is almost to hot, it would be great if it had adjustable temp control.</li>
            <li> It does a great job of smoothing out frizziness I get after blow drying (which I have to do to get any body, what a process we go through...)  ; ).</li>
            <li> However, it is a fair price and came quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for many years.</li>
            <li> I packed this in a suitcase (not overstuffed), and so many of the teeth broke off</li>
            <li> Light is good - but this is too light.    </li>
            <li> Glad I found it at Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to make sure I had a backup</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this curling iron for MANY years</li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Love, love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love the size of this curling iron - 1-1/2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> but now they have made it better</li>
            <li> AS WELL, IT IS MORE LIKE A CURLING IRON, BUT I WAS NONE</li>
            <li> Much better for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this curling brush.  </li>
            <li> I am not the most coordinated when it comes to styling my hair and</li>
            <li> This brush is ok.  </li>
            <li> LOVE Helen of Troy curling brushes/brush irons</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> I do love the brush</li>
            <li> My hair does get caught in the bottom of the barrel sometimes, but still glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> I just love it...............</li>
            <li> If you have nothing to compare it to I guess it would be ok.  </li>
            <li> Today my hair looks better than it has in years.</li>
            <li> its okay.</li>
            <li> Love the size, however my hair gets stuck and pulled out where the handle meets the Iron.</li>
            <li> They should make the teeth thicker or use bristles or something to make them more durable.</li>
            <li> But these are great - it&#x27;s just like brushing your hair - or using the old fashioned kind of curlers.  </li>
            <li> I think its okay because it does do shorter hair</li>
            <li> This brush iron is absolutely fantastic!  </li>
            <li> However,  I was able to add some volume by using volumizing mousse and this brush.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way her hair looks</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Helen of Troy curling iron brush.</li>
            <li> Just love this curling brush.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product....would use nothing else.  </li>
            <li> Was really expecting great things from this.</li>
            <li> Was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> It would be much better with a slimmer handle and a rubber grip.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> The product was shipped quickly and I am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> The darn thing is EXACTLY what I hoped for!!!  </li>
            <li> This brush iron works well - even with very fine hair and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and gives my hair a nice smooth finish while turning under the ends.  </li>
            <li> Works wonderful for long hair, and because of the brush no burning of the face and neck as the heated barrel does not touch the skin, also helps to hold air in place while processing the curls.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty good quality.  </li>
            <li> This is a good hot curling brush.</li>
            <li> The Mega Barrel curling iron is excellent for long curly/fuzzy hair.</li>
            <li> I am thrilled with my Helen of Troy Super Mega Brush.</li>
            <li> The barrel heats up to a nice, but not hair-scorching temperature and it heats fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> As seen works, well not too hot, so doesn&#x27;t damage my very fine hair!</li>
            <li> This curling iron is excellent for loose curls.</li>
            <li> So far this is great.  </li>
            <li> I Love how it gives a smooth curl</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and is very easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> Not only was the price great, but I love the ability to take the tines out and clean them!</li>
            <li> The cord rotates easily ,and the support beneath it keeps it off any surface area.</li>
            <li> This is the most useful styling tool of many I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This takes time to heat up and the switch is easy to shut off inadvertantly while using.</li>
            <li> They are great, gentle on my hair, and worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> The joint was an EASY fix.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li> so when you are trying to style your hair, it is too easy to push the button into the off position.</li>
            <li> My original 13 year old one STILL WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> and this is perfect for the roller look without having to weigh down your head and have it poked or pulled for hours.  </li>
            <li> The older model had longer bristles and I liked it so much better.  </li>
            <li> I received it in good time but the item itself doesn&#x27;t live up to my expectations.</li>
            <li> , it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and there was basically no body to it at all.</li>
            <li> I think &#x27;super mega&#x27; should be more than 1.5 inches</li>
            <li> If there is a brush out there that holds the hair a little tighter (like a curling iron) it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> This is cheap, works great for big curls on the ends of your hair.   </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why this tool isn&#x27;t readily available in stores.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more powerful curling iron.</li>
            <li> and I feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> Shame on the maker for making such a fictitious claim and a pox on their house for spoiling an otherwise great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/23/2011  </li>
            <li> This one is the best I could find for everyday use.  </li>
            <li> For those w/fine/medium/normal hair, this is a GREAT TOOL to use daily and NOT DAMAGE your hair.</li>
            <li> This is because the handle is so smooth, it slips.</li>
            <li> Still a great product and I am now using it almost daily.</li>
            <li> You wrap a section of hair around it and hold it there for a few seconds and Voila&#x27; - great looking hair!</li>
            <li> It was cheap but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> The handle is cheap plastic which feels like if you drop it once it will shatter into a thousand pieces.</li>
            <li> I guess these two things were fixed by the manufacturer which is a good thing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It takes quite a while to heat to full capacity, more than 30 minutes, and that&#x27;s not even very hot.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to manipulate without burning you fingers, no tangled hair and heats quickly.</li>
            <li> Heat quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> i like quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, does not snag hair and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and it performs great for me..........</li>
            <li> I still use my ancient Conair hot air brush more often.</li>
            <li> I just love this hot curling iron..</li>
            <li> I really like this product, my hair is longer and this size is great for soft waves and curls.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that the bristles (or more precisely, teeth) break off very easily.  </li>
            <li> However, my favorite and most used model is the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron.  </li>
            <li> This is a pretty good curling iron except for the fact that the heating element took a dump and the thing wasn&#x27;t that old!</li>
            <li> product came as expected, and was delivered in great time.  </li>
            <li> one gives you a nice, soft curl.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s good enough for me.  </li>
            <li> The conair brush I had before was much sturdier and the settings button more rigid.</li>
            <li> Loved the bigger size Barrell.</li>
            <li> The iron itself never heated up well enough to set my hair and it took a good deal of time for it to even get to</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to love this but had to return it.</li>
            <li> It turns out that a 1 1/2&amp;#34; brush is very large!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a 1 1/2\\&quot; hot brush for some time; there used to be a fair selection but the Helen of Troy brush seems to be the only one available.  </li>
            <li> and they are a much better product in the older brush.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I have one in almost every size; I use the size most appropriate for my then current hair style.  </li>
            <li> I had been searching stores, big box and specialty beauty stores for this type of curling brush, I was very happy to find one at such an affordable price.</li>
            <li> At first it appeared to work ok, then it literally fell apart upon first use &amp; heating element was also broken.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used this particular curling iron brush before and had been satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> The cord does not tangle, it heat quickly and maintains a level heat throughout the sytling process.  </li>
            <li> B0001IVKYG Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\</li>
            <li> The tines of the brush quickly broke off.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my second Super brush Iron...............</li>
            <li> Nice iron in general.  </li>
            <li> I had used a product similar to this for quite some time and was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> , it gets very hot.  </li>
            <li> I thought this would be a nice way to give my hair some shape and smooth out the frizzies instead of pulling a flat iron through or even a curling iron with the clamp...</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li> This is my new \\&quot;favorite thing!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This brush works very well though - heats well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I bought the Helen of Troy 1.5\\&quot; curling brush several years ago via Amazon.com and love it!  </li>
            <li> This does exactly what I want it to do!  </li>
            <li> BUY THEM in duplicate and tell HOT not to stop manufacturing!</li>
            <li> the troy hot air brush is the one you want!</li>
            <li> It really controls frizz and helps make your hair super smooth.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a large brush and they are so hard to find, I was very happy to find this one.  </li>
            <li> The large, smooth 1-1/2\\&quot; barrel with built-in brush holds hair and smooths hair - if you don&#x27;t want curls or if you are fighting frizzy hair from humidity.</li>
            <li> It helps tame the frizzies when my hairstyle is a smooth one and is ideal for attaining just the right curve when my hair is styled in a modified bob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this particular model for almost 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I love Helen of Troy Professional Brush Irons.  </li>
            <li> Did someone cleverly design this thing so the tines could be easily removed for cleaning?</li>
            <li> And at $20 bucks, it was worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  </li>
            <li> Whoever buys it will probably pay 2 dollars for it and that is about what is was worth to me.  </li>
            <li> Loads of nice big waves and curls.  </li>
            <li> I received it   early, have used it often &amp; am completrely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I ended up just not using it because it didn&#x27;t work as good as the standard straight iron does.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has just the right size teeth to grip you hair and comb it out while you curl, and the barrel is large enough to create those big beautiful curls that look so great with long hair!  </li>
            <li> , the new version is much improved - heats up more quickly, is hotter and the switch doesn&#x27;t accidentally move.  </li>
            <li> do have to use the high setting even though my hair is fine.</li>
            <li> The tip is hot -very hot.</li>
            <li> It is WONDERFUL for straight hair to give lift and volume at the roots and to give soft turn up or down at the tips.  </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is right where your hand goes</li>
            <li> and it lays right in that groove.</li>
            <li> barrel size is right, the heat is right</li>
            <li> I have no big gripes about this iron, except that it needs improvement on the   warm up time (takes about 10 minutes to get hot).</li>
            <li> It is soooo much easier to use than a normal smooth curling iron!  </li>
            <li> This seems to be the only kind manufactured almost at all anymore - bought my first one about 13 years ago-Helen of Troy -STILL WORKS</li>
            <li> The only thing it kind of works on is to turn under the ends of my 2 year old&#x27;s baby fine hair.........</li>
            <li> This works GREAT on my baby fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> Even my hair dresser couldn&#x27;t find one with a barrel this large!  </li>
            <li> Came in mail super fast, too.</li>
            <li> I like tools that make it easier - this one is pretty good, but my hair is not really long enough to get the full benefit.  </li>
            <li> Love it just what I wanted to curl and tame my hair heats up quickly and is easy to use</li>
            <li> I finally found a styling tool that works for my stubborn fine hair!</li>
            <li> I will use this occasionally, but I am still searching for the one I can use every day, quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> Was shipped very fast and the whole   thing is a very positive experience.</li>
            <li> I absolutely swear by it!  </li>
            <li> If it heated up to a higher temperature maybe I could deal with the bristles.  </li>
            <li> It gets really hot.........</li>
            <li> Even my stylist complements me on how much volume I get in my hair!</li>
            <li> I love this product BUT noticed in the last couple weeks that the teeth in the brush are breaking off.  </li>
            <li> This curling brush iron is exactly what I was wanting.  </li>
            <li> The plastic on my first one became brittle from the heat and a number of bristles broke off.  </li>
            <li> A word of caution: the metal does get hot enough to burn your ear&#x27;s top if you happen to accidently rest it there.  </li>
            <li> And when it does is not too hot.</li>
            <li> The only thing better is a hairdresser.</li>
            <li> This item came up when I was searching for hot air brushes on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Also must be aware of the on switch.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, highlighted and shoulder length, and wanted  a curling iron just to smooth out the dry edges and give it body.  </li>
            <li> and I burned myself this first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> I only paid about $20 with shipping, but I should have went out to eat with that money, I would have gotten more for my money.</li>
            <li> thinking it would MAYBE work better with shorter and thinner hair (my hair is fairly coarse).</li>
            <li> and it was my mistake by not reading the full description more carefully before I bought.</li>
            <li> First, there is a plastic tip</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have the conair 1 1/4 inch hot brush</li>
            <li> I have had so many of these curlers in my lifetime, but not in the last 2 decades.</li>
            <li> It DOES take a while to get REALLY hot.  </li>
            <li> It was ok, but there were several things I did not like.</li>
            <li> It also does not get hot at all.</li>
            <li> I received this item yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  </li>
            <li> Recently I dropped mine and shattered the top which holds in the rows of teeth.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this item and the bristles started breaking off after the first use.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> This brush with its larger barrel diffuses the heat better and gives my hair a bit of lift.  </li>
            <li> I am not one to use rushes and irons so hot that they cannot be touched and where your hair is damaged, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything blazing hot.  </li>
            <li> In all my years, I have never had an iron or brush that didn&#x27;t get hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought it because I wanted something that was gentle to my hair, not something that would grab it and not let go!</li>
            <li> Thanks for having this one!</li>
            <li> -- my fine, thin, shoulder-length hair has never looked so full and lovely!  </li>
            <li> It quickly makes my frizzy, coarse, lumpy hair silky smooth and can put in curls, waves or straighten it.</li>
            <li> I am not very good using a curling iron, on myself anyway, so this product is the next best thing.  </li>
            <li> When this finally came back in stock I was thrilled and ordered right away!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why I even decided to give this a try because I own 2 other Helen of Troy products</li>
            <li> But I love a brush iron and they are so hard to find and was glad to get this one.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery and item in new condition when received.  </li>
            <li> I am now replacing my second Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron since the top has cracked and is in danger of coming apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Barely heats up - does not work well even on my fine, thinning hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have at least 1 hour to use the brush maybe ok for you otherwise better to look for another one.</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY WAVY SLIGHTLY THICK HAIR, I LOVE THIS HOT BRUSH BECAUSE THE HOT BARREL SMOOTHES FRIZZ AND MAKES MY HAIR SHINY AND HEALTHY LOOKING.  </li>
            <li> good enough quality for the low price.</li>
            <li> Also, the product is made so you can slide each row of teeth out for cleaning, which is a great feature, but it&#x27;s very hard to slide the rows out and back in again without breaking more teeth.  </li>
            <li> Great, cheap product that actually works-use HIGH setting, no idea what LOW would do - likely nothing.</li>
            <li> First, the bristles are too short to grip my fine, blunt cut hair.</li>
            <li> It would be perfect if it just heated up a cooled down a little faster, but I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> The only drawbacks are that it is easy to accidentally shut off while curling your hair and your hair gets caught in the barrel and pulls.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and bought it, slightly worried about the hair catching in the joint.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and has hi and low heat settings and auto turn off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a curling brush with a large barel.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it to make large curls and straightening.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice curling brush, except that it doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to actually curl hair.  </li>
            <li> And Helen of Troy if you ever make a decent quality curling brush iron, you owe me one!</li>
            <li> I am always suspicious when I read good reviews of a product that they were written by the manufacturer, well this one has been written by a hard to please consumer.</li>
            <li> [...]   Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t wrap around the hair very well.  </li>
            <li> even then it doesn&#x27;t hold the curl very well.  </li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron.</li>
            <li> Just so my hair wasn&#x27;t straight as a board.  </li>
            <li> I really like how this curling brush styles my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have definitely accomplished that control.</li>
            <li> Much easier to avoid burns than with a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Very disappinting.  </li>
            <li> get absolutely NOTHING fro this iron.  </li>
            <li> -probably wouldn&#x27;t help curly hair straighten much at all</li>
            <li> but it was just too much hassle to use it.</li>
            <li> I have found that the newer version heats up MUCH faster, is hotter, and I have no problem with the switch accidentally moving from one position to another.  </li>
            <li> I really like how this styles my hair.  </li>
            <li> but it takes longer than a straight iron does.</li>
            <li> Even using volumizing shampoo doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> Helen of Troy redesigned it and made the bristles much shorter.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up much at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this brush iron but</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair manageable and real curly....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much..........</li>
            <li> I really like that it&#x27;s 1 1/2&amp;#34; BUT it would NOT stay heated.  </li>
            <li> Cons: no light to say when it&#x27;s ready, and the tip does get quite warm</li>
            <li> However, it has to be warm enough to actually curl hair.  </li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the job quickly.  </li>
            <li> At first I needed a new one every 2 years</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always easy to buy a gift such as a curling iron for your better half.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is such a rare find these days!  </li>
            <li> Other than that,  I love it.  </li>
            <li> Also I gave myself a little burn putting my hand on the tip when I first used it, but have been able to avoid repeating this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other irons and This Is The One For Me, try it, you&#x27;ll love it...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up much, I can still touch it when it&#x27;s on high, which is unusual for a hair iron.</li>
            <li> Smaller versions with 3/4 inch barrels are available, though not a lot of them, but this larger 1 1/2 inch barrel is good for volume when you don&#x27;t want tight curls.</li>
            <li> I did not experience the issue with the hot tip that others have complained about, nor the issue of hair catching at the handle.  </li>
            <li> I heats up quickly and gives your hair soft, natural wave and curl.</li>
            <li> My hair normally takes to these brushes very well.</li>
            <li> I have thin and fine hair that is scorched by most curling irons.  </li>
            <li> They last a long time and makes styling my hair very easy.</li>
            <li> They need to update the photo to represent the \\&quot;new design\\&quot; -- as indicated on the box -- not in the photo!</li>
            <li> THE LESS PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> I have an older one and compared the teeth</li>
            <li> Frankly, this is the only 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel curling brush on the market from what I could find, so it&#x27;s lucky</li>
            <li> This is the only l 1/2&amp;#34; curling brush I have been able to find in the last 12 yrs or so.  </li>
            <li> so I had only one choice which was the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1 1/2&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> Probably very similar to something currently offered on t.v. ads for much more money.</li>
            <li> However, don&#x27;t think it really gets hot enough to do much.</li>
            <li> Obviously not for very short hair, but good for medium to long layers.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I do plug the brush in and turn it on high when I get in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product/name brand to anyone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get hot enough, took a long time to heat up, and the switch easily moved from the low/high position to off.  </li>
            <li> It feel cheap and not very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Not hard to avoid once I realized that I needed to.</li>
            <li> I do like the new switch as it does not switch off with normal handling.</li>
            <li> My hair is long enough to just cover the barrel, and it works great for providing a little movement.</li>
            <li> My hair is fairly short and fine,  and the 1-1/2\\&quot; barrel gives it enough body, without curls.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find one of the new ceramic or ion(?) type irons, but no luck.  </li>
            <li> I managed to fry my curling brush in Italy &amp; needed a new one ASAP.</li>
            <li> I ordered a new one.</li>
            <li> My new curling brush iron is a piece of garbage.</li>
            <li> Time for a new one.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, I strongly recommend this product only.    </li>
            <li> Only problem is that the end is plastic, and gets too hot to touch.  </li>
            <li> This does not get hot enough!!  </li>
            <li> The tip is the only part that gets hot.....too hot to touch.  </li>
            <li> It took ages to heat up and just never go hot enough.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t quite get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It gets hot enough, but my hair won&#x27;t stay wrapped in it.</li>
            <li> It does not get hot enough.  </li>
            <li> It never gets hot enough to affect my hair style at all.</li>
            <li> This does not get hot enough to make an impact on my hair.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> There is a cool tip, but I have a habit of adjusting my hair, so have to be careful not to touch the barrel.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the fact that the heat is not so intense that it will damage your hair, even when used daily.  </li>
            <li> I took my old iron apart and slid its rows of longer bristles into the new brush.</li>
            <li> Second, the rows of bristles are so far apart that it is easy for my fingers to slip and land on hot iron instead of firm bristles.</li>
            <li> Even better news is that it doesn&#x27;t constantly shut down or blow fuses as the old one did.</li>
            <li> These are very hard to find in the stores and it is nice to order online and have delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> and then it is not at all hot enough to curl hair, no \\&quot;safe\\&quot; area to hold end of brush away from hot curling barrel (hot enough to burn your fingers, but not very hot to curl hair).  </li>
            <li> this product pretty much operates as the other Helen of Troy burshes.  </li>
            <li> I do not like the large handle as it is too big for my hand.</li>
            <li> I would have liked it fine, but there was a bad connection in the cord and it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that has no natural volume.  </li>
            <li> There are ionic stylers in stores that are similar to this (Perfector and InStyler) but the ions are too much for my fine hair and make it limp.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s probably not as hard on my hair as a curling iron or my In-Styler (which I LOVE).</li>
            <li> - it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough even on high and the bristles are very short.</li>
            <li> The reviews on this item seemed very favorable and it looked quite similar to the device already in use.</li>
            <li> Your hair never looks like an iron has touched it - totally natural results.</li>
            <li> Curling irons give me waves that go in unintended directions and take much longer because each clump of hair must be inserted individually.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for to curl my long layered hair..</li>
            <li> Only giving 4 as if it could be a BIT hotter but still adjustable that would be ideal/5, but thanks for not letting me fry my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you want a soft, feathered look to your hair, this is the ticket.  </li>
            <li> &quot; Professional Brush Iron]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you are looking for a well made, long lasting styling tool you may want to consider the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron.  </li>
            <li> At the tip end, I found a grove such that one of the tine strips (blue thingies) could slide right out.</li>
            <li> I red complaints about the tip being too hot before I bought - the tip seems big enough to me, and I certainly didn&#x27;t burn myself</li>
            <li> Perhaps I was being extra cautious in light of those other reviews.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Really a disappointment, because it is otherwise a very nice brush.  </li>
            <li> The large barrel curling iron was exactly what I was looking for but could not fine in stores.</li>
            <li> Plus any other large barrel curling irons are all those clamping style that leave big horizontal bars on your hair and burn way too hot.  </li>
            <li> The rows themselves are not long enough but it works a little better.  </li>
            <li> The low setting doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to create volume.</li>
            <li> I removed the teeth from the older and smaller brush and put them in the newer one.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years in the past and will continue to do so in the future.</li>
            <li> I use it pretty much every day and my hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out or singed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this same problem with the smaller Helen of Troy hot brush (1 1/4\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a large curly iron brush for a long time, Can&#x27;t find them that don&#x27;t blow air, this one does not.  </li>
            <li> High and low temps.  </li>
            <li> There are two settings:  High and Low.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand this new wave of modern curling brushes that blow hot air and frizz up your hair, and most other curling iron brushes have too small a diameter, and way too big of teeth to make the big curvy turn under that I like with my long hair.  </li>
            <li> The plastic tip stays cool enough to touch, so styling is simple and the bristles are close enough together to make curling even my baby-fine locks possible.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many things that just didn&#x27;t work to create lasting volume or were too hard to use.</li>
            <li> It came in new condition, and in only a couple of days!</li>
            <li> Of course my daughter is thrilled when I try another flat iron because she knows she will be getting it for her super thick, coarse hair within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> Every time it gets bumped or falls on the floor it loses teeth so easily.</li>
            <li> But I recently got a short bob that doesn&#x27;t require much styling</li>
            <li> only problem I see is that you aren&#x27;t going to really get enough heat for major styling.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why there are not other products like this out there.</li>
            <li> Makes for big soft curls...</li>
            <li> The cool tip at the end is too small and I kept burning my finger tips.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m already going to have to replace it because so many of the comb-like teeth have broken off already.  </li>
            <li> The only reason that I bought a new one is that I left mind on vacation which seems to have \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; when I called to ask if they found it in the condo.  </li>
            <li> My hair (I have fine hair) kept getting caught in the little riser on the center of the iron.  </li>
            <li> this product lacks in most areas; it does not get very hot, the on/off switch is in a bad location so as when you are trying to roll your hair around the brush, you inadvertently shut it off,it takes forever to heat up</li>
            <li> Not super hot</li>
            <li> Very economical and usually lasts for several years of daily use.    </li>
            <li> Another downside is the static left behind.  </li>
            <li> And the main thing wrong is that the heat given is much too hot....too hot to touch hair after a brush through.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this style in stores anymore, except hot air brushes and those do not give me as firm a curl.</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get hot and the brush size is just a little too big for my hair.  </li>
            <li> &quot; really gripped my hair, but it would just take me too long as it doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> love the 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel size but am disappointed that the bristles are much too short and the curling iron brush takes much too long to heat up</li>
            <li> A little too large for my length hair</li>
            <li> I have found that plugging it in for only a few minutes does not allow the brush to get hot enough to do what I want it to do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the right diameter - curls aren&#x27;t too tight or loose.</li>
            <li> The only downfall is that the tip is not long enough.</li>
            <li> I get so much volume without the look of tight unruly curls from smaller barrel brushes.</li>
            <li> I do not like straight irons or those little barreled irons.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It works good on my thin hard to wave hair by giving body that lasts through the day but again-</li>
            <li> when I went to use the Helen of Troy Super Mega it didn&#x27;t do my hair because I have thick long hair.</li>
            <li> However, the Helen of Troy far exceeds the other product.</li>
            <li> That combo finally did the trick and my hair doesn&#x27;t go flat five minutes after I style it!</li>
            <li> The first one Amazon offered was discontinued (conair 1 1/2&amp;#34; with hard bristles)</li>
            <li> I have used this brush when I had long hair to give it body and short hair to turn the ends under.  </li>
            <li> And the curls last a long timr</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it is flat</li>
            <li> The brush tips are too far apart to hold your hair tight enough to wrap around and curl.</li>
            <li> Flat irons give my baby fine shoulder length hair horrible static.</li>
            <li> One thing that should be pointed out is that this model DOES NOT have two of the major problems that other reviewers cited.  </li>
            <li> I wanted big, loose curls.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find large curling brushes at the store however.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for being my go to source of hard to find products.</li>
            <li> one a long time ago</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a brush iron for a long time and didn&#x27;t even know that Amazon had it.  </li>
            <li> It seems to take a long time for me to get any body in my hair when I use this instead of my curling iron.</li>
            <li> it takes too long to use.  </li>
            <li> have a lot of very thin, fine, curly hair.</li>
            <li> But this last one was made so cheaply it only lasted about 3 months - compared to years that I had owned the previous models.</li>
            <li> It takes too long to heat up and not hot enough to do anything to your hair.</li>
            <li> Still not hot enough.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not because the iron goes out or stops working its because I&#x27;ve left it somewhere during travel or for some other reason that wasn&#x27;t the iron&#x27;s fault.  </li>
            <li> This purchase is to have an EXTRA on on hand when my other one decides to quit working, which I&#x27;ve had for about five years now</li>
            <li> I live in an area where finding certain things in the local stores is next to impossible.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product at lease 2 or three times in the past and have always been very satisfied with it; however the one I just received recently - and it is the same model as the ones I have purchased in the past -  have much shorter &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; , which makes it VERY difficult to wind your hair around!  </li>
            <li> It probably heats for 20 minutes during my shower and while I dry my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and could not live without it.  </li>
            <li> Loose looking curls are added to my hair.  </li>
            <li> The switch does not stay on because it is so loose.  </li>
            <li> Used it one time and already the cord is loose causing the iron to shut off.</li>
            <li> The power button is too loose</li>
            <li> Recently the old one stopped working after several years of daily use, and I was unable to find the size 1 1/2&amp;#34; anywhere.</li>
            <li> I had a very hard time finding one this large.  </li>
            <li> They are round, like a tube, not flat.  </li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> so I purchased a second curling brush a few weeks ago.  </li>
            <li> I can use this while reading with minimal effort.</li>
            <li> had trouble with my hair getting caught in that grove next to the handle (as another reviewer mentioned), but I can see how that could happen</li>
            <li> I started looking for a brush iron a year or so ago and could only find the 3/4\\&quot; irons or the 1+ inch round air brushes.</li>
            <li> I have to be so careful not to burn my fingers.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I read all reviews before I purchased and people either loved it or hated it.  </li>
            <li> Today I was using my brush iron and just releasing my hair when there was a flash, spark, a puff of black smoke and hot cinders fell onto my hand leaving soot behind (I have a photo).  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this brush to anyone with thick wavy hair, it will tame it immediately</li>
            <li> I have purchased it over the past 10 years about 4 different times.  </li>
            <li> First of all it is difficult to find a (non-ceramic) curling Iron in a 1&amp;#34; diameter.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing I have to say about it is the on/off switch is very loose and keeps turning off while I&#x27;m using it, so you have to be careful that you keep your finger on the switch while using it.</li>
            <li> I have never gotten the hang of using a hairdrier in one hand and a styling brush in the other.</li>
            <li> not sure it would do much on coarse hair</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I usually buy mine at a local store, but they&#x27;ve decided not to carry it anymore.  </li>
            <li> I had to use a smaller size that was not appropriate for my hair length.</li>
            <li> The large handle makes it difficult to use.  </li>
            <li> The brush is not made of hard plastic bristles, which is a vast improvement, IMO.  </li>
            <li> The bristles are too short and hard for give a curl at the end....</li>
            <li> The only major problem is what I consider a design flaw:  the joint between the barrel and the handle isn&#x27;t covered, which means if you&#x27;re not extremely careful to keep your hair toward the tip of the barrel, it&#x27;ll get caught--and it&#x27;s painful.  </li>
            <li> The only negative thing is that it does not automatically shut off after a period of time.</li>
            <li> HOwever, the handle part is illuminated when it is on, so you have at least a visual indication that it is still on.</li>
            <li> I probably use the brush on an average of once a week and ordered the brush in January of 2013.  </li>
            <li> Even with being careful I burned myself a few times.  </li>
            <li> just incase I need another one years down the road.</li>
            <li> Be careful and hold tight!</li>
            <li> I had owned  one previously</li>
            <li> I use this daily and have used an earlier model for years until the heating element turned on and off randomly.</li>
            <li> I thought I would never find another one and a half inch one.</li>
            <li> I have looked hard &amp; long for this size curling brush.</li>
            <li> Now for the bad part: They advertise the product thusly  \\&quot;Cool Tip for Styling</li>
            <li> If I am careful it doesn&#x27;t happen but I am usually in a hurry in the morning</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disgusted but tired of returning inferior merchandise in general.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Conair makes a 1 1/4 inch curling brush with auto shutoff, but it makes my hair too tightly curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The small iron is just too small for long hair and the air brushes are cumbersome and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> The handle is a little fat to hold.  </li>
            <li> I would say the teeth are less than half an inch!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve burnt my thumb a few times since recieving the brush iron.</li>
            <li> I invariably lose a few valuable strands a day, no matter how I try to prevent it.</li>
            <li> Depending on my hair&#x27;s mood, a few strokes and I am through.</li>
            <li> If you have a lot of hair don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It now lives at the back of my drawer with the other useless things.</li>
            <li> but at least there are other brands from which to choose.</li>
            <li> but my hair is very thick and long</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work on my thick hair, not hot enough :</li>
            <li> BULKY, HEAVY AND CLUMSY FEELING</li>
            <li> Not sure why because I haven&#x27;t dropped it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want small curls.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Through all those years and almost daily use, I have never had this brand and model of brush fail to heat up.  </li>
            <li> This tip is too small to hold</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I got what I paid for and no more.  </li>
            <li> I have gone though 3 of these over the past years.  </li>
            <li> (an iron) w. very few bristles.</li>
            <li> If you have the conair first you will hate this brush.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick wavy hair and this cuts my styling time in half.      </li>
            <li> It literally fell apart the very first time I used it, very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why these are so hard to find???</li>
            <li> This type of iron is hard to find in stores.</li>
            <li> even the cord is not yet hard or damaged AT ALL.</li>
            <li> i looked forever for this type of hard bristle curling iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get it to grip my hair though with the brush</li>
            <li> This product is flimsy to say the least.</li>
            <li> But I took some thick stick-on felt, you know--</li>
            <li> There no way my thick wavy hair is going to wrap around it.</li>
            <li> It broke as soon as i tried to use it, im not sure if its defective or just poor quality</li>
            <li> iron has some serious QC problems.</li>
            <li> I always keep a spare on hand since they are impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> It is very hard to find in this size.  </li>
            <li> THIS TYPE OF ELECTRIC HAIR BRUSH IS VERY HARD TO FIND IN THE STORES, I BOUGHT 3 OF THEM WHEN I SAW THEM ON AMAZON.  </li>
            <li> It was worse 10-12 yrs ago</li>
            <li> However, the follow through on this is poor.  </li>
            <li> I HATE flat irons!</li>
            <li> I am giving it two stars because the teeth on the barrel are made of a very  weak plastic.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed because this is the only brush iron of this size I can find.</li>
            <li> Makes it difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> , UNABLE TO  MANAGE IT.</li>
            <li> Since stores don&#x27;t carry them, it&#x27;s useless to look around for 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel brushes.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t find this out until I was in Florida on vacation after I threw away receipts and packaging.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it died after about 8 years of use...</li>
            <li> I found it awkward and difficult to work with, And I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find at stores</li>
            <li> It is all around a bad product.  </li>
            <li> so I assume it&#x27;s just bad quality.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when i opened the box.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very inconvenient and thus annoying to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I hate rollers</li>
            <li> that is that your hair can get caught on the one side which is annoying but doesn&#x27;t hurt to pull your hair out.  </li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product!!  </li>
            <li> Also, the placement of the On/Off switch is terrible because as you are trying to curl your hair it keeps switching to Off.  </li>
            <li> but the bristles are a bit shorter than I thought and worst of all</li>
            <li> Horrible!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have been using this product for 10 years,  I never burn myself and it doesen&#x27;t damage my hair.  I heats up quickly and gives your hair soft, natural wave and curl.</li>
            <li> I have used this brush for many years. They last a long time and makes styling my hair very easy.</li>
            <li> Turned it on 5 mins after receiving it....barrel broke away from unit.  Left heating element exposed and singed hair.  Also burned my hand to get the barrel out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the Helen of Troy Brush Irons ordered.  These are very hard to find in the stores and it is nice to order online and have delivered to my door.</li>
            <li> This is the only curling brush I could find in the size I needed.  Only problem is that the end is plastic, and gets too hot to touch.  Makes it difficult to work with.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not always easy to buy a gift such as a curling iron for your better half. The reviews on this item seemed very favorable and it looked quite similar to the device already in use. As it turns out it&#x27;s been used and given a two thumbs up. Even better news is that it doesn&#x27;t constantly shut down or blow fuses as the old one did. That in itself rates a &#x27;five star&#x27; from me!</li>
            <li> If you have shoulder-length hair, or longer, and don&#x27;t want curls - this is the best &#x27;curling iron&#x27; going. The large, smooth 1-1/2\\&quot; barrel with built-in brush holds hair and smooths hair - if you don&#x27;t want curls or if you are fighting frizzy hair from humidity. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> The only curling iron/brush I can use.</li>
            <li> I finally found a styling tool that works for my stubborn fine hair! I&#x27;ve tried so many things that just didn&#x27;t work to create lasting volume or were too hard to use. I&#x27;ve never mastered regular curling irons that have a clamp. I don&#x27;t understand why this tool isn&#x27;t readily available in stores. Smaller versions with 3/4 inch barrels are available, though not a lot of them, but this larger 1 1/2 inch barrel is good for volume when you don&#x27;t want tight curls. I&#x27;m actually going to order a second one to have on hand in case something happens to this one. There are ionic stylers in stores that are similar to this (Perfector and InStyler) but the ions are too much for my fine hair and make it limp. This one is not ionic and works better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to use the high setting even though my hair is fine. The low setting doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to create volume.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is such a rare find these days!  I absolutely swear by it!  I can&#x27;t stand this new wave of modern curling brushes that blow hot air and frizz up your hair, and most other curling iron brushes have too small a diameter, and way too big of teeth to make the big curvy turn under that I like with my long hair.  Plus any other large barrel curling irons are all those clamping style that leave big horizontal bars on your hair and burn way too hot.  This curling iron has just the right size teeth to grip you hair and comb it out while you curl, and the barrel is large enough to create those big beautiful curls that look so great with long hair!  Just like this!  [...]   Highly reccomended!</li>
            <li> this product lacks in most areas; it does not get very hot, the on/off switch is in a bad location so as when you are trying to roll your hair around the brush, you inadvertently shut it off,it takes forever to heat up and then it is not at all hot enough to curl hair, no \\&quot;safe\\&quot; area to hold end of brush away from hot curling barrel (hot enough to burn your fingers, but not very hot to curl hair).  I&#x27;m planning to return the item as soon as I find a replacement....any suggestions out there?</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product!!  This does not get hot enough!!  Bristles are too short and they are flexible....so they don&#x27;t wrap around the hair very well.  If it heated up to a higher temperature maybe I could deal with the bristles.  The tip is the only part that gets hot.....too hot to touch.  Your hair gets caught in between a gap at the end of the barrel and the handle and rips your hair out.  Also, the placement of the On/Off switch is terrible because as you are trying to curl your hair it keeps switching to Off.  It is all around a bad product.  The only thing it kind of works on is to turn under the ends of my 2 year old&#x27;s baby fine hair.........even then it doesn&#x27;t hold the curl very well.  Still not hot enough.  I don&#x27;t know why I even decided to give this a try because I own 2 other Helen of Troy products and I don&#x27;t care for them either.  Go with the Conair Instant Heat 1.25 inch with the 25 settings.  It gets really hot.........I just wish the barrel was bigger.  I don&#x27;t understand why these are so hard to find???</li>
            <li> The large barrel creates the perfect style for my hair.  Loose looking curls are added to my hair.  I get so much volume without the look of tight unruly curls from smaller barrel brushes. Excellent product.  I can only order this curling brush online.  I have looked in every local drugstore and even beauty product supply stores for this size styling brush without any luck.  Keep the product in production.  I use it as my every day styling aid to great looking hair!  Even my stylist complements me on how much volume I get in my hair!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t work on my thick hair, not hot enough :/&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep looking for a more powerful curling iron.</li>
            <li> Works great! The only negative thing is that it does not automatically shut off after a period of time. HOwever, the handle part is illuminated when it is on, so you have at least a visual indication that it is still on. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product heats up well, and is one of a kind in terms of barrel width. I am giving it two stars because the teeth on the barrel are made of a very  weak plastic. I packed this in a suitcase (not overstuffed), and so many of the teeth broke off I can no longer use this.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AT ALL. BULKY, HEAVY AND CLUMSY FEELING, UNABLE TO  MANAGE IT. SENT IT BACK...</li>
            <li> This brush iron is great.  Works wonderful for long hair, and because of the brush no burning of the face and neck as the heated barrel does not touch the skin, also helps to hold air in place while processing the curls.  Makes for big soft curls...</li>
            <li> I love this product BUT noticed in the last couple weeks that the teeth in the brush are breaking off.  I have an older one and compared the teeth and they are a much better product in the older brush.  I probably use the brush on an average of once a week and ordered the brush in January of 2013.  They usually last for years.  I removed the teeth from the older and smaller brush and put them in the newer one.  I have not used it yet so can&#x27;t attest to how well that is going to work.  I hope the company goes to another manufacturer for the teeth as I do like this curling brush.</li>
            <li> I really like this curling iron. It really controls frizz and helps make your hair super smooth. The only downfall is that the tip is not long enough. Be careful. I&#x27;ve burnt my thumb a few times since recieving the brush iron.</li>
            <li> This curling iron has been the best hair utility item I have ever owned.  I have purchased it over the past 10 years about 4 different times.  It&#x27;s not because the iron goes out or stops working its because I&#x27;ve left it somewhere during travel or for some other reason that wasn&#x27;t the iron&#x27;s fault.  It is WONDERFUL for straight hair to give lift and volume at the roots and to give soft turn up or down at the tips.  Your hair never looks like an iron has touched it - totally natural results. Excellent heating element, never quits, lasts forever, a must have for straight hair.  Only 2 downfalls - 1. it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find at stores and I have to always order it online.  2. it would be nice if there was an auto-shut off timer that turned the iron off after an hour or so of no use. (In case I walk out the door and accidentally leave it on.) Otherwise - this iron is the BEST!</li>
            <li> Favorite hair accessory!</li>
            <li> This works but you have to let it heat up for a good five minutes.  It works good on my thin hard to wave hair by giving body that lasts through the day but again- you have to let it heat up.</li>
            <li> Nice iron in general.  Price is right and it heats up great.  The only drawbacks are that it is easy to accidentally shut off while curling your hair and your hair gets caught in the barrel and pulls.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best curling irons I have ever used.  It heats quickly and is very easy to handle.  The product was shipped quickly and I am very satisfied.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Mine just broke after years of use, came here to get another. Since stores don&#x27;t carry them, it&#x27;s useless to look around for 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel brushes.  Agree with the reviews about the design flaw in the switch.  But I took some thick stick-on felt, you know--the kind you put on the bottoms of chair legs so they don&#x27;t scratch the floor, cut a tiny piece, and stuck it on the switch while it was in the ON position.  Problem solved--it stayed there for years and the iron never shut off while I was using it again.  The wires in the cord finally broke--otherwise having the iron switch permanently ON seemed to cause no problems whatsoever.  Try it!</li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy curling iron that I purchased is great.....I had owned  one previously so I knew that it was a good product...</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed when i opened the box.  The product does now have the \\&quot;solid\\&quot; feel of a good styling tool.  Light is good - but this is too light.    It took ages to heat up and just never go hot enough.  I have been using Conair for years, and this just doesn&#x27;t compare.    The barrel is a great size and the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; really gripped my hair, but it would just take me too long as it doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough for my thick hair.</li>
            <li> This type of iron is hard to find in stores. Glad I found it at Amazon.  I have no big gripes about this iron, except that it needs improvement on the   warm up time (takes about 10 minutes to get hot). My hair is fairly short and fine,  and the 1-1/2\\&quot; barrel gives it enough body, without curls.</li>
            <li> I have been looking and looking for a 1 1/2\\&quot; brush iron.  I was hoping to find one of the new ceramic or ion(?) type irons, but no luck.  I am thrilled with my Helen of Troy Super Mega Brush.</li>
            <li> I have always liked using a curling brush more than a curling iron.  It&#x27;s hard to find large curling brushes at the store however.  I bought the Helen of Troy 1.5\\&quot; curling brush several years ago via Amazon.com and love it!  I wanted to make sure I had a backup so I purchased a second curling brush a few weeks ago.  It&#x27;s definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> So happy I found this at Amazon; it exceeds my expectations.  Handles very easily and I feel comfortable using it.</li>
            <li> Frankly, this is the only 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel curling brush on the market from what I could find, so it&#x27;s lucky it&#x27;s pretty good quality.  The barrel heats up to a nice, but not hair-scorching temperature and it heats fairly quickly.  The plastic tip stays cool enough to touch, so styling is simple and the bristles are close enough together to make curling even my baby-fine locks possible.    The only major problem is what I consider a design flaw:  the joint between the barrel and the handle isn&#x27;t covered, which means if you&#x27;re not extremely careful to keep your hair toward the tip of the barrel, it&#x27;ll get caught--and it&#x27;s painful.  I invariably lose a few valuable strands a day, no matter how I try to prevent it.</li>
            <li> Only one concern. After 4 months some of the &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; on the barrel came off. Not sure why because I haven&#x27;t dropped it. Other than that,  I love it.  It is soooo much easier to use than a normal smooth curling iron!  I would recommend to friends.</li>
            <li> This curling brush iron is exactly what I was wanting.  I didn&#x27;t want small curls.  I wanted big, loose curls.  Just so my hair wasn&#x27;t straight as a board.  This does exactly what I want it to do!  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I live in an area where finding certain things in the local stores is next to impossible. I was so happy to find the 1 1/2\\&quot; brush curling iron on this site.  It came in new condition, and in only a couple of days!</li>
            <li> I actually bought this to use on short hair; just to give volume and turn the ends under.  It works wonderfully for that.  My hair is long enough to just cover the barrel, and it works great for providing a little movement. I&#x27;ve read complaints that the hair tangles on it.  I have not had that problem.  Very easy to roll on and off the hair.  I do wish it had an automatic turn-off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Now for the bad part: They advertise the product thusly  \\&quot;Cool Tip for Styling Control\\&quot;.  Now that is a total piece of fiction.  The tip is hot -very hot. If you need to use both hands to curl your hair, then walk on by; you cannot use your fingertips to guide the curling brush.  Shame on the maker for making such a fictitious claim and a pox on their house for spoiling an otherwise great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/23/2011  I am editing this review to warn that using this curling iron on the highest setting will definitely burn the hair.  I stopped using it, but had to have my hair cut very short several times to get rid of the burned ends.</li>
            <li> I love Helen of Troy Professional Brush Irons.  In fact, I have one in almost every size; I use the size most appropriate for my then current hair style.  However, my favorite and most used model is the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron.  It helps tame the frizzies when my hairstyle is a smooth one and is ideal for attaining just the right curve when my hair is styled in a modified bob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this particular model for almost 20 years.  The plastic on my first one became brittle from the heat and a number of bristles broke off.  I am now replacing my second Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron since the top has cracked and is in danger of coming apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through all those years and almost daily use, I have never had this brand and model of brush fail to heat up.  I particularly like the fact that the heat is not so intense that it will damage your hair, even when used daily.  A word of caution: the metal does get hot enough to burn your ear&#x27;s top if you happen to accidently rest it there.  I do plug the brush in and turn it on high when I get in the shower.  It probably heats for 20 minutes during my shower and while I dry my hair. I have found that plugging it in for only a few minutes does not allow the brush to get hot enough to do what I want it to do.  I always unplug the brush when I am done using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a well made, long lasting styling tool you may want to consider the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron.  I&#x27;ve used this product for many years in the past and will continue to do so in the future.</li>
            <li> First of all it is difficult to find a (non-ceramic) curling Iron in a 1&amp;#34; diameter.  This one is the best I could find for everyday use.  I have very short hair and it does it&#x27;s job in curling my hair the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve looked everywhere for a curling brush with a large barel.  This one is just perfect !!!  Love it !!!</li>
            <li> I really like how this curling brush styles my hair.  It gives just enough curl.  I only wish the teeth weren&#x27;t so fragile.  Every time it gets bumped or falls on the floor it loses teeth so easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this curling iron for MANY years and I love it.  I broke one of mine on a trip and I could find none that were it&#x27;s equal.  I have very long hair and I hate rollers and this is perfect for the roller look without having to weigh down your head and have it poked or pulled for hours.  I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  Scream, probably.  You do need to have experience with using a curling brush and have some finesse with it so as not to get entangled in it though.  I have definitely accomplished that control.</li>
            <li> It just take for ever to heat. And when it does is not too hot. If you have at least 1 hour to use the brush maybe ok for you otherwise better to look for another one.</li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy curling brush is a great tool for styling hair.  I have used this brush when I had long hair to give it body and short hair to turn the ends under.  This is the second brush I have purchased and have been using this brand for over 10 years.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I had used a product similar to this for quite some time and was very pleased with it. However, the Helen of Troy far exceeds the other product. It is easy to manipulate without burning you fingers, no tangled hair and heats quickly. The cord rotates easily ,and the support beneath it keeps it off any surface area. I will be purchasing another one for travel use. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This is a good hot curling brush. I only wish it had an auto turn-off - you know how frazzled you can be in the morning!  This brush works very well though - heats well and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and could not live without it.  I do not like straight irons or those little barreled irons.&lt;br /&gt;This one gives you a nice, soft curl.  I always keep one as a spare.</li>
            <li> Love, love this product.  It is very hard to find in this size.  I have used this product for over 20 years.  The only reason that I bought a new one is that I left mind on vacation which seems to have \\&quot;disappeared\\&quot; when I called to ask if they found it in the condo.  The only draw back if you want to call it that is that your hair can get caught on the one side which is annoying but doesn&#x27;t hurt to pull your hair out.  If I am careful it doesn&#x27;t happen but I am usually in a hurry in the morning and I am not necessarily in front of a mirror when I use it.  I would highly recommend this product.  I considered buying two because I fear that at some point they will stop manufacturing this product.  I did buy two but in different sizes.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this curling iron - 1-1/2\\&quot;.  I had a very hard time finding one this large.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is the on/off switch is very loose and keeps turning off while I&#x27;m using it, so you have to be careful that you keep your finger on the switch while using it.</li>
            <li> Barely heats up - does not work well even on my fine, thinning hair.  It just doesn&#x27;t get any heat to it.</li>
            <li> This is the most useful styling tool of many I have ever tried. The only thing better is a hairdresser. It quickly makes my frizzy, coarse, lumpy hair silky smooth and can put in curls, waves or straighten it. Curling irons give me waves that go in unintended directions and take much longer because each clump of hair must be inserted individually. This is used like a brush. Depending on my hair&#x27;s mood, a few strokes and I am through. I have never gotten the hang of using a hairdrier in one hand and a styling brush in the other. I can use this while reading with minimal effort. Design flaws: Occasionally I get a piece of hair caught in the seam between the brush and the attachment. Not hard to avoid once I realized that I needed to. Also I gave myself a little burn putting my hand on the tip when I first used it, but have been able to avoid repeating this. Much easier to avoid burns than with a curling iron. I use it pretty much every day and my hair doesn&#x27;t look dried out or singed. I am always suspicious when I read good reviews of a product that they were written by the manufacturer, well this one has been written by a hard to please consumer.</li>
            <li> Been waiting for this iron..,.had one a long time ago and I thought they quit making it but now they have made it better</li>
            <li> Even my hair dresser couldn&#x27;t find one with a barrel this large!  The barrel is also longer than it appears in this image.  Exactly what I&#x27;ve been searching for to curl my long layered hair..High and low temps.  Great product!</li>
            <li> This item came up when I was searching for hot air brushes on Amazon. Obviously I didn&#x27;t read the description well enough, but when it came and I realized what it was I decided I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I honestly didn&#x27;t feel like it did anything at all for my hair. I found it awkward and difficult to work with, And I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why there are not other products like this out there. This is the best thing for fine hair that has a tendency to frizz at the end.   Excellent product, and I&#x27;m tempted to buy another one just incase I need another one years down the road. Was shipped very fast and the whole   thing is a very positive experience. Thank YOu!!</li>
            <li> I am not very good using a curling iron, on myself anyway, so this product is the next best thing.  If there is a brush out there that holds the hair a little tighter (like a curling iron) it would be perfect. I haven&#x27;t found one like that yet, so the Helen of Troy Brush Iron is really a very good one.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for the size.  All I could find in the stores were the skinny rods, this one is perfect.  It does a good job gripping my hair, and my hair hasn&#x27;t gotten tangled in it once.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good curling iron except for the fact that the heating element took a dump and the thing wasn&#x27;t that old!</li>
            <li> I managed to fry my curling brush in Italy &amp; needed a new one ASAP. I was happy to find this one online. Not only was the price great, but I love the ability to take the tines out and clean them! Great product!</li>
            <li> I HAVE VERY WAVY SLIGHTLY THICK HAIR, I LOVE THIS HOT BRUSH BECAUSE THE HOT BARREL SMOOTHES FRIZZ AND MAKES MY HAIR SHINY AND HEALTHY LOOKING.  I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE A HAIR DRYER AS WELL, IT IS MORE LIKE A CURLING IRON, BUT I WAS NONE THE LESS PLEASED WITH THE RESULTS.</li>
            <li> So far this is great.  I am just not use to waiting for it to heat up.&lt;br /&gt;But I Love how it gives a smooth curl</li>
            <li> this product pretty much operates as the other Helen of Troy burshes.  It doesn&#x27;t quite get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Great product.  A little too large for my length hair so I purchased the identical curling brush with a 1\\&quot; barrel.  Much better for me.  I&#x27;ll keep them both in case I decide to try a longer style.  Watch out for the end of the barrel though, it gets very hot.  Also must be aware of the on switch.  Has a tendency to get turned off while in use.</li>
            <li> Pros: it&#x27;s big and simple. Cons: no light to say when it&#x27;s ready, and the tip does get quite warm (thus the four stars).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t had trouble with my hair getting caught in that grove next to the handle (as another reviewer mentioned), but I can see how that could happen and I&#x27;m being careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curiously, when I got it, I thought there was a defect. At the tip end, I found a grove such that one of the tine strips (blue thingies) could slide right out. Then I noticed the end could be tightened and positioned so this would not happen. Did someone cleverly design this thing so the tines could be easily removed for cleaning? Well, that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to use the grove for.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, highlighted and shoulder length, and wanted  a curling iron just to smooth out the dry edges and give it body.  This does more than a great job! My hair looks great!</li>
            <li> This tip is too small to hold and I burned myself this first time I used it.  The brush tips are too far apart to hold your hair tight enough to wrap around and curl. It gets hot enough, but my hair won&#x27;t stay wrapped in it. I only paid about $20 with shipping, but I should have went out to eat with that money, I would have gotten more for my money.</li>
            <li> I had been searching stores, big box and specialty beauty stores for this type of curling brush, I was very happy to find one at such an affordable price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I just love this product!  I have been looking for a brush iron for a long time and didn&#x27;t even know that Amazon had it.  Quick delivery and item in new condition when received.  I just love it!</li>
            <li> I received it in good time but the item itself doesn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. It doesn&#x27;t heat up much, I can still touch it when it&#x27;s on high, which is unusual for a hair iron. It now lives at the back of my drawer with the other useless things.</li>
            <li> This brush iron works well - even with very fine hair and is easy to use. So far I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> The Helen of Troy Brush Iron is a great product.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with it and will purchase more items from this company when the need arises.</li>
            <li> At first it appeared to work ok, then it literally fell apart upon first use &amp; heating element was also broken.&lt;br /&gt;A piece of trash!!!</li>
            <li> Very disappinting.  The switch does not stay on because it is so loose.  Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t find this out until I was in Florida on vacation after I threw away receipts and packaging.  Mine may be a lemon but I would not advise anyone to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, curly hair.  I love this curling brush.  It is easy to use and gives my hair a nice smooth finish while turning under the ends.  I have several of them for home travel, etc.  It is one product that my hair does not get tangled in.  It would be perfect if it just heated up a cooled down a little faster, but I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a nice way to give my hair some shape and smooth out the frizzies instead of pulling a flat iron through or even a curling iron with the clamp...&lt;br /&gt;I was WAY WRONG.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get absolutely NOTHING fro this iron.  I can&#x27;t even get my hair to heat up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking it would MAYBE work better with shorter and thinner hair (my hair is fairly coarse).</li>
            <li> It turns out that a 1 1/2&amp;#34; brush is very large!  I am not the most coordinated when it comes to styling my hair and I like tools that make it easier - this one is pretty good, but my hair is not really long enough to get the full benefit.  Also, it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to do the job quickly.  I will use this occasionally, but I am still searching for the one I can use every day, quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be a blow dryer as well as a brush.  But I&#x27;m making it work and it was my mistake by not reading the full description more carefully before I bought.</li>
            <li> This brush is ok.  Good for added volume.  One thing that should be pointed out is that this model DOES NOT have two of the major problems that other reviewers cited.  First, there is a plastic tip so you can grab it on the end without burning your fingers. Second, there is NO GAP where hair gets caught when rolling.  I guess these two things were fixed by the manufacturer which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I see is that you aren&#x27;t going to really get enough heat for major styling.  But I recently got a short bob that doesn&#x27;t require much styling so it&#x27;s good enough for me.  And at $20 bucks, it was worth the gamble.</li>
            <li> LOVE Helen of Troy curling brushes/brush irons whatever they&#x27;re called! This seems to be the only kind manufactured almost at all anymore - bought my first one about 13 years ago-Helen of Troy -STILL WORKS but I buy extras for travel, second home, etc, and in case they ever stop making them! Not super hot so 1. good for fine/medium or damaged hair, so 2. not sure it would do much on coarse hair -probably wouldn&#x27;t help curly hair straighten much at all but I can&#x27;t say for sure. For those w/fine/medium/normal hair, this is a GREAT TOOL to use daily and NOT DAMAGE your hair. Recently I tried the newest Conair flatirons on MEDIUM/20-25 setting and BURNED MY HAIR-in decades I&#x27;ve never done that-so forget it-back to these Helen of Troy brush irons. My original 13 year old one STILL WORKS GREAT even the cord is not yet hard or damaged AT ALL. Great, cheap product that actually works-use HIGH setting, no idea what LOW would do - likely nothing. Only giving 4 as if it could be a BIT hotter but still adjustable that would be ideal/5, but thanks for not letting me fry my hair.  BUY THEM in duplicate and tell HOT not to stop manufacturing! Came in mail super fast, too. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Love it just what I wanted to curl and tame my hair heats up quickly and is easy to use</li>
            <li> This is the only l 1/2&amp;#34; curling brush I have been able to find in the last 12 yrs or so.  I do love the brush but I always buy one for reserve too lol.  At first I needed a new one every 2 years but I had the last one for 6 yrs.  The only problem I&#x27;ve had with them is eventually the cord attached to the iron starts to short out.  It was worse 10-12 yrs ago but like I said, the last one worked for 6 yrs and gets used every day.  They have to die sometime and I sure hope Helen of Troy keeps making them!  I can&#x27;t use a curling iron.</li>
            <li> Does not get very hot.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron because it has a brush. Although it works well, every time I use it I drop it! This is because the handle is so smooth, it slips. It has no grooves in it like the Conair models have. Be careful and hold tight!</li>
            <li> Really enjoying the product!! It is exactly what I was looking for, smoothes my hair, curls my hair and helps it good great.  It heats well and handles well in my hand.  My hair does get caught in the bottom of the barrel sometimes, but still glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> product came as expected, and was delivered in great time.  thanks for the flawless transaction!</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my second Super brush Iron...............This iron is the only product that I can curl my hair with..I have long hair and it performs great for me..........This is the only curling brush iron I will ever  purchase.................I just love it...............If you have long hair, I strongly recommend this product only.    Thank-you,    Cindy Grover</li>
            <li> I have the conair 1 1/4 inch hot brush but my hair is very thick and long so I wanted a bigger barrell.  This was all I could find. I read all reviews before I purchased and people either loved it or hated it.  If you have the conair first you will hate this brush.  If you have nothing to compare it to I guess it would be ok.  The cool tip at the end is too small and I kept burning my finger tips.  The on/off switch is right where your hand goes so you have to keep switching it back on.  It does not get hot enough.  If you have a lot of hair don&#x27;t waste your money.  I&#x27;ve gone back to using my conair.  Wish it was bigger but it always makes my hair look great! I donated mine to a thrift store.  I paid for shipping and by the time I paid to have it shipped back it just wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Whoever buys it will probably pay 2 dollars for it and that is about what is was worth to me.  Someone please come out with a 1 1/2 inch hot brush!!!!</li>
            <li> This takes time to heat up and the switch is easy to shut off inadvertantly while using. However, it is a fair price and came quickly. Just not an enthusiastic yes!</li>
            <li> It seems to take a long time for me to get any body in my hair when I use this instead of my curling iron. But it&#x27;s probably not as hard on my hair as a curling iron or my In-Styler (which I LOVE).</li>
            <li> I would have liked it fine, but there was a bad connection in the cord and it wouldn&#x27;t stay on.  Sent it back for a refund and ordered the similar product by Conair.  I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This is my third curling brush iron in 20 years.  They are great, gentle on my hair, and worth the purchase.  The only reason I replace is because I wear it out.  I have yet to find a hair iron that works this well.</li>
            <li> It never gets hot enough to affect my hair style at all. Also, the on/off switch turns off at the slightest bump or touch while styling. I am very disappointed because this is the only brush iron of this size I can find.</li>
            <li> I have had so many of these curlers in my lifetime, but not in the last 2 decades. Flat irons give my baby fine shoulder length hair horrible static. I HATE flat irons! Of course my daughter is thrilled when I try another flat iron because she knows she will be getting it for her super thick, coarse hair within a few weeks.  I started looking for a brush iron a year or so ago and could only find the 3/4\\&quot; irons or the 1+ inch round air brushes. The small iron is just too small for long hair and the air brushes are cumbersome and ineffective.  Desperation led me to the web where I found this one. OMG.. could it be the same iron I had in the 70&#x27;s? I think so!!! Yay! I read the reviews and bought it, slightly worried about the hair catching in the joint.  Got it yesterday and tried it out.  1. It DOES take a while to get REALLY hot.  2. My hair does get caught in that joint, which is totally unacceptable.  3. The darn thing is EXACTLY what I hoped for!!!  The joint was an EASY fix. Goody sells SILICONE rubberbands. They are round, like a tube, not flat.  Double one of those up and it lays right in that groove. Silicone can take that heat no problem and it TOTALLY resolves the caught hair issue.  The brush is not made of hard plastic bristles, which is a vast improvement, IMO.  This is cheap, works great for big curls on the ends of your hair.   Today my hair looks better than it has in years. Loads of nice big waves and curls.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This does not get hot enough to make an impact on my hair. I used it several times and could not get a curl. I can hold my fingers on it and not burn.</li>
            <li> I have had the same brush curling iron from Helen of Troy for about 10 years. It still worked, but was taking 8-10 minutes to heat up. I ordered a new one. Looked the same in the picture; I didn&#x27;t give it a 2nd thought. I can&#x27;t find this style in stores anymore, except hot air brushes and those do not give me as firm a curl. My new curling brush iron is a piece of garbage. First, the bristles are too short to grip my fine, blunt cut hair. Second, the rows of bristles are so far apart that it is easy for my fingers to slip and land on hot iron instead of firm bristles. Third, my hair catches where the iron meets the handle. Hurts, and I lose hair every time I use it. Fourth, STILL does not have auto shutoff. I took my old iron apart and slid its rows of longer bristles into the new brush. The rows themselves are not long enough but it works a little better.  I still use my ancient Conair hot air brush more often. Conair makes a 1 1/4 inch curling brush with auto shutoff, but it makes my hair too tightly curled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disgusted but tired of returning inferior merchandise in general. I do not recommend. Don&#x27;t waste your money! And Helen of Troy if you ever make a decent quality curling brush iron, you owe me one!</li>
            <li> i looked forever for this type of hard bristle curling iron. The first one Amazon offered was discontinued (conair 1 1/2&amp;#34; with hard bristles) so I had only one choice which was the Helen of Troy Super Mega 1 1/2&amp;#34; . barrel size is right, the heat is right but the bristles are a bit shorter than I thought and worst of all there isn&#x27;t enough room at the end of the barrel to hold onto without getting your fingers burned. And believe me anyone that&#x27;s ever used a curling iron knows you have to hold on to the end to use it properly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still a working girl, so I use this product every morning.  My hair is longer and I like the way it styles it.</li>
            <li> It looked like something that I can use ... but it was just too much hassle to use it. It takes too long to heat up and not hot enough to do anything to your hair.It was just not for me but I can see someone with plenty of time to spend on their hair will appreciate it.</li>
            <li> For looser curls its okay. It&#x27;s hard to get it to grip my hair though with the brush</li>
            <li> Love the size, however my hair gets stuck and pulled out where the handle meets the Iron. Also it is almost to hot, it would be great if it had adjustable temp control.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find anything like this in local stores.&lt;br /&gt;Love this curling brush. Hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled up and it&#x27;s easy to handle.</li>
            <li> I owned a 1 1/2\\&quot; Helen of Troy curling brush for several years of non-daily use before it finally conked out.  It was ok, but there were several things I did not like. It didn&#x27;t get hot enough, took a long time to heat up, and the switch easily moved from the low/high position to off.  Before you knew it, the iron was turned off!  I have found that the newer version heats up MUCH faster, is hotter, and I have no problem with the switch accidentally moving from one position to another.  There is a cool tip, but I have a habit of adjusting my hair, so have to be careful not to touch the barrel.  Seems obvious, doesn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;In summary, the new version is much improved - heats up more quickly, is hotter and the switch doesn&#x27;t accidentally move.  I would recommend it to make large curls and straightening.  Obviously not for very short hair, but good for medium to long layers.  Good product so far!&lt;br /&gt;Addendum:  Still a great product and I am now using it almost daily. Recommend, especially at the price!</li>
            <li> I really like how this styles my hair.  The only problem is that the bristles (or more precisely, teeth) break off very easily.  I&#x27;ve only had this product a couple of months and I&#x27;m already going to have to replace it because so many of the comb-like teeth have broken off already.  Also, the product is made so you can slide each row of teeth out for cleaning, which is a great feature, but it&#x27;s very hard to slide the rows out and back in again without breaking more teeth.  They should make the teeth thicker or use bristles or something to make them more durable.</li>
            <li> I have looked hard &amp; long for this size curling brush. I received it   early, have used it often &amp; am completrely satisfied. Yay!!!</li>
            <li> The brush does not heat up enough to curl your hair.  I returned the one I ordered.</li>
            <li> I cannot use a &amp;#34;curling iron&amp;#34; - totally uncoordinated.  But these are great - it&#x27;s just like brushing your hair - or using the old fashioned kind of curlers.  You wrap a section of hair around it and hold it there for a few seconds and Voila&#x27; - great looking hair!</li>
            <li> It takes a while to get hot and the brush size is just a little too big for my hair.  Other than that, it works fine.</li>
            <li> Today I was using my brush iron and just releasing my hair when there was a flash, spark, a puff of black smoke and hot cinders fell onto my hand leaving soot behind (I have a photo).  Thank goodness my hair didn&#x27;t catch fire.  I&#x27;ve had some curling irons for over 10 years that never literally &amp;#34;burned out&amp;#34; on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I wanted to use electricity to curl my hair, I wouldn&#x27;t have bought an iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This iron has some serious QC problems.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find these in stores anymore. Love it!</li>
            <li> good enough quality for the low price.Probably very similar to something currently offered on t.v. ads for much more money.</li>
            <li> when I went to use the Helen of Troy Super Mega it didn&#x27;t do my hair because I have thick long hair. I ended up just not using it because it didn&#x27;t work as good as the standard straight iron does. I think its okay because it does do shorter hair but it takes longer than a straight iron does. It also does not get hot at all.</li>
            <li> If you want a soft, feathered look to your hair, this is the ticket.  Heat quickly and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Was a gift for mom; can&#x27;t find them in the stores; is the only type of hair curling device she uses, so I bought her two. She&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Wow!  I received this item yesterday and used it for the first time this morning.  I wish I would have had this years and years ago -- my fine, thin, shoulder-length hair has never looked so full and lovely!  It is perfect for the style I want -- not curls, but large, smooth waves with curve-under at the ends.  I love it!  I did not experience the issue with the hot tip that others have complained about, nor the issue of hair catching at the handle.  Perhaps I was being extra cautious in light of those other reviews.  I will order a second one to have as a back-up.  This is my new \\&quot;favorite thing!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This brush iron is absolutely fantastic!  I have long, fine hair that has no natural volume.  Even using volumizing shampoo doesn&#x27;t do much.  However,  I was able to add some volume by using volumizing mousse and this brush.  That combo finally did the trick and my hair doesn&#x27;t go flat five minutes after I style it!</li>
            <li> This item is great if you want a looser curl. I have medium length hair and it gives me just enough wave.</li>
            <li> Girlfriend says it works great! She has used it several times now and I love the way her hair looks so I guess I must agree.</li>
            <li> I have used this particular curling iron brush before and had been satisfied with it. Helen of Troy redesigned it and made the bristles much shorter. Not like the one pictured here. I end up burning my hand or my head. They need to make them longer. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others over many years, and this is the best! It&#x27;s just the right diameter - curls aren&#x27;t too tight or loose. It does a great job of smoothing out frizziness I get after blow drying (which I have to do to get any body, what a process we go through...)  ; ). Every once in a while, the product is unavailable, so I get a couple whenever I order.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product at lease 2 or three times in the past and have always been very satisfied with it; however the one I just received recently - and it is the same model as the ones I have purchased in the past -  have much shorter &amp;#34;teeth&amp;#34; , which makes it VERY difficult to wind your hair around!  Please, PLEASE, please, go back to the longer teeth!!!! B.W. Shipman</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a large curly iron brush for a long time, Can&#x27;t find them that don&#x27;t blow air, this one does not.  It is a curling iron brush and I love it.</li>
            <li> not what i thought it would be.  it takes too long to use.  i like quick and easy. the troy hot air brush is the one you want!</li>
            <li> I think &#x27;super mega&#x27; should be more than 1.5 inches but I knew this before purchase.&lt;br /&gt;I have a lot of very thin, fine, curly hair. Tons of body. My hair normally takes to these brushes very well. Bottom line, this brush just doesn&#x27;t heat up enough. I can&#x27;t imagine what it would (or wouldn&#x27;t) do to thicker hair. Ditch this one and go with Conair.</li>
            <li> As seen works, well not too hot, so doesn&#x27;t damage my very fine hair! Use it every day! Heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> Used it one time and already the cord is loose causing the iron to shut off. Packaging looked untampered with so I assume it&#x27;s just bad quality.</li>
            <li> I love the Helen of Troy curling iron brush. I works wonderfully in my thin/fine hair.And the curls last a long timr</li>
            <li> My wife insists on purchasing this brand of curling iron, but can no longer find them in stores. She was very happy I found it here.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t heat up much at all. Doesn&#x27;t curl or lift my hair at all. It was cheap but you get what you pay for. Ended up donating to goodwill.</li>
            <li> Works great! have recommended to friends and relatives I ordered different sizes. I am very happy with my purchases. Happy</li>
            <li> I really like this brush iron but the model now has to short of bristles.  I have to be so careful not to burn my fingers.  Even with being careful I burned myself a few times.  The older model had longer bristles and I liked it so much better.  But I love a brush iron and they are so hard to find and was glad to get this one.</li>
            <li> The Mega Barrel curling iron is excellent for long curly/fuzzy hair. I&#x27;ve tried other irons and This Is The One For Me, try it, you&#x27;ll love it...</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 4 years.  Recently I dropped mine and shattered the top which holds in the rows of teeth.  Time for a new one.  I usually buy mine at a local store, but they&#x27;ve decided not to carry it anymore.  I was lost without this.  I have very thick wavy hair and this cuts my styling time in half.      I found it on Amazon and purchased two of them so that I have a spare.  Living without this curling brush for 2 weeks proved to me that I don&#x27;t want to be without it.    This wand does not overheat, or damage the hair.  The cord does not tangle, it heat quickly and maintains a level heat throughout the sytling process.  Very economical and usually lasts for several years of daily use.    I would highly recommend this brush to anyone with thick wavy hair, it will tame it immediately and you&#x27;ll be very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Just love this curling brush. You can&#x27;t find this size for some reason in the stores. I may have to order another for my daughter and another for me as a spare.</li>
            <li> This product is flimsy to say the least. The handle is cheap plastic which feels like if you drop it once it will shatter into a thousand pieces. The power button is too loose so when you are trying to style your hair, it is too easy to push the button into the off position. The conair brush I had before was much sturdier and the settings button more rigid. Unfortunately it died after about 8 years of use...I doubt I will get 1 year with this brush.</li>
            <li> I use this daily and have used an earlier model for years until the heating element turned on and off randomly. I do not like the large handle as it is too big for my hand. The bristles are too short and hard for give a curl at the end....hair slides out. And the main thing wrong is that the heat given is much too hot....too hot to touch hair after a brush through. I do like the new switch as it does not switch off with normal handling.</li>
            <li> THIS TYPE OF ELECTRIC HAIR BRUSH IS VERY HARD TO FIND IN THE STORES, I BOUGHT 3 OF THEM WHEN I SAW THEM ON AMAZON.  IT WORKS GREAT</li>
            <li> Hair gets caught between the iron and the handle - ouch.  I got what I paid for and no more.  It did not last a year and I only used it about once a week.  So it cost me 2 bucks a month.</li>
            <li> I used to love this product....would use nothing else.  But this last one was made so cheaply it only lasted about 3 months - compared to years that I had owned the previous models.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a 1 1/2\\&quot; hot brush for some time; there used to be a fair selection but the Helen of Troy brush seems to be the only one available.  It takes quite a while to heat to full capacity, more than 30 minutes, and that&#x27;s not even very hot.  Another downside is the static left behind.  I&#x27;ve had this same problem with the smaller Helen of Troy hot brush (1 1/4\\&quot;) but at least there are other brands from which to choose.</li>
            <li> Was really expecting great things from this. Loved the bigger size Barrell. However, don&#x27;t think it really gets hot enough to do much. I have fine hair and there was basically no body to it at all. Was very disappointed. Was hoping for more.</li>
            <li> The large handle makes it difficult to use.  It would be much better with a slimmer handle and a rubber grip.</li>
            <li> It rips your hair out.  Stay away.</li>
            <li> I looked everywhere for something like this. Imagine my excitement for it to be a Helen of Troy product at a great price. Thanks Amazon for being my go to source of hard to find products. This works GREAT on my baby fine and thin hair.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a large brush and they are so hard to find, I was very happy to find this one.  It literally fell apart the very first time I used it, very disappointed, don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. Heats up quickly, does not snag hair and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have gone though 3 of these over the past years.  They work good.  They last longer than a lot of curling iron I have had before.  I will keep using this brand of curling iron!</li>
            <li> Excellent service.  I have used this curling iron for years and although my iron still works, I thought it necessary to keep a spare on hand.  This curling iron is excellent for loose curls.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  This purchase is to have an EXTRA on on hand when my other one decides to quit working, which I&#x27;ve had for about five years now and it works as well as it did the day I took it out of the box!</li>
            <li> I purchased this Brush Iron for my daughter as a Christmas Gift, she requested this size for herself.  She just loves it.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t get hot enough</li>
            <li> Have used this for years. Recently the old one stopped working after several years of daily use, and I was unable to find the size 1 1/2&amp;#34; anywhere. I had to use a smaller size that was not appropriate for my hair length. When this finally came back in stock I was thrilled and ordered right away! The model has been updated, but all good. Am considering buying a second one to have on hand.</li>
            <li> I like this.  It was just what I expected.  The handle is a little fat to hold.  But it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> I received the item today and the \\&quot;teeth\\&quot; are way shorter than in the photo. I would say the teeth are less than half an inch! There no way my thick wavy hair is going to wrap around it. I&#x27;m returning it without even opening the box. They need to update the photo to represent the \\&quot;new design\\&quot; -- as indicated on the box -- not in the photo!</li>
            <li> It is the only iron I care to use. Sure wish it could be found in a retail outlet!  Hint hint</li>
            <li> I have used this type of brush before and it has lasted approx.7 years.This is my second one that I have bought.I would highly recommend this product/name brand to anyone.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item and the bristles started breaking off after the first use.</li>
            <li> I liked the 1-1/2&amp;#34; barrel - it was exactly what I wanted.  However, the follow through on this is poor.  It feel cheap and not very sturdy.  My hair (I have fine hair) kept getting caught in the little riser on the center of the iron.  The iron itself never heated up well enough to set my hair and it took a good deal of time for it to even get to it&#x27;s hottest point.  I returned it and will be searching for something else.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, my hair is longer and this size is great for soft waves and curls. It is easy to handle and has hi and low heat settings and auto turn off.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize it is flat (an iron) w. very few bristles. It looks like a brush in the ad.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0001IVKYG Helen of Troy Super Mega 1-1/2\\&quot; Professional Brush Iron]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel size but am disappointed that the bristles are much too short and the curling iron brush takes much too long to heat up - it&#x27;s very inconvenient and thus annoying to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never buy this product except for the 1 1/2\\&quot; barrel size.</li>
            <li> I have thin and fine hair that is scorched by most curling irons.  This brush with its larger barrel diffuses the heat better and gives my hair a bit of lift.  I always keep a spare on hand since they are impossible to find locally.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice curling brush, except that it doesn&#x27;t get nearly hot enough to actually curl hair.  There are two settings:  High and Low.  The &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; setting does not even produce a curl immediately after taking the brush out of your hair.  I am not one to use rushes and irons so hot that they cannot be touched and where your hair is damaged, so I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything blazing hot.  However, it has to be warm enough to actually curl hair.  In all my years, I have never had an iron or brush that didn&#x27;t get hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really a disappointment, because it is otherwise a very nice brush.  But what good is a curling brush if it doesn&#x27;t curl??</li>
            <li> Bought it because I wanted something that was gentle to my hair, not something that would grab it and not let go! Granted, I have longer hair but I would like to keep it. Horrible!</li>
            <li> I just love this hot curling iron..It really makes my hair manageable and real curly....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much..........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cynthia B. Grover</li>
            <li> It broke as soon as i tried to use it, im not sure if its defective or just poor quality</li>
            <li> I bought this and returned it the same day I received it.  I really like that it&#x27;s 1 1/2&amp;#34; BUT it would NOT stay heated.  I was really hoping to love this but had to return it.</li>
            <li> It is great! I thought I would never find another one and a half inch one. Thanks for having this one!</li>
            <li> The tines of the brush quickly broke off.</li>
            <li> Not enough heat to do anything</li>
            <li> I red complaints about the tip being too hot before I bought - the tip seems big enough to me, and I certainly didn&#x27;t burn myself - it doesn&#x27;t get hot enough even on high and the bristles are very short. Didn&#x27;t think it worked  well at all.</li>
            <li> The large barrel curling iron was exactly what I was looking for but could not fine in stores. Thank you.</li>
