            <li>this is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;i really love it if you are a makeup artist</li>
            <li>i think its a most have</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Love love love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using it often, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li>It came in less than two weeks which was awesome.</li>
            <li>Not only does this feel like great quality</li>
            <li>easy clean up, and fully adjustable.  </li>
            <li>I like the fact you can wipe it clean from brushes with make up that has smudged on it.  </li>
            <li>Its beautifyl, can be used for smalls or large womans size, the belt fits many sizes.</li>
            <li>It is very big, which is not a bad thing because I have way too many brushes and they all fit.</li>
            <li>I love it so far</li>
            <li>very nice material, it does come with a little bit of smell but nothing that will kill you or give you allergies.</li>
            <li>and I like my makeup belt to be higher</li>
            <li>and I added extra pockets to hold more brushes.</li>
            <li>It expanded to a women&#x27;s size 16 around the hip, and it just barely made it to fit my hips.</li>
            <li>but I just used it for my large brush .</li>
            <li>it all the time holds everything very well</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for pro artist!</li>
            <li>Definitely sturdy and worth ordering!</li>
            <li>and it lays high on my waits .</li>
            <li>With all the bending, moving, and leaning, I thought for sure a brush may come loose, but the pockets are deep, so that isn&#x27;t a issue.</li>
            <li>It is a must have for a new mua</li>
            <li>It looks very professional too.</li>
            <li>I never put much thought or effort into my kit, but after one wedding without a belt, I knew it was absolutely necessary for the next job.</li>

            <li> Because it came from China and said I wouldn&#x27;t get it till early January whrn I ordred it in late November</li>
            <li> I bought this for my job at a makeup store because our bags were too small for all the brushes I needed to carry .</li>

            <li> I bought this for my job at a makeup store because our bags were too small for all the brushes I needed to carry . It&#x27;s fantastic! I have a place for everything and it lays high on my waits . I&#x27;m a size 20 and I like my makeup belt to be higher and it&#x27;s perfect. If I was any larger I would be afraid it wouldn&#x27;t fit though . It came in less than two weeks which was awesome. Because it came from China and said I wouldn&#x27;t get it till early January whrn I ordred it in late November</li>
            <li> just the way i like it!!</li>
            <li> Made well, works great with many brushes I have.  Do not understand why it would be given two or three stars.  You are paying under 10 dollars, the fabric is sturdy, plenty of pockets and nice strap and snap.  Arrived on time and quality packaging.  I like the fact you can wipe it clean from brushes with make up that has smudged on it.  Great buy, just what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> I started getting requests to do wedding makeup on a semi-regular basis, but have a full-time job outside of that. I never put much thought or effort into my kit, but after one wedding without a belt, I knew it was absolutely necessary for the next job. Not only does this feel like great quality, it had no problem clipping around my waist and staying put. It held many of my many brushes without any problem. With all the bending, moving, and leaning, I thought for sure a brush may come loose, but the pockets are deep, so that isn&#x27;t a issue. For the price, you cannot go wrong with this belt!</li>
            <li> Identical to what the store clerks in Macy&#x27;s are wearing at the Mac counter.  Excellent and a great buy!</li>
            <li> love this belt. Mine was falling apart already and i needed another one to hold my brushes. Great quality and good for many brushes!!</li>
            <li> It has worked out perfect for me while working on my clients. It looks very professional too. The one thing I would change on it is the strap. It expanded to a women&#x27;s size 16 around the hip, and it just barely made it to fit my hips. *((please make the adjustable strap longer for us bigger men and women.))*</li>
            <li> Great product, great quality.. one of the places teared off.. making the brush space doubled..but I use as a big space for meny brushes toghter aniway. Its beautifyl, can be used for smalls or large womans size, the belt fits many sizes.</li>
            <li> It is very big, which is not a bad thing because I have way too many brushes and they all fit. When I wear it I think it looks ridiculous, so I mainly use to organize my brushes.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my recent purchase. I am a makeup artist and needed a bigger brush belt, I was skeptical about buying this one because it&#x27;s so inexpensive but it really was a great buy.  The strap is nice and sturdy and there is a lot of room to fit all my brushes plus it got to me very quickly, which was nice.</li>
            <li> I love it! Definitely sturdy and worth ordering! Will recommend to any artist.</li>
            <li> really nice item and very good for the money us it all the time holds everything very well i&#x27;ll buy me another</li>
            <li> Very professional and perfect Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Most of my brushes fit! I love it so far</li>
            <li> I got this because my old belt that I got of eBay broke, the other onne was slightly tight. I read the reviews on this belt and saw that people with bigger waists could wear this belt.&lt;br /&gt;I am a size 32-33 waist, this belt is perfect for me. I can still loosen the belt up if I want it not to tight, there is a lot of wiggle room if you have a bigger waist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall about this product is that it lacks pockets. there is two sections that are gaint pockets, I went in with my sewing machine and I added extra pockets to hold more brushes. I left the front pocket for my business cards and extra items.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for, like it a lot</li>
            <li> Not the best,but the best for your buck, enough slots for tons of brushes, it&#x27;s a good purchase</li>
            <li> i love this apron.&lt;br /&gt;!  it&#x27;s very handy.  i&#x27;ve been looking for an apron like this that has all the pockets.</li>
            <li> The belt is perfect for a new artist like myself.  It holds all my brushes, business cards, and cellphone.  It is a must have for a new mua</li>
            <li> this is amazing!!&lt;br /&gt;i really love it if you are a makeup artist i think its a most have it organized my brushes perfectly and it has lots of room for many brushes !&lt;br /&gt;you can travel very easily with it and it does not smell like  cheap leather !!</li>
            <li> Love this. Got it for freelancing and it holds a lot of brushes. Took a star off because a part of the threading was reeled out when I got it but I just used it for my large brush . Great product though</li>
            <li> All brushes fit and was what what I needed!!! Love love love it. Highly recommended for pro artist! ❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> Looks just like the belts worn by the kids at the MAC counter without the logo.  Room for lots of brushes, great quality, easy clean up, and fully adjustable.  I&#x27;ll be using it often, I&#x27;m sure.</li>
            <li> very nice material, it does come with a little bit of smell but nothing that will kill you or give you allergies.</li>
