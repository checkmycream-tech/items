            <li>I tried a sample size of this and liked it.  </li>
            <li>It also leaves a residue on my hair which is not at all nice.</li>
            <li>It Free has cured me of that gel-dried-to-crunchiness issue (which is fantastic, as that is not my best look).</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does smell nice, though.</li>

            <li>love it love it!</li>
            <li>I love their products but after this experience, I&#x27;d rather make my own leave in conditioner with conditioner and water.</li>
            <li>Deva Curl Products are awesome for naturally curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love the curls!</li>
            <li>I have been a licensed hairstylist for 30 years, so I have tried many of the best professional products.  </li>
            <li>However, the seller quickly made good on this mistake.  </li>
            <li>I love their products; and I bought two bottle of the \\&quot;Set it</li>
            <li>I just love this hair gel.  </li>
            <li>and I love this product on my hair.  </li>
            <li>Have I said how much I love this product?</li>
            <li>I lay my hair on top of the diffuser and move the diffuser towards my scalp.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I add more Set</li>
            <li>I love the Devacurl products.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot Deva Curl products which I love.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s Auto-Drop feature will also give you a better price than any of the so-called discount beauty supply shops out there.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s gotta be something better out there.</li>
            <li>and I love all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am so glad my stylist put me on to it.</li>
            <li>I love this Moisture Lock.</li>
            <li>Love it love it</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>love it love it</li>
            <li>the world is a better place with deva - lovely defined curls.</li>
            <li>Excellent to bring back the curl in your hair without having to wash it!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>The reason I love it: my curls always look amazing, and it works great to reactivate second day curls, plus it smells</li>
            <li>Not sticky, tames some of the frizz and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>My curls are plentiful though hair is fine, and my hair has never looked better than when I&#x27;m using Deva products.</li>
            <li>Set it Free is my favorite...</li>
            <li>With Set It Free and the new Deva curl cream, my hair comes pretty close to perfect.</li>
            <li>--I use it when I use Mist-er right to add a layer of nice scent, citrus over lavender.</li>
            <li>It smells like sweet tarts, which I like too!</li>
            <li>to Set It Free.</li>
            <li>Then the Set it Free.  </li>
            <li>Deva Curl Moisture Lock Set it free is a must for Diva&#x27;s with curls.</li>
            <li>this stuff ain&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li>It has kind of a waxy build up to it if you use too much.  </li>
            <li>Set It Free is part of a system from Deva Curl.</li>
            <li>Free remains a part of my hair routine.</li>
            <li>Then I apply a curl leave in conditioner or light non silicone frizz control product.</li>
            <li>the Set It Free.</li>
            <li>It Free</li>
            <li>It Free on non-shampoo days.</li>
            <li>It Free.  </li>
            <li>Deva Curl Moisture Lock came as a free sample with my Deva Curl diffuser.  </li>
            <li>It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition</li>
            <li>Set It Free is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried most of the products in the Deva line, and while I use and like the LowPoo and One Condition in the DEVACare line, and I like to refresh with Mist-er Right, and I use B-leave</li>
            <li>Based on others reviews, I made sure I first applied my leave in for moisture, then castor oil and shea butter to seal that moisture in.  </li>
            <li>This works great used alone to refresh curls or combined with an-gel when your curls are wet.</li>
            <li>I hold it in the same position for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li>Free is worth a try.</li>
            <li>Most of all it will give you the one thing most of us curly headed folks never really get a chance to enjoy - consistency!  </li>
            <li>I had an allergic reaction to this product which included mild airway constriction.  </li>
            <li>I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to spending money on beauty products, but this is my splurge.  </li>
            <li>All other Deva curl products never left my hair feeling anything but clean &amp; wonderfully scented.</li>
            <li>It really works for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li>I have fine, wavy, very unruly hair, prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li>it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>I found drugstore products that worked just as well, smelled better, and were far cheaper than this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky and don&#x27;t like gel or mousse, but I do love their new curl creme.&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li>it seems to work for other reviewers and it smells good.</li>
            <li>Just understand it is trial and error until you get it right.</li>
            <li>Does right by my curls.</li>
            <li>Not too sticky, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking and write a positive review whenever I find it!</li>
            <li>It is light (not sticky) and definitely sets your curls free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of floored by the negative reviews on this product, because I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>It still looked good today with just a little attention.</li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my curly hair looks lush and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>If anyone has any further suggestions I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
            <li>I have tried several Deva Curl products and LOVE them.</li>
            <li>have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it on wet hair but the really beauty is on dry hair to get great curls.</li>
            <li>Free on wet, freshly washed and conditioned hair</li>
            <li>But no, it neither sets the style nor does anything else really.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Deva Care and Deva Curl One conditioners and I really like both of those products.</li>
            <li>My hair is naturely curly and this product really helps make my hair curl.  </li>
            <li>If you use too much your hair will become sticky.</li>
            <li>It really does keep the curls and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel</li>
            <li>I really want to like Deva Curl products</li>
            <li>I want my hair to be super soft and plyable but look amazing, and it seems a hard goal to achieve.</li>
            <li>After buying the full size and using it several days in a row, I find that it coats my hair and leaves it feeling sticky, and I still have frizz.</li>
            <li>I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li>This product tames down my frizzes and makes my hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>The trick to this product is less is more and water.</li>
            <li>It does work as a great smoothing spray for my daughter who has straight hair, but it ultimately fails at it&#x27;s intended purpose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many anti frizz products I could open a store, but yesterday I decided to try something different and sprayed Set it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend giving them a try.  </li>
            <li>but this product now has a different smell (used to be citrus fresh, now I don&#x27;t know what it is</li>
            <li>I purchased pretty much the entire Deva Curl line when I had my hair longer and was wearing it curly/wavy.</li>
            <li>I love this product as it keeps my curls from frizzing and does not make my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li>I wish it were slightly more stiff.......</li>
            <li>Right out of the shower, I scrunch my wet hair with paper towels, apply Arc Angell and Set It Free, scrunch a little more, then wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li>Very natural feel on hair.</li>
            <li>Very natural look with this product.</li>
            <li>Also don&#x27;t mix too many other products with this especially if they are oil based.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only product that does what it is supposed to!</li>
            <li>and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t dry like many other products can make your hair feel.</li>
            <li>Trust me, your curls are soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>This product really helps refresh your hair the next day</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair everyday, which is important for curly girls</li>
            <li>The water I initially left in my hair really helps to move all these products around throughout my hair.</li>
            <li>It helps with frizz and keeps my curls soft.</li>
            <li>Does not work for me, it dries out my hair and does nothing to hold my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of the frizzies and makes my curls soft.</li>
            <li>but (it is well worth it) if you use the same amount as a salon does (2-3 pumps over entire head)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not happy with either Angel or ArcAngel in my very fine, frizzy hair, especially after the first day.</li>
            <li>Maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair.</li>
            <li>I have a serious hair obsession and often play with my hair, which is probably the reason I don&#x27;t always love this product.</li>
            <li>I live in humid Miami, FL and Deva Curl is currently my go to product.  </li>
            <li>The key to the success is to have really wet hair to start the product application, not to manipulate the hair too much with my hands and to leave the hair alone until it is completely dry.</li>
            <li>I have no regrets, although it is pricey</li>
            <li>I have a hair stylist who follows the Deva cutting method and uses her products and when she does it it looks good</li>
            <li>, granted, I have dry 3b hair with high porosity.</li>
            <li>I have 4b African American natural hair</li>
            <li>You have to practice to get the right amount for your hair, so start small and work up.  </li>
            <li>For years, I used gobs of product and lots of hairspray to set the whole mess.  </li>
            <li>I do warn if you use this product a little to much it can make your hair feel greasy, a trial and error type of thing.</li>
            <li>This product is just OK...not particularly good nor bad.</li>

            <li> --I use it when I use Mist-er right to add a layer of nice scent, citrus over lavender.</li>
            <li> It smells like sweet tarts, which I like too!</li>
            <li> to Set It Free.</li>
            <li> Then the Set it Free.  </li>
            <li> Deva Curl Moisture Lock Set it free is a must for Diva&#x27;s with curls.</li>
            <li> this stuff ain&#x27;t cheap</li>
            <li> It has kind of a waxy build up to it if you use too much.  </li>
            <li> Set It Free is part of a system from Deva Curl.</li>
            <li> Free remains a part of my hair routine.</li>
            <li> Then I apply a curl leave in conditioner or light non silicone frizz control product.</li>
            <li> the Set It Free.</li>
            <li> It Free</li>
            <li> It Free on non-shampoo days.</li>
            <li> It Free.  </li>
            <li> Deva Curl Moisture Lock came as a free sample with my Deva Curl diffuser.  </li>
            <li> It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition</li>
            <li> Set It Free is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the products in the Deva line, and while I use and like the LowPoo and One Condition in the DEVACare line, and I like to refresh with Mist-er Right, and I use B-leave</li>
            <li> Based on others reviews, I made sure I first applied my leave in for moisture, then castor oil and shea butter to seal that moisture in.  </li>
            <li> This works great used alone to refresh curls or combined with an-gel when your curls are wet.</li>
            <li> I hold it in the same position for a good amount of time.</li>
            <li> Free is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Most of all it will give you the one thing most of us curly headed folks never really get a chance to enjoy - consistency!  </li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product which included mild airway constriction.  </li>
            <li> I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to spending money on beauty products, but this is my splurge.  </li>
            <li> All other Deva curl products never left my hair feeling anything but clean &amp; wonderfully scented.</li>
            <li> It really works for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, very unruly hair, prone to frizz.  </li>
            <li> it is well worth it.  </li>
            <li> I found drugstore products that worked just as well, smelled better, and were far cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty picky and don&#x27;t like gel or mousse, but I do love their new curl creme.&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
            <li> it seems to work for other reviewers and it smells good.</li>
            <li> Just understand it is trial and error until you get it right.</li>
            <li> Does right by my curls.</li>
            <li> Not too sticky, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep looking and write a positive review whenever I find it!</li>
            <li> It is light (not sticky) and definitely sets your curls free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of floored by the negative reviews on this product, because I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> It still looked good today with just a little attention.</li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, my curly hair looks lush and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> If anyone has any further suggestions I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Deva Curl products and LOVE them.</li>
            <li> have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on wet hair but the really beauty is on dry hair to get great curls.</li>
            <li> Free on wet, freshly washed and conditioned hair</li>
            <li> But no, it neither sets the style nor does anything else really.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Deva Care and Deva Curl One conditioners and I really like both of those products.</li>
            <li> My hair is naturely curly and this product really helps make my hair curl.  </li>
            <li> If you use too much your hair will become sticky.</li>
            <li> It really does keep the curls and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel</li>
            <li> I really want to like Deva Curl products</li>
            <li> I want my hair to be super soft and plyable but look amazing, and it seems a hard goal to achieve.</li>
            <li> After buying the full size and using it several days in a row, I find that it coats my hair and leaves it feeling sticky, and I still have frizz.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better!</li>
            <li> This product tames down my frizzes and makes my hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li> The trick to this product is less is more and water.</li>
            <li> It does work as a great smoothing spray for my daughter who has straight hair, but it ultimately fails at it&#x27;s intended purpose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many anti frizz products I could open a store, but yesterday I decided to try something different and sprayed Set it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend giving them a try.  </li>
            <li> but this product now has a different smell (used to be citrus fresh, now I don&#x27;t know what it is</li>
            <li> I purchased pretty much the entire Deva Curl line when I had my hair longer and was wearing it curly/wavy.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it keeps my curls from frizzing and does not make my hair stiff.  </li>
            <li> I wish it were slightly more stiff.......</li>
            <li> Right out of the shower, I scrunch my wet hair with paper towels, apply Arc Angell and Set It Free, scrunch a little more, then wait for it to dry.</li>
            <li> Very natural feel on hair.</li>
            <li> Very natural look with this product.</li>
            <li> Also don&#x27;t mix too many other products with this especially if they are oil based.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only product that does what it is supposed to!</li>
            <li> and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t dry like many other products can make your hair feel.</li>
            <li> Trust me, your curls are soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> This product really helps refresh your hair the next day</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair everyday, which is important for curly girls</li>
            <li> The water I initially left in my hair really helps to move all these products around throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> It helps with frizz and keeps my curls soft.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me, it dries out my hair and does nothing to hold my natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of the frizzies and makes my curls soft.</li>
            <li> but (it is well worth it) if you use the same amount as a salon does (2-3 pumps over entire head)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with either Angel or ArcAngel in my very fine, frizzy hair, especially after the first day.</li>
            <li> Maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have a serious hair obsession and often play with my hair, which is probably the reason I don&#x27;t always love this product.</li>
            <li> I live in humid Miami, FL and Deva Curl is currently my go to product.  </li>
            <li> The key to the success is to have really wet hair to start the product application, not to manipulate the hair too much with my hands and to leave the hair alone until it is completely dry.</li>
            <li> I have no regrets, although it is pricey</li>
            <li> I have a hair stylist who follows the Deva cutting method and uses her products and when she does it it looks good</li>
            <li> , granted, I have dry 3b hair with high porosity.</li>
            <li> I have 4b African American natural hair</li>
            <li> You have to practice to get the right amount for your hair, so start small and work up.  </li>
            <li> For years, I used gobs of product and lots of hairspray to set the whole mess.  </li>
            <li> I do warn if you use this product a little to much it can make your hair feel greasy, a trial and error type of thing.</li>
            <li> This product is just OK...not particularly good nor bad.</li>
            <li> The secret to using most curl products is to apply them to wet hair.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like it at all) and seems to be a different formula - much heavier and makes my hair stiff.</li>
            <li> : if you use too much, your curls end up sticky/tacky and stiff.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s 6 years old and extremely active so it probably has a 6-8 hr hold before she begins frizzing out again through outside playing and so forth.  </li>
            <li> As far as the \\&quot;enhance curls\\&quot; goes I didn&#x27;t notice anything different than when I simply spray a little water on my hair to rejuvenate curl.</li>
            <li> I am a guy who&#x27;s trying to wear his hair long but battling constant dryness and frizz.</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding a styling product that really works with my hair.</li>
            <li> I have long curly hair.  </li>
            <li> It did not really reduce frizz and when used on dry hair it actually created frizz.</li>
            <li> Careful not to spritz too much, or your hair gets a dull, sort of waxy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never applied it on my hair while it&#x27;s dry</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t dry out their hair from over-washing.  </li>
            <li> I also use the spray on dry hair it to touch up her hair before school.</li>
            <li> We use it after the No-Poo &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and the One Conditioner- while hair is wet, put alot of gel and spray this also-- works wonders-and trust me we have spent thousands of dollars trying different products.  </li>
            <li> Being lead like wooly headed sheep to pledge loyalty to any single product line is not for me.</li>
            <li> You can use it while your hair is wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Today I used a little Mist-er Right and Set it Free and had disastrous results (even frizzier and drier than usual).</li>
            <li> The pump gets almost all the product out of the bottle with just a little left in the bottom.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no twisting the hair up in a towel.</li>
            <li> I try not to wash my hair every day, just wet it.</li>
            <li> I bought it as a 2-pack and have used roughly over 1/5 of it(6oz)...</li>
            <li> I spray it on while my hair is still wet.  </li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I use Set-it-free as a finishing spray on dry hair and it forms a barrier against moisture, leaving a soft sheen behind.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t use any other product in my hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe they aren&#x27;t working for the other curlies, because they have not read the \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; book that tells you how to apply the products and style your hair the \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; way.  </li>
            <li> My daughter has extremely curly/frizzy hair.  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but this product does not warrant a positive review in my opinion.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold longer.  </li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t even reach out to ask if they could help me, just shut me down and refunded my $26.00 without shipping and handling.</li>
            <li> I even turn my head upside down and keep the scrunching process going.</li>
            <li> This product is not sticky and does not weigh down curls.  </li>
            <li> I order packages all the time to my building complex and for some strange reason the package was denied.</li>
            <li> You end up with a sticky frizzy mess, kinda like with this product.  </li>
            <li> Just spray and use hands to tame frizz down.</li>
            <li> I use probably 5-6 pumps in my hands then run it thru my hair after it has been washed and air dried.  </li>
            <li> It helps to remove the crunchiness left behind from the gel but still helps the curls to stay chunky.  </li>
            <li> Immediately after hair washing I remove very little water from my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure there is any poertion of the line that I would re-order.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m following the instructions and am not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong.</li>
            <li> Keeps the frizz away without making my hair look greasy, stiff, dull or shiny.  </li>
            <li> That earns it at least one star.</li>
            <li> both spray nozzles spray in a \\&quot;v\\&quot; form and not effective to application of hair.</li>
            <li> Those of us who grew up with images of Boy George, Madonna and Michael Jackson on MTV 24/7 will understand what I mean.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos and conditioners on the market will do the trick, but Deva Curl Moisture Lock will polish your look like you invested in all the expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me I have waited past the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with a product I won&#x27;t use at a $30.00 investment.</li>
            <li> I like that my hair is not weight down with a heavy, sticky gel (I just hate that look and feel on my hair).  </li>
            <li> but I have a very thick head of hair.</li>
            <li> Not happy with a company that will ignore the risk its products pose.</li>
            <li> this has been a real challenge for me, the gel makes me look like a poodle .Lots of products in my hair makes it look awful.</li>
            <li> If you too were traumatized by staining, bad smelling and flammable goo they called hair gel in this era, but still have a mop of curls to tame, your worries are over.</li>
            <li> Sad about this purchase.</li>
            <li> However, the listing was wrong and listed 2 bottles</li>
            <li> Sorry</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate to say it</li>
            <li> reason I hate it</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!</li>
            <li> the sulfate and alcohol in the products were my worst enemy.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product which included mild airway constriction.  I left a polite review about the risk on diva curls page and of course it disappeared.  Not happy with a company that will ignore the risk its products pose.</li>
            <li> TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! I love their products; and I bought two bottle of the \\&quot;Set it free\\&quot; hair products. I order packages all the time to my building complex and for some strange reason the package was denied. I e-mailed them and I was told that once they got the shipment back, they would e-mail me on how to proceed. NOW they are telling me there is NO way they can send my package and they told me they paid for shipping and handling. Last time I checked, I PAID SHIPPING AND HANDLING. They didn&#x27;t even reach out to ask if they could help me, just shut me down and refunded my $26.00 without shipping and handling. I love their products but after this experience, I&#x27;d rather make my own leave in conditioner with conditioner and water.</li>
            <li> I tried a sample size of this and liked it.  After buying the full size and using it several days in a row, I find that it coats my hair and leaves it feeling sticky, and I still have frizz.</li>
            <li> I love this product as it keeps my curls from frizzing and does not make my hair stiff.  The pump gets almost all the product out of the bottle with just a little left in the bottom.  Amazon has the best price I have found!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a creme based spray.  The Deva videos say to use it after using the styling product, either ArcAngel gel or the One Condition conditioner.  So I thought it was a setting spray, somewhat like a hairspray..???  But no, it neither sets the style nor does anything else really.  Curly haired people, have you ever tried using a \\&quot;no-frizz\\&quot; serum and then gel?  You end up with a sticky frizzy mess, kinda like with this product.  It does work as a great smoothing spray for my daughter who has straight hair, but it ultimately fails at it&#x27;s intended purpose.  It claims to be a \\&quot;moisture lock\\&quot; but since using the Deva line, my hair is dryer than ever.  I&#x27;m not sure there is any poertion of the line that I would re-order.  Perhaps maybe the NoPoo....no guarantees.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the recommendations I read on [...]I hate to say it but I was disappointed in this product. It did not really reduce frizz and when used on dry hair it actually created frizz. It also leaves a residue on my hair which is not at all nice. I now have two bottles of this that I probably won&#x27;t use and it wasn&#x27;t cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the Deva Care and Deva Curl One conditioners and I really like both of those products. But everything else I&#x27;ve tried from this company has not worked out for me. I have 3b/c hair by the way.</li>
            <li> I just love this hair gel.  It is light (not sticky) and definitely sets your curls free.  My hair is naturely curly and this product really helps make my hair curl.  I like that my hair is not weight down with a heavy, sticky gel (I just hate that look and feel on my hair).  This is a great haircare product for wavy or curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have a love-hate relationship with this product, although I continue to buy it and use it. I use several of the Deva Curl products, including No Poo and One Condition. I have had a hard time finding a styling product that really works with my hair. I&#x27;m pretty picky and don&#x27;t like gel or mousse, but I do love their new curl creme.&lt;br /&gt;Back to Set It Free. The reason I love it: my curls always look amazing, and it works great to reactivate second day curls, plus it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I hate it: if you use too much, your curls end up sticky/tacky and stiff. I have a serious hair obsession and often play with my hair, which is probably the reason I don&#x27;t always love this product. I want my hair to be super soft and plyable but look amazing, and it seems a hard goal to achieve. With Set It Free and the new Deva curl cream, my hair comes pretty close to perfect.</li>
            <li> I have 4b African American natural hair and I love this product on my hair.  So far I have used it for wet setting.  Based on others reviews, I made sure I first applied my leave in for moisture, then castor oil and shea butter to seal that moisture in.  Then the Set it Free.  The product seems to prvent frizz, which I didn&#x27;t even think I had any.  My hair also seems softer and has a sheen.  But maybe it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s not as frizzy.  I used it for twists.  Finally I have a staple product!</li>
            <li> Deva Curl Moisture Lock Set it free is a must for Diva&#x27;s with curls. The trick to this product is less is more and water. You need to spray hair with water before and after use. If you use too much your hair will become sticky. Also don&#x27;t mix too many other products with this especially if they are oil based. Now mind you this stuff ain&#x27;t cheap but (it is well worth it) if you use the same amount as a salon does (2-3 pumps over entire head) you will get the same results as your stylist. Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Devacare and Devacurl products for the last five years. My curls are plentiful though hair is fine, and my hair has never looked better than when I&#x27;m using Deva products. Right out of the shower, I scrunch my wet hair with paper towels, apply Arc Angell and Set It Free, scrunch a little more, then wait for it to dry. The Set It Free has cured me of that gel-dried-to-crunchiness issue (which is fantastic, as that is not my best look). I&#x27;ve never applied it on my hair while it&#x27;s dry so haven&#x27;t a clue what the effect would be if I did.</li>
            <li> It really does keep the curls and it doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky feel</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  I use probably 5-6 pumps in my hands then run it thru my hair after it has been washed and air dried.  It helps to remove the crunchiness left behind from the gel but still helps the curls to stay chunky.  It has kind of a waxy build up to it if you use too much.  It smells like sweet tarts, which I like too!</li>
            <li> OMG!!!! Can I give it 6 stars? This is the first and only product that does what it is supposed to! I&#x27;ve used it on wet hair but the really beauty is on dry hair to get great curls. I use it on the days I don&#x27;t wash my hair. Love, love, love the curls! Have I said how much I love this product? Trust me, your curls are soft and bouncy. They aren&#x27;t dry like many other products can make your hair feel. Run, don&#x27;t walk and buy this! LOL</li>
            <li> This product really helps refresh your hair the next day so you don&#x27;t have to wash your hair everyday, which is important for curly girls so they don&#x27;t dry out their hair from over-washing.  It has a pleasant aroma that I often get compliments on.  It gets 4 starts instead of 5 because it&#x27;s on the pricey side.</li>
            <li> Set It Free is part of a system from Deva Curl. I do not use the entire system however Set It Free remains a part of my hair routine. The secret to using most curl products is to apply them to wet hair. Immediately after hair washing I remove very little water from my hair. Absolutely no twisting the hair up in a towel. I also use a microfiber towel. I do not comb my hair what so ever. Then I apply a curl leave in conditioner or light non silicone frizz control product. I next apply a gel. Once again, no silicones or alcohols in the gel. Next comes the Set It Free. I am fairly liberal with the amount but I have a very thick head of hair. The water I initially left in my hair really helps to move all these products around throughout my hair. Once all these products are applied, I scrunch my hair from end up to my roots. I even turn my head upside down and keep the scrunching process going. I use to the diffuser attachment for drying my hair. I lay my hair on top of the diffuser and move the diffuser towards my scalp. I hold it in the same position for a good amount of time. I keep moving it all around my head until it feel closer to damp. This process creates a \\&quot;set\\&quot; to the waves. I have tried this process without the Set It Free and I don&#x27;t get the same curl separation or frizz control. Day 2, 3 and even 4 days after the hair washing I will use a spray bottle to apply water to my locks. Sometimes I add more Set It Free on non-shampoo days. I use the diffuser each time and it recreates that great curl separation. It has taken me about 1.5 years to get this system figured out. The key to the success is to have really wet hair to start the product application, not to manipulate the hair too much with my hands and to leave the hair alone until it is completely dry. Set It Free is worth a try. Just understand it is trial and error until you get it right.</li>
            <li> This product has made my curls look amazing!  I have heard about it for years, and finally gave in to it.  I have no regrets, although it is pricey it is well worth it.  Can&#x27;t use any other product in my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of floored by the negative reviews on this product, because I LOVE it.  For the first time in my life, my curly hair looks lush and frizz free.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I love the Devacurl products.  I use Devacurl Nopoo, Conditioner, Angell, and finish with the Set It Free.  My hair looks amazing!  All of the products smell great.  The only downside is the cost.  I am usually pretty cheap when it comes to spending money on beauty products, but this is my splurge.  I highly recommend giving them a try.  Maybe they aren&#x27;t working for the other curlies, because they have not read the \\&quot;Curly Girl\\&quot; book that tells you how to apply the products and style your hair the \\&quot;curly girl\\&quot; way.  All I know is that my hair loves this stuff!</li>
            <li> Deva Curl Products are awesome for naturally curly hair.  Deva Curl Moisture Lock, Set it Free is my favorite...it helps prevent the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Great for curly hair. Very natural feel on hair. Not crunchy. Lasts throughout the day&lt;br /&gt;Wish they did bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> A must have for anyone with curls. The best product out there. I get constant compliments on my hair when I use this, no friz, just glossy curls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had \\&quot;Set it Free\\&quot; for a couple of years but didn&#x27;t see any benefit and stopped using it.  I&#x27;m not happy with either Angel or ArcAngel in my very fine, frizzy hair, especially after the first day. I try not to wash my hair every day, just wet it. I&#x27;ve tried so many anti frizz products I could open a store, but yesterday I decided to try something different and sprayed Set it Free on wet, freshly washed and conditioned hair and it worked great. It still looked good today with just a little attention. I like Deva shampoos and conditioner, just didn&#x27;t like the finishing products. I have a hair stylist who follows the Deva cutting method and uses her products and when she does it it looks good but I don&#x27;t have the patience to spend the amount of time she does on a daily basis.  My hair got curlier during menopause although I still have areas that aren&#x27;t as curly as others, and I now color it which has changed the texture and I just can&#x27;t style it the way I used to. this has been a real challenge for me, the gel makes me look like a poodle .Lots of products in my hair makes it look awful. If anyone has any further suggestions I&#x27;d love to hear them.</li>
            <li> This keeps my frizz tamed, and I do find it works for about 48 hours. Beyond that, a couple of sprays in the palm scrunched into my frizzy areas keeps it going.</li>
            <li> Deva Curl Moisture Lock came as a free sample with my Deva Curl diffuser.  I am so glad I didn&#x27;t buy this stuff and can&#x27;t wait to wash it out of my hair!!  It feels sticky and seems to create frizz.  I have tried a lot Deva Curl products which I love.  This one not at all!</li>
            <li> Great product!  My daughter has extremely curly/frizzy hair.  This product allows the curls to come back together.  She&#x27;s 6 years old and extremely active so it probably has a 6-8 hr hold before she begins frizzing out again through outside playing and so forth.  My only complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t hold longer.  I wish it were slightly more stiff.......just personal preference....but a good product regardless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it&#x27;s been great but this product now has a different smell (used to be citrus fresh, now I don&#x27;t know what it is but I don&#x27;t like it at all) and seems to be a different formula - much heavier and makes my hair stiff. Sad about this purchase.</li>
            <li> This is the best curl spray! Smells good too.  Great product.  This was a great price too.  However, the listing was wrong and listed 2 bottles but it was really only one.  However, the seller quickly made good on this mistake.  A nice company with great customer service!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried most of the products in the Deva line, and while I use and like the LowPoo and One Condition in the DEVACare line, and I like to refresh with Mist-er Right, and I use B-leave In to refresh with conditioner on 2nd and 3d days, and I like Arc Angell, THIS STUFF DID NOTHING as promised. Frizz was not reduced. Moisture was not locked in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, granted, I have dry 3b hair with high porosity. Maybe it works better on lower porosity hair or less dry hair. But for me, nada. Zip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does smell nice, though. That earns it at least one star. I have one bottle that I&#x27;ll finish up--I use it when I use Mist-er right to add a layer of nice scent, citrus over lavender. Careful not to spritz too much, or your hair gets a dull, sort of waxy feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, really,can&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;IngredientsAqueous Extracts of: Achilea Millefolium, Chamomilla Recutita (Matricaria), Cymbopogon Schoenanthus, Humulus Lupulus (Hops), Melissa Offcinalis (Balm Mint), Rosmarinus Offcinalis (Rosemary), Cetearyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Isopropyl Myristate, Acrylates/C12-22 Alkylmethacrylate Copolymer, Ceteareth-20, PVP, Beeswax, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Lipids, Sodium Hydroxide, DMDM Hydantoin, Fragrance.</li>
            <li> Those of us who grew up with images of Boy George, Madonna and Michael Jackson on MTV 24/7 will understand what I mean. If you too were traumatized by staining, bad smelling and flammable goo they called hair gel in this era, but still have a mop of curls to tame, your worries are over. Being lead like wooly headed sheep to pledge loyalty to any single product line is not for me. Other shampoos and conditioners on the market will do the trick, but Deva Curl Moisture Lock will polish your look like you invested in all the expensive stuff. It will not cause build-up. It will not leave a grease spot on your pillow. Most of all it will give you the one thing most of us curly headed folks never really get a chance to enjoy - consistency!  Amazon&#x27;s Auto-Drop feature will also give you a better price than any of the so-called discount beauty supply shops out there.</li>
            <li> Great doing and great product! :-)</li>
            <li> Arrived on time. I love this product. It really works for my fine curly hair.</li>
            <li> Purchased this based on the 30 plus 5 star reviews.I have tried several Deva Curl products and LOVE them. This one....I regret the purchase. I bought it as a 2-pack and have used roughly over 1/5 of it(6oz)...both spray nozzles spray in a \\&quot;v\\&quot; form and not effective to application of hair. Afterwards, the feeling it leaves on my hair is tacky,\\&quot;dirty\\&quot; need to wash my hair feeling! so disappointed. All other Deva curl products never left my hair feeling anything but clean &amp; wonderfully scented. As far as the \\&quot;enhance curls\\&quot; goes I didn&#x27;t notice anything different than when I simply spray a little water on my hair to rejuvenate curl. Also can&#x27;t comment in the \\&quot;moisture lock or no frizz\\&quot; it claims. Unfortunately for me I have waited past the 30 day return policy so I am stuck with a product I won&#x27;t use at a $30.00 investment.Sorry, but this product does not warrant a positive review in my opinion.</li>
            <li> This is the best curl product that I have found.  I have long curly hair.  I spray it on while my hair is still wet.  This product is not sticky and does not weigh down curls.  It helps with frizz and keeps my curls soft.</li>
            <li> helps the curls stay defined</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give the product two stars simply &#x27;cos it seems to work for other reviewers and it smells good. I really want to like Deva Curl products but they&#x27;re not working out for me. I am a guy who&#x27;s trying to wear his hair long but battling constant dryness and frizz. Today I used a little Mist-er Right and Set it Free and had disastrous results (even frizzier and drier than usual). I&#x27;m following the instructions and am not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong. I can&#x27;t recommend this product for my hair type (\\&quot;s-wavy\\&quot; to \\&quot;wavy\\&quot; according to Deva Curl). There&#x27;s gotta be something better out there. I&#x27;ll keep looking and write a positive review whenever I find it!</li>
            <li> I purchased pretty much the entire Deva Curl line when I had my hair longer and was wearing it curly/wavy. This product is just OK...not particularly good nor bad. For the money, I would not purchase again. I found drugstore products that worked just as well, smelled better, and were far cheaper than this.</li>
            <li> Does not work for me, it dries out my hair and does nothing to hold my natural curly hair. Sorry</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Not sticky, tames some of the frizz and smells pretty good.</li>
            <li> It is a good product.</li>
            <li> I was a Ouidad girl but have switched back to Deva and now I don&#x27;t know why I ever left Deva. This works great used alone to refresh curls or combined with an-gel when your curls are wet. Great smell and nice feel. Does right by my curls.</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine, curly hair and my hair has never looked better! I use the B&#x27;Leave in Curl Booster, the Set It Free, and No Poo shampoo with One Condition and I love all of them.&lt;br /&gt;I have been through hundreds of products ranging from cheap to seriously expensive and the Deva line is by far the best for my hair. I am so glad my stylist put me on to it. WOOHOO!! I will be using these products from now on!</li>
            <li> PERFECT for curly or wavy hair.  Keeps the frizz away without making my hair look greasy, stiff, dull or shiny.  Very natural look with this product.</li>
            <li> This product tames down my frizzes and makes my hair more manageable.  I love the smell!  I do warn if you use this product a little to much it can make your hair feel greasy, a trial and error type of thing.</li>
            <li> I have fine, wavy, very unruly hair, prone to frizz.  For years, I used gobs of product and lots of hairspray to set the whole mess.  I found out through trial and error the sulfate and alcohol in the products were my worst enemy.  I now use all sufate-free products and my hair feels like it never did before.  I use Set-it-free as a finishing spray on dry hair and it forms a barrier against moisture, leaving a soft sheen behind.  You have to practice to get the right amount for your hair, so start small and work up.  WONDERFUL STUFF, I need to stock up in case they discontinue it!! I have been a licensed hairstylist for 30 years, so I have tried many of the best professional products.  Deva Curl has some of the best stuff on the market for frizz control.</li>
            <li> My daughter has VERY curly hair- using this product with the Deva Gel has been awesome. Frizz gone, nice curls that stay. We use it after the No-Poo &amp;#34;shampoo&amp;#34; and the One Conditioner- while hair is wet, put alot of gel and spray this also-- works wonders-and trust me we have spent thousands of dollars trying different products.  I also use the spray on dry hair it to touch up her hair before school. Just spray and use hands to tame frizz down. Go Deva if you have curly hair-it works!!</li>
            <li> I love this Moisture Lock. I can use it alone or with gel. It gives moisture to my curls and gives a bounce to my curls. Gets rid of the frizzies and makes my curls soft.</li>
            <li> Love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it love it! is the best product I have ever used for my hair</li>
            <li> I use this in the mornings, holds my curls the entire day. No frizz whatsoever. All  the Deva products are great.I recommend all of them.</li>
            <li> I live in humid Miami, FL and Deva Curl is currently my go to product.  Anyone with curly hair knows that their hair needs to stay moisturized for a nice curl.  I spray this on, especially on my ends before using either the gel or the mousse.</li>
            <li> deva products for my daughter &#x3D; happy hair!  the world is a better place with deva - lovely defined curls.</li>
            <li> Excellent to bring back the curl in your hair without having to wash it!&lt;br /&gt; Good for a touch up before going out to dinner.</li>
            <li> After No Poo, One Conditioner and the gel... this is my favorite Deva product!</li>
            <li> This product is a must in a daily regimen for curly hair.  You can use it while your hair is wet or dry.  It stops those unwanted frizzies.  Set It Free is fantastic.</li>
            <li> I spray it on along with gel after washing my hair. It smells great and makes my curls a bit poofier, which is exactly what I wanted!!</li>
            <li> Great finishing product for all day hold on my curls, I use it alone in the summer when humidity becomes an issue.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost two years and I always get compliments on my naturally curly hair!</li>
            <li> I use this immediately out of the shower, but it&#x27;s also a great mid-day spray.  Not too sticky, it&#x27;s just right.</li>
