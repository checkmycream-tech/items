            <li>Then the website says \\&quot;Our products should be in good quality condition for 3 years.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect texture and smells just like their pomegranate lip balm, which I love, love, LOVE!</li>
            <li>Very glad I could return it.</li>
            <li>People at work kept commenting on how healthy and &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; I looked, and I started to realize that it was the Burt&#x27;s that was improving my appearance!  </li>
            <li>I love that it is not harmful to my skin!</li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I do like the light formula though, and it smells great.</li>
            <li>This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li>Has a pleasant&lt;br /&gt;smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li>Has been in use for a period of time, feel very good, like it very much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rich, creamy texture is very nice</li>
            <li>Love! :-)</li>
            <li>I love both the smell &amp; texture of the eye cream; the smell is quite strong and it stays for quite awhile, but i don&#x27;t mind that since it&#x27;s a pleasant fruity smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice product, glad I got it.</li>
            <li>This is one of Burt&#x27;s best products by far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s got natural ingredients and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous eye creams from all of the best department store brands and this is by far the best!!  </li>
            <li>Love the eye cream.  </li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of eye creams, this is not on the top of my list.</li>
            <li>For summer months when there is more hydration in the air, this might work for just a day to day eye</li>
            <li>I do love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li>Much better than all the chemical junk out there.</li>
            <li>I picked this Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream since I felt I needed a bit more moisturizing under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I am in my 20&#x27;s, so I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles that need diminishing yet.</li>
            <li>..bottle, the writing on the bottle is worn out...not really sure about the product..</li>
            <li>If this came in a tube I probably would like it better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love it because I didn&#x27;t see any life changing results</li>
            <li>I find that lessening the amount of stress in my life did a lot more for the lines and bags under my eyes than this product.  </li>
            <li>I guess this cream is OK</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t even more moisturized.</li>
            <li>The $7 bottle of Cetaphil does a better job.</li>
            <li>i like most of burts bee products.</li>
            <li>wish they had more to offer and  bulk buys too.</li>
            <li>I just received this yest and I can feel my complexion getting better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>It turns out that the &amp;#34;brighteners&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light reflectors&amp;#34; included in many cosmetics and eye creams can cause irritation.</li>
            <li>Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
            <li>From now on I make sure I am well stocked.  </li>
            <li>It already pass it  expiration date for more than one year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>use Burt&#x27;s Bee for more than five years now.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff...</li>
            <li>cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li>Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li>I used it three times thinking I was going to be able to tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li>One more thing, for those reviewers who state that this cream has &amp;#34;erased</li>
            <li>That a cream can hydrate, enhance the texture of the skin, make it look better, yes.</li>
            <li>This cream moisturizes my eyes better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>If I buy it there will be one more junk.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li>It is very rich</li>
            <li>In addition to not looking the greatest and itching throughout the day, I was getting concerned about how this might affect my long term skin health.</li>
            <li>I tried this based on the good reviews, and I&#x27;m not sorry.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a pleasant texture and not irritating.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, it softened my lines and keeps the tender eye-area very soft and bright.</li>
            <li>Smells fantastic and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my crows feet around my eyes!</li>
            <li>Its easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling like you get with some.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice (be sure to pat it on gently)</li>
            <li>I am 40 years old and getting lines around my eyes, this really works great as soon as I put it on, the lines start to disappear!</li>
            <li>floral scent is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>I agree that it smells somewhat medicinal, but it is not flowery or overly strong.</li>
            <li>It smells delicious and I can see an im[provement in the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li>It felt kind of zingy at first, but after a day or two I was used to it.</li>
            <li>It seems to work just fine being applied under makeup in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I didnt notice any difference in my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>It worsen my fine lines...</li>
            <li>The creme is smooth and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li>It really does nice things for my eyes.</li>
            <li>If I use the Ageless under  my makeup for daytime, and the Radiance at night, I am maintaining the same great results.  </li>
            <li>Not too greasy, but not too light.</li>
            <li>Results were Fabulous.  </li>
            <li>Love berts bee&#x27;s products, I think anything that is more in the natural spectrum is going to be better for your skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I&#x27;m sure nobody</li>
            <li>Since it did not REMOVE my wrinkles, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, lol.  </li>
            <li>Smells kind of funky but overall nice.</li>
            <li>It does a good job moisturizing, it&#x27;s mostly natural...</li>
            <li>But I am not noticing a significant difference in fine lines yet.</li>
            <li>Burts Bee&#x27;s products have never disappointed.  </li>
            <li>It does not matter how good a product is, if you can barely stand the scent.</li>
            <li>Honestly, this product makes me feel better, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li>I read so many great reviews on this eye creme,, I was anxious to try it for myself.</li>
            <li>This crème is really good especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it SO much that I have a subscription, so that I get it every month.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, and my skins absorb it quickly.     </li>
            <li>Nothing will take the dark circles completely away, but Burts Bees Ageless Eye Cream gave me the best results, it reduces the small laugh lines around my eyes and  provides the perfect amount of moisture too.</li>
            <li>It has a cooling sensation and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>;... let&#x27;s be more realistic.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients in this are a plus, but they ruined it by adding a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li>Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li>Maybe the jar I got was rancid, but that will teach me to buy face cream again without smelling it first!</li>
            <li>I really notice a huge difference since using it for 30 days.</li>
            <li>It really keeps your eye area smooth and silky.....</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a great quality natural eye cream, and i will keep using it.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive and around the eyes I can have reactions and burning with many products on the market.  </li>
            <li>AND IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li>I was hoping the creme would work well and would be worth putting up with the odor</li>
            <li>I really like this so far, it moisturizes nicely around your eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s doing anything right now.  </li>
            <li>and that is something you can tell right away.</li>
            <li>It will keep dark circles light and fine lines filled, but won&#x27;t make you look 18 again.</li>
            <li>My eyes are sensitive and tear easily.  </li>
            <li>Not worth, do not waste your money, I could not even noticed this creme hydrating my skin more effectively</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do anything for dark circles, but it has reduced the fine lines around my eyes more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>great stuff ,just kinda hard to find on sell.</li>
            <li>I could see a difference in the first day.  </li>
            <li>(exactly what I was looking for), so I use it in the morning under the foundation.</li>
            <li>The eye cream was definitely sitting on the shelf for many years before it was sent to me.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done; it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but pretty close.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this pretty diligently</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting a fountain of youth</li>
            <li>Absolutely correct!  </li>
            <li>Once you open it, you are not goint to be able to return it.</li>
            <li>I am just happy because at least this product is working even that</li>
            <li>&quot; , it says \\&quot;the first three numbers are the day of the year the product was made (aka Julian Date).</li>
            <li>I just been wearing the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless eye creme for a very short time, so I do not know the results in a long run but it feels smooth and has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li>I chose this eye cream because it has natural ingredients; it is gentle on the ageing skin; it is a competitive price; I use it morning and evening; it is better than the designer name brands for my face - far fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li>It looks white in the jar but easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li>IT GOES ON YOUR SKIN EASILY AND SOOTHES MY SKIN INSTANTLY.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t find the scent strong enough at all.</li>
            <li>not sure if it really does anything age-wise but it feels good and doesnt leave a residue.  </li>
            <li>This may lead to some confusion in a house with multiple cosmetic users, or in a well-stocked cabinet, but works fine for me and hasn&#x27;t triggered any questions from my husband.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t care what it smells like though.</li>
            <li>I really feel as though it helps moisturize the eye area</li>
            <li>Plus, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li>and you could really see the lines</li>
            <li>I thought I would give it a try, even though I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>The skin around my eyes feels very moisturized all day too.  </li>
            <li>I did not like this as much as the Radiance eye cream from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing and no reactions</li>
            <li>Band-aids, really?</li>
            <li>It really has reduced the lines and bags around my eyes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much thicker</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>shipping was fast .  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of the cream too much.</li>
            <li>It hydrates really well</li>
            <li>I really like burt&#x27;s bees&#x27; eye cream</li>
            <li>I am in the process of transitioning from big name chemically based body care products to more natural choices, and revisited my eye problem.</li>
            <li>I have pretty much used a million different creams from the cheapest to the MOST expensive, and I am really loving the way this is making my under-eye area look!</li>
            <li>It smells nice and feels like a lovely eye creme, but it was very irritating to the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I may give their other Ageless products a try now since I&#x27;ve enjoyed this eye cream so much.</li>
            <li>I have dark hair and eyes and very fair skin, so I have naturally very dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li>This cream has worked better than other comparable high end</li>
            <li>I recently tried Burt&#x27;s Radiance eye cream at night since it is a little richer and makes a good night cream.  </li>
            <li>Most of its ingredients are rated a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; concern by EWG, and I&#x27;m fine with a little alcohol as long as the rest of the goo keeps it from creating dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It does get absorbed quickly, as it only takes gentle circular motions to apply.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely lightweight and seems to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li>But my main issue is the smell.</li>
            <li>The consistency of this product is more like white glue than what I expect of regular eye cream.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this eye cream, but it irritated the skin under my eyes almost immediately.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a little more time.</li>
            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute; is very scent sensitive though.</li>
            <li>Otherwise a good product for rejuvenating tired eye lines.</li>
            <li>40&#x27;s must be the new twenties because I am &#x27;carded&#x27; all the time.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and often have allergic reactions to products, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem in the four months I&#x27;ve been using this cream.  </li>
            <li>and I have taken to storing the jar on its side to make it easy to dab a little onto a finger without scooping into the jar.</li>
            <li>and I started to notice a little difference in the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a young 20-something with pretty good skin but wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes from being in college, working and just plain not sleeping enough.</li>
            <li>I mix this with one drop of Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Serum [...].  </li>
            <li>Has taken 5 years off my face so far after just under 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li>Glorious results so far.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re sensitive to scent, you&#x27;ll probably be sensitive to this, and therefore, you may not like</li>
            <li>But I have no problem with the Naturally Ageless Eye Cream - and</li>
            <li>Does not cause any irritation, even for my husband who has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I will be 54 years old this year</li>
            <li>I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Line Smoothing Eye Cream for over a year.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>We recommend that our products are used within 12 months after opening since they are natural products.</li>
            <li>However, the product is very moisturizing and glides on very smoothly, as long as you apply with your middle or ring finger by gently blotting it on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying a tiny dab after my shower every morning and notice that my eye skin is no longer dry, and feels fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li>(Burt&#x27;s Bees changed this product to a white plastic cap YEARS ago), and that was when I noticed that on the outside of the box, it also said &#x27;new,&#x27; as in new product.</li>
            <li>I sought out a simply moisturizing cream with natural ingredients and ordered Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have any major wrinkles yet</li>
            <li>I would highly recommmend this for those who are not sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>/&gt;A couple things to note - while the box is clearly labeled the container inside has no labels whatsoever - just some white cream in a glass jar.</li>
            <li>I went online to Amazon to return it, because I do not trust an eye cream that is so old, but I was a couple days outside of my 30-day return window.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and the cream is not sticky or greasy, like other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>Although I really like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Have used this eye cream more than 2 weeks, tiny lines under the eye bags have  reduced, and the eye bags have also slightly tightened, but my dark circles are still obviously ...</li>
            <li>I use it daily and works especially well on my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li>At first a little medicinal smelling then I learned to appreciate the flowery part.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it for use by any age group- I am aged 60+</li>
            <li>However,, I have as of yet to see any improvement on my dark circles, and this was the main reason I purchased this eye creme.</li>

            <li> My face find good.</li>
            <li> Then the website says \\&quot;Our products should be in good quality condition for 3 years.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect texture and smells just like their pomegranate lip balm, which I love, love, LOVE!</li>
            <li> Very glad I could return it.</li>
            <li> People at work kept commenting on how healthy and &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; I looked, and I started to realize that it was the Burt&#x27;s that was improving my appearance!  </li>
            <li> I love that it is not harmful to my skin!</li>
            <li> love it!</li>
            <li> I do like the light formula though, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  </li>
            <li> Has a pleasant&lt;br /&gt;smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li> Has been in use for a period of time, feel very good, like it very much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rich, creamy texture is very nice</li>
            <li> Love! :-)</li>
            <li> I love both the smell &amp; texture of the eye cream; the smell is quite strong and it stays for quite awhile, but i don&#x27;t mind that since it&#x27;s a pleasant fruity smell.  </li>
            <li> Nice product, glad I got it.</li>
            <li> This is one of Burt&#x27;s best products by far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s got natural ingredients and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous eye creams from all of the best department store brands and this is by far the best!!  </li>
            <li> Love the eye cream.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of eye creams, this is not on the top of my list.</li>
            <li> For summer months when there is more hydration in the air, this might work for just a day to day eye</li>
            <li> I do love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees</li>
            <li> Much better than all the chemical junk out there.</li>
            <li> I picked this Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream since I felt I needed a bit more moisturizing under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am in my 20&#x27;s, so I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles that need diminishing yet.</li>
            <li> ..bottle, the writing on the bottle is worn out...not really sure about the product..</li>
            <li> If this came in a tube I probably would like it better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t love it because I didn&#x27;t see any life changing results</li>
            <li> I find that lessening the amount of stress in my life did a lot more for the lines and bags under my eyes than this product.  </li>
            <li> I guess this cream is OK</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t even more moisturized.</li>
            <li> The $7 bottle of Cetaphil does a better job.</li>
            <li> i like most of burts bee products.</li>
            <li> wish they had more to offer and  bulk buys too.</li>
            <li> I just received this yest and I can feel my complexion getting better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> It turns out that the &amp;#34;brighteners&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light reflectors&amp;#34; included in many cosmetics and eye creams can cause irritation.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
            <li> From now on I make sure I am well stocked.  </li>
            <li> It already pass it  expiration date for more than one year.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> use Burt&#x27;s Bee for more than five years now.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...</li>
            <li> cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> I used it three times thinking I was going to be able to tolerate the smell.</li>
            <li> One more thing, for those reviewers who state that this cream has &amp;#34;erased</li>
            <li> That a cream can hydrate, enhance the texture of the skin, make it look better, yes.</li>
            <li> This cream moisturizes my eyes better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> If I buy it there will be one more junk.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream.</li>
            <li> It is very rich</li>
            <li> In addition to not looking the greatest and itching throughout the day, I was getting concerned about how this might affect my long term skin health.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on the good reviews, and I&#x27;m not sorry.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a pleasant texture and not irritating.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, it softened my lines and keeps the tender eye-area very soft and bright.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my crows feet around my eyes!</li>
            <li> Its easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling like you get with some.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice (be sure to pat it on gently)</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and getting lines around my eyes, this really works great as soon as I put it on, the lines start to disappear!</li>
            <li> floral scent is a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> I agree that it smells somewhat medicinal, but it is not flowery or overly strong.</li>
            <li> It smells delicious and I can see an im[provement in the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> It felt kind of zingy at first, but after a day or two I was used to it.</li>
            <li> It seems to work just fine being applied under makeup in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I didnt notice any difference in my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It worsen my fine lines...</li>
            <li> The creme is smooth and absorbs easily.</li>
            <li> It really does nice things for my eyes.</li>
            <li> If I use the Ageless under  my makeup for daytime, and the Radiance at night, I am maintaining the same great results.  </li>
            <li> Not too greasy, but not too light.</li>
            <li> Results were Fabulous.  </li>
            <li> Love berts bee&#x27;s products, I think anything that is more in the natural spectrum is going to be better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I&#x27;m sure nobody</li>
            <li> Since it did not REMOVE my wrinkles, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, lol.  </li>
            <li> Smells kind of funky but overall nice.</li>
            <li> It does a good job moisturizing, it&#x27;s mostly natural...</li>
            <li> But I am not noticing a significant difference in fine lines yet.</li>
            <li> Burts Bee&#x27;s products have never disappointed.  </li>
            <li> It does not matter how good a product is, if you can barely stand the scent.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this product makes me feel better, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it&#x27;s effective.  </li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews on this eye creme,, I was anxious to try it for myself.</li>
            <li> This crème is really good especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love it SO much that I have a subscription, so that I get it every month.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightweight, and my skins absorb it quickly.     </li>
            <li> Nothing will take the dark circles completely away, but Burts Bees Ageless Eye Cream gave me the best results, it reduces the small laugh lines around my eyes and  provides the perfect amount of moisture too.</li>
            <li> It has a cooling sensation and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> ;... let&#x27;s be more realistic.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients in this are a plus, but they ruined it by adding a very strong fragrance.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li> Maybe the jar I got was rancid, but that will teach me to buy face cream again without smelling it first!</li>
            <li> I really notice a huge difference since using it for 30 days.</li>
            <li> It really keeps your eye area smooth and silky.....</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s a great quality natural eye cream, and i will keep using it.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive and around the eyes I can have reactions and burning with many products on the market.  </li>
            <li> AND IT IS WORTH</li>
            <li> I was hoping the creme would work well and would be worth putting up with the odor</li>
            <li> I really like this so far, it moisturizes nicely around your eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s doing anything right now.  </li>
            <li> and that is something you can tell right away.</li>
            <li> It will keep dark circles light and fine lines filled, but won&#x27;t make you look 18 again.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive and tear easily.  </li>
            <li> Not worth, do not waste your money, I could not even noticed this creme hydrating my skin more effectively</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do anything for dark circles, but it has reduced the fine lines around my eyes more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> great stuff ,just kinda hard to find on sell.</li>
            <li> I could see a difference in the first day.  </li>
            <li> (exactly what I was looking for), so I use it in the morning under the foundation.</li>
            <li> The eye cream was definitely sitting on the shelf for many years before it was sent to me.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done; it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but pretty close.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty diligently</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting a fountain of youth</li>
            <li> Absolutely correct!  </li>
            <li> Once you open it, you are not goint to be able to return it.</li>
            <li> I am just happy because at least this product is working even that</li>
            <li> &quot; , it says \\&quot;the first three numbers are the day of the year the product was made (aka Julian Date).</li>
            <li> I just been wearing the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless eye creme for a very short time, so I do not know the results in a long run but it feels smooth and has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> I chose this eye cream because it has natural ingredients; it is gentle on the ageing skin; it is a competitive price; I use it morning and evening; it is better than the designer name brands for my face - far fewer chemicals.</li>
            <li> It looks white in the jar but easily absorbs into the skin.</li>
            <li> IT GOES ON YOUR SKIN EASILY AND SOOTHES MY SKIN INSTANTLY.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t find the scent strong enough at all.</li>
            <li> not sure if it really does anything age-wise but it feels good and doesnt leave a residue.  </li>
            <li> This may lead to some confusion in a house with multiple cosmetic users, or in a well-stocked cabinet, but works fine for me and hasn&#x27;t triggered any questions from my husband.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t care what it smells like though.</li>
            <li> I really feel as though it helps moisturize the eye area</li>
            <li> Plus, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li> and you could really see the lines</li>
            <li> I thought I would give it a try, even though I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> The skin around my eyes feels very moisturized all day too.  </li>
            <li> I did not like this as much as the Radiance eye cream from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  </li>
            <li> Very soothing and no reactions</li>
            <li> Band-aids, really?</li>
            <li> It really has reduced the lines and bags around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much thicker</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> shipping was fast .  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of the cream too much.</li>
            <li> It hydrates really well</li>
            <li> I really like burt&#x27;s bees&#x27; eye cream</li>
            <li> I am in the process of transitioning from big name chemically based body care products to more natural choices, and revisited my eye problem.</li>
            <li> I have pretty much used a million different creams from the cheapest to the MOST expensive, and I am really loving the way this is making my under-eye area look!</li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels like a lovely eye creme, but it was very irritating to the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> I may give their other Ageless products a try now since I&#x27;ve enjoyed this eye cream so much.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair and eyes and very fair skin, so I have naturally very dark circles under my eyes.  </li>
            <li> This cream has worked better than other comparable high end</li>
            <li> I recently tried Burt&#x27;s Radiance eye cream at night since it is a little richer and makes a good night cream.  </li>
            <li> Most of its ingredients are rated a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; concern by EWG, and I&#x27;m fine with a little alcohol as long as the rest of the goo keeps it from creating dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It does get absorbed quickly, as it only takes gentle circular motions to apply.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely lightweight and seems to absorb quickly.</li>
            <li> But my main issue is the smell.</li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is more like white glue than what I expect of regular eye cream.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this eye cream, but it irritated the skin under my eyes almost immediately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute; is very scent sensitive though.</li>
            <li> Otherwise a good product for rejuvenating tired eye lines.</li>
            <li> 40&#x27;s must be the new twenties because I am &#x27;carded&#x27; all the time.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and often have allergic reactions to products, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem in the four months I&#x27;ve been using this cream.  </li>
            <li> and I have taken to storing the jar on its side to make it easy to dab a little onto a finger without scooping into the jar.</li>
            <li> and I started to notice a little difference in the fine lines under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a young 20-something with pretty good skin but wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes from being in college, working and just plain not sleeping enough.</li>
            <li> I mix this with one drop of Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Serum [...].  </li>
            <li> Has taken 5 years off my face so far after just under 2 weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> Glorious results so far.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re sensitive to scent, you&#x27;ll probably be sensitive to this, and therefore, you may not like</li>
            <li> But I have no problem with the Naturally Ageless Eye Cream - and</li>
            <li> Does not cause any irritation, even for my husband who has sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I will be 54 years old this year</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Line Smoothing Eye Cream for over a year.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> We recommend that our products are used within 12 months after opening since they are natural products.</li>
            <li> However, the product is very moisturizing and glides on very smoothly, as long as you apply with your middle or ring finger by gently blotting it on.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying a tiny dab after my shower every morning and notice that my eye skin is no longer dry, and feels fresh throughout the day.</li>
            <li> (Burt&#x27;s Bees changed this product to a white plastic cap YEARS ago), and that was when I noticed that on the outside of the box, it also said &#x27;new,&#x27; as in new product.</li>
            <li> I sought out a simply moisturizing cream with natural ingredients and ordered Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have any major wrinkles yet</li>
            <li> I would highly recommmend this for those who are not sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> /&gt;A couple things to note - while the box is clearly labeled the container inside has no labels whatsoever - just some white cream in a glass jar.</li>
            <li> I went online to Amazon to return it, because I do not trust an eye cream that is so old, but I was a couple days outside of my 30-day return window.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and the cream is not sticky or greasy, like other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> Although I really like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Have used this eye cream more than 2 weeks, tiny lines under the eye bags have  reduced, and the eye bags have also slightly tightened, but my dark circles are still obviously ...</li>
            <li> I use it daily and works especially well on my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> At first a little medicinal smelling then I learned to appreciate the flowery part.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it for use by any age group- I am aged 60+</li>
            <li> However,, I have as of yet to see any improvement on my dark circles, and this was the main reason I purchased this eye creme.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin, but the reaction was extreme.</li>
            <li> It seems to last well, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I wish this product didn&#x27;t smell so terrible, because it is probably pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll have to find something with more gentle ingredients. :(</li>
            <li> I usually go with the Clinic for the eye cream but switched because I couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t take a lot at all - a tiny dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I often have dry, flaky skin around my eyes, especially in winter time.</li>
            <li> Finally, I thought to look up Naturally Ageless eye cream on Amazon - and there it was - at half the cost of what I used to pay!  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed any major improvement in terms of dark circles.</li>
            <li> If you want to smell like a little old lady, go ahead and buy it.</li>
            <li> Personally, I&#x27;m not a scent-type of person, as I do prefer my facial care products to contain as little scent as possible.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see what it&#x27;s doing to the age related dark circles</li>
            <li> and it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t help in the long term?</li>
            <li> and once of prevention goes a long way.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;ll last longer than other eye creams.</li>
            <li> My skin around my eyes feels dry.</li>
            <li> Even giving it 3 years, the product has long since expired !!</li>
            <li> , for winter months, this doesn&#x27;t offer enough hydration when the air has less humidity.</li>
            <li> When I could no longer find it at my local store, I tried all other kinds of other eye creams.  </li>
            <li> Usually use much more expensive crème like Clinique, lancome or shiseido.</li>
            <li> It makes no sense to add fragrance to a cream meant for the delicate and sensitive eye area.</li>
            <li> I gave it 5 stars because I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last and how the results will fare in the longer term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just seems not very sanitary.</li>
            <li> I have not really noticed any effects on circles or bags.</li>
            <li> but there&#x27;s absolutely no difference.</li>
            <li> Considering I am not certain, I will probably discontinue using it and purchase it on Burt bees website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but the odor is strong and unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many products to improve or cover them, from inexpensive to pricey, usually with disappointing results.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way ....</li>
            <li> I have had very dark circles under my eyes as long as I can remember.  </li>
            <li> being said, I did read other reviews on the scent.</li>
            <li> WHEN USING PRODUCT ONLY USE SMALL AMOUNTS AROUND EYE AREA.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say it tingled or irritated the skin, but I have not had that experience.</li>
            <li> we hope the other one like it too.</li>
            <li> the only thing that is a negative about the product itself is the scent is a little strange.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I expect the half ounce jar to last at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> But I have always had dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> But for dark circles/puffiness, it does not work for me.     </li>
            <li> I had read that some people had improvement in dark circles when using this cream, so</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream to see if it helps to reduce some of the dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness around the eye area.</li>
            <li> This eye cream is not worth at all.</li>
            <li> Usually if it isn&#x27;t Caudalie, my eyes will weep all day long, but this product is the bees</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s just more crap</li>
            <li> It dries your eyes out really bad making the crows feet even worse and is not in the least effective in any of the things it claims such as puffiness, dark circles, etc.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way, and I have noticed a small difference in the look of my crows feet.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that Burt&#x27;s bees is this shady, selling long expired products on Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Thought slightly mortified, I have to admit, there is a scent to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not even half way through the jar yet</li>
            <li> An odd choice of fragrance -- maybe they were going for a peaty scotch?</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any smoother lines or less puffiness around the eye area.</li>
            <li> would recommend it as compared to Clinique for much less.</li>
            <li> and I saw that the lines were smoother than before and less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The little glass jar I received previously from amazon had nothing printed on it, but this one came with a 7-digit number 0030801.</li>
            <li> You just have to use a little bit</li>
            <li> I gave this product plenty of time to show some result, but not even a little difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that it is in a little jar.</li>
            <li> My eyes watered a lot and burned a little.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as heavy as my fianc&amp;eacute; may have indicated, but there is a scent.</li>
            <li> Beware its a waste of money.</li>
            <li> DONT Waste ur money</li>
            <li> i opened one a few days ago,and planed to bring another one to my friend</li>
            <li> I use it everyday..</li>
            <li> It is a small jar but like massage oil a little goes along</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few eye creams in the past with no luck.  </li>
            <li> a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thick, so it will be a little greasy under the eyes</li>
            <li> My concealer doesn&#x27;t sink into the small lines around my eyes with this.  </li>
            <li> I was unhappy that the seller sent me extremely old stock of this, however.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount and spread and spread and spread</li>
            <li> this product made my face break out in a red rash, itching and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to rate this cream too badly because I only purchased it to help with dark circles.</li>
            <li> I think it smells a little odd (weird and flowery</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard for me to get to it twice a day as I always seem to be in a hurry.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes you have to use the product at least 90 days to see any type of results.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get into my contacts, plumps the delicate eye area</li>
            <li> Also, the cream itself is quite thick</li>
            <li> No more concealer for me!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s annoying and barely moisturizes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rather thin</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t make anything worse.</li>
            <li> My poor rating is for the seller (King of Deals), not the eye cream.</li>
            <li> Make the lines under my eyes even worse.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out to help against &#x27;tired&#x27; eyes.</li>
            <li> Man, if you have sensitive eyes stay away from this crap!</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Sorry honey, my eye cream smells like bandaids.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not impressed with anything.</li>
            <li> When it comes to eye creams, I am always skeptical.  </li>
            <li> I put some on the other night, and my husband asked me what that terrible smell was...</li>
            <li> I dont have real bad dark circles and puffiness but</li>
            <li> It is weird, though, that Burt&#x27;s Bees has come up with a product that smells this bad.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin horribly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;so angry of it !</li>
            <li> Impossible.</li>
            <li> they are not gone, :(  </li>
            <li> I really disappointed Amazon and Burt&#x27;s bees.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> Very bad choice.</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with this product.  </li>
            <li> Horrible, I did not dare to use the eye cream.</li>
            <li> the product smells horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this item works, I have no idea about that, I just try it....</li>
            <li> The box looks tampered and smells kinda off to me.</li>
            <li> Love the eye cream.  It smells delicious and I can see an im[provement in the puffiness and dark circles under my eyes.</li>
            <li> Smells kind of funky but overall nice. Its easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily feeling like you get with some.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Goes on smooth smells wonderful and I feel like it&#x27;s working.  Burts Bee&#x27;s products have never disappointed.  thanks</li>
            <li> Cons:&lt;br /&gt;The floral scent is a bit strong for me. Even though I apply only to my under eye area, the scent lingers for a while. Personally, I&#x27;m not a scent-type of person, as I do prefer my facial care products to contain as little scent as possible. I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s enough to prevent me from buying it again, but I would likely look elsewhere first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;It does get absorbed quickly, as it only takes gentle circular motions to apply. Product is moisturizing as advertised. It also doesn&#x27;t take a lot at all - a tiny dab goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Good price.  Prompt delivery.  Works well.</li>
            <li> The smell takes getting used to. At first a little medicinal smelling then I learned to appreciate the flowery part. I really don&#x27;t care what it smells like though. It really does nice things for my eyes. Smooths wrinkles and tightens skin. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve used it long enough to see what it&#x27;s doing to the age related dark circles but I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of eye creams, this is not on the top of my list. It&#x27;s rather thin and I find the thicker creams are best for the wrinkles under my eye. For summer months when there is more hydration in the air, this might work for just a day to day eye moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;But, for winter months, this doesn&#x27;t offer enough hydration when the air has less humidity.</li>
            <li> it is like a jam,hard to apply</li>
            <li> Have used this eye cream more than 2 weeks, tiny lines under the eye bags have  reduced, and the eye bags have also slightly tightened, but my dark circles are still obviously ... hope they will eventually be faded!!    I love both the smell &amp; texture of the eye cream; the smell is quite strong and it stays for quite awhile, but i don&#x27;t mind that since it&#x27;s a pleasant fruity smell.  It&#x27;s lightweight, and my skins absorb it quickly.     Overall, it&#x27;s a great quality natural eye cream, and i will keep using it.</li>
            <li> I mix this with one drop of Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Serum [...].  Has taken 5 years off my face so far after just under 2 weeks of use.  I use the cream alone in the day without the Serum and add a drop of the Serum at night.  Glorious results so far.  Loving it!!!!</li>
            <li> I do love this eye cream. I carry it with me in my make-up bag. I really feel as though it helps moisturize the eye area gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I did read other reviews on the scent. I was putting this on one night (in the car) and my fianc&amp;eacute; looks at me and says \\&quot;Someone smells like the perfume department at Macy&#x27;s\\&quot;. Thought slightly mortified, I have to admit, there is a scent to it. It&#x27;s not as heavy as my fianc&amp;eacute; may have indicated, but there is a scent. You will smell it. I think it smells a little odd (weird and flowery, i.e. I would not wear this as a perfume) but I don&#x27;t find the scent strong enough at all. My fianc&amp;eacute; is very scent sensitive though. If you&#x27;re sensitive to scent, you&#x27;ll probably be sensitive to this, and therefore, you may not like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can get over the scent, this is your best friend. This works wonders for someone like me (I can&#x27;t speak for anyone else). I&#x27;m a young 20-something with pretty good skin but wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes from being in college, working and just plain not sleeping enough. It&#x27;s definitely lightweight and seems to absorb quickly. I would highly recommmend this for those who are not sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> This cream has worked better than other comparable high end products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients in this are a plus, but they ruined it by adding a very strong fragrance. It makes no sense to add fragrance to a cream meant for the delicate and sensitive eye area. Plus, it doesn&#x27;t absorb very well.</li>
            <li> Good at moisturizing the eye area but didn&#x27;t notice any diminished under eye circles. It&#x27;s one of the better eye creams out there but not the greatest. It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s got natural ingredients and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> I have used this eye cream for 4 years.  My skin is extremely sensitive and around the eyes I can have reactions and burning with many products on the market.  But I have no problem with the Naturally Ageless Eye Cream - and my eyes never feel irritated.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of this cream - I feel as though it&#x27;s doing nothing for my skin. I&#x27;ve never been impressed with Burt&#x27;s Bees before but wanted to try this after reading the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees so I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try. I really notice a huge difference since using it for 30 days. I used to have puffiness under my eyes and you could really see the lines but now even my hubby notices that they are all gone! I love the smell and the cream is not sticky or greasy, like other products I&#x27;ve tried in the past. It&#x27;s the perfect texture and smells just like their pomegranate lip balm, which I love, love, LOVE! You just have to use a little bit and it goes a long way. I&#x27;m not even half way through the jar yet and I apply it before bed and before I apply makeup. Amazon has the best price on this stuff too. Love! :-)</li>
            <li> I do not know how it happened, however, I found inside a bottle curly hair, length is 3-4mm. Horrible, I did not dare to use the eye cream.</li>
            <li> I read so many great reviews on this eye creme,, I was anxious to try it for myself. It works very good on the wrinkles around the eyes. It goes on nice (be sure to pat it on gently) However,, I have as of yet to see any improvement on my dark circles, and this was the main reason I purchased this eye creme. I would recommend it for wrinkles, though.</li>
            <li> this is a great great eye cream.....not sure if it really does anything age-wise but it feels good and doesnt leave a residue.  can be used in the AM &amp; PM and i havent had an makeup issues if wearing it</li>
            <li> Makes my eyes look brighter and rested.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Burt&#x27;s Bees Radiance collection before and like it.  When I saw this type on sale, I decided to give it a try.  It does a good job moisturizing, it&#x27;s mostly natural...the only thing that is a negative about the product itself is the scent is a little strange.  Almost like chewing tobacco.</li>
            <li> Man, if you have sensitive eyes stay away from this crap! It dries your eyes out really bad making the crows feet even worse and is not in the least effective in any of the things it claims such as puffiness, dark circles, etc. Bunch of hype!</li>
            <li> It smells and feels good on your skin. Much better than all the chemical junk out there. Burts Bees is a winner.</li>
            <li> I picked this Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream since I felt I needed a bit more moisturizing under my eyes. It looks white in the jar but easily absorbs into the skin. It&#x27;s rich, creamy texture is very nice and I think it&#x27;s helped lessen under eye darkness. I may give their other Ageless products a try now since I&#x27;ve enjoyed this eye cream so much.</li>
            <li> I wish this product didn&#x27;t smell so terrible, because it is probably pretty good.  I put some on the other night, and my husband asked me what that terrible smell was...\\&quot;Sorry honey, my eye cream smells like bandaids.\\&quot;  Maybe the jar I got was rancid, but that will teach me to buy face cream again without smelling it first!</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous eye creams from all of the best department store brands and this is by far the best!!  I could see a difference in the first day.  I have dark hair and eyes and very fair skin, so I have naturally very dark circles under my eyes.  Nothing will take the dark circles completely away, but Burts Bees Ageless Eye Cream gave me the best results, it reduces the small laugh lines around my eyes and  provides the perfect amount of moisture too. My concealer doesn&#x27;t sink into the small lines around my eyes with this.  My eyes looks bright now, like I got a great night&#x27;s sleep!</li>
            <li> Has been in use for a period of time, feel very good, like it very much.</li>
            <li> Dried out my skin horribly.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to rate this cream too badly because I only purchased it to help with dark circles. I am in my 20&#x27;s, so I don&#x27;t have too many wrinkles that need diminishing yet. But I have always had dark circles under my eyes. I purchased this cream to see if it would help at all (as it claims to). However, I have been using it for about a month now and have not seen any improvements.     So perhaps it works for wrinkles, I can&#x27;t vouch for that. When I put it on, it does seem to tighten the skin. But for dark circles/puffiness, it does not work for me.     The smell seems to be an issue for some people. I agree that it smells somewhat medicinal, but it is not flowery or overly strong.</li>
            <li> Package it came in looked used..bottle, the writing on the bottle is worn out...not really sure about the product..I don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s doing anything right now.  My skin around my eyes feels dry. I&#x27;m not impressed with anything.</li>
            <li> This is a great product--the best eye cream I&#x27;ve found. But, it&#x27;s not sold in any local stores in my area. I&#x27;m very happy that Amazon sells it. Thank you!</li>
            <li> I gave this product plenty of time to show some result, but not even a little difference under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I am 32 so I don&#x27;t have any major wrinkles yet but I am having some darkness under the eyes starting. I tried this eye cream hoping it would help with that. I think this is a good eye cream. It has a good feel to it. I don&#x27;t like that it is in a little jar. I prefer the tube so that I don&#x27;t have to stick my finger in the jar each time. Just seems not very sanitary. I could use a cotton swab or something else to get the cream out but that&#x27;s just more crap I have to have in my tiny bathroom. If this came in a tube I probably would like it better. I don&#x27;t love it because I didn&#x27;t see any life changing results but it didn&#x27;t make anything worse.</li>
            <li> I have had very dark circles under my eyes as long as I can remember.  I have tried many products to improve or cover them, from inexpensive to pricey, usually with disappointing results.  Until Burt&#x27;s Ageless eye cream!  I had read that some people had improvement in dark circles when using this cream, so I thought I would give it a try, even though I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  I used it morning and night, and started seeing results within a week!  People at work kept commenting on how healthy and &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; I looked, and I started to realize that it was the Burt&#x27;s that was improving my appearance!  I have very sensitive skin and often have allergic reactions to products, but I haven&#x27;t had a problem in the four months I&#x27;ve been using this cream.  The skin around my eyes feels very moisturized all day too.  I recently tried Burt&#x27;s Radiance eye cream at night since it is a little richer and makes a good night cream.  If I use the Ageless under  my makeup for daytime, and the Radiance at night, I am maintaining the same great results.  No more concealer for me!</li>
            <li> I think this is a good eye cream for the price. It is very rich (exactly what I was looking for), so I use it in the morning under the foundation. I have not noticed any major improvement in terms of dark circles.</li>
            <li> Honestly, this product makes me feel better, but I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it&#x27;s effective.  I find that lessening the amount of stress in my life did a lot more for the lines and bags under my eyes than this product.  However, the product is very moisturizing and glides on very smoothly, as long as you apply with your middle or ring finger by gently blotting it on.  Does not cause any irritation, even for my husband who has sensitive skin.  Who&#x27;s to stay it doesn&#x27;t help in the long term?</li>
            <li> I did not like this as much as the Radiance eye cream from Burt&#x27;s Bees.  My eyes watered a lot and burned a little.  Very glad I could return it.</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic and I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference in my crows feet around my eyes! I tell EVERYONE about this product!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product.  Its the third time that I&#x27;ve bought this and I like it.  Very soothing and no reactions</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of eye creams, from high-end to drugstore...&lt;br /&gt;I have never, ever ran across a product so grossly smelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like the smell of an unlit cigarette - tobacco, I guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s yucky. And even though I believe this product does the job, it&#x27;s too stinky to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to Burt&#x27;s Bees?!!</li>
            <li> My poor rating is for the seller (King of Deals), not the eye cream. I like this eye cream a lot, and have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees eye cream for years. It is the perfect level of moisturizerization for my skin. Not too greasy, but not too light. I was unhappy that the seller sent me extremely old stock of this, however. I ordered when I was running low, and didn&#x27;t open the package until I was done with my jar. Upon opening, I saw that the cap was silver (Burt&#x27;s Bees changed this product to a white plastic cap YEARS ago), and that was when I noticed that on the outside of the box, it also said &#x27;new,&#x27; as in new product. The eye cream was definitely sitting on the shelf for many years before it was sent to me. I went online to Amazon to return it, because I do not trust an eye cream that is so old, but I was a couple days outside of my 30-day return window. I will not be buying from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I chose this eye cream because it has natural ingredients; it is gentle on the ageing skin; it is a competitive price; I use it morning and evening; it is better than the designer name brands for my face - far fewer chemicals. I would highly recommend it for use by any age group- I am aged 60+</li>
            <li> I guess this cream is OK, it&#x27;s a pleasant texture and not irritating. I have not really noticed any effects on circles or bags. But my main issue is the smell. Band-aids, really? It&#x27;s overwhelming. An odd choice of fragrance -- maybe they were going for a peaty scotch?</li>
            <li> This gets the job done; it&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but pretty close. Use it! It will keep dark circles light and fine lines filled, but won&#x27;t make you look 18 again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this pretty diligently and I wasn&#x27;t exactly expecting a fountain of youth but there&#x27;s absolutely no difference. My skin isn&#x27;t even more moisturized. The $7 bottle of Cetaphil does a better job.</li>
            <li> When it comes to eye creams, I am always skeptical.  I will be 54 years old this year and yes I have wrinkles around the eyes.  I do not know if they make a &amp;#34;magic potion&amp;#34; to help diminish wrinkles.  It would be alright for younger folks in their 20s and 30s.</li>
            <li> I have been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless Line Smoothing Eye Cream for over a year.  It really has reduced the lines and bags around my eyes.  I love that it is not harmful to my skin!</li>
            <li> great stuff ,just kinda hard to find on sell. i like most of burts bee products. wish they had more to offer and  bulk buys too.</li>
            <li> I just received this yest and I can feel my complexion getting better. It is a small jar but like massage oil a little goes along way so i&#x27;m not using gobs n gobs at a time. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;ll last me awhile so yeah I think I may need to keep this in supply;-D</li>
            <li> The best eye smoothing cream out there!</li>
            <li> Make the lines under my eyes even worse. Wont ever buy again. Beware its a waste of money. DONT Waste ur money</li>
            <li> The consistency of this product is more like white glue than what I expect of regular eye cream. Will not buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few eye creams in the past with no luck.  This one definetly lightened the circles.  Unforetunately they are not gone, :(  but lighter they are.  The smell is not the best, but no one seemed to notice and after I close up the jar I don&#x27;t notice it anymore either.  It&#x27;s sometimes hard for me to get to it twice a day as I always seem to be in a hurry.  It seems to work just fine being applied under makeup in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I usually go with the Clinic for the eye cream but switched because I couldn&#x27;t see much of a difference but this product is absolutely awesome.  It&#x27;s much thicker so it&#x27;ll last longer than other eye creams. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It really keeps your eye area smooth and silky.....love it!</li>
            <li> THIS EYE CREAM IS WONDERFUL. IT GOES ON YOUR SKIN EASILY AND SOOTHES MY SKIN INSTANTLY. IT HAS ALREADY MADE MY EYE AREA LOOK AGELESS./YOUNG LOOKING. I WOULD RECOMMEND PRODUCT AND IT IS WORTH IT PRICE IS GREAT. WHEN USING PRODUCT ONLY USE SMALL AMOUNTS AROUND EYE AREA. I USE MORNING AND AT NIGHT BEFORE SLEEP.&lt;br /&gt;THIS EYE CREAM IS A JEWEL.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I didnt notice any difference in my fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Been using it for several weeks now, with a noticeable difference in the skin around the eye area - lighter, smoother.  I suffer with darker skin around the eyes and this has definitely helped to improve the appearance in that area.</li>
            <li> Very bad choice. It worsen my fine lines...</li>
            <li> The cap was brokem when it arrived. shipping was fast .  The bottle was different than those purchased in the store and on Burt Bees website.  The name is also different . I hope the product is the same.  Considering I am not certain, I will probably discontinue using it and purchase it on Burt bees website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would Have given it 5 stars ---- but I don&#x27;t know if it is the truly the same product for the reasons mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I loved the product when purchased at the store and had to have it again.  Results were Fabulous.  Then, I don&#x27;t have wrinkles  probably because and once of prevention goes a long way. 40&#x27;s must be the new twenties because I am &#x27;carded&#x27; all the time.</li>
            <li> My eyes are sensitive and tear easily.  I love this cream, it softened my lines and keeps the tender eye-area very soft and bright.</li>
            <li> I use a small amount and spread and spread and spread BUT it never soaks in! How can it do the job if it can&#x27;t absorb into the skin? It&#x27;s annoying and barely moisturizes.</li>
            <li> I really disappointed Amazon and Burt&#x27;s bees. When I open the package, the burt&#x27;s bees box in the package was already opened and the cream leaked out. So I finally return it.</li>
            <li> I often have dry, flaky skin around my eyes, especially in winter time. In addition to not looking the greatest and itching throughout the day, I was getting concerned about how this might affect my long term skin health. After trying several big cosmetic brands from the drugstore, all of which irritated my eyes during the day and didn&#x27;t fully relieve the dryness, I gave up for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I am in the process of transitioning from big name chemically based body care products to more natural choices, and revisited my eye problem. It turns out that the &amp;#34;brighteners&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;light reflectors&amp;#34; included in many cosmetics and eye creams can cause irritation. I sought out a simply moisturizing cream with natural ingredients and ordered Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless. Most of its ingredients are rated a &amp;#34;0&amp;#34; concern by EWG, and I&#x27;m fine with a little alcohol as long as the rest of the goo keeps it from creating dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying a tiny dab after my shower every morning and notice that my eye skin is no longer dry, and feels fresh throughout the day. A little goes a long way, and I expect the half ounce jar to last at least 6 months. I gave it 5 stars because I&#x27;m not sure how long it will last and how the results will fare in the longer term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple things to note - while the box is clearly labeled the container inside has no labels whatsoever - just some white cream in a glass jar. This may lead to some confusion in a house with multiple cosmetic users, or in a well-stocked cabinet, but works fine for me and hasn&#x27;t triggered any questions from my husband. Also, the cream itself is quite thick and I have taken to storing the jar on its side to make it easy to dab a little onto a finger without scooping into the jar.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and feels like a lovely eye creme, but it was very irritating to the skin around my eyes. I&#x27;ll have to find something with more gentle ingredients. :(</li>
            <li> I just been wearing the Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturally Ageless eye creme for a very short time, so I do not know the results in a long run but it feels smooth and has a nice light scent.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 bottles  aneless 2 monthes ago . i opened one a few days ago,and planed to bring another one to my friend,She  read the date in the buttom of the bottle:0030801..that means it was made in 2008!&lt;br /&gt; I asked the qurestion here,but the seller no answer it yet !!!&lt;br /&gt;so angry of it !it is a shame !!!!</li>
            <li> Was very disappointed with this product.  Another reviewer talked about the creme having an odor similar to band aids.  Absolutely correct!  Since it was only one review, I thought maybe the reviewer was just a bit picky but the odor is strong and unpleasant.  It stopped using it in the a.m. and only use in the p.m.  I was hoping the creme would work well and would be worth putting up with the odor but I have not noticed any improvement and I have been using for almost a month.  Although I really like other Burt&#x27;s Bees products, I would not recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, fast S&amp;H and will buy again.</li>
            <li> When I could no longer find it at my local store, I tried all other kinds of other eye creams.  Finally, I thought to look up Naturally Ageless eye cream on Amazon - and there it was - at half the cost of what I used to pay!  From now on I make sure I am well stocked.  Paired up with the Ageless Serum, it has taken years off my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this eye cream to see if it helps to reduce some of the dark circles, wrinkles and puffiness around the eye area. I don&#x27;t like the fragrance of the cream too much. I do like the way the cream feels on my skin. I haven&#x27;t seen any smoother lines or less puffiness around the eye area. Sometimes you have to use the product at least 90 days to see any type of results. So I guess I can continue to use this eye cream and maybe see some results in the future.</li>
            <li> I just got this eye cream. You never going to believe the product being made on 2009 which&lt;br /&gt;the lot code on the bottle shows 3360901. It already pass it  expiration date for more than one year.&lt;br /&gt;I use Burt&#x27;s Bee for more than five years now. I will never buy them from Amazon just because it&lt;br /&gt;is cheaper.</li>
            <li> I really like this so far, it moisturizes nicely around your eyes. I&#x27;ve read other reviews that say it tingled or irritated the skin, but I have not had that experience. It felt kind of zingy at first, but after a day or two I was used to it. It seems to last well, a tiny bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...I use it every day and I have NO wrinkles around my eyes. I will definitely continue using it!</li>
            <li> I dont have real bad dark circles and puffiness but its there.  This product works great for me!!  Definetley can see a difference when I dont use it!</li>
            <li> Great gift for my mom</li>
            <li> It has a cooling sensation and absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way .... It hydrates really well</li>
            <li> This is an excellent eye cream. The Burt&#x27;s Bees AGELESS line of products are all excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream feels very soothing, refreshing and smells great.</li>
            <li> I tried this product out to help against &#x27;tired&#x27; eyes. It has done nothing for the puffy but has reduced the age lines and furrowed brow. I will be switching to a different product for the puffy eyes. Otherwise a good product for rejuvenating tired eye lines.</li>
            <li> this product made my face break out in a red rash, itching and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Nice and smooth. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> It does not matter how good a product is, if you can barely stand the scent. If you want to smell like a little old lady, go ahead and buy it. What a disappointment! I bought it based on the reviews, but come on guys... the product smells horrible. Once you open it, you are not goint to be able to return it. It is weird, though, that Burt&#x27;s Bees has come up with a product that smells this bad. I do not even imagine myself using this eye creme again. I used it three times thinking I was going to be able to tolerate the smell. Impossible. Not worth, do not waste your money, I could not even noticed this creme hydrating my skin more effectively and that is something you can tell right away. One more thing, for those reviewers who state that this cream has &amp;#34;erased the wrinkles around the eyes&amp;#34;... let&#x27;s be more realistic. No cream is going to do that. That a cream can hydrate, enhance the texture of the skin, make it look better, yes. But &amp;#34;erase wrinkles&amp;#34;... only Botox can do that. This eye cream is not worth at all.</li>
            <li> Love berts bee&#x27;s products, I think anything that is more in the natural spectrum is going to be better for your skin. That being said however, I saw no change in undereye brightening. I do like the light formula though, and it smells great.</li>
            <li> This cream moisturizes my eyes better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It doesn&#x27;t do anything for dark circles, but it has reduced the fine lines around my eyes more than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.  It feels great going on and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I will be buying it again!</li>
            <li> My face find good.I use it everyday..Because it is safe,we are all like it..we hope the other one like it too.</li>
            <li> Usually use much more expensive crème like Clinique, lancome or shiseido. This crème is really good especially for the price.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it as compared to Clinique for much less.</li>
            <li> It was a great gift for my wife.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Naturall Ageless Eye Creme is wonderful I use it daily and works especially well on my sensitive eyes.</li>
            <li> So I think I spent thousands of dollars so far trying products that never worked. I came about this product (not here at amazon) and I thought: _Oh well! What the heck! If I buy it there will be one more junk. I will try it.&lt;br /&gt;It has been 2 weeks that I am wearing this cream and I started to notice a little difference in the fine lines under my eyes. I looked at the mirror and I saw that the lines were smoother than before and less noticeable. I am just happy because at least this product is working even that a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is thick, so it will be a little greasy under the eyes (I have oily skin) and the smell is not the best one, but I like the results. I wear it twice a day, in the morning and at night before bed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get into my contacts, plumps the delicate eye area&lt;br /&gt;and smoothes out creping and wrinkles.  Has a pleasant&lt;br /&gt;smell and nice texture.</li>
            <li> I tried this based on the good reviews, and I&#x27;m not sorry.  A little goes a long way, and I have noticed a small difference in the look of my crows feet.  It seems to brighten up my eyes.  I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell, but I&#x27;m sure nobody but me can smell it and it seems to go away after it&#x27;s applied.  Makes my skin feel supple and hydrated.  Since it did not REMOVE my wrinkles, I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars, lol.  Nice product, glad I got it.</li>
            <li> This is one of Burt&#x27;s best products by far. Usually if it isn&#x27;t Caudalie, my eyes will weep all day long, but this product is the bees knees!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it SO much that I have a subscription, so that I get it every month. I couldn&#x27;t ask for more. Thank you so very much!</li>
            <li> I love this eye cream. I have pretty much used a million different creams from the cheapest to the MOST expensive, and I am really loving the way this is making my under-eye area look!</li>
            <li> I really like burt&#x27;s bees&#x27; eye cream and this is my one of my re-orders . The little glass jar I received previously from amazon had nothing printed on it, but this one came with a 7-digit number 0030801. I guessed it would be some code indicating the date it expires/was produced, so I looked it up online and on burt&#x27;s bees&#x27; official website \\&quot;[...]\\&quot; , it says \\&quot;the first three numbers are the day of the year the product was made (aka Julian Date). The next two digits are the year, and the last two digits are a batch number \\&quot;, so this means the product was produced on January 3rd, 2008!!! OMG!!! Then the website says \\&quot;Our products should be in good quality condition for 3 years. We recommend that our products are used within 12 months after opening since they are natural products. \\&quot; Even giving it 3 years, the product has long since expired !! I can&#x27;t believe that Burt&#x27;s bees is this shady, selling long expired products on Amazon!! Returning this!! Don&#x27;t buy this product!!! Otherwise you would be applying poison to your eyes while you think you&#x27;re taking care of it!!!</li>
            <li> The creme is smooth and absorbs easily. My skin feels sufficiently hydrated. But I am not noticing a significant difference in fine lines yet. So the jury is still out about this as an anti-aging product. I&#x27;ll give it a little more time.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this eye cream, but it irritated the skin under my eyes almost immediately. I do have sensitive skin, but the reaction was extreme.</li>
            <li> I am 40 years old and getting lines around my eyes, this really works great as soon as I put it on, the lines start to disappear!</li>
