            <li>Great Price, a lot of hair, nice length,&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Matched my hair perfectly after I washed my own hair and flat iron with no product in it.</li>
            <li>matched my hair perfectly, (dyed burgundy, faded out a bit) though the quality was a bit low.</li>
            <li>It tangled so easily.</li>
            <li>But the hair falls out of the clips and they get tangled fairly easily.</li>
            <li>And free shipping was a plus.</li>
            <li>Just was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and good the only thing was the hair was not enough you have to order more then 1</li>
            <li>you have recently dyed your hair, and can easily straighten it, these will probably work for you.</li>
            <li>For the price you really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I do really like the color and length.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had human hair extensions before, but the idea of buying human hair extensions online kind of freaks me out, so I decided to go this route.</li>
            <li>It is more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li>I was surprised at the quality!</li>
            <li>Each clip is pretty thin, once all of the clips are put in it&#x27;s actually pretty full.</li>
            <li>it want it to look natural  </li>
            <li>and they never stayed soft, they just stayed tangled.</li>
            <li>I wore it around ComiCon all day and it blended in well with my natural hair.</li>
            <li>i chose a 2 because they are very tangley, they are super long and thin.</li>

            <li> Pros: Great Price, a lot of hair, nice length,&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The hair is a little shiny, but then again it is synthetic. The color is not really red. It is more of a dark brown.</li>
            <li> Matched my hair perfectly after I washed my own hair and flat iron with no product in it. I&#x27;m a African American with a curly texture of hair. Recommended for my &amp;#34;mixed&amp;#34; woman but be careful my roots had too be flat ironed every now and then. Also too get the shine out of it I recommend using baby powder! Worked for me and I still use mine</li>
            <li> My granddaughter wanted this so she ordered and bought it.  I can&#x27;t recommend it one way or the other but it must have worked out.  I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had human hair extensions before, but the idea of buying human hair extensions online kind of freaks me out, so I decided to go this route. These are thin, stick-straight, and a weird color. Not sure what I was supposed to expect, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have recently dyed your hair, and can easily straighten it, these will probably work for you.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and good the only thing was the hair was not enough you have to order more then 1 set it you it want it to look natural  the color was a lil off for my hair color but nothing dying them could fix</li>
            <li> Tangled after one use. Horrible. Just order human extensions. Not worth it att all. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time</li>
            <li> It tangled so easily.</li>
            <li> The hair fails out. There ugly. Looks like something from the dollar store. Wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. Unless you wanna look stupid</li>
            <li> matched my hair perfectly, (dyed burgundy, faded out a bit) though the quality was a bit low. You get what you pay for I suppose, but they are fun, and quite thick.</li>
            <li> For the price you really can&#x27;t complain. You get what you pay for.. It&#x27;s a lot of hair.. Each clip is pretty thin, once all of the clips are put in it&#x27;s actually pretty full. The only con for me is that it&#x27;s a little shiny but nothing too terrible. I like them though. And free shipping was a plus.</li>
            <li> not what I was hoping for. Had a hard time putting them in my hair and when I finally got them in and brushed them the hair started coming out of the clips. Even at that when I pulled them out the package the hair was already coming off of them in big pieces.</li>
            <li> Terrible quality please don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> Just was not as good as I expected.</li>
            <li> The clip in were disappointing. One thing they don&#x27;t curl. They tangle constantly at the ends. I washed them 3 to 4 times a week and they never stayed soft, they just stayed tangled.</li>
            <li> i chose a 2 because they are very tangley, they are super long and thin. i had to cut them to make them look thicker</li>
            <li> I do really like the color and length. But the hair falls out of the clips and they get tangled fairly easily.</li>
            <li> Sad that the hair does not curl at all.  But yeah what can you expect for the price</li>
            <li> ugly. synthetc. looks like a fake cosplay wig. its absolutly terrible.dont buy not worth it</li>
            <li> I was surprised at the quality! I wore it around ComiCon all day and it blended in well with my natural hair.</li>
