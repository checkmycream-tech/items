            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t expect to be needing to replace that, but it&#x27;s good knowing that it is replaceable.</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>and it seems to be a really good product</li>
            <li>That converter costs even more than the price I paid for the curling iron !</li>
            <li>(There&#x27;s a tutorial on youtube on how to use this kind of curling iron.)</li>
            <li>The iron itself has a nice feel; however, I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>The heat settings are adjustable which is very important.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this curling iron.</li>
            <li>On top of that it was encased in the dreaded, sealed plastic container.</li>
            <li>Overall very very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I was happy with my purchase and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Furthermore, it actually stays the perfect temperature without burning my hair off.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy an electrical voltage converter in order to be able to use the product.</li>
            <li>I really love this to curl my hair, if I need big voluminous curls this product is the best to use..</li>
            <li>thx : )</li>
            <li>I owned the exact one for five years and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Works great gets hot fast and love my curls!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited!</li>
            <li>I bought this at wal mart about a year ago and it actually surprised me as it works great,, i ususally dont use hairspray so my curls would fall in a couple of hours</li>
            <li>Now, I know firsthand why people want frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have tons of hair.  </li>
            <li>thought getting better quality would be worth it.</li>
            <li>I found this curling iron and was excited to try it.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS CURLING IRON, has lasted a year and still going, very durable and such a great item</li>
            <li>Love it, it&#x27;s heats up quickly and is just the right size for my bangs.</li>
            <li>I really liked that this curler came with a velcro strap attached to the cord to keep it tidy when not in use, which the other curler didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Even though I clean it with alcohol and then a product I purchased at a hair salon to clean it, the barrel is deteriorating quickly.</li>
            <li>not as I expected I have a pro straighter and it works great</li>
            <li>Also, if you just wrap your hair around the barrel starting at the ends and rolling up, you&#x27;re not going to get good results.</li>
            <li>This curling iron is awesome, my big bouncy curls last all day long, and they have the most amazing shine.</li>
            <li>super annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It have never fried my hair even though it can get very hot</li>
            <li>It heats up super fast and has a heat adjuster.</li>
            <li>I decided that I would be buy the same curling iron as I had had such great results with the first one.</li>
            <li>Very reasonable.</li>
            <li>But that was with 4 years of consistent use.</li>
            <li>One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the protective tip was too short, which can lead to burns from accidentally touching the barrel instead of the tip.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of that converter, but the iron is not getting too hot when I turn it on.</li>
            <li>but after it happens my hair be looking shinning and very voluminous , very satisfied and definitely getting a new replacement</li>
            <li>With the smaller cap you can easily grab the hot ceramic part of the iron.</li>
            <li>I also like that it heated up just as quickly as the other one and has a strong clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the swivel cord and the end piece</li>
            <li>I spent most of the time laughing because it must have been packaged to withstand an atomic blast.</li>
            <li>It is a fast way to straighten kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>Never gets turned off by mistake like most of my other curling irons do.  </li>
            <li>I have long hair and this curling iron helps me to have huge curls and will also straighten it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better if you start closest to the roots and curl as you go down.</li>
            <li>The cord is perfect; it is long enough allowing me to grab the hairspray I left in the other room, and it refrains from knotting and strangling me.  </li>
            <li>It is high quality feeling.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this iron the few times it was needed.  </li>
            <li>Spend a few more $$ and buy quality products ladies.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a replacement to my fourth Hot Tools curling irons (I don&#x27;t seem to have much luck with those).</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly though and you can curl/straighten quite a bit of hair with each clamp down.</li>
            <li>Big mistake, it never heated as well as the first one and after 5 months just died.</li>
            <li>My biggest issue with this curling iron is that the end cap is much smaller than the end cap on my Hot Tools.  </li>
            <li>I loved this curling iron at first, but then in a few months the yellow ceramic began to come off, which leaves the barrel very rough.  </li>
            <li>I had such high hopes for this product but was very dissapointed once i used it.</li>
            <li>so I would stay clear of this item.</li>
            <li>When the cord finally twirled too much.........</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t happen all the time but frequently.</li>
            <li>My old con air from 10</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not tight it let&#x27;s go the curls</li>
            <li>I had an older version of this same curling iron and after 3 years it died.</li>
            <li>LOW or HIGH setting there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a difference in the heat.</li>
            <li>live in France and here we have different voltage, we use 220V-240V.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and holds hair firmly in place.</li>
            <li>Not sure if this is an appropriate timeframe for it to stop working when it was only used occasionally and never used daily.</li>
            <li>Great price too, less expensive than</li>
            <li>It took me no less than 15 minutes to open.</li>
            <li>In terms of features, this was almost exactly the same as the other one I purchased, with both toting the on/off switch, swivel cord, and temperature adjustment.</li>
            <li>/&gt;In terms of performance, the curls stayed for a pretty long time but not as long as with the other iron.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a very sturdy cardboard box with no easy way to open.</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and medium coarse, so I can get the setting just right and as long</li>
            <li> A bigger barrel will make loose waves.</li>

            <li> When I bought it &amp;#34;Like other folks, the only problem I have found with this is the pulling of hair by the spring joint.  </li>
            <li> but as I used it the paint on the top clamping came off and flaked into my hair, so that was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> The handle is very loose 😡</li>
            <li> I have had this a few short months.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not exactly the case.</li>
            <li> The barrel never snags or pulls my hair like my other ones have before.</li>
            <li> Gives you loose, bouncy waves that aren&#x27;t too tight which is just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the second one i&#x27;ve owned and the same piece has broken on each.</li>
            <li> Love the cord and the swivel base.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have to spray them down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than a year and the spring that causes it to clamp broke off.</li>
            <li> However it has stopped working in less than 6 months.  </li>
            <li> One typically holds on to the end cap when they are twirling/steadying the iron.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!  </li>
            <li> I was looking for a curling iron that would give me big, Victoria&#x27;s Secret model looking waves and this did it.</li>
            <li> I literally had to destroy the plastic cover it came with just to get it out...</li>
            <li> I tried it twice; both times my hair hardly curled at all.</li>
            <li> Hair glides thru nicely, no pulling or snagging.  </li>
            <li> I will be buying a different brand :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite disappointed.</li>
            <li> This was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t do it for me, sorry !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve opened probably hundreds of packages in my lifetime and this one was literally the worst.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I think people misunderstand that a bigger curling iron is going to make bigger curls. That&#x27;s not exactly the case. A bigger barrel will make loose waves. Also, if you just wrap your hair around the barrel starting at the ends and rolling up, you&#x27;re not going to get good results. It&#x27;s better if you start closest to the roots and curl as you go down. (There&#x27;s a tutorial on youtube on how to use this kind of curling iron.) I am really enjoying this curling iron. It is high quality feeling. The spring clip is also replaceable at the cost of $1.50 each. Very reasonable. I don&#x27;t expect to be needing to replace that, but it&#x27;s good knowing that it is replaceable. I really like the swivel cord and the end piece is the perfect size. I never burn my fingers. The heat settings are adjustable which is very important. My hair is thick and medium coarse, so I can get the setting just right and as long as no one else messes with it I don&#x27;t have to reset it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con is the packaging. It was horrendous. I&#x27;ve opened probably hundreds of packages in my lifetime and this one was literally the worst. It took me no less than 15 minutes to open. It&#x27;s a very sturdy cardboard box with no easy way to open. Each side of the box was sealed and I had to cut the thing to pieces to get the iron out and the cord was in a separate section of the box and I had to cut the box lengthwise to get the cord out. On top of that it was encased in the dreaded, sealed plastic container. I spent most of the time laughing because it must have been packaged to withstand an atomic blast. Now, I know firsthand why people want frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li> Works great gets hot fast and love my curls!</li>
            <li> Loved this curling iron, had it for almost 4 years and it worked perfectly. Only downfall was that the clamp&#x27;s paint started peeling off and would constantly get into my hair. But that was with 4 years of consistent use. Overall very very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I owned the exact one for five years and loved it.  When the cord finally twirled too much.........I replaced it with the replica, and am extremely happy.</li>
            <li> I found this curling iron and was excited to try it. I wanted a 1 1/2\\&quot; inch, so I thought this was perfect. I tried it twice; both times my hair hardly curled at all. I want big curls when I curl my hair, which is what a 1 1/2\\&quot; curling iron should normally be expected to deliver. This was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Does not hold may hair ! The handle is very loose 😡</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t curl at all!!!</li>
            <li> Heats up great but the clamp it&#x27;s not tight it let&#x27;s go the curls and once you open the clamp it stays open I have to close it my self not as I expected I have a pro straighter and it works great</li>
            <li> Did not hold a curl and the spring broke after about 6 months of use if that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this less than a year and the spring that causes it to clamp broke off. It&#x27;s the second one i&#x27;ve owned and the same piece has broken on each. I will be buying a different brand :(</li>
            <li> do not buy this product the paint chips off into your hair under the inside of the curling iron barrel.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this iron the few times it was needed.  However it has stopped working in less than 6 months.  Not sure if this is an appropriate timeframe for it to stop working when it was only used occasionally and never used daily.</li>
            <li> When I bought it &amp;#34;Like other folks, the only problem I have found with this is the pulling of hair by the spring joint.  It doesn&#x27;t happen all the time but frequently. Fortunately, I have tons of hair.  It heats up very quickly though and you can curl/straighten quite a bit of hair with each clamp down. It is a fast way to straighten kinky hair.  So, I would buy it again, if I had to do it over again.    It is now December 2015 and the thing died about two months ago.  I continue to suffer from all the short hairs I now have that got pulled out from the hinge on this thing.  So, it didn&#x27;t even last 6 months and did some damage so I would stay clear of this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this at wal mart about a year ago and it actually surprised me as it works great,, i ususally dont use hairspray so my curls would fall in a couple of hours but after it happens my hair be looking shinning and very voluminous , very satisfied and definitely getting a new replacement</li>
            <li> Best curling iron I&#x27;ve ever had! Love the cord and the swivel base. The barrel never snags or pulls my hair like my other ones have before. I&#x27;m going to get another one in a smaller size.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a curling iron that would give me big, Victoria&#x27;s Secret model looking waves and this did it. It heats up super fast and has a heat adjuster. It&#x27;s also easier to work with than a curling wand.</li>
            <li> I had such high hopes for this product but was very dissapointed once i used it. Doesnt keep the curl and low quality. Spend a few more $$ and buy quality products ladies.</li>
            <li> I loved this curling iron at first, but then in a few months the yellow ceramic began to come off, which leaves the barrel very rough.  Even though I clean it with alcohol and then a product I purchased at a hair salon to clean it, the barrel is deteriorating quickly.</li>
            <li> I have had this a few short months. I am the only user of this product used at home, not a salon. The movable part of the iron has pain peeling off and gets into my hair. It heats well though.</li>
            <li> I had an older version of this same curling iron and after 3 years it died. I decided that I would be buy the same curling iron as I had had such great results with the first one. Big mistake, it never heated as well as the first one and after 5 months just died. Save your money and try another one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this curling iron on Amazon along with another pricier brand 1 -1/2&amp;#34;  curling iron (which was double the price- $33) to compare the two. This product definitely gives higher-end curling irons a run for their money. In terms of features, this was almost exactly the same as the other one I purchased, with both toting the on/off switch, swivel cord, and temperature adjustment. I really liked that this curler came with a velcro strap attached to the cord to keep it tidy when not in use, which the other curler didn&#x27;t have. I also like that it heated up just as quickly as the other one and has a strong clamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of performance, the curls stayed for a pretty long time but not as long as with the other iron. One thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the protective tip was too short, which can lead to burns from accidentally touching the barrel instead of the tip. Ouch. Also, it took me 20 minutes just to take this curling iron out of it&#x27;s packaging. I literally had to destroy the plastic cover it came with just to get it out...super annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a budget curling iron with the same features of a high-end curing iron, I would recommend this one. It&#x27;s definitely outperforms the drugstore brand products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a replacement to my fourth Hot Tools curling irons (I don&#x27;t seem to have much luck with those). The Pro Beauty seemed to be similar in size and weight so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The iron itself has a nice feel; however, I stopped using it. My biggest issue with this curling iron is that the end cap is much smaller than the end cap on my Hot Tools.  This is a big issue as it makes it easier to burn yourself. One typically holds on to the end cap when they are twirling/steadying the iron. With the smaller cap you can easily grab the hot ceramic part of the iron.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS CURLING IRON, has lasted a year and still going, very durable and such a great item</li>
            <li> Love it, it&#x27;s heats up quickly and is just the right size for my bangs. Great price too, less expensive than anywhere I have seen it.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron but as I used it the paint on the top clamping came off and flaked into my hair, so that was a little disappointing.</li>
            <li> LOW or HIGH setting there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a difference in the heat. Does not hold curls, they start to fall out after 2 hours.  Wish I kept the packaging and info.....so it can be returned.  Not worth it!  My old con air from 10+ years ago held its curl and I loved it (the wires/circuit went out) thought getting better quality would be worth it.</li>
            <li> This curling iron does the job for a great affordable price. Gives you loose, bouncy waves that aren&#x27;t too tight which is just what I wanted. I was happy with my purchase and fast delivery. Great quality as well.</li>
            <li> This curling iron is awesome, my big bouncy curls last all day long, and they have the most amazing shine. I cannot believe I didn&#x27;t think to try this earlier, the reviews don&#x27;t lie nor do I.  This curling iron is a keeper and for the price I say stock up.</li>
            <li> Best thing about this curling iron is the placement of the buttons.  Never gets turned off by mistake like most of my other curling irons do.  Great design.  Hair glides thru nicely, no pulling or snagging.  A great buy in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Without this curing iron, I would be the beast.  The cord is perfect; it is long enough allowing me to grab the hairspray I left in the other room, and it refrains from knotting and strangling me.  Furthermore, it actually stays the perfect temperature without burning my hair off.  I believe it would curl my toes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually quite disappointed. I saw a youtube guru use this as she was doing a review for human hair and it seems to be a really good product so I ordered it immediately.&lt;br /&gt;I live in France and here we have different voltage, we use 220V-240V. This curling iron is built only for US thus 120V.&lt;br /&gt;I wish they had put this information in the &amp;#34;product details information&amp;#34; box! They didn&#x27;t !&lt;br /&gt;Now I had to buy an electrical voltage converter in order to be able to use the product. That converter costs even more than the price I paid for the curling iron !&lt;br /&gt;And I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of that converter, but the iron is not getting too hot when I turn it on. Even when it&#x27;s on &amp;#34;high&amp;#34; position.&lt;br /&gt;So it doesn&#x27;t do it for me, sorry !</li>
            <li> I put it on the highest temp setting but the curls don&#x27;t last even with hairspray</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this curling iron helps me to have huge curls and will also straighten it out. It have never fried my hair even though it can get very hot</li>
            <li> I really love this to curl my hair, if I need big voluminous curls this product is the best to use..thx : )</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t do without it!!!</li>
            <li> My curls stay in place and I don&#x27;t even have to spray them down. I&#x27;m so excited! I will never get a different curling iron</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived in a timely manner and well packaged. Quality item. Heats quickly and holds hair firmly in place. Warning: do not leave this item on any surface that can be damaged by heat.</li>
