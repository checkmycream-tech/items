            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Although the powder is much lighter than the wax it works great!</li>
            <li>Just wished the gel part was sold on its own.</li>
            <li>Super affordable and great quality.</li>
            <li>it blends perfectly and just gives your eyebrows a fuller natural look.</li>
            <li>This is what I have discovered,  The cream line maker of the light set works good for me, The powder of this set works better for me when I use alone.  </li>
            <li>Great price and fast shipping also!</li>
            <li>This is like the next best thing.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I&#x27;ve been using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried the loreal pencils and I prefer powder/wax more.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite brow product and I have used many.</li>
            <li>she is white &amp; it was perfect for her!</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>how many times I apply it to get a darker or nicer appearance.</li>
            <li>I love this eyebrow kit.</li>
            <li>I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder.</li>
            <li>Plan to buy more.</li>
            <li>It was not expensive at all and works amazing!</li>
            <li>To tell the truth, the first time I read about this product I laughed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good brow compact.</li>
            <li>okay the light had some reddish undertones.</li>
            <li>I use the NYC dark brown pencil and this gel (I don&#x27;t use the powder side) on top and my eyebrows are perfect</li>
            <li>, it goes on smoothly and is more pigmented than I assumed it would have been.</li>
            <li>e.l.f. makeup makes it easy.</li>
            <li>My eyebrows are naturally black and this blends in perfectly.</li>
            <li>A good time to try it out the first time would be right before you are cleaning your face at night -- give it a go and then remove it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s completely accurate with description and seller</li>
            <li>Its such a great product for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I find the color is to light for my eyebrows..</li>
            <li>It feels cheap and flimsy.</li>
            <li>But if you already have your own eyebrow brushes or brushes you would use then it doesn&#x27;t really matter.</li>
            <li>really light no matter</li>
            <li>Super easy to shape.</li>
            <li>Super great for the price obviously, and I don&#x27;t regret the buy at all.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much!</li>
            <li>This duo really looks great with my naturally brunette eyebrows!</li>
            <li>If I warm it up or work with it a bit it does a good job, I just would prefer it to be a little easier  to work with.</li>
            <li>I got this as i am new to doing my brows and this is everything i was looking for since i have my own set of brushs.</li>
            <li>Your better off getting your own angled flat brush to use with this.</li>
            <li>Enhancing your brows can really change your appearance for the better.</li>
            <li>Good brows are just a few dollars away :)</li>
            <li>Maybe if I used some high quality brushes this product would look a lot better</li>
            <li>I had this product in light first and while it worked</li>
            <li>Easy and fast  to apply.</li>
            <li>Also, pretty packaging!</li>
            <li>The wax sets the hairs and lays a color basis and the powder smooths the look out making it even more natural looking.</li>
            <li>Worth the wait</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and looks really natural.</li>
            <li>Of course, you must do as others have suggested and use a light hand, and I might add a good eyebrow brush, but that is just common sense.</li>
            <li>and I like how smooth and natural this product looks on my brows!</li>
            <li>I love this product for the simple and easy application and the natural look.</li>
            <li>I actually purchased this item twice thinking that the darker color would look better.</li>
            <li>and i wish that I would have just purchased the higher priced BB cosmetic to get the look</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure which color to try and this was a little dark for my kind of light eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>This product goes on very smooth and very little is needed, it goes on as light as a feather and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>I thought it would go on looking like a dry chalky layer on top</li>
            <li>You get a large quantity of product for your buck.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use the powder side as much as the gel side gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>know that some ELF products can be hit or miss, but this one is absolutely a hit.</li>
            <li>is fast with delivery</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>and I so love the idea of one being a powder and the other a gel.</li>
            <li>My brows and hair have cool undertones, not warm, so the medium color worked much better.</li>
            <li>I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the product as well as the price, though the tiny little brush is a bit lacking.</li>
            <li>Surely, I thought, this must be a waste of money.</li>
            <li>I lean towards trying to keep my eyebrows looking a little bit more on the natural side and everything about this product does what I need.</li>
            <li>This kit gives you a defined, yet very natural eyebrow look.</li>
            <li>It looks very natural.</li>
            <li>pretty well I&#x27;m of mixed race</li>
            <li>All I can say is, wow!</li>
            <li>It stays all day, and honestly into the next day (if I don&#x27;t wash it off at night) with very little need for reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks natural.</li>
            <li>This is not as natural as a lot of reviews said.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re stiff and cheap.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s pretty much useless and the gel is okay</li>
            <li>I have pretty dark eyebrows and this product</li>
            <li>I had to wipe off some of the gel to avoid them looking too fake, but they look really nice now.</li>

            <li> This is not as natural as a lot of reviews said.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re stiff and cheap.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s pretty much useless and the gel is okay</li>
            <li> I have pretty dark eyebrows and this product</li>
            <li> I had to wipe off some of the gel to avoid them looking too fake, but they look really nice now.</li>
            <li> Only regret is that waited so long to make this purchase.</li>
            <li> It lasts as long as the anastasia dip brow</li>
            <li> Obviously we all have different color needs for makeup, and my eyebrows are a mix of sun bleached, brown and a few grey hairs.  </li>
            <li> The powder end is not full enough in my opinion and the angled side feels rough.</li>
            <li> I choose this rating cause product its not really as described.  </li>
            <li> (I was skeptical at first about that).</li>
            <li> The only, small, problem I have with this product is the brush it came with.</li>
            <li> One side is gel and the other is powder.</li>
            <li> Like any other makeup it stays on all day if you don&#x27;t touch it.</li>
            <li> you have black eyebrows,  this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> The colors are a little bit dark</li>
            <li> and I have used it everyday since.</li>
            <li> (I deducted one star for the awful brush included, so use your own.)</li>
            <li> Read my full review on Jennbizzle.com: [...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been filling them in with just plain eyeshadow for years.</li>
            <li> Now part of my everyday makeup routine!</li>
            <li> Bought it in Medium because I didn&#x27;t wanna go too dark and dramatic.</li>
            <li> I like this kit, however the cream product in it is a bit too hard for me.</li>
            <li> My eyebrows are a little too thin and lighter than I like.</li>
            <li> I will warn you that it takes a delicate touch and perhaps a bit of practice to get the results you want.</li>
            <li> You can come out looking like Joan Crawford in a horror flick if you lay it on too thick.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t appear dusty or make them lighter.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I was comparing to Bobby Browns product and there is no comparison.</li>
            <li> This stuff looked cheesy and felt cheesy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s impossible to find a product like this one.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> Perfect color!!! Natural-looking and beautiful eyebrows. Super easy to shape.👍👍</li>
            <li> I choose this rating cause product its not really as described.  Color I picked was Medium brown and it looks like nlack color. Don&#x27;t know if I will recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this as i am new to doing my brows and this is everything i was looking for since i have my own set of brushs. It works perfect with a light hand.</li>
            <li> I had this product in light first and while it worked okay the light had some reddish undertones. My brows and hair have cool undertones, not warm, so the medium color worked much better. I love this product so much! It stays on for days if you don&#x27;t wash it off.</li>
            <li> Always wanted to buy the Anastasia brow kit but it&#x27;s way too pricey for my taste. This is like the next best thing. My eyebrows are naturally black and this blends in perfectly. I use the NYC dark brown pencil and this gel (I don&#x27;t use the powder side) on top and my eyebrows are perfect</li>
            <li> Its such a great product for a fraction of the price. Easy to apply and looks really natural. The two tones allows you to create a 3D effect to your brows.</li>
            <li> This kit gives you a defined, yet very natural eyebrow look. The wax sets the hairs and lays a color basis and the powder smooths the look out making it even more natural looking. Although the powder is much lighter than the wax it works great! (I was skeptical at first about that). You get a large quantity of product for your buck. Also, this is $3 on the ELF website so a great value!</li>
            <li> The product is great. I find the color is to light for my eyebrows..&lt;br /&gt;If you have black eyebrows,  this might not be for you.</li>
            <li> I just received this product a couple days ago and I have used it everyday since. I like the wax/gel, it goes on smoothly and is more pigmented than I assumed it would have been. I also like the powder.....I thought it would go on looking like a dry chalky layer on top but it doesn&#x27;t.....it blends perfectly and just gives your eyebrows a fuller natural look. It doesn&#x27;t appear dusty or make them lighter. The only, small, problem I have with this product is the brush it came with. It feels cheap and flimsy. The powder end is not full enough in my opinion and the angled side feels rough. But if you already have your own eyebrow brushes or brushes you would use then it doesn&#x27;t really matter. I plan to continue using this kit for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product multiple times. It is comparable to much more expensive products. I have tried similarly packaged products from Benefit, and find this easier and longer lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use the powder side as much as the gel side gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m an oily skinned woman, and have never had problems with this product staying on my face. It stays all day, and honestly into the next day (if I don&#x27;t wash it off at night) with very little need for reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know that some ELF products can be hit or miss, but this one is absolutely a hit.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product. The powder has no pigment to it so it&#x27;s pretty much useless and the gel is okay but it doesn&#x27;t last on your brows.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product.  It&#x27;s impossible to find a product like this one.  The value is great, the choice of colors are great, and they work well together.</li>
            <li> My friend, who happens to be a makeup artist, recommended this product to me.  I am very pleased with the product as well as the price, though the tiny little brush is a bit lacking.</li>
            <li> works great love how it goes on my eyebrows. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments since I&#x27;ve been using this product. Tell her it&#x27;s completely accurate with description and seller is fast with delivery</li>
            <li> Great product, receive it in a timely fashion.</li>
            <li> To tell the truth, the first time I read about this product I laughed. I&#x27;ve been using a neutral eye shadow to fill in my brows for years. Surely, I thought, this must be a waste of money. Well, surprise, surprise. It is very good. I will warn you that it takes a delicate touch and perhaps a bit of practice to get the results you want. You can come out looking like Joan Crawford in a horror flick if you lay it on too thick. A good time to try it out the first time would be right before you are cleaning your face at night -- give it a go and then remove it. Enhancing your brows can really change your appearance for the better. Once you try it, you&#x27;ll use it regularly! (I deducted one star for the awful brush included, so use your own.)</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow kit! It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> Good product to try out and see if you like to do your brows.  I ended up using this as my back up and buying the sephora kit.  I&#x27;ve tried the loreal pencils and I prefer powder/wax more. Get a different brush, this one is garbage.</li>
            <li> just what I wanted perfect colors for me and I so love the idea of one being a powder and the other a gel.</li>
            <li> Absolutly love! It lasts as long as the anastasia dip brow</li>
            <li> This is my favorite brow product and I have used many. It looks very natural.</li>
            <li> Took a chance and bought this eyebrow kit online and I really like it. Bought it in Medium because I didn&#x27;t wanna go too dark and dramatic. It works really well. Not a fan of the brush but I have an angled brush that i use instead</li>
            <li> I use this every day love love love it!!! The colors are a little bit dark but I can make it work</li>
            <li> I like this kit, however the cream product in it is a bit too hard for me. If I warm it up or work with it a bit it does a good job, I just would prefer it to be a little easier  to work with. Super great for the price obviously, and I don&#x27;t regret the buy at all.</li>
            <li> Great product! I lean towards trying to keep my eyebrows looking a little bit more on the natural side and everything about this product does what I need. Great color, formula, ease of use.</li>
            <li> Works great for me. My eyebrows are a little too thin and lighter than I like. I&#x27;ve been filling them in with just plain eyeshadow for years. This stuff works awesome though! One side is gel and the other is powder. I had to wipe off some of the gel to avoid them looking too fake, but they look really nice now. Also, pretty packaging!</li>
            <li> Good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> I thought this would match my skin tone pretty well I&#x27;m of mixed race and it didn&#x27;t go well you couldn&#x27;t even see it! Gave it to my best friend she is white &amp; it was perfect for her!</li>
            <li> Perfect for my darker skin.</li>
            <li> Great product. Just wished the gel part was sold on its own.</li>
            <li> This duo really looks great with my naturally brunette eyebrows! It works wonder! Super affordable and great quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good brow compact. I do wish the powder was a bit darker though. The brush it comes with is horriable. Your better off getting your own angled flat brush to use with this.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Only regret is that waited so long to make this purchase. Easy and fast  to apply. Looks natural. Will buy again..</li>
            <li> This product was not to my satisfaction. I thought I was getting a quality Brow make up that works,  it don&#x27;t! doesn&#x27;t work, don&#x27;t show. really light no matter how many times I apply it to get a darker or nicer appearance.</li>
            <li> I believe in good brows. After all, they frame our eyes! I will spend a lot of money to have a good brow powder. I am shocked that this stuff is so good, for such an inexpensive price. All I can say is, wow! Of course, you must do as others have suggested and use a light hand, and I might add a good eyebrow brush, but that is just common sense. If you are on the fence about this product, don&#x27;t be. Good brows are just a few dollars away :)</li>
            <li> I love this product for the simple and easy application and the natural look. Like any other makeup it stays on all day if you don&#x27;t touch it. Would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this item twice thinking that the darker color would look better. Unfortunately, I was comparing to Bobby Browns product and there is no comparison. This stuff looked cheesy and felt cheesy. I will not purchase this again. I can not recommend it and i wish that I would have just purchased the higher priced BB cosmetic to get the look i want that has never let me.</li>
            <li> I love this eyebrow kit. I love that it comes with a wax-based product and a powder. I love that there are different colors because all eyebrows are not created equally. Read my full review on Jennbizzle.com: [...]</li>
            <li> This product goes on very smooth and very little is needed, it goes on as light as a feather and lasts all day.  Plan to buy more.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price; will repurchase.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure which color to try and this was a little dark for my kind of light eyebrows.  I also got the blonde set. This is what I have discovered,  The cream line maker of the light set works good for me, The powder of this set works better for me when I use alone.  Obviously we all have different color needs for makeup, and my eyebrows are a mix of sun bleached, brown and a few grey hairs.  By mixing the two sets and utilizing what color I want, I can create different levels of drama or lack of) with my eye brows.  The affordability of e.l.f. makeup makes it easy.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It was not expensive at all and works amazing! Now part of my everyday makeup routine!</li>
            <li> Was hesitant about getting this.  But it works great! I just used eyeshadow and an angled brush before and I like how smooth and natural this product looks on my brows! Great price and fast shipping also!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Fills in you&#x27;re eyebrows amazingly! Worth the wait</li>
            <li> Item was delivered on time...the product was in tact and gave me great results</li>
            <li> Loved it. Does the job</li>
            <li> This is not as natural as a lot of reviews said. I have pretty dark eyebrows and this product just didn&#x27;t do it for me. Definitely don&#x27;t use the brushes that this kit provides....they&#x27;re stiff and cheap. Maybe if I used some high quality brushes this product would look a lot better</li>
