            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>So glad I started using it.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>but it is better then</li>

            <li>While I still love to shop at amazon, I think some products may not be genuine.  </li>
            <li>but I can definitely say this line is super impressive.</li>
            <li>Overall I love skinceuticals ANYthing -- they&#x27;re always great for me.</li>
            <li>and I received this product QUICKLY!</li>
            <li>I love this product and the customer service I received from this company was stellar!  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Another HUGE difference is the appearance of blackheads.</li>
            <li>I also contacted Skinceuticals and they confirmed Amazon was not an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li>Received it promptly and it is a great product as i use it daily</li>
            <li>I can honestly say I will highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This is the best cleanser ever - not too harsh, not too mild.</li>
            <li>Not only have I achieved that goal, but my skin is brighter and has more of a healthy glow!</li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I also have been experiencing acne breakthroughs which had vanished with the original tube purchased at the spa.</li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t feel that it leaves my face super smooth everywhere.  </li>
            <li>and my face feels clean.</li>
            <li>It also smells fresh and clean and not perfumy.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face smooth and feeling very clean and seems to clear up some blemishes.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this cleanser overall.</li>
            <li>The first one was returned because it lacked the scent and texture I was used to.</li>
            <li>I use this cleanser most days of the week twice daily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hurt my super sensitive skin, and does its job.</li>
            <li>Great for slightly oily skin that gets an occasional outbreak.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy this cleanser because I thought it would be really drying.</li>
            <li>I buy their mositurizer and gentle cleanser and the eye renewal cream.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying from these folks!</li>
            <li>They sell this same product in the same size at my dermatologists office for a lot more money.</li>
            <li>This is a good cleanser to use daily, or just a few times a week.  </li>
            <li>My acne is not horrible but my skin is not perfect either, honestly you can buy over the counter (OTC) products such as neutrogena and save money.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong enough to clear my skin but gentle enough to not dry it out too much.</li>
            <li>My new dermatologist recommends Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li>or else it will dry your face and produce more oil as it will compensate for your face being dry.  </li>
            <li>I also am prone to breakouts if under stress, but my skin responds very well to this and breakouts are very rare (and usually coincide with my cycle).  </li>
            <li>It is like a cheap version of Proactive to gently remove zits and actually made me break out a little.</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and this in conjunction with the moisturizer has changed my skin&#x27;s appearance.</li>
            <li>It truly keeps my adult acne prone skin soft and clear.</li>
            <li>I went after this product in hopes of ending my frequent breakouts.</li>
            <li>and it has caused my breakouts to diminish completely without over drying my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t completely help my acne because I still need medication</li>
            <li>My 13 year old son has been using this cleanser to prevent acne breakouts and just like the doctor suggested</li>
            <li>I think it is too old.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a few $$ cheaper to go to when the cost of this gets too prohibitive, but until then, just a dab twice a day will keep you clean and clear.</li>
            <li>I have acne only on the side of my jawbone &amp; got this &amp; noticed a big change I highly recommend this line of products!!</li>
            <li>I also started using a super heavy duty moisturizer (clinique anti-gravity).</li>
            <li>I have used this product for several years purchasing it from a Spa near my home.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I love Skin Ceuticals! I&#x27;ll never stop using this line. My skin is clear and this in conjunction with the moisturizer has changed my skin&#x27;s appearance. Seller was the best and I received this product QUICKLY!</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy this cleanser because I thought it would be really drying. I&#x27;m able to use it twice a day with a heavier moisturizer (My skin is normal/dry) and I&#x27;ve noticed a huge difference in my skin. I went after this product in hopes of ending my frequent breakouts. Not only have I achieved that goal, but my skin is brighter and has more of a healthy glow! Another HUGE difference is the appearance of blackheads. I constantly had them on my nose and now I can hardly even see them! What a great surprise!! I use less than a pea-sized drop with each wash so a little goes a long way. I&#x27;m also using the C E Ferulic antioxidant serum from Skinceuticals. I was worried I was going to spend all this money and not have a good result but I can definitely say this line is super impressive. My skin has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and have been using this product for more than 6 months.  A pea size twice a day goes a long way.  No need to use more than that or else it will dry your face and produce more oil as it will compensate for your face being dry.  It is a scrub consistency.  I purchased this to perform like a microdermabrasion where it scrubs my face however I don&#x27;t feel that it leaves my face super smooth everywhere.  My chin area still feels like it needs a deeper scrub.</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t too harsh for my skin, I&#x27;m using it day and night and after two weeks I have A) fewer blemishes and B) fresher-looking skin. It doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin out, either, although at the same time I began using it I also started using a super heavy duty moisturizer (clinique anti-gravity). I had already tried Proactiv, a salicylic spot treatment, and a few other things -- this is working (so far) where nothing else really did. It also smells fresh and clean and not perfumy. Overall I love skinceuticals ANYthing -- they&#x27;re always great for me. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> The dermatologist recommended that I use this cleanser, so I got some and love it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my super sensitive skin, and does its job. Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been a fan of Skinceuticals for years. I buy their mositurizer and gentle cleanser and the eye renewal cream. I have always been more than pleased! However, this product does not impress me. It is like a cheap version of Proactive to gently remove zits and actually made me break out a little. My skin got dry around the areas where I used it. I don&#x27;t see the purpose of this. I would not recommend it. Wish I could trade it in for something else in their line.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this cleanser overall. I like the way it lather and my face feels clean. My skin seems to have even out complexion wise which makes me happy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this product! I have been using it for a year and it has caused my breakouts to diminish completely without over drying my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best cleanser I have ever used.  Helps heal and protect the skin.  So glad I started using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 years now, and would be at a loss without it.  It truly keeps my adult acne prone skin soft and clear. Its starting to get a bit pricey, so I may need to find a back up that&#x27;s a few $$ cheaper to go to when the cost of this gets too prohibitive, but until then, just a dab twice a day will keep you clean and clear.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser I have ever used.  It&#x27;s strong enough to clear my skin but gentle enough to not dry it out too much.</li>
            <li> This is a very good skin cleanser. It leaves my face smooth and feeling very clean and seems to clear up some blemishes. They sell this same product in the same size at my dermatologists office for a lot more money. It is much less expensive through Amazon.</li>
            <li> My derm recommended this. It doesn&#x27;t completely help my acne because I still need medication but it is better then any other cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li> I have acne only on the side of my jawbone &amp; got this &amp; noticed a big change I highly recommend this line of products!! I also have tried other products from SkinCeuticals &amp; I don&#x27;t have one bad thing to say! worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This is the best cleanser ever - not too harsh, not too mild. Great for slightly oily skin that gets an occasional outbreak.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old son has been using this cleanser to prevent acne breakouts and just like the doctor suggested*** it has prevented horrible acne ***** I can honestly say I will highly recommend this product. I&#x27;m ordering 2 more tubes one for my son and one for me. Hopes this review helps.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is the only one that I have continued to use for years.  It exfoliates perfectly leaving my skin&#x27;s texture very smooth.  I also am prone to breakouts if under stress, but my skin responds very well to this and breakouts are very rare (and usually coincide with my cycle).  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> Ive tried this product three times now. My acne is not horrible but my skin is not perfect either, honestly you can buy over the counter (OTC) products such as neutrogena and save money. My new dermatologist recommends Neutrogena products.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years purchasing it from a Spa near my home.  They were out so I found it on Amazon. The first one was returned because it lacked the scent and texture I was used to. Amazon replaced it with no issues.  Problem is that the replacement appeared to be a fake too. I also have been experiencing acne breakthroughs which had vanished with the original tube purchased at the spa. While I still love to shop at amazon, I think some products may not be genuine.  I also contacted Skinceuticals and they confirmed Amazon was not an authorized dealer.</li>
            <li> you can use daily once or twice per day depending on your skin condition...recommended by my dermatologist! product works great...</li>
            <li> This is a good cleanser to use daily, or just a few times a week.  It helps to minimize bumpy skin and prevent future breakouts.</li>
            <li> I can tell that my pores are minimized and that my complexion is better.  I am really happy that I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite product as always. Thanks</li>
            <li> Great cleanser! I use this cleanser most days of the week twice daily. Two days each week I use the Skinceuticals Facial Scrub instead during my morning skin care regimen. My pores appear smaller, my face is cleaner and my skin is refreshed and renewed. I also like the scent which is slightly citrus but nothing overpowering.</li>
            <li> I used this product daily to wash my face i love the fact the scrub make my skin looking youthful</li>
            <li> I love this product and the customer service I received from this company was stellar!  I highly recommend buying from these folks!</li>
            <li> Received it promptly and it is a great product as i use it daily and it is recommended by dermatologist.</li>
            <li> Product smells no very good. I think it is too old. I have been using this cleanser for a while, and it doesn&#x27;t smell in the way this one does.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have problems with the shipment.</li>
            <li> This is a great cleanser if you have oily, acne prone skin. It&#x27;s a little pricey but lasts me for months.</li>
