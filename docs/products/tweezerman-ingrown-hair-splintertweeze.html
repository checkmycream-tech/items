            <li>best pair of tweezers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t been overly impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a tweezer expert but they seem great for me!</li>
            <li>Although I was very happy with the shipment and I will still use them.</li>
            <li>It has been a great item</li>
            <li>These do a great job of digging them out.  </li>
            <li>These do the job great.</li>
            <li>These are great for splinters and ingrown hairs.  </li>
            <li>Great tweezers.  </li>
            <li>These are great quality tweezers that come to a needle point.</li>
            <li>The needle points were great for finding and grasping the splinters.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Always great quality with Tweezerman</li>
            <li>These tweezers work great.  </li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>Happy with the product, and the price I paid for it.  </li>
            <li>Great buy</li>
            <li>These tweezers are great for getting out any ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Great tool otherwise</li>
            <li>This is a very handy tool to have.</li>
            <li>They were wonderful for many years.</li>
            <li>THIS pair, however, is perfectly aligned, needle-tipped and strong.  </li>
            <li>After purchasing a pair of Tweezerman slant tweezers and finding them excellent, I decided to buy this pair of &amp;#34;needle point&amp;#34; tweezers to deal with fine wood or metal splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>PERFECT for removing splinters and fine pieces of glass.</li>
            <li>very good, but grip could be better</li>
            <li>How good are they?</li>
            <li>Now that&#x27;s a good tweezer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good idea to keep them in this when you&#x27;re not using them.</li>
            <li>Good quality material.  </li>
            <li>It makes taking slivers out of kids&#x27; feet 100% easier, the grip is good, the pinch and precision is militaristic.</li>
            <li>I like a duller tip, but these are good quality nonetheless.</li>
            <li>Good pair.</li>
            <li>I loved this until just after my one month Amazon return period I dropped it in my sink and the tip bent, ruining the grip.</li>
            <li>Good for tweezing brows or something like that,</li>
            <li>I quickly realized these would meet a purpose at home - besides ingrown hairs, they&#x27;re excellent for pulling splinters and, a problem for me, nails that splinter on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li>I am sure they will also be great for splinters.</li>
            <li>Nicely aligned ,feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>Best, most precise tweezers I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>but I sure could feel it!  </li>
            <li>This product works exactly as advertised, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Also as a tweezer it is great on fine hair.</li>
            <li>these are amazing</li>
            <li>I own a pair of those too</li>
            <li>but after a while, they weren&#x27;t quite as effective.  </li>
            <li>Not as nice as when they were made in Italy, but they will serve.</li>
            <li>At best Tweezerman will send you a coupon for 1/2 off a new pair bought off their site</li>
            <li>But, this is by far the best tweezerI have found</li>
            <li>know there&#x27;s a healthy mix of reviews on here for these, but what I bought works perfect, has a superfine point, and grabs very well.</li>
            <li>but it would have been nice to warn people that this is easily damaged.</li>
            <li>Good quality and overall very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li>Excellent not only for ingrown hairs but also for removing cactus needles which is why I bought this.  </li>
            <li>It looks to me like the needle points are more pronounced on that one, and that may be a pro or con for some people.</li>
            <li>They come in a plastic vial for storage, with a rubber cover for the tip to keep the blades safe, and a lifetime guarantee to send them in for resharpening.</li>
            <li>Okay product for when needed.</li>
            <li>Although they are top-notch quality, I really only needed the set.  </li>
            <li>Ever since I spotted a pair of these in my Dermatologist&#x27;s Office I&#x27;ve been wanting to get my hands on them:)</li>
            <li>Love these and will buy nothing but tweezerman tweezer products.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with the Tweezerman GEAR ingrown tweezers.</li>
            <li>Mine were made in Germany, so I think the quality was a bit better.</li>
            <li>LOVE TWEEZERMAN PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>You need to make sure to keep the cap on the tip of the tweezers so that you don&#x27;t hurt yourself or damage the tip in case the tweezers fall, etc.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure if Amazon had these but did the search and found the identical tweezers I wanted and ordered two pair.</li>
            <li>Even though they say Tweezerman, I doubt they are authentic.</li>
            <li>Very fine, but almost too fine.  </li>
            <li>You can be very accurate and get to the hair easily.</li>
            <li>but when it did arrive i was able to pluck the ingrown easily.</li>
            <li>most tweezer tasks, Tweezerman&#x27;s Slant Tip Tweezers will do just fine.</li>
            <li>but they seem fine for most of what I need them to do.  </li>
            <li>These are the best tweezers I have ever owned, and since I loose them easily, I have had a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was happy to replace an old pair of tweezers which I have had for twenty years.  </li>
            <li>The fit and finish are top quality and</li>
            <li>the tips are very sharp, but the inside wall also have a textured gripping surface, so this thing works perfect.</li>
            <li>not so good for those jobs that require the flat-ended tweezers, but terrific for the jobs that need more of a needle-tweez !</li>
            <li>The sharpness and gripping ability seem just about perfect to me: it easily breaks the surface of the skin to get to the hair and is able to form a firm and precise grip.</li>
            <li>This is excellent and verrry sharp.</li>
            <li>Well made, tips are sharp and align perfectly,  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Tweezers are extremely sharp and excellent for getting out ingrowns or splinters.</li>
            <li>Well designed, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Theses with a strong</li>
            <li>And they are not just sharp, but the sides come together perfectly flush, making it easy to pick things with the barest of material available.</li>
            <li>I really liked these tweezers when I first got them</li>
            <li>Size is perfect, not too small and very comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The ends of the tweezers are very sharp, making them perfect for extracting ingrown hairs or splinters without scarring.  </li>
            <li>work perfectly fine</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t grasp the fine hairs as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>That said, the tips are extremely precisely aligned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;People keep mentioning the \\&quot;free sharpening\\</li>
            <li>Not the kind I was really looking.</li>
            <li>With tips so fine, I&#x27;m sure that accidentally dropping them tip first would bend them out of alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Okay, so who gets excited about a pair of tweezers, right?</li>
            <li>, keep it in the original package to protect the tip.  </li>
            <li>Well made, these are worth the price!</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve switched to wet shaving with a safety razor and hopefully won&#x27;t need this very often, but very happy with them anyway.)</li>
            <li>These are pretty good tweezers, but only 3 stars because they aren&#x27;t nearly as fine (the point is not as fine)</li>
            <li>I presume they would be good for ingrown hairs, but I will use them for tiny splinters.  </li>
            <li>and they&#x27;re better (sharper, easier to hold) than the stainless version reviewed here</li>
            <li>Please check out the Tweezerman site for full details.  </li>
            <li>After a good shave, I can actually reach into a pore and grab a problem hair.</li>
            <li>Tried and true.</li>
            <li>You could get the most minuscule splinter out with these, or hurt yourself accidentally with the very pointy tip.</li>
            <li>I love these so much.</li>
            <li>Much to my relief, the new one is just as good as the one I bought 20 years ago.</li>
            <li>I tried five more times, turning the tweezers over to be sure that one side did not grip better than the other, and it worked each time.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, these tweezers are in that too unusual category of products that do just what they are supposed to do--making them a real pleasure to own.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found a source for a new pair.</li>
            <li>It is great for digging out a stray eyebrow hair, but be careful as you may &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; too much!</li>
            <li>I think they where worth the $$$ I paid ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li>totally worth the money</li>
            <li>as my old pair of Tweezerman needle nose tweezers, which I bent repairing the washing machine (ok, it was an emergency and cheaper than a repair call</li>
            <li>Just the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not enough surface area to give a strong grip on anything but hairs and fine splinters.</li>
            <li>Works great on small splinters.</li>
            <li>There not bad better than most I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li>These tweezers are sharp and do a great job when they&#x27;re new.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping to love these after my experiences with other tweezerman tweezers, but I think they are just okay.</li>
            <li>Much better than using the old straight pin method.</li>
            <li>A beginner may need a little practice at first because ends are like needles, but this gives a much better precision, so you don&#x27;t end-up plucking more than needed at one time.</li>
            <li>These work very well but pretty quickly needed sharpening.</li>
            <li>Good for other people who can use them - I really wanted these to work.</li>
            <li>It may not be the best for the stray hair that is far down under your eyebrow as those strays are a bit fine and may be harder to grip without pinching the skin.</li>
            <li>My husband works with metal and being able to get the shavings out of his hands is essential.</li>
            <li>The ends don&#x27;t touch perfectly, making it difficult to grap the hair without causing damage to the skin around it.  </li>
            <li>My first Tweezerman lasted for 20 years.  </li>
            <li>Every first aid kit, cosmetic bag, and bathroom should contain one of these.</li>
            <li>I always keep a pair handy in case I lose (which I have done) or damage (be careful not to drop as this can warp the tips from &#x27;meeting&#x27; and grabbing the hair) a set.</li>
            <li>I think these are okay, but I prefer a different pair.</li>
            <li>These are so sharp I was able to go into the entry wound and grab and pull out the splinter without ripping all the skin off!  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>But isn&#x27;t that what I&#x27;m paying for in the first place.</li>
            <li>I like these because they have a sharp point and are good for tiny fine hair or coarser brows, depending on your needs.</li>
            <li>My bent 10 year old tweezers grasp hair better than the new ones do.</li>
            <li>Either the tips didn&#x27;t meet perfectly or were too wide (not a true needle-tip) or they were flimzy.  </li>
            <li>While I can see that they may be helpful with ingrown hairs if you are ultra careful and okay with a little blood being drawn, but I can&#x27;t see how people successfully use these for splinters without causing a cut.</li>
            <li>in general, it is way better than the normal tweezers&lt;br</li>
            <li>For larger objects, you&#x27;ll want the slant tip style, which contacts across a much wider tip, therefore giving you a better grip.</li>
            <li>exactly as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li>I thought twice about spending so much for a pair of tweezers, but I decided to go for it after so many years of blunt tweezers that couldn&#x27;t easily get small splinters.  </li>
            <li>Theyre very sharp and effective.  </li>
            <li>A CERTAIN WAY TO TWEEZE</li>
            <li>Also be aware that there are multiple hairs growing out of each plug, so you have to grip them all for complete removal :)</li>
            <li>They are needle sharp, have perfectly alligned points, and can reach anything small.  </li>
            <li>Not the kind of tweezer that gets those little hairs in your magnifying mirror</li>
            <li>Be very careful because they have a very fine point.</li>
            <li>Great tweezers and very sharp when first purchased but they dull very quickly...</li>
            <li>If you cant decide, i highly recommend to get these first to try.</li>
            <li>ingrown hairs are a huge problem for me and these tweezers are the only thing that helps.</li>
            <li>and I have used it much.</li>
            <li>shipment delivery was fast (about 1 week - 10 days) to Sweden, which is away faster than the ones on ebay</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think I could ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are very well made tweezers.  </li>
            <li>They are fairly solid and are precisely machined.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really imagine better-made pointy tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Those seeking the absolutely pointiest tweezers may want to consider:  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t get to use it much.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used them much yet.</li>
            <li>Points don&#x27;t really line up very well</li>
            <li>I needed something much thinner.</li>
            <li>: stainless steel&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Made very durable and with quality&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Don&#x27;t really have any.</li>
            <li>They really work</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the new model very much</li>
            <li>Had to order a new one because I lost my first one.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use, excellent to remove those nasty embedded splinters.  </li>
            <li>try, but I&#x27;m still going to try other brands to find a better one.</li>
            <li>I am currently using my original pair and just bend them from time to time.</li>
            <li>I was expecting more precision based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li>but you should use a more sharply pointed tweezer for removing splinters.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very precise, and are able easily to get the smallest, thinnest little hairs that I could not have even dreamed to remove with the generic previous tweeter</li>
            <li>These are great tweezers and especially for those stubborn hard to get in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re very similar, the new model is a tad heavier than the old (more metal) but the tip is about 85% as sharp/fine/pointy as the old.  </li>
            <li>Much better than typical tweezers.</li>
            <li>A bit expensive, but product is worth it, I was finally able to get ingrown brow hairs without having to wait to be able to pull with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for both men and women.</li>
            <li>I bought a set for my bathroom and second for my first aid kit!</li>
            <li>Good pair of tweezers and very useful for splinters but a little too sharp to use, definitely be cautious when using them.</li>
            <li>This is great for getting that little tiny sliver that is deep in there and just won&#x27;t come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so i needed a tweezers that would get those fine hairs that i could see but couldnt pluck with other tweezers.</li>
            <li>Those did not tweeze fine hairs, only coarse ones.</li>
            <li>Also they arrived brand new with misaligned heads.</li>
            <li>When you drop them (and you will) you will have to buy a new pair.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it, so when the tip got bent, I ordered a new one.  </li>
            <li>Super sharp and Tweezerman products come with a very generous warranty for repair or resharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>the way, I&#x27;ve seen this exact model for sale locally at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, if you&#x27;d like to take a look in person.</li>
            <li>The first pair I sent back to readjust  the alignment to no avail after having had to insure package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparing the two tweezers (old &amp; new)</li>
            <li>The 20 year old is still sharper than the new ones.</li>
            <li>Item okay, but not adequate for removing ingrown chin or upper lip hair.</li>
            <li>However, my fiancee (who I bought them for) has trouble getting a hold of the hairs because the point is so fine.  </li>
            <li>Great for woodworkers, just had a deep splinter &amp; tweezers have a small sharp point that took out  immediately.</li>
            <li>I frequently get ingrown hairs on my neck from shaving every day.  </li>
            <li>These offer no advantage as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>The tweezers I received Spring 2014 say \\&quot;Tweezerman\\&quot; on the outside of the tweezers, \\&quot;Stainless India\\&quot; on the inside.  </li>
            <li>&quot; service Tweezerman offers.  </li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much thanks to my using these tweezers regularly.</li>
            <li>These are made in India; my old Tweezerman&#x27;s were made in Europe.</li>
            <li>I used to order these directly from manufacturer and when I went to their site, they were out.</li>
            <li>The two times so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because I have always used a slant tweeter I could not decide and bought both these and the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant Tweeter at the same time.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re blunt at the tips, which is probably a good thing to prevent yourself from accidentally stabbing your skin, but they&#x27;re too blunt to be very helpful for ingrown</li>
            <li>I think they are expensive at $11.50, but since they are so good, I now I have to purchase another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can just go straight in and in one or two attempts I can pull it right out, with no other tools and far less damage to the skin than the old way.</li>
            <li>Still vastly better than any drugstore tweezers, and they will last for years as long as you&#x27;re careful not to drop them and keep the plastic tip cover on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Every household needs a pair of these tweezers, you never know when you&#x27;ll need them to tweeze out something small or fine.</li>
            <li>High quality, you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>These are my second pair of Tweezerman Tweezers and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>if you are wanting something that can dig the ingrown hair out this wouldn&#x27;t be the right product for you, the so called point isn&#x27;t really a point it&#x27;s squared off and just doesn&#x27;t grasp the small hair.</li>
            <li>I get very bad ingrown hairs in my pubic area from waxing, and this is the best (by far) tweezer</li>
            <li>The tips were not sharp at all &amp; didn&#x27;t come to a point, &amp; they bent almost immediately.</li>
            <li>Works well for the intended splinters, but I primarily use it for getting &amp;#34;seed ticks&amp;#34; that are too small for regular tweezers and tick removal devices.</li>
            <li>I got a complete set of sharps from eBay for only $5 which are a match in quality and sharpness.</li>
            <li>Perhaps I don&#x27;t know how to use them properly, and they&#x27;re really handy for other uses, but not really good for my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>For ingrown hairs, the tips are not sharp enough to remove hair below skin where ingrown hairs lay.</li>
            <li>If you are really struggling with ingrown hairs give these a try, but be very careful so that you aren&#x27;t left with a scab.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re VERY sharp, VERY pointed .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t use them the right way because I used them for tweezing all eyebrow hairs, not just ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>High quality product that works extremely well for tweezing ingrown hairs and pulling out splinters.</li>

            <li> but I haven&#x27;t been overly impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a tweezer expert but they seem great for me!</li>
            <li> Although I was very happy with the shipment and I will still use them.</li>
            <li> It has been a great item</li>

            <li> Great tweezers.  </li>
            <li> These are great quality tweezers that come to a needle point.</li>
            <li> The needle points were great for finding and grasping the splinters.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Always great quality with Tweezerman</li>
            <li> These tweezers work great.  </li>
            <li> Great product.  </li>
            <li> Happy with the product, and the price I paid for it.  </li>
            <li> Great buy</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great for getting out any ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Works great.  </li>
            <li> Great tool otherwise</li>
            <li> This is a very handy tool to have.</li>
            <li> They were wonderful for many years.</li>
            <li> THIS pair, however, is perfectly aligned, needle-tipped and strong.  </li>
            <li> After purchasing a pair of Tweezerman slant tweezers and finding them excellent, I decided to buy this pair of &amp;#34;needle point&amp;#34; tweezers to deal with fine wood or metal splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> PERFECT for removing splinters and fine pieces of glass.</li>
            <li> very good, but grip could be better</li>
            <li> How good are they?</li>
            <li> Now that&#x27;s a good tweezer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good idea to keep them in this when you&#x27;re not using them.</li>
            <li> Good quality material.  </li>
            <li> It makes taking slivers out of kids&#x27; feet 100% easier, the grip is good, the pinch and precision is militaristic.</li>
            <li> I like a duller tip, but these are good quality nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Good pair.</li>
            <li> I loved this until just after my one month Amazon return period I dropped it in my sink and the tip bent, ruining the grip.</li>
            <li> Good for tweezing brows or something like that,</li>
            <li> I quickly realized these would meet a purpose at home - besides ingrown hairs, they&#x27;re excellent for pulling splinters and, a problem for me, nails that splinter on my hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I am sure they will also be great for splinters.</li>
            <li> Nicely aligned ,feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> Best, most precise tweezers I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> but I sure could feel it!  </li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Also as a tweezer it is great on fine hair.</li>
            <li> these are amazing</li>
            <li> I own a pair of those too</li>
            <li> but after a while, they weren&#x27;t quite as effective.  </li>
            <li> Not as nice as when they were made in Italy, but they will serve.</li>
            <li> At best Tweezerman will send you a coupon for 1/2 off a new pair bought off their site</li>
            <li> But, this is by far the best tweezerI have found</li>
            <li> know there&#x27;s a healthy mix of reviews on here for these, but what I bought works perfect, has a superfine point, and grabs very well.</li>
            <li> but it would have been nice to warn people that this is easily damaged.</li>
            <li> Good quality and overall very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Excellent not only for ingrown hairs but also for removing cactus needles which is why I bought this.  </li>
            <li> It looks to me like the needle points are more pronounced on that one, and that may be a pro or con for some people.</li>
            <li> They come in a plastic vial for storage, with a rubber cover for the tip to keep the blades safe, and a lifetime guarantee to send them in for resharpening.</li>
            <li> Okay product for when needed.</li>
            <li> Although they are top-notch quality, I really only needed the set.  </li>
            <li> Ever since I spotted a pair of these in my Dermatologist&#x27;s Office I&#x27;ve been wanting to get my hands on them:)</li>
            <li> Love these and will buy nothing but tweezerman tweezer products.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off with the Tweezerman GEAR ingrown tweezers.</li>
            <li> Mine were made in Germany, so I think the quality was a bit better.</li>
            <li> LOVE TWEEZERMAN PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> You need to make sure to keep the cap on the tip of the tweezers so that you don&#x27;t hurt yourself or damage the tip in case the tweezers fall, etc.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if Amazon had these but did the search and found the identical tweezers I wanted and ordered two pair.</li>
            <li> Even though they say Tweezerman, I doubt they are authentic.</li>
            <li> Very fine, but almost too fine.  </li>
            <li> You can be very accurate and get to the hair easily.</li>
            <li> but when it did arrive i was able to pluck the ingrown easily.</li>
            <li> most tweezer tasks, Tweezerman&#x27;s Slant Tip Tweezers will do just fine.</li>
            <li> but they seem fine for most of what I need them to do.  </li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned, and since I loose them easily, I have had a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was happy to replace an old pair of tweezers which I have had for twenty years.  </li>
            <li> The fit and finish are top quality and</li>
            <li> the tips are very sharp, but the inside wall also have a textured gripping surface, so this thing works perfect.</li>
            <li> not so good for those jobs that require the flat-ended tweezers, but terrific for the jobs that need more of a needle-tweez !</li>
            <li> The sharpness and gripping ability seem just about perfect to me: it easily breaks the surface of the skin to get to the hair and is able to form a firm and precise grip.</li>
            <li> This is excellent and verrry sharp.</li>
            <li> Well made, tips are sharp and align perfectly,  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are extremely sharp and excellent for getting out ingrowns or splinters.</li>
            <li> Well designed, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Theses with a strong</li>
            <li> And they are not just sharp, but the sides come together perfectly flush, making it easy to pick things with the barest of material available.</li>
            <li> I really liked these tweezers when I first got them</li>
            <li> Size is perfect, not too small and very comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The ends of the tweezers are very sharp, making them perfect for extracting ingrown hairs or splinters without scarring.  </li>
            <li> work perfectly fine</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t grasp the fine hairs as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> That said, the tips are extremely precisely aligned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;People keep mentioning the \\&quot;free sharpening\\</li>
            <li> Not the kind I was really looking.</li>
            <li> With tips so fine, I&#x27;m sure that accidentally dropping them tip first would bend them out of alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Okay, so who gets excited about a pair of tweezers, right?</li>
            <li> , keep it in the original package to protect the tip.  </li>
            <li> Well made, these are worth the price!</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve switched to wet shaving with a safety razor and hopefully won&#x27;t need this very often, but very happy with them anyway.)</li>
            <li> These are pretty good tweezers, but only 3 stars because they aren&#x27;t nearly as fine (the point is not as fine)</li>
            <li> I presume they would be good for ingrown hairs, but I will use them for tiny splinters.  </li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re better (sharper, easier to hold) than the stainless version reviewed here</li>
            <li> Please check out the Tweezerman site for full details.  </li>
            <li> After a good shave, I can actually reach into a pore and grab a problem hair.</li>
            <li> Tried and true.</li>
            <li> You could get the most minuscule splinter out with these, or hurt yourself accidentally with the very pointy tip.</li>
            <li> I love these so much.</li>
            <li> Much to my relief, the new one is just as good as the one I bought 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> I tried five more times, turning the tweezers over to be sure that one side did not grip better than the other, and it worked each time.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, these tweezers are in that too unusual category of products that do just what they are supposed to do--making them a real pleasure to own.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found a source for a new pair.</li>
            <li> It is great for digging out a stray eyebrow hair, but be careful as you may &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; too much!</li>
            <li> I think they where worth the $$$ I paid ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Totally worth the price.</li>
            <li> totally worth the money</li>
            <li> as my old pair of Tweezerman needle nose tweezers, which I bent repairing the washing machine (ok, it was an emergency and cheaper than a repair call</li>
            <li> Just the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not enough surface area to give a strong grip on anything but hairs and fine splinters.</li>
            <li> Works great on small splinters.</li>
            <li> There not bad better than most I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li> These tweezers are sharp and do a great job when they&#x27;re new.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to love these after my experiences with other tweezerman tweezers, but I think they are just okay.</li>
            <li> Much better than using the old straight pin method.</li>
            <li> A beginner may need a little practice at first because ends are like needles, but this gives a much better precision, so you don&#x27;t end-up plucking more than needed at one time.</li>
            <li> These work very well but pretty quickly needed sharpening.</li>
            <li> Good for other people who can use them - I really wanted these to work.</li>
            <li> It may not be the best for the stray hair that is far down under your eyebrow as those strays are a bit fine and may be harder to grip without pinching the skin.</li>
            <li> My husband works with metal and being able to get the shavings out of his hands is essential.</li>
            <li> The ends don&#x27;t touch perfectly, making it difficult to grap the hair without causing damage to the skin around it.  </li>
            <li> My first Tweezerman lasted for 20 years.  </li>
            <li> Every first aid kit, cosmetic bag, and bathroom should contain one of these.</li>
            <li> I always keep a pair handy in case I lose (which I have done) or damage (be careful not to drop as this can warp the tips from &#x27;meeting&#x27; and grabbing the hair) a set.</li>
            <li> I think these are okay, but I prefer a different pair.</li>
            <li> These are so sharp I was able to go into the entry wound and grab and pull out the splinter without ripping all the skin off!  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> But isn&#x27;t that what I&#x27;m paying for in the first place.</li>
            <li> I like these because they have a sharp point and are good for tiny fine hair or coarser brows, depending on your needs.</li>
            <li> My bent 10 year old tweezers grasp hair better than the new ones do.</li>
            <li> Either the tips didn&#x27;t meet perfectly or were too wide (not a true needle-tip) or they were flimzy.  </li>
            <li> While I can see that they may be helpful with ingrown hairs if you are ultra careful and okay with a little blood being drawn, but I can&#x27;t see how people successfully use these for splinters without causing a cut.</li>
            <li> in general, it is way better than the normal tweezers&lt;br</li>
            <li> For larger objects, you&#x27;ll want the slant tip style, which contacts across a much wider tip, therefore giving you a better grip.</li>
            <li> exactly as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> I thought twice about spending so much for a pair of tweezers, but I decided to go for it after so many years of blunt tweezers that couldn&#x27;t easily get small splinters.  </li>
            <li> Theyre very sharp and effective.  </li>
            <li> A CERTAIN WAY TO TWEEZE</li>
            <li> Also be aware that there are multiple hairs growing out of each plug, so you have to grip them all for complete removal :)</li>
            <li> They are needle sharp, have perfectly alligned points, and can reach anything small.  </li>
            <li> Not the kind of tweezer that gets those little hairs in your magnifying mirror</li>
            <li> Be very careful because they have a very fine point.</li>
            <li> Great tweezers and very sharp when first purchased but they dull very quickly...</li>
            <li> If you cant decide, i highly recommend to get these first to try.</li>
            <li> ingrown hairs are a huge problem for me and these tweezers are the only thing that helps.</li>
            <li> and I have used it much.</li>
            <li> shipment delivery was fast (about 1 week - 10 days) to Sweden, which is away faster than the ones on ebay</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think I could ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are very well made tweezers.  </li>
            <li> They are fairly solid and are precisely machined.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really imagine better-made pointy tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those seeking the absolutely pointiest tweezers may want to consider:  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get to use it much.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used them much yet.</li>
            <li> Points don&#x27;t really line up very well</li>
            <li> I needed something much thinner.</li>
            <li> : stainless steel&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Made very durable and with quality&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Don&#x27;t really have any.</li>
            <li> They really work</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the new model very much</li>
            <li> Had to order a new one because I lost my first one.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, excellent to remove those nasty embedded splinters.  </li>
            <li> try, but I&#x27;m still going to try other brands to find a better one.</li>
            <li> I am currently using my original pair and just bend them from time to time.</li>
            <li> I was expecting more precision based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> but you should use a more sharply pointed tweezer for removing splinters.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very precise, and are able easily to get the smallest, thinnest little hairs that I could not have even dreamed to remove with the generic previous tweeter</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers and especially for those stubborn hard to get in-grown hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re very similar, the new model is a tad heavier than the old (more metal) but the tip is about 85% as sharp/fine/pointy as the old.  </li>
            <li> Much better than typical tweezers.</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but product is worth it, I was finally able to get ingrown brow hairs without having to wait to be able to pull with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for both men and women.</li>
            <li> I bought a set for my bathroom and second for my first aid kit!</li>
            <li> Good pair of tweezers and very useful for splinters but a little too sharp to use, definitely be cautious when using them.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting that little tiny sliver that is deep in there and just won&#x27;t come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so i needed a tweezers that would get those fine hairs that i could see but couldnt pluck with other tweezers.</li>
            <li> Those did not tweeze fine hairs, only coarse ones.</li>
            <li> Also they arrived brand new with misaligned heads.</li>
            <li> When you drop them (and you will) you will have to buy a new pair.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it, so when the tip got bent, I ordered a new one.  </li>
            <li> Super sharp and Tweezerman products come with a very generous warranty for repair or resharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the way, I&#x27;ve seen this exact model for sale locally at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, if you&#x27;d like to take a look in person.</li>
            <li> The first pair I sent back to readjust  the alignment to no avail after having had to insure package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparing the two tweezers (old &amp; new)</li>
            <li> The 20 year old is still sharper than the new ones.</li>
            <li> Item okay, but not adequate for removing ingrown chin or upper lip hair.</li>
            <li> However, my fiancee (who I bought them for) has trouble getting a hold of the hairs because the point is so fine.  </li>
            <li> Great for woodworkers, just had a deep splinter &amp; tweezers have a small sharp point that took out  immediately.</li>
            <li> I frequently get ingrown hairs on my neck from shaving every day.  </li>
            <li> These offer no advantage as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> The tweezers I received Spring 2014 say \\&quot;Tweezerman\\&quot; on the outside of the tweezers, \\&quot;Stainless India\\&quot; on the inside.  </li>
            <li> &quot; service Tweezerman offers.  </li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much thanks to my using these tweezers regularly.</li>
            <li> These are made in India; my old Tweezerman&#x27;s were made in Europe.</li>
            <li> I used to order these directly from manufacturer and when I went to their site, they were out.</li>
            <li> The two times so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because I have always used a slant tweeter I could not decide and bought both these and the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant Tweeter at the same time.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re blunt at the tips, which is probably a good thing to prevent yourself from accidentally stabbing your skin, but they&#x27;re too blunt to be very helpful for ingrown</li>
            <li> I think they are expensive at $11.50, but since they are so good, I now I have to purchase another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can just go straight in and in one or two attempts I can pull it right out, with no other tools and far less damage to the skin than the old way.</li>
            <li> Still vastly better than any drugstore tweezers, and they will last for years as long as you&#x27;re careful not to drop them and keep the plastic tip cover on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Every household needs a pair of these tweezers, you never know when you&#x27;ll need them to tweeze out something small or fine.</li>
            <li> High quality, you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> These are my second pair of Tweezerman Tweezers and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> if you are wanting something that can dig the ingrown hair out this wouldn&#x27;t be the right product for you, the so called point isn&#x27;t really a point it&#x27;s squared off and just doesn&#x27;t grasp the small hair.</li>
            <li> I get very bad ingrown hairs in my pubic area from waxing, and this is the best (by far) tweezer</li>
            <li> The tips were not sharp at all &amp; didn&#x27;t come to a point, &amp; they bent almost immediately.</li>
            <li> Works well for the intended splinters, but I primarily use it for getting &amp;#34;seed ticks&amp;#34; that are too small for regular tweezers and tick removal devices.</li>
            <li> I got a complete set of sharps from eBay for only $5 which are a match in quality and sharpness.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I don&#x27;t know how to use them properly, and they&#x27;re really handy for other uses, but not really good for my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> For ingrown hairs, the tips are not sharp enough to remove hair below skin where ingrown hairs lay.</li>
            <li> If you are really struggling with ingrown hairs give these a try, but be very careful so that you aren&#x27;t left with a scab.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re VERY sharp, VERY pointed .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t use them the right way because I used them for tweezing all eyebrow hairs, not just ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> High quality product that works extremely well for tweezing ingrown hairs and pulling out splinters.</li>
            <li> previous same-model Tweezerman said, \\&quot;Tweezerman Stainless Italy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The tips aren&#x27;t as sharp and don&#x27;t grab splinters as well as the old ones did.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s a little more delicate, buy these with confidence!</li>
            <li> This does not last too long ...</li>
            <li> A little more costly but, alas</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a few new ones and will eventually send in a handful to be sharpened.  </li>
            <li> The wide finger base is great for grip.  </li>
            <li> These are difficult to use and make it easy to stab yourself.</li>
            <li> pair of really sharp tweezers really do the trick grabbing onto those little hairs that penetrate the skin.</li>
            <li> Well, as I was measuring the tweezers for this review, I noticed a hair that measured about a millimeter long lying flat on the piece of paper in front of me.</li>
            <li> This tool is of the highest quality, and I think we even used these exact tweezers in a laboratory I worked in for dealing with very small fibers.</li>
            <li> My wife being a Cosmetologist, I never thought a person could actually get human hair embedded in their hands, feat or other areas.</li>
            <li> Although I believe that because they are so thin, they are sharp and precise - so would not want to change this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These have exactly the sharp point that one needs to get those pesky little hairs that seem so elusive with other tweezers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened to the Yellow model but others are completely abusing the price of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are not what I expected, especially from Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> Just be aware that they are not great for normal everyday tweezing</li>
            <li> Their tips are definitely pointy, but not as sharp as a needle.</li>
            <li> These are acceptable tweezers, but the ends don&#x27;t quite line up and one tip is larger than the other.</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from some in-grown beard hairs for the last couple of years (not realizing it was due to using a cartridge razor with eleventy blades in it)</li>
            <li> I finally bought a pair of these after years of trying to get ingrown hairs out the old-fashioned way, with a needle and conventional tweezers.</li>
            <li> only negative is that I now alternate between the yellow model and this one.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed in the quality of the tweezer after a time.</li>
            <li> Because of the sharp point, you have to be very careful about getting too close to the skin to avoid damaging (and possibly scarring)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Purchased and it does come with a little tiny cover for the points, so I&#x27;ve been keeping in the plastic box.</li>
            <li> I bought these to replace my 20 year old tweezerman because I thought they were getting dull.</li>
            <li> Huge disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not lowering my review, but I just had to say how great they are and how very disappointed I am because I DROPPED them and now the point on one side is damaged and they won&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> Not much else to add.....</li>
            <li> Be careful because the end, if not protected, gets bent and then does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t do heavy construction with this thing, I simply dropped it in the sink, about 1.5 foot drop, something everyone with tweezers accidentally does at some point.</li>
            <li> these are way better than the silly eyebrow tweezers i been forced to use all my life.</li>
            <li> The tip is not that sharp, and certainly not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This is not a good situation to be in when you&#x27;re attempting to pull a tiny glass-shard out of your foot as was the case with me recently.  </li>
            <li> You must also be extremely careful with them due to the ultra sharp point.</li>
            <li> This item is not as pointy and sharp as one would think.</li>
            <li> (Incidentally, Tweezerman&#x27;s slant tip tweezers also have relatively sharp tips on them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sharp and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mention it was sharp?</li>
            <li> Still searching for the SHARP POINTED tweezers.</li>
            <li> I would definitely not give them to small children because I could imagine accidents.</li>
            <li> They are really sharp.</li>
            <li> BUT they are not as pointy/sharp as the other model.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Like all sharp implements, you should protect the pointed ends (with the included cover) when not using in order to preserve sharpness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve concluded that all other tweezers just don&#x27;t have the quality and performance that this brand does.</li>
            <li> The points are sharp and they will get to what is under your skin.</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t grab as well as other tweezers I have</li>
            <li> Stay sharp for about a year.</li>
            <li> The texture is such that you have very firm control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have removed quite few metal splinters from my hands and feet that were too small to see and could only be felt.</li>
            <li> Recently had an opportunity to use these to get out a long, thin wood splinter.  </li>
            <li> Tweezerman is not the perfection (i gave it 8 out of 10)&lt;br /&gt;The problem with Tweezerman that whenever you start using it, you will get addicted to use it in such a way you destroy your facial looking</li>
            <li> I dropped one and the little sharp points on the tip bent, so I had to buy another.</li>
            <li> The tips are just as sharp as they look so you do want to keep the little rubber tube over them when not in use to avoid accidental sticks.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a pair of tweezermans that I wanted to replace because the tip got bent.</li>
            <li> I would ballpark them at around half a millimeter.</li>
            <li> The metal is thinner than previous Tweezerman tweezers I have owned.</li>
            <li> For serious tweeting only.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d still consider buying a new one for the price, but still, the fragility is disturbing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the shipment fees is really expensive relative to other couriers on other websites, like ebay</li>
            <li> I encourage the company to provide a little plastic protector case or something.</li>
            <li> Little things matter</li>
            <li> Contacted them and it was going to be a little while</li>
            <li> Hair trimmings can be like little needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;The points are uneven &amp; don&#x27;t meet or come to a point&lt;br /&gt;Obviously</li>
            <li> I dont have any trouble with them though.  </li>
            <li> Actually cuts the hair before you pull it out a lot making an ingrown hair worse.</li>
            <li> They are no sharper than others I have, hence, the price you pay is not justified.</li>
            <li> VERY SHARP!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hair , much less a splinter !</li>
            <li> Only thing is you cannot have a shaky hand or you will pull out skin instead of the hair you may be trying to get a grip on!</li>
            <li> If used for ingrown hairs, hardly even leave a scar if you are very careful, and no need to use a needle anymore&lt;</li>
            <li> /&gt;It won&#x27;t work well for larger things, because the jaws are, by necessity, very narrow and therefore can&#x27;t grip very hard.  </li>
            <li> But would like to mention that the ends are very thin and sharp, and occasionally when you try to grab a hair - it brakes it.</li>
            <li> They are not as thin or sharp as my previous pair.</li>
            <li> There is nothing too small to grab with these.</li>
            <li> Depending on how hard you squeeze them together, the contact area measures anywhere from hard-to-see-with-the-naked-eye to about a millimeter.</li>
            <li> HARD TO USE, HAVE TO PLACE IT</li>
            <li> The tip is too blunt for that, at least for me anyway.</li>
            <li> I will say that the tips at least come together.</li>
            <li> This is a failure for them.</li>
            <li> in mind that these are probably not a good &#x27;all purpose&#x27; tweezer.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased several so-called needle-tipped tweezers; always to come away disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Could have spared myself a lot of carving out splinters with a knife because regular tweezers were crap.</li>
            <li> that were really frustrating to deal with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; tweezers.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing compared my previous (now lost) Tweezerman tweezers.</li>
            <li> Not pointed enough to get out splinters and terrible for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Thats why I gave them a 4 star instead of 5 because they may be difficult to use for some.</li>
            <li> We had a lousy set of tweezers and gave up with them</li>
            <li> Useless.</li>
            <li> Just another sad example of outsourcing work and quality suffering.</li>
            <li> Very poor, Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm to remove a very difficult to remove splinter under my wife&#x27;s fingernail.</li>
            <li> so it is very difficult to grab a splinter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an awful thing to take a pin to your skin, but the ingrown&#x60;s are tough to remove.</li>
            <li> Perhaps I got a bad pair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed in these.  </li>
            <li> but it sometimes breaks the hair you are trying to tweeze, which is annoying.</li>
            <li> BUT THESE ARE THE WORST I EVER USED!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Highly recommend, you wont be disappointed !!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent not only for ingrown hairs but also for removing cactus needles which is why I bought this.  Never hike in cactus country without tweezers just like this!</li>
            <li> It has been a great item and I have used it much.</li>
            <li> Tweezerman is not the perfection (i gave it 8 out of 10)&lt;br /&gt;The problem with Tweezerman that whenever you start using it, you will get addicted to use it in such a way you destroy your facial looking somehow&lt;br /&gt;but in general, it is way better than the normal tweezers&lt;br /&gt;The shipment delivery was fast (about 1 week - 10 days) to Sweden, which is away faster than the ones on ebay&lt;br /&gt;the shipment fees is really expensive relative to other couriers on other websites, like ebay</li>
            <li> I finally bought a pair of these after years of trying to get ingrown hairs out the old-fashioned way, with a needle and conventional tweezers. These things are perfect. I can just go straight in and in one or two attempts I can pull it right out, with no other tools and far less damage to the skin than the old way. The sharpness and gripping ability seem just about perfect to me: it easily breaks the surface of the skin to get to the hair and is able to form a firm and precise grip. I really don&#x27;t think I could ask for more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that Tweezerman carries what appears to be a newer model. I have no idea how it performs in comparison. It looks to me like the needle points are more pronounced on that one, and that may be a pro or con for some people. All I can say is that this model works perfectly for me and I&#x27;ve already recommended them to family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;ve seen this exact model for sale locally at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply, if you&#x27;d like to take a look in person. They come in a plastic vial for storage, with a rubber cover for the tip to keep the blades safe, and a lifetime guarantee to send them in for resharpening.</li>
            <li> I previously owned a pair of tweezermans that I wanted to replace because the tip got bent. These don&#x27;t come close to comparing. The tips aren&#x27;t as sharp and don&#x27;t grab splinters as well as the old ones did. My husband works with metal and being able to get the shavings out of his hands is essential.</li>
            <li> This item is not as pointy and sharp as one would think. Actually the heads were kinda blunt. Also they arrived brand new with misaligned heads. Huge disappointment. Returned for refund.</li>
            <li> Okay product for when needed.</li>
            <li> I need needle point tweezers and that&#x27;s what I tought I was getting.  These are not what I expected, especially from Tweezerman.  I&#x27;m disappointed in these.</li>
            <li> Not pointed enough to get out splinters and terrible for eyebrows.  I have several Tweezerman products that are sharper than these. This is a failure for them.</li>
            <li> After purchasing a pair of Tweezerman slant tweezers and finding them excellent, I decided to buy this pair of &amp;#34;needle point&amp;#34; tweezers to deal with fine wood or metal splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Their overall length is 4 and 5/16 inches. Their tips are definitely pointy, but not as sharp as a needle. I would ballpark them at around half a millimeter. So, for deeply buried splinters or hairs, you may still need to use a needle. That said, the tips are extremely precisely aligned. How good are they? Well, as I was measuring the tweezers for this review, I noticed a hair that measured about a millimeter long lying flat on the piece of paper in front of me. I tried picking it up with the tweezers, and had no problem. I tried five more times, turning the tweezers over to be sure that one side did not grip better than the other, and it worked each time. Now that&#x27;s a good tweezer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind that these are probably not a good &#x27;all purpose&#x27; tweezer. Depending on how hard you squeeze them together, the contact area measures anywhere from hard-to-see-with-the-naked-eye to about a millimeter. That&#x27;s not enough surface area to give a strong grip on anything but hairs and fine splinters. For larger objects, you&#x27;ll want the slant tip style, which contacts across a much wider tip, therefore giving you a better grip. (Incidentally, Tweezerman&#x27;s slant tip tweezers also have relatively sharp tips on them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These come with a rubber tip protector. It&#x27;s a good idea to keep them in this when you&#x27;re not using them. With tips so fine, I&#x27;m sure that accidentally dropping them tip first would bend them out of alignment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For most tweezer tasks, Tweezerman&#x27;s Slant Tip Tweezers will do just fine. But if you have some work to do that&#x27;s a little more delicate, buy these with confidence!</li>
            <li> High quality product that works extremely well for tweezing ingrown hairs and pulling out splinters.</li>
            <li> I frequently get ingrown hairs on my neck from shaving every day.  These do a great job of digging them out.  High quality, you definitely get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, excellent service... as always!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hair , much less a splinter !&lt;br /&gt;The points are uneven &amp; don&#x27;t meet or come to a point&lt;br /&gt;Obviously no quality control from manufacturer</li>
            <li> I was happy to replace an old pair of tweezers which I have had for twenty years.  I am so glad I found a source for a new pair.</li>
            <li> Used to remove a very tiny, stubborn splinter.  Worked great!!!  Not much else to add.....excellent shipping!!!</li>
            <li> Points don&#x27;t even meet.  Very poor, Tweezerman.</li>
            <li> Well designed, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting that little tiny sliver that is deep in there and just won&#x27;t come out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t work well for larger things, because the jaws are, by necessity, very narrow and therefore can&#x27;t grip very hard.  So, you&#x27;ll want a regular tweezer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, keep it in the original package to protect the tip.  I dropped one and the little sharp points on the tip bent, so I had to buy another.</li>
            <li> HARD TO USE, HAVE TO PLACE IT A CERTAIN WAY TO TWEEZE</li>
            <li> These are very well made tweezers.  They are fairly solid and are precisely machined.  If they were just a bit thicker they would be perfect in my book.</li>
            <li> These tweezers allow you to pluck the smallest of hairs. Great product!</li>
            <li> the tips are very sharp, but the inside wall also have a textured gripping surface, so this thing works perfect.</li>
            <li> There not bad better than most I&#x27;ve had in the past I think they where worth the $$$ I paid ...</li>
            <li> I find this item as an excellent product. I use it for stuburn ingrown hair and splinters. Also as a tweezer it is great on fine hair.</li>
            <li> This tool is of the highest quality, and I think we even used these exact tweezers in a laboratory I worked in for dealing with very small fibers. I can&#x27;t really imagine better-made pointy tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaving gives me ingrown hairs, though, and I can&#x27;t say these tweezers have ever helped. Perhaps I don&#x27;t know how to use them properly, and they&#x27;re really handy for other uses, but not really good for my ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> Excellent for splinter removal. Wonderfully crafted, and the guarantee is an added plus.</li>
            <li> Sharp and does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention it was sharp? Needle points.</li>
            <li> These have exactly the sharp point that one needs to get those pesky little hairs that seem so elusive with other tweezers.</li>
            <li> I wish this came a day sooner to help get an ingrown out but when it did arrive i was able to pluck the ingrown easily. Much better than typical tweezers. I get a lot of ingrowns so i needed a tweezers that would get those fine hairs that i could see but couldnt pluck with other tweezers. These do the job great. Be very careful because they have a very fine point. I did notice they sell these at Bed Bath Beyond(use your 20% coupon).</li>
            <li> Nicely aligned ,feels good in your hand. Will pull out any hair that has emerged and above skin surface. For ingrown hairs, the tips are not sharp enough to remove hair below skin where ingrown hairs lay. Still need a sharper tool, like a pin to dig it out. It&#x27;s an awful thing to take a pin to your skin, but the ingrown&#x60;s are tough to remove. Still searching for the SHARP POINTED tweezers.</li>
            <li> These are great for splinters and ingrown hairs.  However, my fiancee (who I bought them for) has trouble getting a hold of the hairs because the point is so fine.  I dont have any trouble with them though.  Thats why I gave them a 4 star instead of 5 because they may be difficult to use for some.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve purchased several so-called needle-tipped tweezers; always to come away disappointed.  Either the tips didn&#x27;t meet perfectly or were too wide (not a true needle-tip) or they were flimzy.  This is not a good situation to be in when you&#x27;re attempting to pull a tiny glass-shard out of your foot as was the case with me recently.  The shard was so tiny my wife couldn&#x27;t even see it but I sure could feel it!  We had a lousy set of tweezers and gave up with them she had to come up with a \\&quot;plan B\\&quot;.  THIS pair, however, is perfectly aligned, needle-tipped and strong.  I definitely recommend this model/brand tweezer and will be revisiting Tweezerman for our future Tweezing needs as well.  A little more costly but, alas, sometimes you need to \\&quot;get what you pay for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This is excellent and verrry sharp. It is great for digging out a stray eyebrow hair, but be careful as you may &amp;#34;dig&amp;#34; too much! It may not be the best for the stray hair that is far down under your eyebrow as those strays are a bit fine and may be harder to grip without pinching the skin. But, this is by far the best tweezerI have found and it hasn&#x27;t lost it&#x27;s point or grip either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: BEST TWEEZERS EVER! I&#x27;m not lowering my review, but I just had to say how great they are and how very disappointed I am because I DROPPED them and now the point on one side is damaged and they won&#x27;t work! I encourage the company to provide a little plastic protector case or something. I think they are expensive at $11.50, but since they are so good, I now I have to purchase another one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased and it does come with a little tiny cover for the points, so I&#x27;ve been keeping in the plastic box. But, they are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: OMG! They&#x27;ve gone up in price to close to $14!!!!!</li>
            <li> Got these to add versatility to my Tweezerman Mini Slant/Point set.  Although they are top-notch quality, I really only needed the set.  These offer no advantage as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> The best tweezer out there.  I received them faster than I anticipated too.</li>
            <li> Good pair of tweezers and very useful for splinters but a little too sharp to use, definitely be cautious when using them.</li>
            <li> These high-quality tweezers are perfect for removing those pesky in-grown hairs. Super sharp and Tweezerman products come with a very generous warranty for repair or resharpening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally worth the price. Trust me, once you purchase these, you&#x27;ll never buy cheapo tweezers again.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for! Ever since I spotted a pair of these in my Dermatologist&#x27;s Office I&#x27;ve been wanting to get my hands on them:) They&#x27;re just perfect!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers.  Well made, tips are sharp and align perfectly,  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I thought twice about spending so much for a pair of tweezers, but I decided to go for it after so many years of blunt tweezers that couldn&#x27;t easily get small splinters.  To my delight, these tweezers were just what I have always wanted.  They are needle sharp, have perfectly alligned points, and can reach anything small.  I presume they would be good for ingrown hairs, but I will use them for tiny splinters.  One warning:  I would definitely not give them to small children because I could imagine accidents. Otherwise, these tweezers are in that too unusual category of products that do just what they are supposed to do--making them a real pleasure to own.</li>
            <li> I get very bad ingrown hairs in my pubic area from waxing, and this is the best (by far) tweezer I have come across to help me get them out.</li>
            <li> These work excellent for those pesky ingrown hairs.  They are really sharp. Love these and will buy nothing but tweezerman tweezer products.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm to remove a very difficult to remove splinter under my wife&#x27;s fingernail.</li>
            <li> This was my third pair of ingrown hair tweezers, and it pales in comparison to others I&#x27;ve tried. The ends don&#x27;t touch perfectly, making it difficult to grap the hair without causing damage to the skin around it.  You&#x27;re better off with the Tweezerman GEAR ingrown tweezers.</li>
            <li> This is a very handy tool to have. I&#x27;ve removed ingrown hairs and splinters. Had to order a new one because I lost my first one.</li>
            <li> These are great quality tweezers that come to a needle point. The fit and finish are top quality and the tweezer tips perfectly align unlike poorer quality version out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have removed quite few metal splinters from my hands and feet that were too small to see and could only be felt. The needle points were great for finding and grasping the splinters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These have been left in water accidentally a couple times and there have been no rust spots. The texture is such that you have very firm control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use I put a daub of hand sanitizer on the tips and leave them that way. There has been no impact to the finish or rust to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will likely buy a second pair so my wife stops taking them out of my medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> The tweezers I received Spring 2014 say \\&quot;Tweezerman\\&quot; on the outside of the tweezers, \\&quot;Stainless India\\&quot; on the inside.  The box says, \\&quot;Made in India by Tweezerman India.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous same-model Tweezerman said, \\&quot;Tweezerman Stainless Italy.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the two tweezers (old &amp; new) I&#x27;d say they&#x27;re very similar, the new model is a tad heavier than the old (more metal) but the tip is about 85% as sharp/fine/pointy as the old.  Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use the new model very much but they seem fine for most of what I need them to do.  Still vastly better than any drugstore tweezers, and they will last for years as long as you&#x27;re careful not to drop them and keep the plastic tip cover on them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those seeking the absolutely pointiest tweezers may want to consider:  [[ASIN:B00HDFZNN4 Tweezerman G.E.A.R. Ingrown Hair SplinterTweeze]].  I own a pair of those too and they&#x27;re better (sharper, easier to hold) than the stainless version reviewed here but the prices have jumped -- I paid twelve dollars for mine last year on Amazon and now they&#x27;re twenty dollars?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People keep mentioning the \\&quot;free sharpening\\&quot; service Tweezerman offers.  Yes, *SHARPENING*.  Their guarantee specifically does not include fixing, grinding or aligining the tips after you drop them.  Please check out the Tweezerman site for full details.  When you drop them (and you will) you will have to buy a new pair.  At best Tweezerman will send you a coupon for 1/2 off a new pair bought off their site (it&#x27;s still cheaper to buy on Amazon).</li>
            <li> I requested yellow but got silver... I whould have just bought it at CVS or any pharmacy store. Little things matter</li>
            <li> I have tweezerman tweezers, that&#x27;s why I chose these!  Mine were made in Germany, so I think the quality was a bit better.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for ingrown hair and splinters!  I bought a set for my bathroom and second for my first aid kit!</li>
            <li> Actually cuts the hair before you pull it out a lot making an ingrown hair worse. Buy the revlons at walmart.</li>
            <li> These are acceptable tweezers, but the ends don&#x27;t quite line up and one tip is larger than the other. They&#x27;re blunt at the tips, which is probably a good thing to prevent yourself from accidentally stabbing your skin, but they&#x27;re too blunt to be very helpful for ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good try, but I&#x27;m still going to try other brands to find a better one.</li>
            <li> Always great quality with Tweezerman</li>
            <li> DANGEREOUS IF YOU DON&#x27;T KNOW HOW TO USE THESE TWEEZERS! MESSED MY LEGS ALL UP! HAD TO BE TREATED AT A DERMATOLOGIST &amp; MEDICATION. STILL HAVE SCARS. VERY SHARP! LOVE TWEEZERMAN PRODUCTS BUT THESE ARE THE WORST I EVER USED!</li>
            <li> Great tweezers and very sharp when first purchased but they dull very quickly...great for the price though !!!</li>
            <li> A bit expensive, but product is worth it, I was finally able to get ingrown brow hairs without having to wait to be able to pull with regular tweezers.</li>
            <li> Tweezers are extremely sharp and excellent for getting out ingrowns or splinters. You need to make sure to keep the cap on the tip of the tweezers so that you don&#x27;t hurt yourself or damage the tip in case the tweezers fall, etc. Every household needs a pair of these tweezers, you never know when you&#x27;ll need them to tweeze out something small or fine.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect addition to my shaving regimine. After a good shave, I can actually reach into a pore and grab a problem hair. My skin has improved so much thanks to my using these tweezers regularly.</li>
            <li> Best, most precise tweezers I&#x27;ve seen.  Could have spared myself a lot of carving out splinters with a knife because regular tweezers were crap.</li>
            <li> My first Tweezerman lasted for 20 years.  I can&#x27;t live without it, so when the tip got bent, I ordered a new one.  Much to my relief, the new one is just as good as the one I bought 20 years ago.</li>
            <li> Good quality material.  Works well for the intended splinters, but I primarily use it for getting &amp;#34;seed ticks&amp;#34; that are too small for regular tweezers and tick removal devices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened to the Yellow model but others are completely abusing the price of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These work perfectly fine BUT they are not as pointy/sharp as the other model.&lt;br /&gt;I use these to get plucked as well as pulling ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative is that I now alternate between the yellow model and this one.</li>
            <li> works awesome on ingrown hairs.  totally worth the money</li>
            <li> I remain unimpressed with these  tweezers. They are no sharper than others I have, hence, the price you pay is not justified. I got a complete set of sharps from eBay for only $5 which are a match in quality and sharpness.</li>
            <li> Kind of disappointed in the quality of the tweezer after a time. Doesn&#x27;t grasp the fine hairs as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> There is nothing too small to grab with these. And they are not just sharp, but the sides come together perfectly flush, making it easy to pick things with the barest of material available.</li>
            <li> Not the kind of tweezer that gets those little hairs in your magnifying mirror&lt;br /&gt;as one reviewer stated.  The tip is too blunt for that, at least for me anyway.</li>
            <li> Great Tweezers!  Tweezerman never disappoints!  Awesome getting small/ingrown hairs out.</li>
            <li> The go to for facial hairs</li>
            <li> Great for getting ingrown hairs out!</li>
            <li> I have an area on the left side of my chin that is prone to ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve been using these Tweezerman tweezers for years and I swear by them.  Theyre very sharp and effective.  Additionally, Tweezerman will sharpen your tools for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a few new ones and will eventually send in a handful to be sharpened.  In the meantime, I can&#x27;t imagine being without my tweezers for ingrown hairs.  I&#x27;ve used others and nothing stacks up to these.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t get to use it much. point is not so pointy</li>
            <li> I bought these tweezers to replace a lost set of Tweezerman tweezers that I had purchased at Ulta. What a disappointment! The tips were not sharp at all &amp; didn&#x27;t come to a point, &amp; they bent almost immediately. Useless. Perhaps I got a bad pair. However I would recommend the \\&quot;tweezerman point tweezers\\&quot; over these anyday.</li>
            <li> Works great on small splinters.</li>
            <li> Every first aid kit, cosmetic bag, and bathroom should contain one of these. GET ONE TODAY!!!!!</li>
            <li> This product works exactly as advertised, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.  The ends of the tweezers are very sharp, making them perfect for extracting ingrown hairs or splinters without scarring.  Like all sharp implements, you should protect the pointed ends (with the included cover) when not using in order to preserve sharpness.</li>
            <li> So happy with these tweezers!</li>
            <li> These tweezers work great.  You can be very accurate and get to the hair easily.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers out there but it sometimes breaks the hair you are trying to tweeze, which is annoying. Be careful because the end, if not protected, gets bent and then does not work at all.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well.  Happy with the product, and the price I paid for it.  Told several friends about this.</li>
            <li> Great Service and item!</li>
            <li> The metal is thinner than previous Tweezerman tweezers I have owned. I bought a slanted style of Tweezerman in the same purchase. Those did not tweeze fine hairs, only coarse ones. Very disappointing compared my previous (now lost) Tweezerman tweezers. I returned these without opening. These are made in India; my old Tweezerman&#x27;s were made in Europe.</li>
            <li> Okay, so who gets excited about a pair of tweezers, right? I do. These are the only tweezers I use. After looking, buying, and using crummy tweezers for years, I finally found these and they are just what I needed. I&#x27;ve concluded that all other tweezers just don&#x27;t have the quality and performance that this brand does. I won&#x27;t buy anything else. I used to order these directly from manufacturer and when I went to their site, they were out. Contacted them and it was going to be a little while before they were back in stock. I wasn&#x27;t sure if Amazon had these but did the search and found the identical tweezers I wanted and ordered two pair. I like these because they have a sharp point and are good for tiny fine hair or coarser brows, depending on your needs. There is a learning curve with them though. Because of the sharp point, you have to be very careful about getting too close to the skin to avoid damaging (and possibly scarring) your skin from continued and prolonged use. I&#x27;ve used these tweezers for years and would be lost without them. I always keep a pair handy in case I lose (which I have done) or damage (be careful not to drop as this can warp the tips from &#x27;meeting&#x27; and grabbing the hair) a set. Great buy and they work!</li>
            <li> This is my third pair that I bough. The first pair I sent back to readjust  the alignment to no avail after having had to insure package. They were wonderful for many years. So I bought a second pair and they do not grip the hair on my chin, not aligned correctly. So I bought a third pair and the same thing is happening. I am currently using my original pair and just bend them from time to time. They just don&#x27;t seem to be aligned correctly. I am stumped as what to do?</li>
            <li> Tried and true. Excellent</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great!  They are excellent for precision detail work like getting out ingrown hairs and splinters.  The wide finger base is great for grip.  These are my second pair of Tweezerman Tweezers and I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for a pair that I have owned for about 10 years. They are not as thin or sharp as my previous pair. My bent 10 year old tweezers grasp hair better than the new ones do. Even though they say Tweezerman, I doubt they are authentic.</li>
            <li> Ever get a splinter that is buried in your skin so you have to dig at it with sewing needle before tweezing it out? Not with these tweezers. They are the needle and tweezers in one (sterilize these with rubbing alcohol when using this way). The points are sharp and they will get to what is under your skin. Use them from the side to pull object out. Great value!</li>
            <li> I think these are okay, but I prefer a different pair. These don&#x27;t grab as well as other tweezers I have so I probably wont reorder these.</li>
            <li> I use these in the shop to remove wood and metal splinters. Just the right tool for the job.</li>
            <li> Very fine, but almost too fine.  Haven&#x27;t used them much yet.</li>
            <li> I happened to run across these tweezers when looking for something else online. I quickly realized these would meet a purpose at home - besides ingrown hairs, they&#x27;re excellent for pulling splinters and, a problem for me, nails that splinter on my hands and feet. Besides a regular pair of blunt edge tweezers, every home should have a pair of these around for those problems that the blunt edge tweezers just can&#x27;t handle. The tips are just as sharp as they look so you do want to keep the little rubber tube over them when not in use to avoid accidental sticks. Well made, these are worth the price!</li>
            <li> I really liked these tweezers when I first got them but after a while, they weren&#x27;t quite as effective.  I don&#x27;t know why but that was my experience.</li>
            <li> These are perfect for taking out slivers! It makes taking slivers out of kids&#x27; feet 100% easier, the grip is good, the pinch and precision is militaristic. Good quality and overall very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> These tweezers are sharp and do a great job when they&#x27;re new. Just don&#x27;t toss them in a drawer. The tips bent almost immediately, and they haven&#x27;t been the same since.</li>
            <li> These tweezers grip even tiny hairs, and are helpful with ingrown ones. Only thing is you cannot have a shaky hand or you will pull out skin instead of the hair you may be trying to get a grip on! Also be aware that there are multiple hairs growing out of each plug, so you have to grip them all for complete removal :)</li>
            <li> I was slightly disappointed in these.  I thought they would work as well as my last ones, but not.  These do not get the finer hairs that my others would get.  I guess I have to keep looking.</li>
            <li> These tweezers are great for getting out any ingrown hairs. I am sure they will also be great for splinters.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re VERY sharp, VERY pointed . . . not so good for those jobs that require the flat-ended tweezers, but terrific for the jobs that need more of a needle-tweez !</li>
            <li> Recently had an opportunity to use these to get out a long, thin wood splinter.  These are so sharp I was able to go into the entry wound and grab and pull out the splinter without ripping all the skin off!  Much better than using the old straight pin method.</li>
            <li> Item okay, but not adequate for removing ingrown chin or upper lip hair. The handles cannot  provide the control to remove the hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t grasp a ingrown hair at all I have to dig out the ingrown hair with a needle then I can grab the hair with this product. if you are wanting something that can dig the ingrown hair out this wouldn&#x27;t be the right product for you, the so called point isn&#x27;t really a point it&#x27;s squared off and just doesn&#x27;t grasp the small hair.</li>
            <li> I had been suffering from some in-grown beard hairs for the last couple of years (not realizing it was due to using a cartridge razor with eleventy blades in it) that were really frustrating to deal with &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; tweezers. (I&#x27;ve switched to wet shaving with a safety razor and hopefully won&#x27;t need this very often, but very happy with them anyway.)</li>
            <li> awesome tweezers! exactly as described and fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, excellent to remove those nasty embedded splinters.  Works great.  I highly recommend this product for both men and women.</li>
            <li> PERFECT for removing splinters and fine pieces of glass. Love this product!</li>
            <li> You could get the most minuscule splinter out with these, or hurt yourself accidentally with the very pointy tip. I like a duller tip, but these are good quality nonetheless.</li>
            <li> Best tweezers ever!!!</li>
            <li> I love these so much. n&#x3D;best pair of tweezers I have ever owned. ingrown hairs are a huge problem for me and these tweezers are the only thing that helps.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to love these after my experiences with other tweezerman tweezers, but I think they are just okay. I have tried them for ingrown hairs but I haven&#x27;t been overly impressed. You must also be extremely careful with them due to the ultra sharp point. While I can see that they may be helpful with ingrown hairs if you are ultra careful and okay with a little blood being drawn, but I can&#x27;t see how people successfully use these for splinters without causing a cut. If you are really struggling with ingrown hairs give these a try, but be very careful so that you aren&#x27;t left with a scab.</li>
            <li> These are great tweezers and especially for those stubborn hard to get in-grown hairs. Just be aware that they are not great for normal everyday tweezing</li>
            <li> these are way better than the silly eyebrow tweezers i been forced to use all my life. now i can get splinters with ease!</li>
            <li> Good pair. I&#x27;m not a tweezer expert but they seem great for me! Skinny enough to get out splinters from my fence! Only gave it 4 stars for my lack of tweezers expertise. ;)</li>
            <li> This does not last too long ...</li>
            <li> Points don&#x27;t really line up very well so it is very difficult to grab a splinter.  I was expecting more precision based on other reviews.  The two times so far I needed to use I couldn&#x27;t get it to grip.</li>
            <li> these are amazing but if you are a digger be carful</li>
            <li> Not the kind I was really looking. I needed something much thinner. Although I was very happy with the shipment and I will still use them.</li>
            <li> My wife being a Cosmetologist, I never thought a person could actually get human hair embedded in their hands, feat or other areas. Hair trimmings can be like little needles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This pair of really sharp tweezers really do the trick grabbing onto those little hairs that penetrate the skin. Theses with a strong</li>
            <li> Great for woodworkers, just had a deep splinter &amp; tweezers have a small sharp point that took out  immediately. Where were these all my life. Every wood shop should have a pair .good buy for the price.Larry</li>
            <li> I loved this until just after my one month Amazon return period I dropped it in my sink and the tip bent, ruining the grip. I didn&#x27;t do heavy construction with this thing, I simply dropped it in the sink, about 1.5 foot drop, something everyone with tweezers accidentally does at some point. The tip bent, it was unusable, I bent it back and now it&#x27;s so-so. Great tool otherwise but it would have been nice to warn people that this is easily damaged. I&#x27;d still consider buying a new one for the price, but still, the fragility is disturbing.</li>
            <li> Can grab even the finest of hairs and pull them out with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there&#x27;s a healthy mix of reviews on here for these, but what I bought works perfect, has a superfine point, and grabs very well.</li>
            <li> These work very well but pretty quickly needed sharpening. I&#x27;m not sure if I didn&#x27;t use them the right way because I used them for tweezing all eyebrow hairs, not just ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> These are the best tweezers I have ever owned, and since I loose them easily, I have had a few.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Color: stainless steel&lt;br /&gt;Use: eyebrows, ingrown hairs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I have always used a slant tweeter I could not decide and bought both these and the Tweezerman Stainless Steel Slant Tweeter at the same time. If you cant decide, i highly recommend to get these first to try. A beginner may need a little practice at first because ends are like needles, but this gives a much better precision, so you don&#x27;t end-up plucking more than needed at one time. Since I started to use these I have not even had the need to use the slant tweeter, although I will keeping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Very precise, and are able easily to get the smallest, thinnest little hairs that I could not have even dreamed to remove with the generic previous tweeter I owned.&lt;br /&gt;- If used for ingrown hairs, hardly even leave a scar if you are very careful, and no need to use a needle anymore&lt;br /&gt;- Made very durable and with quality&lt;br /&gt;- Size is perfect, not too small and very comfortable to hold&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;- Don&#x27;t really have any. But would like to mention that the ends are very thin and sharp, and occasionally when you try to grab a hair - it brakes it. Although I believe that because they are so thin, they are sharp and precise - so would not want to change this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend, you wont be disappointed !!!</li>
            <li> Made well. Stay sharp for about a year. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Not as nice as when they were made in Italy, but they will serve.</li>
            <li> Breaks the hairs when you pluck!</li>
            <li> For serious tweeting only.  They really work</li>
            <li> I bought these for removing splinters.  The tip is not that sharp, and certainly not what I expected.  Good for tweezing brows or something like that, but you should use a more sharply pointed tweezer for removing splinters.</li>
            <li> I resort to a pin and my regular tweezers for ingrown hairs. These are difficult to use and make it easy to stab yourself. Good for other people who can use them - I really wanted these to work.</li>
            <li> very good, but grip could be better</li>
            <li> These are pretty good tweezers, but only 3 stars because they aren&#x27;t nearly as fine (the point is not as fine) as my old pair of Tweezerman needle nose tweezers, which I bent repairing the washing machine (ok, it was an emergency and cheaper than a repair call and I had no idea that Tweezerman didn&#x27;t make them the same anymore!).  I will be looking for a finer point.</li>
            <li> I gave it one star because they are tweezers. But I can go to the local craft store and get a pin for 5 cents and will be way sharper than these. I bought these to replace my 20 year old tweezerman because I thought they were getting dull. Guess what? The 20 year old is still sharper than the new ones. A German made product this is not. I will say that the tips at least come together. But isn&#x27;t that what I&#x27;m paying for in the first place. Just another sad example of outsourcing work and quality suffering.</li>
