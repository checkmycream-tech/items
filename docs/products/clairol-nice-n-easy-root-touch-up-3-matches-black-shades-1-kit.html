            <li>Just wish it had more in it, because I always have to use two bottles and my hair isn&#x27;t even sholder length.</li>
            <li>I go to what most would consider an \\&quot;upscale\\&quot; salon and this color works just fine with thier products.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that most the dye stay on my hair and little was in the rinse off.</li>
            <li>The application was easy, too.</li>
            <li>About as easy as they come.</li>
            <li>Does have a strong smell though but will use again.</li>
            <li>I immediately applied shampoo afterward and the color stays fine.</li>
            <li>The Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy does an amazing job of covering my grey roots, although I have to leave it on twenty minutes to get the full effect.</li>
            <li>This stuff is easy to use and quick.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty well pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Quick processing time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy and very satisfactory</li>
            <li>I use either the light brown or dark blonde and it always looks great!</li>
            <li>I wanted to cover those new grays that appear just over the ears - the ones that look so great on men and somehow add ten years as a woman!</li>
            <li>It is kind of a shame the tubes are so big -</li>
            <li>&quot; This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>A quick fix for roots in between coloring, works fast, and</li>
            <li>I did do the recommended allergy test first (testing the product on your arm for a couple of days).</li>
            <li>got three boxes at the same or better price</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>I leave on the full 12-15 minutes because my grays and whites can be stubborn (even the salon colorings didn&#x27;t mask them completely).</li>
            <li>It is easy and quick (10 min) to use it for root touch up, and the color matches well with the rest of my hair that was dyed using other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a hair-color expert, but I like this, and this is a good price compared to Target.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a brighter red than I expected from the name, but I&#x27;ll make do.  </li>
            <li>How I wish Clairol would add a little more product and sell some without the brush applicator</li>
            <li>This product does an amazing job at matching salon color, making it possible for me to stretch out my appointments a little longer.  </li>
            <li>The color lasted until the new hair grew in - about five/six weeks.</li>
            <li>For the cost you only get a very small amount, covers the roots on the top and sides, not enough for the full head.</li>
            <li>I like this product because it covers my grays really well in a short time.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product that makes it easy to color just the roots in between coloring.  Matches perfectly to the original product.  Quick processing time.  Recommend that once you apply, comb through toward ends so that you don&#x27;t have a line of where you applied the product.</li>
            <li> Perfect color to cover white roots. The auburn shade softens the harshness of a dark brown.</li>
            <li> When I can&#x27;t get to my hairdresser on time or can&#x27;t afford to go, I use this instead. It is a permanent dye and the applicator is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I never tried an over the counter product and was very skeptical. However, I couldn&#x27;t swing the salon trip anymore so I gave this a shot. I wanted to cover those new grays that appear just over the ears - the ones that look so great on men and somehow add ten years as a woman! I&#x27;m a brunette with auburn overtones. This color matched my hair perfectly without looking like a color was added. I leave on the full 12-15 minutes because my grays and whites can be stubborn (even the salon colorings didn&#x27;t mask them completely). I was really pleased with the product. I used it a couple of times - just divided up the product (Pre-mixed. Once mixed you can&#x27;t save it). I don&#x27;t think you are supposed to do that and it might make my head fall off but so far nothing bad happened. I did do the recommended allergy test first (testing the product on your arm for a couple of days). No problems. It is kind of a shame the tubes are so big - I only need like a teaspoon so a lot gets thrown away. The color lasted until the new hair grew in - about five/six weeks. Looked great the whole time.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work at all. I have some gray hair, so used it on my roots and left it on the 15 recommended minutes. Rinsed it off and my roots are just as gray as if I didn&#x27;t use anything at all. What a waste of money and time. I do NOT recommend this product!</li>

            <li> this is a good product.  got three boxes at the same or better price then you can get in the stores  arrived when company stated.</li>
            <li> Great as an interim fix before going to your stylist.</li>

The application was easy, too.</li>

            <li> I was skeptical as I&#x27;m a bit of a salon snob. Due to economizing, I&#x27;ve been stretching my hair color with at home jobs. This Root Touch Up is an amazing product. It does exactly what it says. It matched my dark auburn Redkin salon color. I could&#x27;ve left it on a bit longer I think for deeper gray coverage. Great when your in a rush.</li>
            <li> This is what I&#x27;ve been using for years now and I don&#x27;t plan on switching! Still works for me!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. I had to go in every 3 weeks for my base color to cover my gray roots and was skeptical about this product as I have a base color, low lights and highlights to get my \\&quot;natural\\&quot; look. I use either the light brown or dark blonde and it always looks great! No more spending every third Friday morning at the salon for two hours. In fact, I&#x27;ve used it two times in a row, giving me a good 8 week break from the salon. I go to what most would consider an \\&quot;upscale\\&quot; salon and this color works just fine with thier products. Totally disagree with other reviewer calling it a \\&quot;rip off.\\&quot; This is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This stuff is easy to use and quick. Just bought me an extra 2 months between hair colorings!  I have always had my hair done professionally and it was easy finding a color that matched perfectly. I just saved about $320/year!</li>
            <li> Product as I expected</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- A quick fix for roots in between coloring, works fast, and well. I use it to touch up break through grays, at temples and part line. There isn&#x27;t enough for a whole-head treatment, just the immediately visible stuff. And unlike regular color, it&#x27;s a lot faster, 10 minutes and I&#x27;m done!&lt;br /&gt;Good product.</li>
            <li> For the cost you only get a very small amount, covers the roots on the top and sides, not enough for the full head.</li>
            <li> Just wish it had more in it, because I always have to use two bottles and my hair isn&#x27;t even sholder length. Put more in !!!</li>
