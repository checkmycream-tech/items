            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s aways lovely.</li>
            <li>I just received Dr. TEals Epsom Salt completely free from [...] to try the product and give my honest opinion...</li>
            <li>I was ABLE utilize this product in a million ways....</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>so I received a full size pack of dr. teals Epsom soaking salt to test and give my honest review from smiley 360,</li>
            <li>I especially like that this company understands that we don&#x27;t want this heaven-scent product in dainty, itsy fashion bottles.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping for something with a bit more of a scent that didn&#x27;t disappear so quickly.  </li>
            <li>But rather, we love to pour generous amounts into the hot, steamy tub and not worry about running out in a day or two!</li>
            <li>I enjoy a soak with Dr Teal&#x27;s and baking soda.</li>
            <li>These are excellent high quality epsom salts with a nice relaxing scents that really makes soaking a pure pleasure and very relaxing</li>
            <li>I love this product and once I am done with these I will most likely buy me some more</li>
            <li>I cant help but tell friends and family join smiley to be a part of a unique community and also try Dr. Teals Epsom Salt to bring some well needed rest and relaxation to your soul....</li>
            <li>Incredible -- just wish the $$ was a little lower for them</li>
            <li>I had seen this on Dr. Oz, so after a full two days of packing I decided to soak in the tub with this product.</li>
            <li>love the product, felt the price a high after I went to the store to compare price.</li>
            <li>My favorite is the lavender but the other is nice too.  </li>
            <li>I use it for facial scrub and my skin feels better than it has in years!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure guys don&#x27;t normally review this, but i have part-time job of physical labor, and this helps ease the aches and pains and recovery time major, and the aromas from all are great too.</li>
            <li>Just let it go and float away on a fragrant steamy cloud in your own private bathroom spa.</li>
            <li>but luckily it wasn&#x27;t a large rip</li>
            <li>Economical bath salts, good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>I am so excited about my new find</li>
            <li>and she stated it left her face feeling clean and smooth....</li>
            <li>After about 20 minutes of soaking, my back and feet felt much better and the aches and pains of being on my feet were gone.</li>
            <li>I already love Epsom salt baths but these take the experience to the next level.</li>
            <li>my legs felt phenomenal after 20 minutes soaking -- they dissolve completely ( no gritty stuff under your body)</li>
            <li>I was able to utilize it as a facial exfoliation for my 14 year</li>
            <li>Love the salts but the price was high as I could have bought four in Target or Walmart for the same price.</li>
            <li>well I can say that I really like it</li>
            <li>and it was very soothing.</li>
            <li>BUT VERY PRICY ON AMAZON.</li>
            <li>fast shipping product as described, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Really.</li>
            <li>The scents are very calming and relaxing, almost felt like a blissful state of mind if I could try to describe it.</li>
            <li>The bath salts are very relaxing and they do ease sore muscles.</li>
            <li>It dissolves really well and the scented ones I&#x27;ve tried are very relaxing.  </li>
            <li>It will fill the whole space by just opening it.</li>
            <li>They are very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment and item just as described.  </li>
            <li>Your hardworking painful arches and cramped toes dabble blissfully and soften right up in nice warm epsom water.</li>
            <li>Very natural smelling, not chemically like others I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Have not shopped around for price but feel this from Amazon is good value and delivery to door is better for me with a bad back anyways.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any beneficial effect as far as relief from aches and pains yet</li>
            <li>Smell is strong but not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Just like fancy bath salts, only without the high price tag.  </li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not really the main reason I purchased these.</li>
            <li>so I lost very little and just transferred most of it to a jar instead of leaving it in the bag, and added hand dried lavender to the mix.</li>

            <li> Our Kroger has way cheaper price on couple of these, but not nearly the selection to pick from.</li>
            <li> Just put some in my bath after a long day and my aches and troubles go away.</li>
            <li> For the price smaller package than expected.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with plain Epsom salts to make it go further.  </li>
            <li> after a hards day work within a hot bath that soothed my aching body as the aroma caressed my tired mind...</li>
            <li> Recently found in Target for half the price.</li>
            <li> sometimes I do one or the other.  </li>
            <li> They always leave me feeling refreshed, energized and less sore.</li>
            <li> not a huge fan of the lavender scent, didn&#x27;t smell floral or lavender at all.</li>
            <li> What a relaxing few minutes to escape from it all!</li>
            <li> Will keep, but disappointed.</li>

            <li> Very happy with this purchase - VERY useful!! great for baths!!! BUT VERY PRICY ON AMAZON. BUY IT RETAIL AND SAVE LOTS. Recommended to all</li>
            <li> Altho it is a great product you can buy it at Target for $ 4.99 for the 3lb bag.  :)</li>
            <li> Love the product, not the price.  50% off or greater at WalMart.</li>
            <li> love the product, felt the price a high after I went to the store to compare price.</li>
            <li> Bags were smaller than I Spected.</li>
            <li> very good item. great smells breath better and relax from the epsom  salts check it out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived without this stuff!!! Leaves the whole bathroom smelling wonderful, also :-)</li>
            <li> fast shipping product as described, would buy again.</li>
            <li> this stuff is great. I&#x27;m sure guys don&#x27;t normally review this, but i have part-time job of physical labor, and this helps ease the aches and pains and recovery time major, and the aromas from all are great too. But keep watch on the pricing. Our Kroger has way cheaper price on couple of these, but not nearly the selection to pick from.</li>
            <li> Love Dr. Teals products for my nightly soaking baths.  The eucalyptus smells up the whole room and feels great.</li>
            <li> These are excellent high quality epsom salts with a nice relaxing scents that really makes soaking a pure pleasure and very relaxing</li>
            <li> I enjoy a soak with Dr Teal&#x27;s and baking soda. Has pleasant scent. Have not shopped around for price but feel this from Amazon is good value and delivery to door is better for me with a bad back anyways.</li>
            <li> very good for soaking - pleasant aroma</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dr. Teals for years, and will continue!</li>
            <li> I had seen this on Dr. Oz, so after a full two days of packing I decided to soak in the tub with this product. After about 20 minutes of soaking, my back and feet felt much better and the aches and pains of being on my feet were gone. I will defintely buy more of this product.</li>
            <li> Dr Teals Epsom salt soaking solution is a great product.  It helps with aches and pains and softens my skin and smells great too.  I use every night except when I take my showers.</li>
            <li> Really good price for nice bath salts.</li>
            <li> That pain in the neck... leave her at work. Just let it go and float away on a fragrant steamy cloud in your own private bathroom spa. Your hardworking painful arches and cramped toes dabble blissfully and soften right up in nice warm epsom water. Really. No Body should be without Dr. Teal&#x27;s sublime soaking solutions. Try it. You&#x27;ll be buying every fragrance in no time at all. I especially like that this company understands that we don&#x27;t want this heaven-scent product in dainty, itsy fashion bottles. But rather, we love to pour generous amounts into the hot, steamy tub and not worry about running out in a day or two!</li>
            <li> mint and eucalyptus smelled amazing. not a huge fan of the lavender scent, didn&#x27;t smell floral or lavender at all.</li>
            <li> Love these bath salts and they smell great also.</li>
            <li> I already love Epsom salt baths but these take the experience to the next level. The scents are very calming and relaxing, almost felt like a blissful state of mind if I could try to describe it. They always leave me feeling refreshed, energized and less sore. I used these faithfully through my pregnancy. Great for treating yourself or distressing.</li>
            <li> Everything as promised</li>
            <li> Economical bath salts, good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Excellent bath salts. The lavender is a very strong but true lavender aroma and the Eucalyptis/Spearming smells like the best gum you&#x27;ve ever chewed.</li>
            <li> Besides the wonderful relaxing effects of the epsom salts, Dr. Teal&#x27; s has real lavender oil and eucalyptus. They are reading and leave you and your bathroom smelling delightful!</li>
            <li> My chiropractor told me to start taking baths with epsom salt. It helps my muscles relax, and I sleep better too!</li>
            <li> Simply perfect!! I love this product</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Each scent that I purchased smells wonderful.  It provides a wonderfully relaxing bath with the wonderful health benefits of an Epsom salt soak.  I will be ordering more for sure.</li>
            <li> Very good price for the size of the package.</li>
            <li> The bath salts are very relaxing and they do ease sore muscles.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this product! Amazing smell. And it soothes you also. I use it for facial scrub and my skin feels better than it has in years! Makes my skin shine and just look healthier.  Would definitely recommend this product! Plus I got this product for FREE just by giving my own opinion on it! #Smiley360</li>
            <li> Receive 2 of the same, not one of each. Will keep, but disappointed.</li>
            <li> These are amazing!  As a runner, Epsom salts are just a part of life.  This brand, however, has been the best brand I&#x27;ve used thus far.  It dissolves really well and the scented ones I&#x27;ve tried are very relaxing.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Love it.  smells great.</li>
            <li> The lavender smells heavenly.  Makes for such a relaxing end to the day/week!</li>
            <li> Perfect! Nice Product! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> love these salts. Smell is strong but not overwhelming. I just wish they had a different closure on the bag, it&#x27;s like plastic Velcro and when you get salt grains in it, it doesn&#x27;t want to shut. Could always store in your own container</li>
            <li> Love the product. Recently found in Target for half the price. Won&#x27;t order again.</li>
            <li> Love these so relaxing. Just put some in my bath after a long day and my aches and troubles go away. I could soak for hours. Only problem was the lavender bag was ripped when shipped but luckily it wasn&#x27;t a large rip so I lost very little and just transferred most of it to a jar instead of leaving it in the bag, and added hand dried lavender to the mix. Also makes great gifts. I gave some to my sister and she loves them also.</li>
            <li> Love the salts but the price was high as I could have bought four in Target or Walmart for the same price.</li>
            <li> These work wonderfully for sleep aids.  I slept like a baby.  Such relaxing scents also.</li>
            <li> Very strong scent nice for relaxing.</li>
            <li> Good soak for feet after being in heels all day</li>
            <li> Love this but Walmart sells for 4.60 a bag</li>
            <li> These smell nice but I was hoping for something with a bit more of a scent that didn&#x27;t disappear so quickly.  I haven&#x27;t noticed any beneficial effect as far as relief from aches and pains yet but that&#x27;s not really the main reason I purchased these.</li>
            <li> This product has a wonderful natural smelling scent. It will fill the whole space by just opening it. Loved it and will order again.</li>
            <li> For the price smaller package than expected. Can buy a larger amount at the local pharmacy with the same scent.</li>
            <li> These are great! The scents are not overpowering. They are very soothing and relaxing.</li>
            <li> I love this product and once I am done with these I will most likely buy me some more</li>
            <li> LOVE. THESE.  Just like fancy bath salts, only without the high price tag.  Sometimes I mix the two types, sometimes I do one or the other.  But it&#x27;s aways lovely.</li>
            <li> Yes this works -/ however you need TWO cups for a muscle soak -- and 20 minutes --but my legs felt phenomenal after 20 minutes soaking -- they dissolve completely ( no gritty stuff under your body) the smell ? Incredible -- just wish the $$ was a little lower for them</li>
            <li> I loved it. Feeling relaxed and has a nice smell</li>
            <li> I just received Dr. TEals Epsom Salt completely free from [...] to try the product and give my honest opinion...I was ABLE utilize this product in a million ways....after a hards day work within a hot bath that soothed my aching body as the aroma caressed my tired mind...I was able to utilize it as a facial exfoliation for my 14 year and she stated it left her face feeling clean and smooth....I am so excited about my new find I cant help but tell friends and family join smiley to be a part of a unique community and also try Dr. Teals Epsom Salt to bring some well needed rest and relaxation to your soul....love it</li>
            <li> My favorite is the lavender but the other is nice too.  Good quality product that makes you fell good!</li>
            <li> Smells and feels wonderful. What a relaxing few minutes to escape from it all!</li>
            <li> Great in a bath for aches and pains</li>
            <li> Fast shipment and item just as described.  Thank you.</li>
