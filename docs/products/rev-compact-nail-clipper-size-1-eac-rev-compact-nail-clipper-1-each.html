    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Every pair I&#x27;ve ever had nips perfectly from edge to edge.  </li>
            <li>Revlon used to be the clippers that everyone used to buy, they worked the best and lasted the longest.  </li>
            <li>They are great travelers, too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had these for 4 years now and they still work great</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t nearly as good, they just won&#x27;t nip hang nails.</li>
            <li>and they work good.</li>
            <li>I am a fan of Amazon and 99.9% of the time have nothing except good to say about how they sell product.  </li>
            <li>all the roughness and sloppiness in the manufacturing of the jaws, you would think that they would carry that through to the edges of the file (where it might do some good).  </li>
            <li>These classic nail clippers are absolutely perfect.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;re probably better off going to your neighborhood drug store than buying a pair of clippers from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found nothing better for trimming finger nails (no filing required) and nipping off hang nails too.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li>These will go in the trash as soon as I can find something slightly better.  </li>
            <li>Revlon would tarnish their reputation if they were giving these rotten things away for free!  </li>
            <li>love that it has the nail file hooked right onto it - and it easily folds down (this comes in especially handy when digging in your purse for it!-</li>
            <li>These clippers are now made on the cheap in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>You can clip, file and clean under your nails all with this one</li>
            <li>these do not leave a clean line when you cut nails with them.</li>
            <li>The new file is so smooth that it might be better suited for polishing the lacquer paint job on the hood of a fine automobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The redesign is for the worse, and it does a fairly thorough job of messing up most of what was good about the decades old design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve enjoyed decades of use from the old style of Revlon clipper  </li>
            <li>First time use was okay, but it broke on the second.  </li>
            <li>These things absolutely suck!  </li>
            <li>The file has smoothly beveled side edges, without a hint of serration near the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Firstly, it is bulkier in an unwelcome way.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The old design had an excellent file with deep serrations and sharp edges.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had other Revlon Nail Clips and they also functioned effectively.</li>
            <li>Too small to be good.</li>
            <li>He really likes them.</li>
            <li>It was a much cheaper clipper.  </li>
            <li>This nail clip was nothing fancy, but it works really well.</li>
            <li>They were kind enough to send me one of the old one&#x27;s mixed in with the 11 new ones.  </li>
            <li>These clippers are so much better than my previous clippers.</li>
            <li>particular listing is showing a photo for the reliable nail clipper design that Revlon marketed for decades.  </li>
            <li>(but, not all) of the listings, but someone keeps wanting to describe this product as &#x27;Classic.&#x27;  </li>
            <li>This product wasn&#x27;t much of an improvement from the old worn out clipper they replaced.  </li>
            <li>First\\&quot; brand nail clippers (which work very well, but are small and I don&#x27;t want to wear them out) until I can find some that cut better than this Revlon model.</li>
            <li>In the picture attached you can see the product i received on the left, and the product I was expecting on the right.</li>
            <li>The cheap metal is really soft and bendable, but apparently brittle enough to break.</li>
            <li>New out of the package the clippers would not cut my finger nails.  </li>
            <li>Its not - its new junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>found that the deficiencies in this new design were widespread -</li>
            <li>The Revlon part numbers on the packaging for the old design and the new were exactly the same part number</li>
            <li>Finally, I ordered a few from an online shop outside of Amazon, just to make sure they truly were horrid - they consistently</li>
            <li>/&gt;The previous old design had a file that was very good for both flat surface and edge work; at least good enough for people who don&#x27;t care for a proper manicure (I&#x27;ll say it: that would probably mean men, mostly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The model that was shipped is a far inferior pair of clippers.  </li>
            <li>Got these for my 17 year old son.</li>
            <li>only consolation is they don&#x27;t cost much.  </li>
            <li>nail clipper that is actually shipping is a new Revlon redesign.  </li>
            <li>new inferior design can be avoided if you are shown a proper photo of it.  </li>
            <li>The new design has a diagonal cross-hatch pattern formed into the outer surface of the upper lever handle.  </li>
            <li>in hand, the new design can be further identified.  </li>
            <li>The center of the jaws close first and even with extra pressure applied to the levers, the jaws cannot close down enough on the outer edges to make a fully clean cut.  </li>
            <li>It seems like pretty simple technology -- in fact it probably is harder to mess up manufacturing than it is to get it right</li>
            <li>It is clearly visible in product photos (when the proper photo is shown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Secondly, it is made in China, while &#x27;old reliable&#x27; was made in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hand now rests in the bent up position while riding in a pocket, and curves down when ready to trim.  </li>
            <li>The small size and slightly curved shape is easy to hold and still see what you&#x27;re doing.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> , I only hope that people will stop buying this miserable product, and that Amazon will further work to clean up the photos to only show the true product being sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Then I ordered a single unit.  </li>
            <li> I thought that perhaps the first was just a fluke, but the replacement performed just as poorly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding them locally (I loaned one to a friend and forgot to get it back!)</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off there are multiple listings for the same product (at least 4 for this product).  </li>
            <li> They break but they work as expected for a while.</li>
            <li> The previous brand had too weak a spring action and didn&#x27;t open all the way.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The new design removes the ability of the cutting surfaces to cut completely through at the outboard sides of the jaws.  </li>
            <li> my wife using the other.  </li>
            <li> Item is NOT as pictured with ridge in center of pressure lever!  </li>
            <li> They won&#x27;t even cut the thin nails of my 8 year old.</li>
            <li> They will trim loose threads, snip off price tags, and any other small snipping or prying job you can think of.    </li>
            <li> It is small, too small and smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t cut yourself while trying to find it since it folds down tight).</li>
            <li> Very difficult to cut through the nails, never able to get a clean cut.  </li>
            <li> The nail file is now a joke, and even the cross hatch pattern that could potentially help keep my thumb from slipping off the hand is on the wrong friggin&#x27; side!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll waste my money on Revlon clippers again.  </li>
            <li> One order was for a 12 pack (something I do once every few years or so).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> The blades are dull and poorly aligned to each other.</li>
            <li> The cutting edges don&#x27;t line up and there is a nick in one of the cutters so it is useless but not worth sending back.  </li>
            <li> you will HATE this new style.  </li>
            <li> Amazon&#x27;s sloppy housekeeping on the duplicate postings.  </li>
            <li> (unfortunately, I tossed the packaging and have forgotten the number).  </li>
            <li> Amazon should pull this product as it reflects very poorly on the retailer in my opinion ... and Amazon is almost always my go to website.</li>
            <li> Made in China - very poor quality.</li>
            <li> I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>

            <li> They break but they work as expected for a while. It is small, too small and smaller than I thought.</li>
            <li> These clippers are now made on the cheap in my opinion.  It seems like pretty simple technology -- in fact it probably is harder to mess up manufacturing than it is to get it right but they have done it.  You&#x27;re probably better off going to your neighborhood drug store than buying a pair of clippers from Amazon.  The only well reviewed clippers on Amazon are $15 and that doesn&#x27;t make sense.  Very disappointed.  Amazon should pull this product as it reflects very poorly on the retailer in my opinion ... and Amazon is almost always my go to website.</li>
            <li> These classic nail clippers are absolutely perfect.  They are on my short \\&quot;must have\\&quot; list.  Must have in bathroom, kitchen, desk, and purse. Maybe one for the car.    I&#x27;ve found nothing better for trimming finger nails (no filing required) and nipping off hang nails too.  Every pair I&#x27;ve ever had nips perfectly from edge to edge.  The small size and slightly curved shape is easy to hold and still see what you&#x27;re doing.  They are great travelers, too.  They will trim loose threads, snip off price tags, and any other small snipping or prying job you can think of.    I&#x27;ve had a hard time finding them locally (I loaned one to a friend and forgot to get it back!) and bought the more expensive Tweezerman clippers.  They aren&#x27;t nearly as good, they just won&#x27;t nip hang nails.</li>
            <li> Image doesn&#x27;t match the product shipped.  The model that was shipped is a far inferior pair of clippers.  The blades are dull and poorly aligned to each other.</li>
            <li> Too small to be good.</li>
            <li> We have about 10 of these all over the house! I carry one in my purse too! You never know when you are going to need it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it has the nail file hooked right onto it - and it easily folds down (this comes in especially handy when digging in your purse for it!- you don&#x27;t cut yourself while trying to find it since it folds down tight). You can clip, file and clean under your nails all with this one product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No household should be without one (or ten)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1smileycat :-)</li>
            <li> I went to the grocery store to hopefully get a generic one, but only found this one.  First time use was okay, but it broke on the second.  The cheap metal is really soft and bendable, but apparently brittle enough to break.</li>
            <li> This product wasn&#x27;t much of an improvement from the old worn out clipper they replaced.  Very difficult to cut through the nails, never able to get a clean cut.  After 8 months of use they broke.  Revlon used to be the clippers that everyone used to buy, they worked the best and lasted the longest.  How they have changed.  If I had 1 pair it might have been a fluke.  Except I purchased 2 pairs and they both broke within 8 months of use, with me using one of them and my wife using the other.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll waste my money on Revlon clippers again.  Time to look elsewhere for something that works.</li>
            <li> Item is NOT as pictured with ridge in center of pressure lever!  I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED. I WILL NOT use this item but give to others.</li>
            <li> Different inferior product than what is pictured on the description. In the picture attached you can see the product i received on the left, and the product I was expecting on the right.</li>
            <li> Not as pictured. Dissapointed.</li>
            <li> These things absolutely suck!  If you&#x27;ve enjoyed decades of use from the old style of Revlon clipper  you will HATE this new style.  The hand now rests in the bent up position while riding in a pocket, and curves down when ready to trim.  The nail file is now a joke, and even the cross hatch pattern that could potentially help keep my thumb from slipping off the hand is on the wrong friggin&#x27; side!  I bought a pair because I lost my last ones I&#x27;d had for years................which was identical to the last several pairs that just wore out.  These will go in the trash as soon as I can find something slightly better.  Revlon would tarnish their reputation if they were giving these rotten things away for free!  Save your money, time, and sanity and buy something else, unless you want to log onto Amazon and complain also.</li>
            <li> Got these for my 17 year old son. He really likes them. I used them once too and they work good. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> New out of the package the clippers would not cut my finger nails.  Made in China - very poor quality.</li>
            <li> What is pictured is NOT what I recieved. What a rip off!!!!</li>
            <li> these do not leave a clean line when you cut nails with them. I&#x27;m still using my toddler&#x27;s \\&quot;Safety First\\&quot; brand nail clippers (which work very well, but are small and I don&#x27;t want to wear them out) until I can find some that cut better than this Revlon model.</li>
            <li> I thought that perhaps the first was just a fluke, but the replacement performed just as poorly. They won&#x27;t even cut the thin nails of my 8 year old.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Amazon and 99.9% of the time have nothing except good to say about how they sell product.  If you haven&#x27;t guessed it already, this isn&#x27;t one of those times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off there are multiple listings for the same product (at least 4 for this product).  One listing would be plenty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular listing is showing a photo for the reliable nail clipper design that Revlon marketed for decades.  But, that isn&#x27;t what is actually shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail clipper that is actually shipping is a new Revlon redesign.  The redesign is for the worse, and it does a fairly thorough job of messing up most of what was good about the decades old design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new inferior design can be avoided if you are shown a proper photo of it.  The new design has a diagonal cross-hatch pattern formed into the outer surface of the upper lever handle.  It is clearly visible in product photos (when the proper photo is shown).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve waited a few months for a break in my schedule to find the time to write this properly, and to cool my venom a little.  I see that Amazon is now showing the proper photo in some (but, not all) of the listings, but someone keeps wanting to describe this product as &#x27;Classic.&#x27;  Its not - its new junk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new design removes the ability of the cutting surfaces to cut completely through at the outboard sides of the jaws.  The center of the jaws close first and even with extra pressure applied to the levers, the jaws cannot close down enough on the outer edges to make a fully clean cut.  Forget about doing edge nips with it - it won&#x27;t bite, it just tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old design had an excellent file with deep serrations and sharp edges.  The new file is so smooth that it might be better suited for polishing the lacquer paint job on the hood of a fine automobile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all the roughness and sloppiness in the manufacturing of the jaws, you would think that they would carry that through to the edges of the file (where it might do some good).  Nope.  The file has smoothly beveled side edges, without a hint of serration near the edges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous old design had a file that was very good for both flat surface and edge work; at least good enough for people who don&#x27;t care for a proper manicure (I&#x27;ll say it: that would probably mean men, mostly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once in hand, the new design can be further identified.  Firstly, it is bulkier in an unwelcome way.  Secondly, it is made in China, while &#x27;old reliable&#x27; was made in Korea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the deficiencies in this new design were widespread - I ordered them three times.  Yes, I&#x27;m stubborn.  Twice I ordered through Amazon.  One order was for a 12 pack (something I do once every few years or so).  Then I ordered a single unit.  I ordered from different Amazon sellers each of these two times.  Finally, I ordered a few from an online shop outside of Amazon, just to make sure they truly were horrid - they consistently are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two Amazon vendors were &#x27;dream store inc&#x27; and &#x27;Bethany&#x27;s Necessities.&#x27;  I have no quarrel with the sellers, as I believe they were victims of Revlon&#x27;s ill-advised design and marketing decisions and Amazon&#x27;s sloppy housekeeping on the duplicate postings.  But, that remains a guess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bethany&#x27;s was where I bought the 12 pack.  They were kind enough to send me one of the old one&#x27;s mixed in with the 11 new ones.  The Revlon part numbers on the packaging for the old design and the new were exactly the same part number (unfortunately, I tossed the packaging and have forgotten the number).  So all paths on this fiasco lead to back to Revlon as the root cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only consolation is they don&#x27;t cost much.  I gave them one star for their scrap metal content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, I forgave Amazon and vendors for their one or two &#x27;aw-shucks.&#x27; I figure that the thousand &#x27;atta-boys&#x27; they deserve should be enough to cancel out the occasional flub.  Taking that into consideration, I couldn&#x27;t be bothered to file for refunds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I only hope that people will stop buying this miserable product, and that Amazon will further work to clean up the photos to only show the true product being sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I ordered three of these items. The item was not the one shown the product description.  It was a much cheaper clipper.  I&#x27;m not satisfied.</li>
            <li> This nail clip was nothing fancy, but it works really well. I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months and its still doing well. I&#x27;ve had other Revlon Nail Clips and they also functioned effectively.</li>
            <li> These clippers are so much better than my previous clippers. The previous brand had too weak a spring action and didn&#x27;t open all the way.</li>
            <li> The cutting edges don&#x27;t line up and there is a nick in one of the cutters so it is useless but not worth sending back.  Not a quality product I would expect from Revlon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had these for 4 years now and they still work great</li>
