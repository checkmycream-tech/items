            <li>Good product, cuts the nails well and does the job fine.  </li>
            <li>I have  a 97 cent pair from Lacrosse that are 5 years old and still work perfectly.</li>
            <li>happy to find exact item needed on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Love the angle of these.</li>
            <li>Brought this many years ago at Walmart and of course they stopped carrying it.  </li>
            <li>I have many in grown toe nails.</li>
            <li>I tried Wal Mart,K mart,Beauty supply shops and many,many more places.</li>
            <li>The are made of very good quality metal and will last 10 years or more(If</li>
            <li>So great for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find these angle cut nail/cuticle clippers for a reasonable price</li>
            <li>Along my journey to find that perfect one again I have purchased probably 15 different ones (maybe some were the same, who knows -</li>
            <li>They cut perfectly and appear to be the exact same quality as those I&#x27;ve purchased in local stores.</li>
            <li>will work but made very cheap the other one i use to have was better</li>

            <li>Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li>but I guess it&#x27;s better than traditional clipper.</li>
            <li>They have more than one use,it&#x27;s like they are universal.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I owned a slanted clipper like this for 5 straight years</li>
            <li>I WILL order the same pair If available.</li>
            <li>so that was good and they are pretty sturdy, so far, but they are dull.  </li>
            <li>I had gotten a similar item to this in Walgreens several years ago and wanted more for gifts....</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve definitely owned clippers that are more likely to tear your nail than clip it)</li>
            <li>Obviously it cuts in more of a straight line than a curve so you have to be careful to shape your nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are one item I can&#x27;t live with out.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t suspect having any problem with them, they are after all pretty simple in design.</li>
            <li>Pretty low quality.  </li>
            <li>There is a marked difference between these and the Revlon pair</li>
            <li>so my nails would be soft.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the only one that is sharp and precise like my old one is.  </li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they are not as sturdy or as sharp as my original ones made by LaCross of which I haven&#x27;t been able to find.</li>
            <li>I paid less than $2.00 but this thing barely cuts and was hardly worth waiting a month to receive from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li>The only toe nail clippers that will work on my 92 year old mother&#x27;s toenails. . .</li>
            <li>The edges are not very sharp so it almost defeats the purpose of purchasing the slanted clippers.</li>
            <li>my luck, the first thing I did was drop it down some stairs.</li>
            <li>Not sharp enough to cut through my cuticles, fingernails or anything else.</li>
            <li>The clippers are not sharp enough to cut nails or cuticles.</li>

            <li> Very Dull! Worthless! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> These will not cut nails, hangnails or cuticles.  I realize they are inexpensive.  I have  a 97 cent pair from Lacrosse that are 5 years old and still work perfectly.</li>
            <li> Useless!  Not sharp enough to cut through my cuticles, fingernails or anything else.</li>

            <li> Good product, cuts the nails well and does the job fine.  I would recommend purchasing these...  They are sharp and cut well</li>
            <li> So great for dry cuticles.</li>
            <li> The only toe nail clippers that will work on my 92 year old mother&#x27;s toenails. . .</li>
            <li> It was shaped the way I wanted and expected, but the cutting edge does not cut well.</li>
            <li> Love the angle of these. They seem to have disappeared from any stores I&#x27;ve looked for them in. They cut perfectly and appear to be the exact same quality as those I&#x27;ve purchased in local stores. I&#x27;ve ordered several of these to keep around in various locations. I don&#x27;t suspect having any problem with them, they are after all pretty simple in design.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for oblique clipper for some time and know I have them. I like them a lot.Thanks</li>
            <li> I had gotten a similar item to this in Walgreens several years ago and wanted more for gifts....everybody that saw my clippers wanted a pair.The store no longer carried them and so I went to the internet and found them here at Amazon !!These are the best clippers because of the angle...just the BEST!</li>
            <li> I am an avid cuticle clipper.  I owned a slanted clipper like this for 5 straight years and it was sharp the entire time (and only cost me $1.29).  Along my journey to find that perfect one again I have purchased probably 15 different ones (maybe some were the same, who knows - this includes the scissor looking cuticle clippers which have never worked for me)  and this is one of the few I could actually clip some cuticles with, so there&#x27;s that - but that was also short lived.  This is usable as a regular clipper and because it will actually clip nails (I&#x27;ve definitely owned clippers that are more likely to tear your nail than clip it) I gave it the extra star.  Obviously it cuts in more of a straight line than a curve so you have to be careful to shape your nails.&lt;br /&gt;If you want a cuticle clipper, get the $11 italian one,  it&#x27;s the only one that is sharp and precise like my old one is.  You can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I paid less than $2.00 but this thing barely cuts and was hardly worth waiting a month to receive from Hong Kong.</li>
            <li> Pretty low quality.  Mine broke after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they are not as sturdy or as sharp as my original ones made by LaCross of which I haven&#x27;t been able to find.</li>
            <li> The clippers are not sharp enough to cut nails or cuticles. No amount of pressure makes any difference. The nail then has to be torn instead of cut. Also, at the tip of the clippers, where the pointed area is located, the clippers do not close in order to cut or grab hold of anything. I&#x27;m extremely  disappointed in the product &amp; my purchase!</li>
            <li> Terrible. Essentially will not cut cuticles. Might cut nails, though.</li>
            <li> I am constantly the recipient of people stick their foots up my butt.&lt;br /&gt;I inserted these and now offered pedicures.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> Arrived roughly around a month after I purchased it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my luck, the first thing I did was drop it down some stairs. I thought it would be cheaply made &amp; would have broken, but it didn&#x27;t! It&#x27;s small in size &amp; the slant is perfect for those annoying hang nails.&lt;br /&gt;Great purchase! Great tool to add to my nail collection :)</li>
            <li> Was a bit disappointed cause it&#x27;s dull, dull, dull.  Brought this many years ago at Walmart and of course they stopped carrying it.  Thought I give this a try and was a bit disappointed but I guess it&#x27;s better than traditional clipper.</li>
            <li> I bought two pairs because I can&#x27;t find them anywhere in stores but I&#x27;m glad I did because they work awesome! Sturdy and sharp and they came way earlier than they said they would.</li>
            <li> These arrived quicker than stated so that was good and they are pretty sturdy, so far, but they are dull.  I purchased these clippers to cut hang nails and my cuticles and they are barely sharp enough to do that.</li>
            <li> will work but made very cheap the other one i use to have was better</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find these angle cut nail/cuticle clippers for a reasonable price and I ordered 2 of them.  But when they came, I was disappointed.  They are not as sharp as I had hoped they would be and fail to give a smooth cut.  There is a marked difference between these and the Revlon pair I had previously.  I guess this is an example of where you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Total garbage!  Has burrs along the cutting surface.  And the cutting surface only comes together at one point, instead of along the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time buying this. You cannot cut your toe nails with it.</li>
            <li> I order the Rosallina Slanted Tip Nail Clipper.I have many in grown toe nails.I bought a pair of these 10 years ago.They became lost somehow.I could not find a pair of clippers like these anywhere. I tried Wal Mart,K mart,Beauty supply shops and many,many more places.I could not find them.I found these on Amazon.I ordered them and they came from China.I thought it would takes weeks to get,but to my surprise,I received them in 2 weeks.These clippers are a must for your finger and toe nail collection.I had 4 in grown nails at the time I got these in the mail.I thought it would take several days to get my toe nails back in shape.Well,it took me one night.I used them after my bath so my nails would be soft.The are made of very good quality metal and will last 10 years or more(If you don&#x27;t loose them as I did)I would recommend these clipper for everyone,Men and women.They have more than one use,it&#x27;s like they are universal.They  are good to remove cuticles,in grown toe nails and many more uses.If I ever loose this pair I WILL order the same pair If available.These are one item I can&#x27;t live with out.</li>
            <li> For some reason, these weren&#x27;t very sharp.  I had to throw away one.</li>
