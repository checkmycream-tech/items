            <li>I feel they are a nice size and have great quality.</li>
            <li>good price and seem to be durable (not separating, staying bunched up)</li>
            <li>Good value for the price.  </li>
            <li>Love these for the price and the thoroughly good exfoliation!</li>
            <li>I also like the wonderful clean feeling I get after using it.</li>
            <li>These come in a nice 6pack and it nice for someone who can not get off Island!</li>
            <li>bath poufs go, these are exceptional.</li>
            <li>Great sponges, perfect size, and they keep their shape for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li>But we are very pleased with the quality and affordability of these bath sponges.</li>
            <li>I am in love, they hold up great too.</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>I love these bath sponges!</li>
            <li>can you imagine how many people have fumbled through those... who knows where their hands have been!</li>
            <li>Love these!</li>
            <li>Love these colors, too!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many Poufs before and nothing tops these!</li>
            <li>I LOVE these!  </li>
            <li>These were great and really cheap.  </li>
            <li>The bright colors do not run, these are hefty bath sponges and they work better than a loofa scrubby.  </li>
            <li>These are very stuff in the beginning, but they hold up great!</li>
            <li>Love and I can feel good that they are made of recycled material and are themselves recyclable.</li>
            <li>Lathers up nicely, extending soap life.</li>
            <li>I like the size and they make a nice lather.</li>
            <li>I kind of like it</li>
            <li>We really liked these.</li>
            <li>The abrasiveness is nice.  </li>
            <li>This is a good buy love the sponges.</li>
            <li>I also liked the hanging loop, it&#x27;s a sturdy material and has that bamboo-y EcoTools feel to it.</li>
            <li>Love everything about these sponges, perfect size, great economical buy and the texture is right on.</li>
            <li>I love the nice lather it gives off when I rub my bar soap onto it.</li>
            <li>they lather up so nicely :)</li>
            <li>Excellent Loofas, they are just the right texture and are just the right size.</li>
            <li>Also, it was very secure and never came apart like the flimsy sponges you find in stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have ordered these from Amazon three different times now and have been happy with every purchase!</li>
            <li>I will buy more soon :)</li>
            <li>Cant express how much I love these.</li>
            <li>Yes, they are that durable :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used bath poufs for many years.  </li>
            <li>These are actually just the perfect combo.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li>Much better than what you get a walmart and CVS for $2 a piece.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to be sure the quality held up.</li>
            <li>I knew the quality was much better than what I had been getting in stores.</li>
            <li>Bought these a year or more ago.  </li>
            <li>Love these a lot.</li>
            <li>I love that these are recycled as well.</li>
            <li>I like being able to order in bulk so as not to need to purchase as often.</li>
            <li>Love these sponges.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy with the sponges!</li>
            <li>So glad I bought this pack.</li>
            <li>but it is ok after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>The bath and body works seems to have the most durable sponges.  </li>
            <li>It is the most substantial scrubbie I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
            <li>They work well, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy so many at a time again, just one at a time</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>Product is great and arrived fast</li>
            <li>More than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li>Ok, so I like these sponges, but here&#x27;s the thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better than the dollar one I bought at target.</li>
            <li>One of the better sponges I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>They seem more substantial than the ones you&#x27;d find in a grocery aisle.</li>
            <li>(For lack of a better descriptor...</li>
            <li>The ones they sell in the bins at the grocery store or Wal-Mart  are softer and work better for me.  </li>
            <li>I usually love everything I buy from Amazon--and I buy alot--</li>
            <li>LOVE the toughness/roughness of these.  </li>
            <li>The recycled poufs seemed like a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that these poufs are very stiff/rough.</li>
            <li>it hasn&#x27;t come unraveled like so many cheaper ones do too.</li>
            <li>I love that these are made out of recycled plastic.  </li>
            <li>For the price, you can&#x27;t get a better loofah.</li>
            <li>I love the fact they are made from recyclable sponges, so we are helping the environment.</li>
            <li>My mother-in-law and Aunt split the pack with me and they are also enjoying them.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that there were so many in one pack.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product and have loved it since the day I first use it in the shower.</li>
            <li>Good price and hold up pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Not as nice as the ones from The Body Shop, which I love, but these are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>Package arrived speedily and the loop fits perfectly around my shower-temperature-handle-thingee to hang dry</li>
            <li>Colors are nice, mature, and not obnoxiously bright.  </li>
            <li>These are not that rough, they are perfect.  </li>
            <li>They are exactly what I had been looking for, I love that they are recycled plastic!</li>
            <li>Lose shape very quickly.</li>
            <li>I got these because they were reviewed as being strong.</li>
            <li>All this for less than a couple of bucks per pouf - win!</li>
            <li>The cheap ones break apart so easily.</li>
            <li>These are great sponges if you don&#x27;t need something incredibly soft and want some mild exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Nice large size.</li>
            <li>The fact that they are recycled is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>Overall, these are great, and I will repurchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like being scratched all over, but it&#x27;s a comfortable scratch.</li>
            <li>Great quality and last without falling apart!</li>
            <li>and I think the roughness makes it feel like a light massage.</li>
            <li>As for the colors - I&#x27;m happy the colors are neutral enough to belong to a guy or a gal.</li>
            <li>I thoroughly enjoy these sponges.</li>
            <li>I wanted something a bit course and cheap..</li>
            <li>cheap and gets the job done</li>
            <li>Such a shame because it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li>Even my daughter said they didn&#x27;t work as well as her cheap puff.</li>
            <li>The sponge is a good soft sponge, but I wish it had a longer hanging string.</li>
            <li>Plus, of course, I end up with a nice clean feeling, much cleaner than with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find a puff made from recycled material.</li>
            <li>As advertized- mine didn&#x27;t have the hemp cords like my original or the photo-</li>
            <li>Never felt clean while using these.</li>
            <li>I loved these much more than any other pouf, loofah or sponge I have used.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love they get shipped together in a large plastic bag</li>
            <li>Nothing special, but no problems either.</li>
            <li>I am letting them air out in hopes the odor will fade, but right now would not want to use them on my body!</li>
            <li>Just right!</li>
            <li>I have been having a hard time finding these in the store, so I was very happy to find them on here.</li>
            <li>I love these sponges because they really are exfoliating.</li>
            <li>These bath sponges are thick, poufy and of excellent quality.</li>
            <li>Super durable and keep clean.</li>
            <li>They are that and are just course enough for a good scrub.</li>
            <li>These are full sized cleaning goodness.</li>
            <li>Not bad price,</li>
            <li>However, I have not had them fall apart as I&#x27;ve experienced with other shower</li>
            <li>The colors are exactly as pictured and the loofah is nice and firm for a good scrub.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t come undone quickly and (supposedly) they&#x27;re earth-friendly.</li>
            <li>The string attached is sturdy enough to last and is perfect for hanging in the shower!</li>
            <li>Unless it dissipates quickly, I can&#x27;t see myself using these or ordering them again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great that these are made of recycled plastic, I don&#x27;t see any reason to waste plastic (oil) on a different, non-recycled brand sponge when these are as good as they are.</li>
            <li>These are higher quality than the ones available at drug stores.</li>
            <li>They are a great deal and made from recycled materials, yet they feel like your typical lufa sponge.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the first one for almost a year!</li>
            <li>Great Value but alittle bit to harsh on the skin</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re economical like myself</li>
            <li>It feels remarkably soft and comfortable, but at the same time has good brisk scrubbing ability.</li>
            <li>but once you get to use them they get bigger, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It could have bee a bit smaller and softer so you can really get a good soapy mass on it.</li>
            <li>I just buy the six pack and have a couple year&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>So far these have seemed to hold up better than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li>I go thru these pretty quickly (replace every 4-6 weeks),</li>
            <li>Unless you use one of these forever, which I&#x27;m probably not going to do, you might as well have thrown all the recyclable plastic products that were recycled to make these right into a landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>just the right amount of roughness, not like a pumice stone</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not super pleasant and now I&#x27;m stuck with 6.</li>
            <li>If, however, you are looking for something that you can actuall scrub and get clean with, this works very well to that end.  </li>
            <li>A bit more rough than the non-eco sponges, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>Work great for real scrubbing, but a little aggressive for some areas.</li>
            <li>Apparently these aren&#x27;t popular where I live anymore</li>
            <li>Very handy when you go to take a shower and yours has worn out and you still have a big bag of these left to use.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it holds up long term, but so far it&#x27;s just as good as the nonrecycled ones sold in drug stores.</li>
            <li>They have a funny smell that does not go away, even after use</li>
            <li>Needed more bath sponges as my current one was falling apart.  </li>
            <li>but it is still holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li>These last much longer than regular poufs, and it is great that they are made from recycled plastic.</li>
            <li>Oh, and I like the size which is pretty big compared to most poufs.</li>
            <li>A lot higher quality</li>
            <li>and they are much higher quality than the cheapy ones I used to snag at the dollar stores.</li>
            <li>I think a looser, floppier and bigger bath sponge works better for me.</li>
            <li>I will be back here to order more when I am out</li>
            <li>Does a good job of removing my dead skin.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, I got this and several other products for a great deal using my Kindle Special offers.  </li>
            <li>I was hoping these would be a little more comfortable</li>
            <li>Bigger than my hand and strong allowing higher pressure.</li>
            <li>Really liked that they were a bit denser than your average bath pouf.</li>
            <li>These are ok, actually kind of rough for the first few uses, but they do get better either way only giving them 3 probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li>They are very strong compared to other brands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase especially because I won&#x27;t need to buy sponges for the next year.</li>
            <li>ribbon used for hanging them is very short and easily lost in the lather of a soapy pouf.</li>
            <li>Your skin must be super sensitive because these were not scratchy at all.  </li>
            <li>However, I had to speak up and say that I have been using my same bath pouf for over 8 months now and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>I like my sponges to be strong enough to exfoliate with.</li>
            <li>last forever (I am still using my first one after about 4 months, no sign of wear) and are a good combination of exfoliating without being too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li>These loofahs are delicate but don&#x27;t fall apart easily like many I have bought.  </li>
            <li>but once I took them out of the bag they were fine shortly after.</li>
            <li>Main brand versions fall apart, these do not!</li>
            <li>Nice loofas, but just a little scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Pay a little more and get a much better product that will last a much longer time.</li>
            <li>There is nothing environmentally responsible about making products that fall apart after a week, which these do.</li>
            <li>Would not have bothered me as much, had it been what was advertised.</li>
            <li>Otherwise I&#x27;d be calling Amazon or the manufacturer/makers to complain about a very sub-par product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are really well made.  </li>
            <li>The $1 Walmart loofahs fall apart after a week or two, but this one has lasted much longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li>Well, It works and works very well.</li>
            <li>Hey, this thing might be just recycled plastic, but it works real</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>They wear very well.</li>
            <li>I have purchased Ecopouf Bath sponges in the store before and thought I was going to receive the same pouf that was available in the store.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t hold the soapy suds very well.</li>
            <li>They hold up really well.</li>
            <li>The cheap 99c ones at your local WM are gentler on the skin</li>
            <li>I also really like the colors they came in.</li>
            <li>They lather very well.</li>
            <li>I bought one at Publix that was too big for me to hold comfortably</li>
            <li>that was much rougher.</li>
            <li>These also lather up really well.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because it seemed like a reasonable price for an item that often seems to be overpriced.  </li>
            <li>High quality loofahs!</li>
            <li>like others have said, the thing fell apart very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t like them as much as I</li>
            <li>Be aware that these are rougher than your normal bath sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That means that all they&#x27;re really doing is delaying the plastic that went into making them from going into the trash.  </li>
            <li>In fact, my upper arms aren&#x27;t bumpy anymore and just totally smooth.</li>
            <li>They were actually very scratchy and we ended up throwing some away.</li>
            <li>I am very tempted to stock up on these and incorporate them in birthday or Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li>However, the soap doesn&#x27;t get sudsy on these sponges and they are very course on your skin.</li>
            <li>I saw some reviews that said these were very scratchy.  </li>
            <li>Theses sponges are the right balance of soft and exfoliating (not too scratchy)</li>
            <li>Unlike many other brands, they don&#x27;t start to become unwound after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li>Every once in a while one seems slightly rougher but most are a gentle scrub, almost silky.</li>
            <li>Very full, dense, and a bit rough.  </li>
            <li>I am sorry for those of you who have not had similar results, but I&#x27;m about to purchase this pack of 6 for stocking stuffers for my family members, and I&#x27;m crossing my fingers for more good results....</li>
            <li>Very ruff doesn&#x27;t soften up like normal ones do</li>
            <li>I love these - they exfoliate nice since they are a little bit scratchy mesh and last a long time.</li>
            <li>A little rough, but great colors and well made.</li>
            <li>They last long, are nice and thick, and have a nice sturdy strap.</li>
            <li>and they seem more sturdy than the ones I previously owned as well.</li>
            <li>I love that they come packaged, which means less hands on them.  </li>
            <li>And, they&#x27;re eco-friendly, which is the main reason I purchased these.</li>
            <li>Fall apart quickly and string is too short to be functional.</li>
            <li>Decent bath puffs.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have the most sensitive skin in the world, but the texture of this sponge was too rough-</li>
            <li>These poofy bath sponges are large and full, well made, but have a very strange odor.  </li>
            <li>I have used high quality poofs for years from a particular store at the mall, and I was worried about deviating.  </li>
            <li>I initially was wanting the dual pouf (one side soft and the other more firm) for a really good scrub.</li>
            <li>Seem to be of high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly advise you to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li>It is definitely not as soft as some of the cheap ones you can find in stores, so if you are looking for a very soft pouf keep looking.  </li>
            <li>These are surprisingly high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Or do they all reek to high heaven?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I got a bag of these for a little more than what I pay for 1 at the store.</li>
            <li>They are tough but I like a good scrub when I shower.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li>but they are pretty hard texture-wise compared to most others.  </li>
            <li>Worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li>These loofahs are better than average (very dense) and last well.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t find them to be too scratchy as I remember other reviews noting.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent sponge, but I just wish the string was a little longer so it could go easily around my wrist while I&#x27;m washing.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy these again when the time comes for new puffs.</li>
            <li>I use a new one about every six to eight weeks</li>
            <li>They come in a package of 6 which means you won&#x27;t have to keep going to the store every month to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like have to scrub too hard so a sponge that is already rough works great for me.</li>
            <li>Although these are much more expensive than other sponges, I sincerely believe they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I really really liked the teal and cornflower blue, the lime green</li>
            <li>There is no \\&quot;plastic smell\\&quot; that I can discern, and I am very sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>The first \\&quot;pouf\\&quot; fell apart - the webbing material just started to unravel - in just the second use.  </li>
            <li>My experience is exactly the opposite.</li>
            <li>I got a fun assortment of colors- an orangesicle like color, a creamy yellow, and a light lime green.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nice mini loofa (or several small loofas, for when one of them falls apart) for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>My opinion on poufs is, if it feels good, you&#x27;re not really sluffing off the dead skin!  </li>
            <li>At most, they feel a little rough on the first couple of uses, but then they relax and soften up.  </li>
            <li>In addition, just as others have said, it is very rough and although the loffah itself is a good size the handle is small; on others I;ve used I can put it on my wrist, but this one can&#x27;t get over my hand</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long it holds together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The texture is still fine, but the first one fell apart within less than a month!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try the others, but am not holding my breath that it will last much longer.  </li>
            <li>Essentially, this was just a filler item that allowed me to get what I really wanted for well over 1/2 the price.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the ones that are soft</li>
            <li>We are a family of four with a 9 year old boy and 10 year old boy.</li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they were going to be SOFT loofas (lufa?</li>
            <li>and now when I try the softer ones, I think they are too soft.</li>
            <li>These, as far as I can tell, are not.  </li>
            <li>thus why I purchased these and so far</li>
            <li>I actually think that these exfoliate my skin very well without hurting it.  </li>
            <li>They last for ever, which means I won&#x27;t be buying more for quite a few years to come.</li>
            <li>Not to soft, not to rough, just right.</li>
            <li>Similar poufs from local stores cost around a buck and last a few weeks at best, barely exfoliate, and are small.</li>
            <li>They seem to be much higher quality than what I find at my local stores for the same price.</li>
            <li>They feel rough on your skin at first</li>
            <li>I thought they were too rough at first too, but got used to it</li>
            <li>I suppose for not checking the size on these carefully, but they are pretty bulky</li>
            <li>Very high quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li>still feels like a new sponge after 8 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li>I have never used such a shoddy bath product before--even the crappy 99¢ guys from the drug store work better.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t rough by any means, but not super soft either which is good because it will help scrub away dead winter skin.</li>
            <li>There simply isn&#x27;t enough sponge to be useful and the material is not very absorbent.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my local store doesn&#x27;t carry these any more, but at least I can get a bulk price online.</li>
            <li>These also give off kind of a noticeable plastic smell which is kind of nasty.</li>
            <li>Some people may consider them rougher than usual, but that&#x27;s what I like about them because I feel totally clean after using an Ecopouf sponge.</li>
            <li>Most are thin, weak, better used for straining then scubbing.</li>
            <li>Unlike other reviewers, I actually wish they were MORE abrasive instead of less.</li>
            <li>These are very well made and last a long time before I feel the need t switch them out</li>
            <li>(hey, I&#x27;m not fixer-upper-- bare with me on the terminology hehe).</li>
            <li>I gave the pack to my mother who apparently likes the microdermabrasion</li>
            <li>I want to throw it away, but it seems weird to dispose of it after just a few uses--I bought it because it seemed more environmentally friendly, after all...</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re highly durable and last a long time.</li>
            <li>These do start out a little rough, but after a few showers they relax and are so amazing.</li>
            <li>It&amp;#34;s an ok product its seems a little too large to handle and a little harsh to the skin.</li>
            <li>The reason they lasted me so long is because I wash mine in the washer machine on gentle cyle and let them air dry.</li>
            <li>Some users listed this item as scratchy but I found them to be much softer than the typical dollar store ones I purchase.</li>
            <li>and it seems pretty sturdy; the texture is a bit rough but loofas are supposed to be rough</li>
            <li>but it does feel like it exfoliates my skin well every time and doesn&#x27;t get soft or loose with increased use.</li>
            <li>and I generally scrub myself pretty hard after a workout.</li>

            <li> These come in a nice 6pack and it nice for someone who can not get off Island!</li>
            <li> bath poufs go, these are exceptional.</li>
            <li> Great sponges, perfect size, and they keep their shape for a decent amount of time.  </li>
            <li> But we are very pleased with the quality and affordability of these bath sponges.</li>
            <li> I am in love, they hold up great too.</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> I love these bath sponges!</li>
            <li> can you imagine how many people have fumbled through those... who knows where their hands have been!</li>
            <li> Love these!</li>
            <li> Love these colors, too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Poufs before and nothing tops these!</li>
            <li> I LOVE these!  </li>
            <li> These were great and really cheap.  </li>
            <li> The bright colors do not run, these are hefty bath sponges and they work better than a loofa scrubby.  </li>
            <li> These are very stuff in the beginning, but they hold up great!</li>
            <li> Love and I can feel good that they are made of recycled material and are themselves recyclable.</li>
            <li> Lathers up nicely, extending soap life.</li>
            <li> I like the size and they make a nice lather.</li>
            <li> I kind of like it</li>
            <li> We really liked these.</li>
            <li> The abrasiveness is nice.  </li>
            <li> This is a good buy love the sponges.</li>
            <li> I also liked the hanging loop, it&#x27;s a sturdy material and has that bamboo-y EcoTools feel to it.</li>
            <li> Love everything about these sponges, perfect size, great economical buy and the texture is right on.</li>
            <li> I love the nice lather it gives off when I rub my bar soap onto it.</li>
            <li> they lather up so nicely :)</li>
            <li> Excellent Loofas, they are just the right texture and are just the right size.</li>
            <li> Also, it was very secure and never came apart like the flimsy sponges you find in stores.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have ordered these from Amazon three different times now and have been happy with every purchase!</li>
            <li> I will buy more soon :)</li>
            <li> Cant express how much I love these.</li>
            <li> Yes, they are that durable :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bath poufs for many years.  </li>
            <li> These are actually just the perfect combo.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re okay.  </li>
            <li> Much better than what you get a walmart and CVS for $2 a piece.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to be sure the quality held up.</li>
            <li> I knew the quality was much better than what I had been getting in stores.</li>
            <li> Bought these a year or more ago.  </li>
            <li> Love these a lot.</li>
            <li> I love that these are recycled as well.</li>
            <li> I like being able to order in bulk so as not to need to purchase as often.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy with the sponges!</li>
            <li> So glad I bought this pack.</li>
            <li> but it is ok after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> The bath and body works seems to have the most durable sponges.  </li>
            <li> It is the most substantial scrubbie I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> Enjoy!</li>
            <li> They work well, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy so many at a time again, just one at a time</li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Product is great and arrived fast</li>
            <li> More than I wanted to pay</li>
            <li> Ok, so I like these sponges, but here&#x27;s the thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better than the dollar one I bought at target.</li>
            <li> One of the better sponges I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> They seem more substantial than the ones you&#x27;d find in a grocery aisle.</li>
            <li> (For lack of a better descriptor...</li>
            <li> The ones they sell in the bins at the grocery store or Wal-Mart  are softer and work better for me.  </li>
            <li> I usually love everything I buy from Amazon--and I buy alot--</li>
            <li> LOVE the toughness/roughness of these.  </li>
            <li> The recycled poufs seemed like a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that these poufs are very stiff/rough.</li>
            <li> it hasn&#x27;t come unraveled like so many cheaper ones do too.</li>
            <li> I love that these are made out of recycled plastic.  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t get a better loofah.</li>
            <li> I love the fact they are made from recyclable sponges, so we are helping the environment.</li>
            <li> My mother-in-law and Aunt split the pack with me and they are also enjoying them.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that there were so many in one pack.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product and have loved it since the day I first use it in the shower.</li>
            <li> Good price and hold up pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Not as nice as the ones from The Body Shop, which I love, but these are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> Package arrived speedily and the loop fits perfectly around my shower-temperature-handle-thingee to hang dry</li>
            <li> Colors are nice, mature, and not obnoxiously bright.  </li>
            <li> These are not that rough, they are perfect.  </li>
            <li> They are exactly what I had been looking for, I love that they are recycled plastic!</li>
            <li> Lose shape very quickly.</li>
            <li> I got these because they were reviewed as being strong.</li>
            <li> All this for less than a couple of bucks per pouf - win!</li>
            <li> The cheap ones break apart so easily.</li>
            <li> These are great sponges if you don&#x27;t need something incredibly soft and want some mild exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Nice large size.</li>
            <li> The fact that they are recycled is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> Overall, these are great, and I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like being scratched all over, but it&#x27;s a comfortable scratch.</li>
            <li> Great quality and last without falling apart!</li>
            <li> and I think the roughness makes it feel like a light massage.</li>
            <li> As for the colors - I&#x27;m happy the colors are neutral enough to belong to a guy or a gal.</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy these sponges.</li>
            <li> I wanted something a bit course and cheap..</li>
            <li> cheap and gets the job done</li>
            <li> Such a shame because it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li> Even my daughter said they didn&#x27;t work as well as her cheap puff.</li>
            <li> The sponge is a good soft sponge, but I wish it had a longer hanging string.</li>
            <li> Plus, of course, I end up with a nice clean feeling, much cleaner than with a wash cloth.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find a puff made from recycled material.</li>
            <li> As advertized- mine didn&#x27;t have the hemp cords like my original or the photo-</li>
            <li> Never felt clean while using these.</li>
            <li> I loved these much more than any other pouf, loofah or sponge I have used.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love they get shipped together in a large plastic bag</li>
            <li> Nothing special, but no problems either.</li>
            <li> I am letting them air out in hopes the odor will fade, but right now would not want to use them on my body!</li>
            <li> Just right!</li>
            <li> I have been having a hard time finding these in the store, so I was very happy to find them on here.</li>
            <li> I love these sponges because they really are exfoliating.</li>
            <li> These bath sponges are thick, poufy and of excellent quality.</li>
            <li> Super durable and keep clean.</li>
            <li> They are that and are just course enough for a good scrub.</li>
            <li> These are full sized cleaning goodness.</li>
            <li> Not bad price,</li>
            <li> However, I have not had them fall apart as I&#x27;ve experienced with other shower</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly as pictured and the loofah is nice and firm for a good scrub.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come undone quickly and (supposedly) they&#x27;re earth-friendly.</li>
            <li> The string attached is sturdy enough to last and is perfect for hanging in the shower!</li>
            <li> Unless it dissipates quickly, I can&#x27;t see myself using these or ordering them again.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great that these are made of recycled plastic, I don&#x27;t see any reason to waste plastic (oil) on a different, non-recycled brand sponge when these are as good as they are.</li>
            <li> These are higher quality than the ones available at drug stores.</li>
            <li> They are a great deal and made from recycled materials, yet they feel like your typical lufa sponge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the first one for almost a year!</li>
            <li> Great Value but alittle bit to harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re economical like myself</li>
            <li> It feels remarkably soft and comfortable, but at the same time has good brisk scrubbing ability.</li>
            <li> but once you get to use them they get bigger, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It could have bee a bit smaller and softer so you can really get a good soapy mass on it.</li>
            <li> I just buy the six pack and have a couple year&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> So far these have seemed to hold up better than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> I go thru these pretty quickly (replace every 4-6 weeks),</li>
            <li> Unless you use one of these forever, which I&#x27;m probably not going to do, you might as well have thrown all the recyclable plastic products that were recycled to make these right into a landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> just the right amount of roughness, not like a pumice stone</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not super pleasant and now I&#x27;m stuck with 6.</li>
            <li> If, however, you are looking for something that you can actuall scrub and get clean with, this works very well to that end.  </li>
            <li> A bit more rough than the non-eco sponges, but that&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> Work great for real scrubbing, but a little aggressive for some areas.</li>
            <li> Apparently these aren&#x27;t popular where I live anymore</li>
            <li> Very handy when you go to take a shower and yours has worn out and you still have a big bag of these left to use.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it holds up long term, but so far it&#x27;s just as good as the nonrecycled ones sold in drug stores.</li>
            <li> They have a funny smell that does not go away, even after use</li>
            <li> Needed more bath sponges as my current one was falling apart.  </li>
            <li> but it is still holding up pretty well.</li>
            <li> These last much longer than regular poufs, and it is great that they are made from recycled plastic.</li>
            <li> Oh, and I like the size which is pretty big compared to most poufs.</li>
            <li> A lot higher quality</li>
            <li> and they are much higher quality than the cheapy ones I used to snag at the dollar stores.</li>
            <li> I think a looser, floppier and bigger bath sponge works better for me.</li>
            <li> I will be back here to order more when I am out</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing my dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, I got this and several other products for a great deal using my Kindle Special offers.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping these would be a little more comfortable</li>
            <li> Bigger than my hand and strong allowing higher pressure.</li>
            <li> Really liked that they were a bit denser than your average bath pouf.</li>
            <li> These are ok, actually kind of rough for the first few uses, but they do get better either way only giving them 3 probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> They are very strong compared to other brands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase especially because I won&#x27;t need to buy sponges for the next year.</li>
            <li> ribbon used for hanging them is very short and easily lost in the lather of a soapy pouf.</li>
            <li> Your skin must be super sensitive because these were not scratchy at all.  </li>
            <li> However, I had to speak up and say that I have been using my same bath pouf for over 8 months now and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> I like my sponges to be strong enough to exfoliate with.</li>
            <li> last forever (I am still using my first one after about 4 months, no sign of wear) and are a good combination of exfoliating without being too rough on the skin.</li>
            <li> These loofahs are delicate but don&#x27;t fall apart easily like many I have bought.  </li>
            <li> but once I took them out of the bag they were fine shortly after.</li>
            <li> Main brand versions fall apart, these do not!</li>
            <li> Nice loofas, but just a little scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Pay a little more and get a much better product that will last a much longer time.</li>
            <li> There is nothing environmentally responsible about making products that fall apart after a week, which these do.</li>
            <li> Would not have bothered me as much, had it been what was advertised.</li>
            <li> Otherwise I&#x27;d be calling Amazon or the manufacturer/makers to complain about a very sub-par product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are really well made.  </li>
            <li> The $1 Walmart loofahs fall apart after a week or two, but this one has lasted much longer than anticipated.</li>
            <li> Well, It works and works very well.</li>
            <li> Hey, this thing might be just recycled plastic, but it works real</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They wear very well.</li>
            <li> I have purchased Ecopouf Bath sponges in the store before and thought I was going to receive the same pouf that was available in the store.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hold the soapy suds very well.</li>
            <li> They hold up really well.</li>
            <li> The cheap 99c ones at your local WM are gentler on the skin</li>
            <li> I also really like the colors they came in.</li>
            <li> They lather very well.</li>
            <li> I bought one at Publix that was too big for me to hold comfortably</li>
            <li> that was much rougher.</li>
            <li> These also lather up really well.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it seemed like a reasonable price for an item that often seems to be overpriced.  </li>
            <li> High quality loofahs!</li>
            <li> like others have said, the thing fell apart very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and durable.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t like them as much as I</li>
            <li> Be aware that these are rougher than your normal bath sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That means that all they&#x27;re really doing is delaying the plastic that went into making them from going into the trash.  </li>
            <li> In fact, my upper arms aren&#x27;t bumpy anymore and just totally smooth.</li>
            <li> They were actually very scratchy and we ended up throwing some away.</li>
            <li> I am very tempted to stock up on these and incorporate them in birthday or Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> However, the soap doesn&#x27;t get sudsy on these sponges and they are very course on your skin.</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews that said these were very scratchy.  </li>
            <li> Theses sponges are the right balance of soft and exfoliating (not too scratchy)</li>
            <li> Unlike many other brands, they don&#x27;t start to become unwound after a month or two of use.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while one seems slightly rougher but most are a gentle scrub, almost silky.</li>
            <li> Very full, dense, and a bit rough.  </li>
            <li> I am sorry for those of you who have not had similar results, but I&#x27;m about to purchase this pack of 6 for stocking stuffers for my family members, and I&#x27;m crossing my fingers for more good results....</li>
            <li> Very ruff doesn&#x27;t soften up like normal ones do</li>
            <li> I love these - they exfoliate nice since they are a little bit scratchy mesh and last a long time.</li>
            <li> A little rough, but great colors and well made.</li>
            <li> They last long, are nice and thick, and have a nice sturdy strap.</li>
            <li> and they seem more sturdy than the ones I previously owned as well.</li>
            <li> I love that they come packaged, which means less hands on them.  </li>
            <li> And, they&#x27;re eco-friendly, which is the main reason I purchased these.</li>
            <li> Fall apart quickly and string is too short to be functional.</li>
            <li> Decent bath puffs.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the most sensitive skin in the world, but the texture of this sponge was too rough-</li>
            <li> These poofy bath sponges are large and full, well made, but have a very strange odor.  </li>
            <li> I have used high quality poofs for years from a particular store at the mall, and I was worried about deviating.  </li>
            <li> I initially was wanting the dual pouf (one side soft and the other more firm) for a really good scrub.</li>
            <li> Seem to be of high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly advise you to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not as soft as some of the cheap ones you can find in stores, so if you are looking for a very soft pouf keep looking.  </li>
            <li> These are surprisingly high quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or do they all reek to high heaven?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I got a bag of these for a little more than what I pay for 1 at the store.</li>
            <li> They are tough but I like a good scrub when I shower.&lt;br /&gt;Nice</li>
            <li> but they are pretty hard texture-wise compared to most others.  </li>
            <li> Worth the extra expense.  </li>
            <li> These loofahs are better than average (very dense) and last well.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t find them to be too scratchy as I remember other reviews noting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent sponge, but I just wish the string was a little longer so it could go easily around my wrist while I&#x27;m washing.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy these again when the time comes for new puffs.</li>
            <li> I use a new one about every six to eight weeks</li>
            <li> They come in a package of 6 which means you won&#x27;t have to keep going to the store every month to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like have to scrub too hard so a sponge that is already rough works great for me.</li>
            <li> Although these are much more expensive than other sponges, I sincerely believe they are worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I really really liked the teal and cornflower blue, the lime green</li>
            <li> There is no \\&quot;plastic smell\\&quot; that I can discern, and I am very sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li> The first \\&quot;pouf\\&quot; fell apart - the webbing material just started to unravel - in just the second use.  </li>
            <li> My experience is exactly the opposite.</li>
            <li> I got a fun assortment of colors- an orangesicle like color, a creamy yellow, and a light lime green.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice mini loofa (or several small loofas, for when one of them falls apart) for use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> My opinion on poufs is, if it feels good, you&#x27;re not really sluffing off the dead skin!  </li>
            <li> At most, they feel a little rough on the first couple of uses, but then they relax and soften up.  </li>
            <li> In addition, just as others have said, it is very rough and although the loffah itself is a good size the handle is small; on others I;ve used I can put it on my wrist, but this one can&#x27;t get over my hand</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long it holds together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The texture is still fine, but the first one fell apart within less than a month!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try the others, but am not holding my breath that it will last much longer.  </li>
            <li> Essentially, this was just a filler item that allowed me to get what I really wanted for well over 1/2 the price.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the ones that are soft</li>
            <li> We are a family of four with a 9 year old boy and 10 year old boy.</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were going to be SOFT loofas (lufa?</li>
            <li> and now when I try the softer ones, I think they are too soft.</li>
            <li> These, as far as I can tell, are not.  </li>
            <li> thus why I purchased these and so far</li>
            <li> I actually think that these exfoliate my skin very well without hurting it.  </li>
            <li> They last for ever, which means I won&#x27;t be buying more for quite a few years to come.</li>
            <li> Not to soft, not to rough, just right.</li>
            <li> Similar poufs from local stores cost around a buck and last a few weeks at best, barely exfoliate, and are small.</li>
            <li> They seem to be much higher quality than what I find at my local stores for the same price.</li>
            <li> They feel rough on your skin at first</li>
            <li> I thought they were too rough at first too, but got used to it</li>
            <li> I suppose for not checking the size on these carefully, but they are pretty bulky</li>
            <li> Very high quality for such a low price.</li>
            <li> still feels like a new sponge after 8 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> I have never used such a shoddy bath product before--even the crappy 99¢ guys from the drug store work better.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t rough by any means, but not super soft either which is good because it will help scrub away dead winter skin.</li>
            <li> There simply isn&#x27;t enough sponge to be useful and the material is not very absorbent.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my local store doesn&#x27;t carry these any more, but at least I can get a bulk price online.</li>
            <li> These also give off kind of a noticeable plastic smell which is kind of nasty.</li>
            <li> Some people may consider them rougher than usual, but that&#x27;s what I like about them because I feel totally clean after using an Ecopouf sponge.</li>
            <li> Most are thin, weak, better used for straining then scubbing.</li>
            <li> Unlike other reviewers, I actually wish they were MORE abrasive instead of less.</li>
            <li> These are very well made and last a long time before I feel the need t switch them out</li>
            <li> (hey, I&#x27;m not fixer-upper-- bare with me on the terminology hehe).</li>
            <li> I gave the pack to my mother who apparently likes the microdermabrasion</li>
            <li> I want to throw it away, but it seems weird to dispose of it after just a few uses--I bought it because it seemed more environmentally friendly, after all...</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re highly durable and last a long time.</li>
            <li> These do start out a little rough, but after a few showers they relax and are so amazing.</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s an ok product its seems a little too large to handle and a little harsh to the skin.</li>
            <li> The reason they lasted me so long is because I wash mine in the washer machine on gentle cyle and let them air dry.</li>
            <li> Some users listed this item as scratchy but I found them to be much softer than the typical dollar store ones I purchase.</li>
            <li> and it seems pretty sturdy; the texture is a bit rough but loofas are supposed to be rough</li>
            <li> but it does feel like it exfoliates my skin well every time and doesn&#x27;t get soft or loose with increased use.</li>
            <li> and I generally scrub myself pretty hard after a workout.</li>
            <li> Now it has a flat cloth-like wrap that isn&#x27;t the same as what&#x27;s in the pictures.</li>
            <li> Will see how long this next one last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a strange smell when you open them initially</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t hinder my bathing because I love the roominess of the previous rope design and how it stretched just a little after a few uses.</li>
            <li> It did have a bit of an odor to it upon first using, but that has since subsided dramatically and is hardly noticeable now.</li>
            <li> They have no odor, do not mold, and stay in the same shape for a long time.</li>
            <li> They last a long time.</li>
            <li> They last a long time and hold their shape.</li>
            <li> They are very fluffy and hold shower gel very well.</li>
            <li> Strange, as they&#x27;re constantly in use and always hung to dry, I have not experienced such quick degradation in a bath sponge before.</li>
            <li> Not very soft though.  </li>
            <li> I suppose as it goes on, I might have to go in and pull it tight again, but so far this seems to have done the trick.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always trying different ones because it&#x27;s hard to find just one particular brand.</li>
            <li> The one I bought at Wal-Mart, while cheaper, were also a little too soft.</li>
            <li> I have small hands and these are so huge I have a hard time holding them.  </li>
            <li> I just get it wet in the shower, then pour a little thick body wash into it at a few spots, squish the \\&quot;sponge\\&quot; a few time to distribute the body wash throughout and, viola, give myself a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li> These can be used for a long time, but this will of course depend on your preference.</li>
            <li> These were not soft as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying these as long as they make them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve left them out for a few days, rinsed them several times, soaped them thoroughly and left them to dry...</li>
            <li> I previously used natural sea sponges and do not find these to be particularly rough.</li>
            <li> When you first start using them, they&#x27;re very tight and a little scratchy.  </li>
            <li> sponge has unraveled barely a week and a half after getting it out of the package.  </li>
            <li> I bought these, even though they were a little more expensive than some others, because they were made with recycled plastic.  </li>
            <li> Other than that they are terrific.</li>
            <li> like the colors, though would have opted for all green instead of the blue tone poufs -- just a personal preference.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well, I never even used it for half as long as I had it and one of the sponges fell apart after only a couple weeks of use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a medium pouf, hard enough to feel like it is cleaning without ripping off your skin, and made to last longer than two washes before it falls apart - then look no further.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of mixed reviews for this product, which is an unfortunate indication that EcoTools is not making a consistent product.</li>
            <li> The material is not silky and they are not particularly dense.</li>
            <li> I think I bought almost $50.00 of products and only spent less than $11, including shipping.  </li>
            <li> For the second, I went in where the string holds all the mesh together, pulled it as tight as it would go and re-tied it.</li>
            <li> A little smaller and rougher than anticipated.  </li>
            <li> You can tell they are well made and will last a little longer then the walmart $1 ones.</li>
            <li> All that is left are dark spots where the bumps used to be!</li>
            <li> It takes a few uses before they start to soft up and lots of uses before they loosen up a little.  </li>
            <li> Not too soft, not too hard.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about these.</li>
            <li> As others have said--it&#x27;s too rough.  </li>
            <li> Per item description, I expected packaged multi-colored sponges.</li>
            <li> Obviously, not much time has passed so</li>
            <li> These sponges are way too rough.  </li>
            <li> What I expected.  </li>
            <li> but they were so rough....</li>
            <li> Somewhat rough</li>
            <li> but some people might find it too rough</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  </li>
            <li> I find them to be firm enough to hold/use but not at all rough/scratching - in</li>
            <li> Plus they seem extremely rough.</li>
            <li> I have the colors shown - brown, green, off-white - plus a purple and a blue.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re not as rough to me as some people are saying in their reviews, however, I like the roughness.</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s expected of any sponge.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because they seemed reasonable enough and, like an idiot, I fell into the trap of wanting to support companies that try to be environmentally responsible.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a reason other companies still use string, not a nylon tag.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for the past several weeks.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed unravelling as listed in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Had to go out to a store to purchase other..</li>
            <li> and they are very rough.</li>
            <li> VERY rough.</li>
            <li> and I agree with some of the other reviews that they are a little rough.</li>
            <li> The are a bit small, but I assume they will get a little larger as you use them.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a athletic guy with an average amount of body hair</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I bought them specifically because they are ecofriendly and they get sent in a non ecofriendly plastic bag.  </li>
            <li> They are nicer than the ones I buy at Target, and much less expensive when buying in a large pack like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought they would break down like my previous bath sponges</li>
            <li> They exfoliate extremely well and stay in tact rather than falling apart after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> They are woven very tightly, and don&#x27;t soften when they get wet.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty small hands and find it difficult to hold and wash with just one hand when I use this thing.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using one from my previous batch</li>
            <li> I ordered my previous batch a year and a half ago.</li>
            <li> They did have a slight plastic smell</li>
            <li> The ones that I received seem a bit less dense than the ones in the picture.</li>
            <li> BUT they are rougher than your typical mesh loofah.</li>
            <li> these do not lather well due to being extremely stiff plastic</li>
            <li> These are very rough, stiff and scratchy...</li>
            <li> Not ideal for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Just grinded my gears a little.</li>
            <li> These sponges are a little bit rougher than ones I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> While some people complained that these were a little rough, I like that.</li>
            <li> I like that they&#x27;re rougher than the typical bath sponge because I have Keratosis Pilaris on my arms, and after using this sponge followed by moisturizing with raw coconut oil</li>
            <li> They seem to be holding up well though, not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> of a \\&quot;green</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find it too harsh, as some reviewers stated.</li>
            <li> When I first handled it, I was very skeptical.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably buy them again to keep a few plastic bottles out of the landfill.</li>
            <li> They destroy loofahs.</li>
            <li> But after a few uses the smell starts to go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s recommended to switch your loofah every few months</li>
            <li> I had hoped after a few uses they would soften up, but did not.</li>
            <li> I have been using them for a few months now</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the point of using them is to get rid of dead skin.  </li>
            <li> Though usable, these are really stiff.  </li>
            <li> I like a stiff shower poof that keeps its form and exfoliates.</li>
            <li> I wish there were some other color options, but that&#x27;s not that serious of a problem.</li>
            <li> A bit scratchy in texture and very tightly wound into a puff.</li>
            <li> Thick and tight knot.</li>
            <li> They have held up well over the past month</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very short and difficult to hang.</li>
            <li> it is so small of an opening.  </li>
            <li> These smell TERRIBLE when you first open that package!</li>
            <li> They are also the most expensive :(</li>
            <li> Usually the string eventually comes apart or untied so the scubbie unravels.</li>
            <li> Mine usually fall apart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was excited to find these Ecopoufs because I prefer them for showering but have always hated adding to the plastic problems of the world.</li>
            <li> Poufs are usually around $2 a piece in the store at least.</li>
            <li> Some of the others I had before hardly held any of the soap so that I had to keep reapplying.</li>
            <li> and it hurts if you scrub hard.  </li>
            <li> At least I know this is coming from recycled material.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer a hanging ribbon at least twice the length of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the lanyard is too thin and small.</li>
            <li> Seriously, we were changing them once a month.</li>
            <li> Buying these in a bundle made them less expensive than those I bought at the grocery store or drug</li>
            <li> This is by far the easiest way for my kids to wash, but I always hate to throw away the puffs that are too worn to use, and just need to be thrown out.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also on the small side which, when combined with the fact that they&#x27;re very rough, make for a bad purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These sponges are way too rough on my skin and washing with them was very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying these one by one at Walmart and decided to buy in bulk.</li>
            <li> Just not soft :(</li>
            <li> These make me feel a lot less bad about using a plastic loofah in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the biggest issue with these BY FAR is the HORRIBLE stench!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen random brands.</li>
            <li> an uncomfortable sense.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I ended up with an unreasonably bad product.  </li>
            <li> It felt like a finer-grained version of those plastic thingies that you scrub dirty pots and pans with.</li>
            <li> The sponges have a bad odor.  </li>
            <li> This one was one of the bad ones, however.</li>
            <li> As sponges, they aren&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> I received them in a plastic bag and they had a bad oder.  </li>
            <li> review also applies to: [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Very disappointing</li>
            <li> have to have a bath pouf I hate washcloths</li>
            <li> I hate when loofahs unravel, so I appreciate that these stay together and are long-lasting</li>
            <li> These smell terrible!</li>
            <li> Absolutely dreadful.  </li>
            <li> Awful just awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great Value but alittle bit to harsh on the skin</li>
            <li> Nice loofas, but just a little scratchy.  I prefer the silkier ones to these.  They seem to be holding up well though, not cheaply made.</li>
            <li> There is not much to say about these. They are bath puffs made from recycled plastic. They have held up well over the past month or so we have been using them. Not to soft, not to rough, just right. I only give them 4 stars because the hanging cord could be a couple inches longer. I will probably buy these again when the time comes for new puffs.</li>
            <li> As others have said--it&#x27;s too rough.  What I also don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s so big!  I have pretty small hands and find it difficult to hold and wash with just one hand when I use this thing.  I want to throw it away, but it seems weird to dispose of it after just a few uses--I bought it because it seemed more environmentally friendly, after all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind of a \\&quot;green fail,\\&quot; in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they seemed reasonable enough and, like an idiot, I fell into the trap of wanting to support companies that try to be environmentally responsible. BIG. MISTAKE. There is nothing environmentally responsible about making products that fall apart after a week, which these do. I have never used such a shoddy bath product before--even the crappy 99¢ guys from the drug store work better. Unless you like throwing your money away (and ruining the environment at the same time by adding a bunch of plastic to landfill), find another product.</li>
            <li> Per item description, I expected packaged multi-colored sponges. Instead, I got 6 sponges, all the same color, not packaged or wrapped at all, just thrown in a box. Would not have bothered me as much, had it been what was advertised. Just grinded my gears a little.</li>
            <li> Seem to be of high quality. Some users listed this item as scratchy but I found them to be much softer than the typical dollar store ones I purchase.</li>
            <li> Although these are much more expensive than other sponges, I sincerely believe they are worth the money.  They exfoliate extremely well and stay in tact rather than falling apart after a few uses.  Some people have commented that they have a plastic smell, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the smell.  I have ordered these from Amazon three different times now and have been happy with every purchase!</li>
            <li> The sponge is a good soft sponge, but I wish it had a longer hanging string. It&#x27;s very short and difficult to hang.</li>
            <li> These mesh sponges are great. I bought them about a month ago and have been using the same one. Obviously, not much time has passed so I don&#x27;t know how it holds up long term, but so far it&#x27;s just as good as the nonrecycled ones sold in drug stores. I don&#x27;t find it too harsh, as some reviewers stated. And, they&#x27;re eco-friendly, which is the main reason I purchased these. Plus they were a great value.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and have loved it since the day I first use it in the shower. I love the nice lather it gives off when I rub my bar soap onto it. I also like the wonderful clean feeling I get after using it. I will buy more soon :)</li>
            <li> Cant express how much I love these. They are the perfect size and texture and hold up well. Would definitely recommend this loofa.</li>
            <li> These are very rough, stiff and scratchy... I guess maybe that is a plus if you are looking for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> These poofy bath sponges are large and full, well made, but have a very strange odor.  I am letting them air out in hopes the odor will fade, but right now would not want to use them on my body!</li>
            <li> Quite disppointed in this purchase.  I finally decided to try this after it was in my closet for a month.  Well, I never even used it for half as long as I had it and one of the sponges fell apart after only a couple weeks of use.  I&#x27;ll try the others, but am not holding my breath that it will last much longer.  In addition, just as others have said, it is very rough and although the loffah itself is a good size the handle is small; on others I;ve used I can put it on my wrist, but this one can&#x27;t get over my hand it is so small of an opening.  Luckily, I got this and several other products for a great deal using my Kindle Special offers.  I think I bought almost $50.00 of products and only spent less than $11, including shipping.  Essentially, this was just a filler item that allowed me to get what I really wanted for well over 1/2 the price.  Otherwise I&#x27;d be calling Amazon or the manufacturer/makers to complain about a very sub-par product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated October 7, 2011&lt;br /&gt;Another sponge has unraveled barely a week and a half after getting it out of the package.  Will see how long this next one last.</li>
            <li> Apparently these aren&#x27;t popular where I live anymore so I have to order them online now. I love these sponges because they really are exfoliating. Some people may consider them rougher than usual, but that&#x27;s what I like about them because I feel totally clean after using an Ecopouf sponge. One thing I&#x27;ll say though is this batch doesn&#x27;t have the rope that I&#x27;m used to. Now it has a flat cloth-like wrap that isn&#x27;t the same as what&#x27;s in the pictures. I&#x27;m still using one from my previous batch so I don&#x27;t yet know how I feel about this change. I hope it doesn&#x27;t hinder my bathing because I love the roominess of the previous rope design and how it stretched just a little after a few uses. Also, it was very secure and never came apart like the flimsy sponges you find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re economical like myself then these may be the sponges for you. They&#x27;re highly durable and last a long time. I ordered my previous batch a year and a half ago. The reason they lasted me so long is because I wash mine in the washer machine on gentle cyle and let them air dry. Yes, they are that durable :)</li>
            <li> A little smaller and rougher than anticipated.  Husband doesn&#x27;t seem to mind though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used bath poufs for many years.  I don&#x27;t like the ones that are soft, I might as well use a washcloth!  These are really well made.  Very full, dense, and a bit rough.  Just the way I like.  And they are from recycled plastic!  Who doesn&#x27;t like that?!  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seeing a lot of mixed reviews for this product, which is an unfortunate indication that EcoTools is not making a consistent product. However, I had to speak up and say that I have been using my same bath pouf for over 8 months now and it is still going strong. I&#x27;m a athletic guy with an average amount of body hair and I generally scrub myself pretty hard after a workout. The $1 Walmart loofahs fall apart after a week or two, but this one has lasted much longer than anticipated. I am sorry for those of you who have not had similar results, but I&#x27;m about to purchase this pack of 6 for stocking stuffers for my family members, and I&#x27;m crossing my fingers for more good results....</li>
            <li> These bath sponges are thick, poufy and of excellent quality. I previously used natural sea sponges and do not find these to be particularly rough. There is no \\&quot;plastic smell\\&quot; that I can discern, and I am very sensitive to scents. Overall, these are great, and I will repurchase.</li>
            <li> These are very stuff in the beginning, but they hold up great!</li>
            <li> I picked up an Ecotools recycled plastic bath sponge in the personal care section of my nearby grocery store. When I first handled it, I was very skeptical. It felt like a finer-grained version of those plastic thingies that you scrub dirty pots and pans with. How could this possibly work on your body? Well, It works and works very well. I just get it wet in the shower, then pour a little thick body wash into it at a few spots, squish the \\&quot;sponge\\&quot; a few time to distribute the body wash throughout and, viola, give myself a good scrubbing. It feels remarkably soft and comfortable, but at the same time has good brisk scrubbing ability. Plus, it feels good. It&#x27;s like being scratched all over, but it&#x27;s a comfortable scratch. When I&#x27;m done, my body almost feels a glow from the scrubbing. Plus, of course, I end up with a nice clean feeling, much cleaner than with a wash cloth. Hey, this thing might be just recycled plastic, but it works real well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Peterson</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve just started using these and I agree with some of the other reviews that they are a little rough. But that&#x27;s what I was looking for. I initially was wanting the dual pouf (one side soft and the other more firm) for a really good scrub. These are actually just the perfect combo. Not too soft, not too hard. Just right! We&#x27;ll see how long it holds together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The texture is still fine, but the first one fell apart within less than a month! For the second, I went in where the string holds all the mesh together, pulled it as tight as it would go and re-tied it. I suppose as it goes on, I might have to go in and pull it tight again, but so far this seems to have done the trick. Again, we&#x27;ll see...</li>
            <li> These do start out a little rough, but after a few showers they relax and are so amazing. I loved these much more than any other pouf, loofah or sponge I have used. They have no odor, do not mold, and stay in the same shape for a long time. Six poufs for a very good price! I use a new one about every six to eight weeks and it is still a really good deal!</li>
            <li> Good quality, exfoliates well.</li>
            <li> They are very strong compared to other brands. I recommend this product</li>
            <li> I bought these, even though they were a little more expensive than some others, because they were made with recycled plastic.  When you first start using them, they&#x27;re very tight and a little scratchy.  It takes a few uses before they start to soft up and lots of uses before they loosen up a little.  They&#x27;re okay.  I&#x27;d probably buy them again to keep a few plastic bottles out of the landfill.</li>
            <li> Poor quality. Fall apart quickly and string is too short to be functional.</li>
            <li> Great Seller and the product is good as well.</li>
            <li> These sponges are way too rough.  They are woven very tightly, and don&#x27;t soften when they get wet.  They would be great for scrubbing pans!</li>
            <li> I have small hands and these are so huge I have a hard time holding them.  I took off a start for the tie, I&#x27;m so use to having a longer tie.  This is so short practically non existing.</li>
            <li> This loofah must be recycled from aluminum cans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not review often but felt I had to on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me DO NOT get these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This review also applies to: [[ASIN:B0032A7M0Q EcoTools EcoPouf Bath Sponge 7408]]</li>
            <li> I love these - they exfoliate nice since they are a little bit scratchy mesh and last a long time.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t come undone quickly and (supposedly) they&#x27;re earth-friendly.</li>
            <li> These are the PERFECT size.  Last time I ordered some they were way too small, but these are exactly like the ones I buy at the retail store, and just a hair cheaper.  Good quality too.</li>
            <li> at first they&#x27;re small but once you get to use them they get bigger, which is nice.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Much better than what you get a walmart and CVS for $2 a piece.  Thick and tight knot.</li>
            <li> Super durable and keep clean. I&#x27;ve been using the first one for almost a year!</li>
            <li> These are a lot nicer than I thought they would be considering the low price.</li>
            <li> The colors are exactly as pictured and the loofah is nice and firm for a good scrub. These will last forever!Great purchase, will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve waited around 9 months to write this review. I wanted to be sure the quality held up. From the moment I pulled these out of the package I knew the quality was much better than what I had been getting in stores. We are a family of four with a 9 year old boy and 10 year old boy. They destroy loofahs. Seriously, we were changing them once a month. It was time to try something different. I hit up amazon and the rest is history. When/if I need to replace our loofah the Ecopouf will be the one that I get. I keep one at the Gym and two in the shower. We are currently on travel to Japan and it&#x27;s here with us. I&#x27;ll never buy a loofah in the store again. Thank you Ecotools.</li>
            <li> Love these! They are a great deal and made from recycled materials, yet they feel like your typical lufa sponge.</li>
            <li> Great sponges in cute colors! They are nicer than the ones I buy at Target, and much less expensive when buying in a large pack like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They last forever (I am still using my first one after about 4 months, no sign of wear) and are a good combination of exfoliating without being too rough on the skin. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> these do not lather well due to being extremely stiff plastic and they are very rough. so if you are looking for a deep exfoliation these are for you.</li>
            <li> I LOVE that these are made from recycled materials, I always felt guilty for using these sponges and throwing them away.  Good quality.</li>
            <li> These smell terrible!</li>
            <li> High-Quality.  I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
            <li> Great sponges, perfect size, and they keep their shape for a decent amount of time.  Will be re-ordering these once I&#x27;ve gone through them all.</li>
            <li> I love these bath sponges! Great quality and last without falling apart! they lather up so nicely :)</li>
            <li> Bought these a year or more ago.  Very handy when you go to take a shower and yours has worn out and you still have a big bag of these left to use.  They wear very well.</li>
            <li> VERY rough. Threw them away since I couldnt return them.</li>
            <li> I got tired of buying these one by one at Walmart and decided to buy in bulk. They last for ever, which means I won&#x27;t be buying more for quite a few years to come.</li>
            <li> They have a funny smell that does not go away, even after use</li>
            <li> I have purchased Ecopouf Bath sponges in the store before and thought I was going to receive the same pouf that was available in the store.  These arrived and are the smallest poufs I have ever purchased... smaller than the 99 cent ones in the grocery store.  Very disappointing and I will give them to goodwill.</li>
            <li> Buying these in a bundle made them less expensive than those I bought at the grocery store or drug store-- and they seem more sturdy than the ones I previously owned as well. Package arrived speedily and the loop fits perfectly around my shower-temperature-handle-thingee to hang dry (hey, I&#x27;m not fixer-upper-- bare with me on the terminology hehe).</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find a puff made from recycled material. This is by far the easiest way for my kids to wash, but I always hate to throw away the puffs that are too worn to use, and just need to be thrown out. At least I know this is coming from recycled material. Now to find out if I can recycle the used ones.</li>
            <li> These are quality poofs!  The are a bit small, but I assume they will get a little larger as you use them.  I have used high quality poofs for years from a particular store at the mall, and I was worried about deviating.  But we are very pleased with the quality and affordability of these bath sponges.</li>
            <li> These are great sponges if you don&#x27;t need something incredibly soft and want some mild exfoliation. The material is not silky and they are not particularly dense. Personally, I prefer this as I think it adds to the exfoliation and the durability. These can be used for a long time, but this will of course depend on your preference. Unlike many other brands, they don&#x27;t start to become unwound after a month or two of use. It&#x27;s also great that these are made of recycled plastic, I don&#x27;t see any reason to waste plastic (oil) on a different, non-recycled brand sponge when these are as good as they are.</li>
            <li> course texture.  lathers great.</li>
            <li> Good price.  What I expected.  Not very soft though.  Work great for real scrubbing, but a little aggressive for some areas.</li>
            <li> Needed more bath sponges as my current one was falling apart.  This was a great deal get 6 for a nice price.  They should last me a while.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  These are not that rough, they are perfect.  I love that they come packaged, which means less hands on them.  I won&#x27;t even think about buying one from the stores in the bins.... can you imagine how many people have fumbled through those... who knows where their hands have been!</li>
            <li> Works well. Good value. My only grievance is that I kept dropping the damn things on the floor of the shower room so they all eventually ended up in the garbage.</li>
            <li> The sponges have a bad odor.  I have washed and bleached them, but the odor remains. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Lose shape very quickly.</li>
            <li> It&amp;#34;s an ok product its seems a little too large to handle and a little harsh to the skin. It could have bee a bit smaller and softer so you can really get a good soapy mass on it. It doesn&#x27;t hold the soapy suds very well. sooooo what can I say. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again</li>
            <li> 2nd time I&#x27;ve bought these. Love and I can feel good that they are made of recycled material and are themselves recyclable. Don&#x27;t love they get shipped together in a large plastic bag</li>
            <li> Perfect size! Bigger than my hand and strong allowing higher pressure. Lathers up nicely, extending soap life. Not too rough nor too soft.</li>
            <li> Love these a lot. Used to sell them at our local grocer but don&#x27;t carry any longer. I liked the bulk option though !</li>
            <li> Good product for the cost. Just like the ones I buy at CVS but cheaper.</li>
            <li> These smell TERRIBLE when you first open that package! But after a few uses the smell starts to go away. I like the size and they make a nice lather. I also like that they are made from recycled materials. Despite the smell, will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. They hold up really well.</li>
            <li> Love these! I bought these for my fiance and I to use. They aren&#x27;t rough by any means, but not super soft either which is good because it will help scrub away dead winter skin. They did have a slight plastic smell but once I took them out of the bag they were fine shortly after. You can&#x27;t beat the price. Poufs are usually around $2 a piece in the store at least. I love that these are recycled as well. A+</li>
            <li> I bought these thinking they were going to be SOFT loofas (lufa? Loufa? Loopha?) but they were so rough....me NO like. I gave the pack to my mother who apparently likes the microdermabrasion feel everytime she bathes....I won&#x27;t be purchasing these again for myself. Just not soft :(</li>
            <li> Great value. good quality.I would recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> Item is as described and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> These lather well and exfoliate well also!</li>
            <li> Always love EcoTools they are the best</li>
            <li> These loofahs are better than average (very dense) and last well. I like being able to order in bulk so as not to need to purchase as often.</li>
            <li> A little rough, but great colors and well made. Main brand versions fall apart, these do not!</li>
            <li> Great price for a great product! This was perfect since I like to change out my Luffas every 3-4 weeks. The string attached is sturdy enough to last and is perfect for hanging in the shower!</li>
            <li> Absolutely dreadful.  These things feel like sandpaper when washing myself and despite trying two different brands of soap that I can always get a lot of lather with when using cheaper sponges, these do not perform.  I highly advise you to look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> I was hoping these would be a little more comfortable but they are pretty hard texture-wise compared to most others.  The cheap 99c ones at your local WM are gentler on the skin so I will be going back to using those instead.  These also give off kind of a noticeable plastic smell which is kind of nasty.</li>
            <li> Great product and a great price! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> Decent bath puffs. Not as nice as the ones from The Body Shop, which I love, but these are definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> These are very well made and last a long time before I feel the need t switch them out They are very fluffy and hold shower gel very well. I also really like the colors they came in.</li>
            <li> Love these sponges. I got a fun assortment of colors- an orangesicle like color, a creamy yellow, and a light lime green. The sponges are the perfect size, and they have a great texture. They lather very well. Overall I am very happy with the sponges! So glad I bought this pack.</li>
            <li> There simply isn&#x27;t enough sponge to be useful and the material is not very absorbent. The ones that I received seem a bit less dense than the ones in the picture. They&#x27;re also on the small side which, when combined with the fact that they&#x27;re very rough, make for a bad purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used mine once and went looking for something else.</li>
            <li> Though usable, these are really stiff.  Not bad price,</li>
            <li> While some people complained that these were a little rough, I like that. I like my sponges to be strong enough to exfoliate with. The one I bought at Wal-Mart, while cheaper, were also a little too soft. I bought one at Publix that was too big for me to hold comfortably that was much rougher. I don&#x27;t like have to scrub too hard so a sponge that is already rough works great for me. These are also the perfect size. I&#x27;m a petite woman. I bought them because they were recycled. These also lather up really well. Some of the others I had before hardly held any of the soap so that I had to keep reapplying. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase especially because I won&#x27;t need to buy sponges for the next year.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because it seemed like a reasonable price for an item that often seems to be overpriced.  Unfortunately, I ended up with an unreasonably bad product.  The first \\&quot;pouf\\&quot; fell apart - the webbing material just started to unravel - in just the second use.  The next \\&quot;pouf\\&quot; made it through three showers.  I definitely would NOT recommend this product because it simply does not last.  Pay a little more and get a much better product that will last a much longer time.</li>
            <li> They feel rough on your skin at first but it is ok after a couple of uses. I thought they would break down like my previous bath sponges but it is still holding up pretty well. If you only need one, maybe you should just go to the store to buy it individually. The quality is good though!</li>
            <li> the lanyard is too thin and small. there&#x27;s a reason other companies still use string, not a nylon tag.</li>
            <li> Somewhat rough and it hurts if you scrub hard.  I kind of like it but some people might find it too rough</li>
            <li> I like a stiff shower poof that keeps its form and exfoliates. These have been awesome!</li>
            <li> Love everything about these sponges, perfect size, great economical buy and the texture is right on. Theses sponges are the right balance of soft and exfoliating (not too scratchy)</li>
            <li> These last much longer than regular poufs, and it is great that they are made from recycled plastic.</li>
            <li> These sponges are a little bit rougher than ones I&#x27;ve bought elsewhere, but you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Just as expected.  Nice large size. I go thru these pretty quickly (replace every 4-6 weeks), so am happy not to have to pay grocery store prices.  Love these colors, too!</li>
            <li> I thought they were too rough at first too, but got used to it and now when I try the softer ones, I think they are too soft. I like the extra exfoliation that comes from using these rougher sponges and I think the roughness makes it feel like a light massage.</li>
            <li> High quality loofahs! It&#x27;s recommended to switch your loofah every few months and I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase -- would buy again.</li>
            <li> These loofahs are delicate but don&#x27;t fall apart easily like many I have bought.  The fact that they are recycled is a huge plus.  And for 6 of these the cost is cheaper than I would find in stores.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have the most sensitive skin in the world, but the texture of this sponge was too rough- felt like I was bathing with a brillo pad.&lt;br /&gt;And like others have said, the thing fell apart very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have to have a bath pouf I hate washcloths and I&#x27;m always trying different ones because it&#x27;s hard to find just one particular brand. This one was one of the bad ones, however. The bath and body works seems to have the most durable sponges.  They are also the most expensive :(</li>
            <li> This is the king of &amp;#34;scubbies&amp;#34; as I call these poufs. It is the most substantial scrubbie I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;ve tried about a dozen random brands. Most are thin, weak, better used for straining then scubbing. I&#x27;ve been using the Ecopouf for about three or four years, since I discovered it. Every once in a while one seems slightly rougher but most are a gentle scrub, almost silky. They hold soap and lather up beautifully. They last a long time. Usually the string eventually comes apart or untied so the scubbie unravels. I just buy the six pack and have a couple year&#x27;s worth. Oh, and I like the size which is pretty big compared to most poufs. I recommend this as the best one out, the king of scrubbies. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> A lot higher quality then I thought it would be. This 6 pack should last me a lifetime.</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re bigger than I thought they&#x27;d be, but that&#x27;s neither here nor there</li>
            <li> Good &amp;#34;poufs&amp;#34;. I like they are recycled. So far these have seemed to hold up better than the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> A bit more rough than the non-eco sponges, but that&#x27;s fine. They work well, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy so many at a time again, just one at a time</li>
            <li> We really liked these. Very sturdy and durable. You can tell they are well made and will last a little longer then the walmart $1 ones.</li>
            <li> Well-made, abrasive (but not overly), and the perfect size - that is what I look for in a pouf or loofah. Thankfully, EcoTools has figured this out and made pouf that not only meets the above requirements, but also utilizes recycled plastics in the process. All this for less than a couple of bucks per pouf - win! Similar poufs from local stores cost around a buck and last a few weeks at best, barely exfoliate, and are small. No thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you&#x27;re looking for a medium pouf, hard enough to feel like it is cleaning without ripping off your skin, and made to last longer than two washes before it falls apart - then look no further. The EcoTools Ecopouf is what you&#x27;re looking for. As for the colors - I&#x27;m happy the colors are neutral enough to belong to a guy or a gal.</li>
            <li> Love these for the price and the thoroughly good exfoliation!</li>
            <li> I hate when loofahs unravel, so I appreciate that these stay together and are long-lasting BUT they are rougher than your typical mesh loofah. It&#x27;s not super pleasant and now I&#x27;m stuck with 6. Not ideal for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using one of these for the past several weeks.  It is definitely not as soft as some of the cheap ones you can find in stores, so if you are looking for a very soft pouf keep looking.  If, however, you are looking for something that you can actuall scrub and get clean with, this works very well to that end.  It did have a bit of an odor to it upon first using, but that has since subsided dramatically and is hardly noticeable now.</li>
            <li> These were great and really cheap.  I got a bag of these for a little more than what I pay for 1 at the store.</li>
            <li> Very ruff doesn&#x27;t soften up like normal ones do</li>
            <li> As advertized- mine didn&#x27;t have the hemp cords like my original or the photo- but they worked just the same</li>
            <li> Excellent product, thx.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many Poufs before and nothing tops these! The only problem is keeping your husband away from them. Great Buy.</li>
            <li> These are quality lufas. They last long, are nice and thick, and have a nice sturdy strap. The abrasiveness is nice.  What more could you want?</li>
            <li> Product is great and arrived fast</li>
            <li> I wanted a nice mini loofa (or several small loofas, for when one of them falls apart) for use in the shower.  It is my fault I suppose for not checking the size on these carefully, but they are pretty bulky and I don&#x27;t like them as much as I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so and it seems pretty sturdy; the texture is a bit rough but loofas are supposed to be rough so you can scrub yourself with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a good product, but not the size I wanted.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a party favor. They were a hit!</li>
            <li> Good price and hold up pretty well.  I buy these regularly.</li>
            <li> These make me feel a lot less bad about using a plastic loofah in the shower. Unfortunately my local store doesn&#x27;t carry these any more, but at least I can get a bulk price online. I wish there were some other color options, but that&#x27;s not that serious of a problem.</li>
            <li> Sponges are sturdy and do their job. They seem to be much higher quality than what I find at my local stores for the same price.</li>
            <li> These are ok, actually kind of rough for the first few uses, but they do get better either way only giving them 3 probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> These come in a nice 6pack and it nice for someone who can not get off Island! More than I wanted to pay but Island people can&#x27;t be picky!</li>
            <li> These are an alright bath sponge. Unlike other reviewers, I actually wish they were MORE abrasive instead of less. Be aware that these are rougher than your normal bath sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a strange smell when you open them initially but I found that it dissipated rather quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally only get a month to two months out of these bath sponges before the string begins to molder. Strange, as they&#x27;re constantly in use and always hung to dry, I have not experienced such quick degradation in a bath sponge before. However, I have not had them fall apart as I&#x27;ve experienced with other shower poofs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once they molder I use them as pet scrubbers.</li>
            <li> This is a good buy love the sponges. They are tough but I like a good scrub when I shower.&lt;br /&gt;Nice value. More expensive if bought individually at local store</li>
            <li> Ok, so I like these sponges, but here&#x27;s the thing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recycling only works if the products being made from recycled material are, they themselves, recyclable.  These, as far as I can tell, are not.  That means that all they&#x27;re really doing is delaying the plastic that went into making them from going into the trash.  Unless you use one of these forever, which I&#x27;m probably not going to do, you might as well have thrown all the recyclable plastic products that were recycled to make these right into a landfill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These sponges don&#x27;t seem to have (and I took one apart to check) any recycle number on them.  For my township and, I presume, every township, that means they simply aren&#x27;t recyclable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you like them, go ahead and buy them.  As sponges, they aren&#x27;t bad.  But don&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;re helping the environment.</li>
            <li> These do what they say they will!  I haven&#x27;t noticed unravelling as listed in other reviews.</li>
            <li> Great loofahs!! Durable and the perfect size.</li>
            <li> I am a guy and stole a couple of these from my wife.  Twice a week I use body wash instead of a bar of soap.  I do this to scrub dead skin away and like the fact that these are made well enough that I can really scrub without the sponge falling apart.  Does a good job of removing my dead skin.  Much better than the dollar one I bought at target.</li>
            <li> I have been having a hard time finding these in the store, so I was very happy to find them on here. They are exactly what I had been looking for, I love that they are recycled plastic!</li>
            <li> These were at the ideal size and roughness for me, and I appreciate their eco-friendly aspect and bundle price. Fortunately, I didn&#x27;t find them to be too scratchy as I remember other reviews noting.</li>
            <li> Been using for over 3 months, and it still has kept its shape. One of the better sponges I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Great value. Really liked that they were a bit denser than your average bath pouf. They seem more substantial than the ones you&#x27;d find in a grocery aisle. I also liked the hanging loop, it&#x27;s a sturdy material and has that bamboo-y EcoTools feel to it. (For lack of a better descriptor...)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish I could order each color separately, though. I really really liked the teal and cornflower blue, the lime green not so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As bath poufs go, these are exceptional. I&#x27;ll order them again.</li>
            <li> Great sponges. These are higher quality than the ones available at drug stores. The colors are nicer too. I like that they&#x27;re rougher than the typical bath sponge because I have Keratosis Pilaris on my arms, and after using this sponge followed by moisturizing with raw coconut oil, it&#x27;s really starting to go away. In fact, my upper arms aren&#x27;t bumpy anymore and just totally smooth. All that is left are dark spots where the bumps used to be!</li>
            <li> I thoroughly enjoy these sponges. I feel they are a nice size and have great quality.</li>
            <li> Again, not a life changing item...I wanted something a bit course and cheap..thus why I purchased these and so far so good!  No complaints...cheap and gets the job done</li>
            <li> These were not soft as I had hoped. They were actually very scratchy and we ended up throwing some away. I had hoped after a few uses they would soften up, but did not.</li>
            <li> These are great poofs.  I have been using them for a few months now and they hold up well.  My only complaint is that I bought them specifically because they are ecofriendly and they get sent in a non ecofriendly plastic bag.  Thought that seemed counterproductive.  Other than that they are terrific.</li>
            <li> These sponges are way too rough on my skin and washing with them was very uncomfortable.  The ones they sell in the bins at the grocery store or Wal-Mart  are softer and work better for me.  I usually love everything I buy from Amazon--and I buy alot-- but this item did not work for me....I will just throw the rest out since I have passed the return window.</li>
            <li> Ok. Nothing special, but no problems either.</li>
            <li> I got these because they were reviewed as being strong. They are that and are just course enough for a good scrub.</li>
            <li> These are surprisingly high quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have one for each of us in the fam and they are much higher quality than the cheapy ones I used to snag at the dollar stores. I am very tempted to stock up on these and incorporate them in birthday or Christmas gifts.</li>
            <li> These are AWESOME. Very high quality for such a low price. They last a long time and hold their shape.</li>
            <li> Excellent Loofas, they are just the right texture and are just the right size.</li>
            <li> A bit scratchy in texture and very tightly wound into a puff. Does not hold the suds and I had to keep adding bath gel. I think a looser, floppier and bigger bath sponge works better for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent sponge, but I just wish the string was a little longer so it could go easily around my wrist while I&#x27;m washing.</li>
            <li> Worth the extra expense.  The cheap ones break apart so easily.</li>
            <li> good price and seem to be durable (not separating, staying bunched up)</li>
            <li> LOVE the toughness/roughness of these.  Actually feels like you&#x27;re cleaning something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are also NOT the baby sized ones like the $1 walmart specials.  These are full sized cleaning goodness.</li>
            <li> Awful just awful. Doesn&#x27;t lather up soap. Had to go out to a store to purchase other.. Will let guest use these. I will not.</li>
            <li> Update: After about two weeks of soaking in soapy water, drying thoroughly and repeating, these things have finally given up their noxious smell. Did I just get a bad/tainted batch?? Or do they all reek to high heaven?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to find these Ecopoufs because I prefer them for showering but have always hated adding to the plastic problems of the world. The recycled poufs seemed like a great solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have said that these poufs are very stiff/rough. My experience is exactly the opposite. I find them to be firm enough to hold/use but not at all rough/scratching - in an uncomfortable sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the colors, though would have opted for all green instead of the blue tone poufs -- just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ribbon used for hanging them is very short and easily lost in the lather of a soapy pouf. I&#x27;d prefer a hanging ribbon at least twice the length of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the biggest issue with these BY FAR is the HORRIBLE stench!! They smell like a petrochemical spill. It&#x27;s a horrible, rancid odor. Imagine an oily garage floor combined with a rotting carcass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve left them out for a few days, rinsed them several times, soaped them thoroughly and left them to dry... but that smell isn&#x27;t going away. It&#x27;s really horrible. Unless it dissipates quickly, I can&#x27;t see myself using these or ordering them again.  Such a shame because it&#x27;s a great idea.</li>
            <li> Never felt clean while using these. Even my daughter said they didn&#x27;t work as well as her cheap puff. So we decided to donate the rest of them. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> affordable, but they feel just a bit low quality. They just dont scrub quite perfectly so I will give this a four</li>
            <li> The bright colors do not run, these are hefty bath sponges and they work better than a loofa scrubby.  The fact that they are Eco-friendly is a plus.</li>
            <li> These are scratchy, which is what I was looking for.  My opinion on poufs is, if it feels good, you&#x27;re not really sluffing off the dead skin!  I LOVE these!  Been using 1 for several months now and it hasn&#x27;t come unraveled like so many cheaper ones do too.</li>
            <li> I received them in a plastic bag and they had a bad oder.  I let them air out,  but is still there.  Plus they seem extremely rough.</li>
            <li> I love that these are made out of recycled plastic.  The texture is the same as you would expect with a standard bath pouff. Colors are nice, mature, and not obnoxiously bright.  I have the colors shown - brown, green, off-white - plus a purple and a blue.  I do not know if this is the standard mix of colors you receive because I have only ordered once and this order will last me a while.  I will be back here to order more when I am out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
            <li> just the right amount of roughness, not like a pumice stone but it does feel like it exfoliates my skin well every time and doesn&#x27;t get soft or loose with increased use. still feels like a new sponge after 8 weeks of daily use.</li>
            <li> Best loofa I have ever had! Great quality. Mine usually fall apart. No issues yet!</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were eco &amp; I like to use recycled products when I can. However, the soap doesn&#x27;t get sudsy on these sponges and they are very course on your skin. I wouldn&#x27;t buy them again.</li>
            <li> These sponges are great.  They&#x27;re not as rough to me as some people are saying in their reviews, however, I like the roughness. That&#x27;s the point of using them is to get rid of dead skin.  They come in a package of 6 which means you won&#x27;t have to keep going to the store every month to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t get a better loofah. I love the fact they are made from recyclable sponges, so we are helping the environment. The colors are very bright.</li>
            <li> These are the perfect texture for exfoliating. I am in love, they hold up great too. My mother-in-law and Aunt split the pack with me and they are also enjoying them. They almost last forever. I will keep buying these as long as they make them.</li>
            <li> I saw some reviews that said these were very scratchy.  Your skin must be super sensitive because these were not scratchy at all.  At most, they feel a little rough on the first couple of uses, but then they relax and soften up.  I think that&#x27;s expected of any sponge.  I actually think that these exfoliate my skin very well without hurting it.  They are also the perfect size.  I like the fact that there were so many in one pack.  Good value for the price.  I would definitely buy these again when we run out of them.</li>
