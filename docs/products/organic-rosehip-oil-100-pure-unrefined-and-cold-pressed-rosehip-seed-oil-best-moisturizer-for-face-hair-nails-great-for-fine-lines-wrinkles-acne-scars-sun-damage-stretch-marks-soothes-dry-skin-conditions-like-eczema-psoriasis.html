            <li>This product is just totally amazing.</li>
            <li>No exaggeration, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing product.</li>
            <li>After emailing Andy and receiving a lot of reassuring information, I&#x27;m more confident about the legitimacy of this product and am really happy with TO&#x27;s willingness to communicate with customers.</li>
            <li>It has a nice light and non greasy texture that feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li>Even if I don&#x27;t see fewer wrinkles, there is no way for rose hip oil to be anything but beneficial.</li>
            <li>i would recommend rubbing warm on scalp and then using a boarbristle brush to move from root to ends of hair.</li>
            <li>It absorbs rather nicely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to make a face cream, and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li>I was offered this product to try out in lieu of my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this oil on my scalp and it seems to work well; it washes off nicely too.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loving this product.</li>
            <li>kind emails and information on their product.</li>
            <li>I use this every night after washing with St. Ives apricot scrub and using the rose water toner.</li>
            <li>also its darker than I anticipated (kind of looks like iodine).  </li>
            <li>I have never used rose hip oil before.  </li>
            <li>It is organic so the smell is not like a rose, so I put a drop of lavender oil with it for added skin conditioning and smell.</li>
            <li>I also noticed that rose hip oil (perhaps from all the vitamin C?)</li>
            <li>Been using this Rose hip oil for about a week.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I&#x27;m impressed with the results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving this product.  </li>
            <li>The correspondence from the Teddie company is awesome ,,, felt like someone was there helping me the whole time.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that my skin looks really good and healthy???</li>
            <li>It absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li>I looove teddie organics rose water spray.</li>
            <li>I spray the rose water on my face then a couple drops of rose oil</li>
            <li>Really love the product and loved that they care about their customers.</li>
            <li>Very good!  High quality!</li>
            <li>A nice addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>This is a nice oil that absorbs well.</li>
            <li>Discount for my honest Nd unbiSed review.</li>
            <li>The sellers are very courteous and follow-up to make sure everything has arrived and is okay.</li>
            <li>My skin breaks out very easily with any kind of oil like argan, coconut, jojoba, etc.</li>
            <li>I am a very natural wearing makeup person so this kind of product suited me best!</li>
            <li>I am using it on an outbreak of rosacea with great success.  </li>
            <li>I read so many amazing things about rosehip oil and was dying to try it</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying my rose hip</li>
            <li>no matter what issue you may be having, if you try the Rosehip Oil, they are sure to be gone in no time at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received product(s)  in exchange for an honest review, which may differ from yours.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin and light too</li>
            <li>It is the best organic Rosehip Oil I bought, so far.     </li>
            <li>and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin with just a perfect natural &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>This seemed to help those oils penetrate deeper and to be more effective with reducing her scarring and helping her tender skin to heal.</li>
            <li>I am so happy I found this company because their oil smells nutty and earthy and undeniably fresh to me.  </li>
            <li>Well, now that I have been using this rose hip seed oil under my make up, it leaves me skin looking silky, even after I put powder on top.</li>
            <li>Rosehip oil is one of the best skin products available and Teddie provides exactly what Im looking for in my rosehip oil:</li>
            <li>This oil feels great when applied and goes right into my face, neck and décolleté.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s great reviews and the right price point.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and the price is right.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;it is very good results, in a few weeks I have seen very good results&lt;</li>
            <li>Smells great, goes on smoothly, and makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li>Growing up in Germany I used to drink Rosehip tea and loved it a lot, knowing it is rich in Vitamin C and many others.</li>
            <li>As someone who has a history of acne and generally irritated skin, this is the best looking my skin has been since childhood.</li>
            <li>My nails feel super strong, and look great.</li>
            <li>Fine product, indeed!</li>
            <li>Very light weight oil that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.</li>
            <li>I try to use it twice a day (along with Vit. C serum and a very light application of Argan oil).  </li>
            <li>Very smooth, silky, and odorless.</li>
            <li>It´s a very light oil, I love to use it</li>
            <li>I noticed significant improvement within two applications!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure that rosehip oil is a keeper for us, and I&#x27;m very pleased with Teddie Organics.</li>
            <li>Since I have tried most of them without the results that I wanted and never heard of rosehip oit, I decided to try on this organic rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil and will not change a thing on it.  </li>
            <li>I love this oil.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this oil.</li>

            <li>am really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li>Having stopped using rosehip oil for many months, I found this brand.</li>
            <li>It bothers me more than it bothers him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased so many products that have shown some results</li>
            <li>At this point I&#x27;ve given it 4 stars because he&#x27;s using it and it appears to be working better than anything we&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Overall I’m very happy with this oil!</li>

            <li>The company even contacted me to provide more information on it&#x27;s uses.</li>
            <li>I love the way my skin looks after I apply it</li>
            <li>i have added coconut oil to this product for a greater effect.</li>
            <li>I love all</li>
            <li>Love love love the rosehip oil, did not break me out at all</li>
            <li>Love this product and company</li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>However, it is very rich and moisturizing  for night.</li>
            <li>It has a rich, amber color and it smells kind of nutty..</li>
            <li>I order many items from amazon and this is the first time that a company contacted me before I received the product (to make sure that I received it in good condition) and they answer any questions that I have, immediately.  </li>
            <li>So far so good!  </li>
            <li>wonderful product, is working nicely on my dry skin:).  </li>
            <li>Leaves it dewy soft, glowing, beautiful.  </li>
            <li>well maybe kind of sweet oil like smell.</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The color is amber, and the smell is not so pleasant.</li>
            <li>The owners are amazing as well, quick to respond to any product questions.</li>
            <li>Several people spontaneously told me how great my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>Instantly absorbs, odor free, perfect food for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Put it on a clean face before bed &amp; wake up glowing!</li>
            <li>I have used other brands and am most impressed with this one.</li>
            <li>Although this is my first time using Rosehip Oil, I would highly recommend this brand because of the great results and the very friendly owners who went above and beyond to make sure it made it on time and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>The reason for the four starts is the intense bright orange color of the oil.</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>Most important, it does not clog or irritate my fussy skin.</li>
            <li>Great oil, not greasy, leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li>but I could never get him to buy more because he&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li>This is a great product - it makes my skin feel soft and nourished.</li>
            <li>The sellers were really sweet and followed up to make sure I was 100% satisfied with the product</li>
            <li>Beautiful amber colored oil with a light, natural smell akin to apricots.</li>
            <li>Product arrived as promised in good shape and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and bottle arrived in good care.</li>
            <li>Great product - - thanks so much!!</li>
            <li>Compared to all other oils I have used on my face, this oil has the best feel.</li>
            <li>After all, I want more than just clean and toned skin.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many similar but never received the great outcome like I have with this.</li>
            <li>I was easy to apply and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li>The rosehips seed oil arrived very quickly and was as promised.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, they have a great product with excellent follow up/customer care.  </li>
            <li>Goes on easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave you with an oily residue.</li>
            <li>this makes application easy.  </li>
            <li>The oil soaks in very quickly and there isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research into clean vegan products and found Teddie Organics. :)</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs really quickly, easy to use under makeup and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how strong my nails felt after the 1st time I put the rosehip oil on them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty amazing what it does on my skin; absorbs easily, and moisturizes.</li>
            <li>the smell is very pleasant as i expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually had people tell me how beautiful my skin is looking</li>
            <li>I will most definitely continue using (and loving!).</li>
            <li>Rosehip Oil helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not an avid user of skin products, but this oil really makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>Slight smell as others have said but the product works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping in time, it will help with the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li>and hopefully it will help prevent fine lines and wrinkles over time.</li>

            <li>Will be ordering more, quick shipping</li>
            <li>What an amazing oil, so many uses and naturally made from the earth, so often we spend a fortune on products that contain chemicals that disturb our immune system, everything we put onto our skin absorbs into the blood stream!</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and softens my fine lines.  </li>
            <li>I just got into essential oils and I am so glad I got this one, love it! :)</li>
            <li>Organic and natural no chemicals perfect for sensitive skin like mine...</li>

            <li>Teddie Organics has stellar customer service!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other rosehip oil on my face, but the customer service from Teddie is incredible.</li>
            <li>This product is fabulous, it is very smooth and has a very pleasant subtle smell that doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>love teddie organics making the oil so pure !</li>
            <li>and I love the dropper top which makes it easy and not messy to use.  </li>
            <li>(If you have a tendency to have super oily skin easily I would use it just at night time.)</li>
            <li>This oil is high quality and effective.</li>
            <li>Overall, super happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I was aware of the color when I ordered the oil but thought it would be absorbed better and more quickly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this oil to see how my skin would react to moisturizing oils instead of creams and lotions, and am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li>I was so amazed and so excited to try it out for myself!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Love the product, shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Worth buying!</li>
            <li>(My boyfriend jokingly tells me I smell like sexy hot tea</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li>I received wonderful service from this small mom and pop company.</li>
            <li>Love this product so much!</li>
            <li>In my 30&#x27;s my skin is in the best condition of my life due to using rose hips oil daily.</li>
            <li>Just FYI I have found that mixing one drop of this product with a regular amount of original ponds moisturizer has been more effective for me than just the product alone.</li>
            <li>I have tried many different rose hips oil on the market</li>
            <li>So far, I find this to be an excellent essential oil...have been using it as part of my skin care moisturizing</li>
            <li>I have only used the oil for a week but am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li>It is great to use for dry skin.</li>
            <li>UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the product for a year now (ordered 3 bottles in total) and I&#x27;ve absolutely loved it until now.</li>
            <li>I mix this with a bit of Vitamin E oil after a good facial wash.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice product, and it makes my skin silky soft, and  has not caused any breakouts for me.  </li>
            <li>I know there have been some comments about the smell of this oil, but I didn&#x27;t find them to be true for me.</li>
            <li>I love it so much I use it every day.</li>
            <li>Teddie Organics sent me an email with an attachment full of info about the oil itself.  </li>
            <li>It helps the dryness and gives it that nice natural glow under my makeup.</li>
            <li>feel that this is a very versatile oil, you just need to figure out your favorite way to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used it for a week so far on its own</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been paying close attention to the ingredients in my cosmetic products lately, and focusing on using products that supply my skin with the nutrients it needs to look and feel it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li>It really is a miracle for me :)</li>
            <li>First time user of Rosehip Oil and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li>The smell is not bad.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long, but so far I am happy with the results!  </li>
            <li>nice oil made my skin super soft and i have oily skin.</li>
            <li>My baby&#x27;s skin is super soft after applying this and it absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li>The oil is light and absorbs right into the skin without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy I found this company and can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li>The other great thing...</li>
            <li>I use it in the morning and night and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>The service was by far superior and the product shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery, quality product.</li>
            <li>Super moisturizing and</li>
            <li>This oil smells good, is not heavy and seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li>Received my oil quickly.</li>
            <li>I love how my face feel now, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It came quickly, too.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>The first bottle had more of a yellow coloring and smelled so good, it was very nutty or like tea.</li>
            <li>Ultimately, I would like a completely honest response from the store owners whether this is in fact pure, because even if it isn&#x27;t, I do like this oil and would love to know its composition.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer for the skin, and is also helping to reduce the appearance of some dark spots I have on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Apparently it is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes predominately grown in Chile.</li>
            <li>you notice the difference the very first day.</li>
            <li>This is such a light nice oil, in a simple tidy bottle.</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly  and did not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li>Ordering was easy and received it in the mail extremely fast.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so it can&#x27;t tolerate many products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The owners are so friendly and very prompt on questions and the email response!</li>
            <li>If you put too much on, your face will feel super greasy!</li>
            <li>It is pure pressed rose hip oil it is all natural.</li>
            <li>Amazing customer service, this is why I like buying from smaller companies!</li>
            <li>I really like how the product makes my skin feel silky smooth without feeling oily.</li>
            <li>I like that it only take a drop or two and that it doesn&#x27;t stay oily on your skin as it absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li>it was the same rose hips</li>
            <li>The oil arrived on time and seems fresh.</li>
            <li>(but I did not see a change in my acne scars) but the risk of permanently staining my sheets and clothes wasn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>But the Teddie oil actually has a nice bread/green tea smell to it.</li>
            <li>I love the soft feel of my skin after application and can see a difference in the lines and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li>It does have the Rosehip &#x27;smell&#x27; and color - which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all because I use it at night, and the results are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>It absorbs far better and quicker than coconut oil does, and does not leave an oily residue on your skin after using.</li>
            <li>Purchased this oil specifically to see if it would clear up some stubborn sun damage after trying many things that did not help.  </li>
            <li>Coming from someone who has struggled for years trying to find a solution to acne, this is really worth trying.</li>
            <li>It is far better than argan oil too.</li>
            <li>Not only was it packaged nicely and arrived promptly</li>
            <li>They are a smaller, family run business and they are so kind.</li>
            <li>It may not smell like fresh roses but it work.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference with my face yet, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it for the change in my nails alone.</li>
            <li>So far I am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li>I can layer other products on top of it :)</li>
            <li>Due to the color I apply it in the mornings to prevent staining and it works great to avoid breakouts since my skin is very prone to acne.</li>
            <li>It smells vaguely like beach roses, the oil is clean and perfectly tinted the color of the fruit.</li>
            <li>soft, smooth, hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li>if you apply the right amount of oil on your face, it will do wonders for you.</li>
            <li>Andy emailed me almost right after I bought it to give me input on how to use and the benefits.  </li>
            <li>I put it on right before bed</li>
            <li>right after I&#x27;ve applied it.)</li>
            <li>It goes on right under my makeup without any issues problem.</li>
            <li>I hope I spelled that right, anyhow I thought something has got to work</li>
            <li>oil is not oily well maybe if you put a lot on but for me it just absorbs right into my skin.</li>
            <li>This organic rosehip oil hit the spot as it was priced right and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected which is always good.</li>
            <li>Thank you for a high quality light oil for my face.</li>
            <li>:)  Not super sure what to make of this.</li>
            <li>It is a nice, thicker consistency with the orange tint which I guess is the typical mark of purity for this oil; unlike a cheap version I have that has a mineral oil smell and is thinner.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say yet that my hair is growing back - because it hasn&#x27;t been long enough - however, just the motion of doing something nice for myself - and using a substance that has no odd scent to it - makes it wonderful choice.</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful rosehip essential oil, goes onto your face silly smooth and even though it&#x27;s not as expensive as most rose-hip oils are, it&#x27;s still wonderful quality!</li>
            <li>Will certainly reorder this product!</li>
            <li>I already had a positive regimen in place for my face and feel that this oil is a good complement to my other skin care products.  </li>
            <li>Only after a few days I notice my face is smoother and it feels good!!</li>
            <li>The oil is not very greasy and absorbs into the skin, which is great for my 2 year old who hates those greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Thanks very much Teddie Organics!</li>
            <li>the teddie organics oil is thicker and absorb by the skin very fast and doesnt feel greasy.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it highly, especially for overall clarity of skin and easy absorption, and I love that it is natural and safe.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be shopping with Teddie Organics in the future, as a result of their amazing support and persistence!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be&lt;br /&gt;Ordering more and soon</li>
            <li>I purchased this funny oil</li>
            <li>I teceived this on Thursday and used it for the first time that night.</li>
            <li>The Rosehip Oil was exactly as I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li>#34;for all skin types&amp;#34;) + Rosehip oil (teddie organics) as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>Thanks, guys &amp;keep it up!</li>
            <li>Love using this oil, especially in this roughy winter weather.</li>
            <li>and it leaves my sometimes oily skin feeling soft and smooth, while soothing inflammation and redness.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve seen any skin improvements yet, but I&#x27;m willing to keep using it for a while, and should it work out,</li>
            <li>I did put it on my chin the first night</li>
            <li>I look forward to purchasing more products from you in the future!</li>
            <li>I tried using it in the morning as well at first and my skin seems to prefer just once a day application.</li>
            <li>I did experience some tiny bumps on my cheek and forehead, not always so this could just be my skin purging and adjusting but definitely have to say overall this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li>First time using rosehip oil</li>
            <li>Perfect lip balm, especially at bed time:  use the dispensing hand to drip one drop of oil onto the back of the opposite hand, then using my index finger of the dispensing hand</li>
            <li>They are a small company (with a great product), and, judging from their follow up after my purchase, they seem to be very committed to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li>Saw results the first time of use.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth and it looks like it&#x27;s glowing.</li>
            <li>Seems to be exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>, me I look anywhere from 5 to 10 years younger and that make me feel like I am on top of the world.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li>The Teddie rosehip seed oil arrived exactly on the day promised.</li>
            <li>The first week I used it once a day.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have ever written a review on a product/item.</li>
            <li>I love this product and look forward to trying all that are offered now and in the future from Teddie Organics.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping to boot!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I have used this about a week now and definitely feel my skin has more of a glow.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company with a couple questions and they replied right away and were very helpful.</li>
            <li>Not greasy and goes right into the skin, just a drop covers whole face.</li>
            <li>have many scars, from my young years as a tomboy, to the multiple surgeries in my adult years, and I was most interested to find out how it would work on them.</li>
            <li>great product,  a little goes a long way on combination skin,  makes my skin very soft , lovely product</li>
            <li>The rosehip oil is packaged nicely with a dropper which is extremely helpful.</li>
            <li>I received my Organic rose hip oil in he mail the other day</li>
            <li>It moisturizers my whole body and make it feel so smooth and young again.</li>
            <li>It refreshes moisture &amp; feels so natural &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>I either use it straight up, or I use it mixed with my favorite night cream, either way I like it.  </li>
            <li>The color of RHS oil I&#x27;ve tried before has been a darker orange-red, while this is more light yellow, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much on its own.</li>
            <li>You can use it pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li>Zero irritation, no hyperpigmentation, fades dark mark, makes my undereye area feel like rose petals.  </li>
            <li>Above anything, the customer service that I received from this seller was phenomenal; I received multiple friendly emails ensuring that I received and was content with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Product shipped quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the rosehip oil on my extremely dry skin, it&#x27;s not often that I&#x27;m able to find a product that works well for keeping my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li>my favorite place to use it is on my dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li>I put it on before I go to bed at night and wake up with super soft face/skin.  </li>
            <li>The vendor is SUPER nice and helpful, and the product itself absorbs quickly, and hasn&#x27;t broken me out (which I was nervous about).</li>
            <li>favorite way to use it is after I wash my hair, when my hair is still a little damp so it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>Teddie Organic Rosehip Oil is bottled in the USA and is 100% pure organic.</li>
            <li>This may be my new HG!!</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s cleared my acne, scaring and my overall skin texture is smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>

            <li>This is the real deal.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve already gone through two bottles-- thanks, Teddie Organics.&lt;br /&gt;(Note</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for creating it.</li>
            <li>It does so much for my body when I take it or use it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I have combination skin, and I feel like the oil has really evened out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Plus as Andy said, the Orange is high in vitamin C!</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product arrived in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be helping somewhat, but I really feel a difference in the softness of my skin.</li>
            <li>be intimidated by the color: it does come straight from the bottle orange.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil.</li>
            <li>so the dropper helps you control how much you use.  </li>
            <li>Also, really appreciated the PDF customer guide for the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>this is a company who REALLY cares and for me that makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li>the fact that he thought I was wearing makeup really speaks volumes.</li>
            <li>I am really thankful that I came across this product.</li>
            <li>I had such smooth skin</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>You see my hair is very curly and feeezy</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>and I really like the dropper.</li>
            <li>On one hand, it feels really nice on my skin and has seemed to help with the redness I have left over from some facial eczema.</li>
            <li>so I was hesitant of adding more oil to it, but this product actually balanced my natural oil.</li>
            <li>love for dry skin !!</li>
            <li>So far, this has been a MIRACLE for my skin in just one week!!!</li>
            <li>Normally the rose hip oil I bought from this company in the past had a nice deep amber color and had a dry oil texture that absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li>Compared to other brands of Rosehip oil I have used the quality of the oil itself is sooo much better.</li>
            <li>have decided to switch from face lotion to this, and it has been pretty beneficial so far!</li>
            <li>You can layer other creams on top if you need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with how soft and supple my skin appears, how smoothly my makeup goes on (I wear very little), and how the fine lines around my eyes and along my neck seem to be increasingly less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I also love it for when I&#x27;m especially dry</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve really tried to get away from heavy chemical facial products and am happy with this all natural oil.</li>
            <li>My dry skin soaks it right up leaving me with silky smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li>after using this a few weeks the severe dry skin ive been struggling with on my legs for over a year has improved greatly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always willing to try new skincare products, and this is by far one of my favorites!  </li>
            <li>One person even asked me if I was wearing some new makeup or something - and I didn&#x27;t even have any makeup on!  </li>
            <li>have not had any new break outs which I&#x27;m very suprised.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>, She is older than I am, &amp; I&#x27;m 53.</li>
            <li>I am going to pick up a second bottle for my friend who is pregnant.  </li>
            <li>Good amount of product since you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin &amp; am very prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>Its a great product, but for some reason has a little thicker consistency than other rosehip oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this oil to anyone.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>helped heal and prevent Candida infections in the cracked corners of my lips which I sometimes get when my blood sugar is too high.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend Teddie&#x27;s organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>because it is a natural product is better than other creams and product</li>
            <li>I feel like I need to use a little more than a &#x27;drop&#x27; (more like a long dab) in order to properly cover my face, but I feel like my skin looks nicer</li>
            <li>leaves your face so soft and learned no to use too much.  </li>
            <li>I applied to my daughter who has some fresh scarring from a recent skin infection.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels more hydrated, and less oily!</li>
            <li>I tried so many creams from QVC, HSN and other stores but was very dissappointed to find out that the creams will help for a day or two and then the problem wil come back again.  </li>
            <li>there is a fine line between putting too little oil or too much oil on your face.</li>
            <li>Just right for my daily face moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Teddie Organic Rosehip Oil has become my new nighttime ritual.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of how rosehip oil smells but mix it with argan oil by teddie organics it makes a huge different!</li>
            <li>I want clear and vibrant looking skin.</li>
            <li>Makes for a really nice, subtle look.</li>
            <li>For my surprise the next day my face and neck feel fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels very soft after using it.  </li>
            <li>It is very soft to touch now.</li>
            <li>I highly endorse this company and recommend the rosehip oil for anyone with mature skin.</li>
            <li>considering I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am always glad to support small, family-owned businesses.</li>
            <li>You can never go wrong with rose hip oil!</li>
            <li>the drip dispenser is extremely user friendly.  </li>
            <li>Leaves the skin amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>This is epic!</li>
            <li>More than I can say for any oil I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li>On the first day  when I open the bottle, I though that I will smell the aroma of roses.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far after 1 week of everyday use as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see any long-term benefits, but I enjoy it so far!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest only using 1-2 drops at night at first if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The next morning after my first use, I immediately noticed how soft, supple, and glowy my face was.</li>
            <li>So far my skin is very soft with no breakouts.</li>
            <li>This may sound silly but one full line under my eye and to my temple has disappeared!</li>
            <li>I will be loyal customer and can&#x27;t wait to try any other products they may offer.</li>
            <li>After that, my skin has become much softer and it is not dried or red anymore.  </li>
            <li>It only takes two or three drops morning and night on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li>after all but not too much so at the end the skin feels so soft that that it is totally worted&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Tried a couple different kinds of oils with it now, really like wild orange with it.</li>
            <li>I had issues with breakouts on my chest and neck and within 2 days my skin was clear.</li>
            <li>Too early to see results,</li>
            <li>oil!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying it directly to my face,&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>This has helped dramatically with the adult acne I have been experiencing all my life as well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just now learning about this natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, my skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely non-irritating, gentle, and moisturizing</li>
            <li>My face is soft and clear.</li>
            <li>Since it is an oil I thought it would be greasy but far from it.</li>
            <li>So far I like it</li>
            <li>but I like how it feels so far</li>
            <li>With everyone including my 2 year old having eczema, I was looking for a nontoxic, organic treatment for us.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>and I always thought it was for old ladies.  </li>
            <li>now her cheeks are completely cleared up.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>So far, this rosehip oil has surpassed coconut oil as part of my skin and hair care routine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It makes the makeup look so natural and w/o oily skin.  </li>
            <li>I bought this being a skeptic, and I am beyond pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it over a month, and even my boyfriend noticed how much lighter my scar was.  </li>
            <li>I am 38 years old and began getting Roseacia.</li>
            <li>It makes my hands feel soft.</li>
            <li>I have suffered from acne since I was 11 years old.</li>
            <li>So far, the product has improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li>This winter nearly killed my skin and now my face feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this straight from the bottle as well as mixing into facial serums.</li>
            <li>Nice texture, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too oily after application and sinks into skin after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>Understanding that I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to report long-term use results, I can say that so far I&#x27;m enjoying it and have had absolutely no adverse effects.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it every day since and can see a vast difference in the fine lines and dark spots on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>And such a cute little label/bottle!</li>
            <li>And what is really amazing is it just takes a few drops a day on the area you would like to resolve your issue and as long as you do this daily, IT WILL WORK!!!</li>
            <li>The most that I could loose was less than $20 dollars</li>
            <li>So Teddie&#x27;s Rosehip Oil has definitely earned it&#x27;s place in my new and streamlined beauty regimen!</li>
            <li>course it has only been a few days, but I have noticed my skin becoming clearer</li>
            <li>If this is working like I think it is, I may eliminate or switch other products to find the right mix.  </li>
            <li>(Thanks Gramma...wish I had listened to you a long time ago.)</li>
            <li>I have read so many great reviews of rosehip, but this gave me such a horrible breakout all over my skin</li>
            <li>The Teddie Organics RH oil seems to absorb better into my skin with less greasy residue than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>It is also a great moisturizer, definitely something needed during the cold months.</li>
            <li>Especially with this cold stormy winter,  I find this oil is soothing,  calming  and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li>It really help smoothen the scar and soothes dry skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really moisturizing for my dry face.</li>
            <li>but I really needed something for my dry under eyes</li>
            <li>I added a few drops of essential oil ( geranium) because I wanted a light fragrance.</li>
            <li>I have used only for a week so can&#x27;t comment on the effect but doesn&#x27;t irritate even very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>i tried my first bottle of this after my other brand was discontinued.</li>
            <li>I dab the oil on the corners of my lips, then rub over the rest of the lip area, Lips stayed super soft this past winter with almost no chapping.</li>
            <li>I did not know until purchasing this, how many issues that it would address, such as Dry or Itchy Skin or Scalp, Cracked Skin around Elbows and Heels, Ezcema, Rosacea, Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Redness and Uneven Skin</li>
            <li>Rosehip seed oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines.</li>
            <li>My skin was becoming dull and lifeless and I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments since I added this to my regimen!  </li>
            <li>Not sure this hard of rubbing is good for my face.</li>
            <li>It has alot of great uses and isnt bad feeling.</li>
            <li>I had read on multiple websites that this oil may help clear it up some, and</li>
            <li>Even after washing my face the next morning, my face was still soft during the day.  </li>
            <li>After the short time I have used it, I can tell a considerable difference in the appearance of my scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s also baby soft in a way I didn&#x27;t believe was possible.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin extremely soft, especially when using it after toning.</li>
            <li>It did not feel oily or greasy at all and left my skin glowing and silky soft.</li>
            <li>Well either I am now an old lady or we, as a society, have finally gotten hip to the oils and what they can do for us.  </li>
            <li>When I wake up, my face is so soft and supple, and this has definitely given my skin a glow.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and how much my skin has changed in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li>The sun damage is barely noticible already.  </li>
            <li>I add it to my Lush facial moisturizer in the evening before bed and at the advice of a YouTube makeup artist, I&#x27;ve started adding a drop to my foundation in the morning.</li>
            <li>Wow can instantly feel the difference on my face!</li>
            <li>I hope that everyone will  start to use more natural products topically, and do away with all the unnecessary toxins we are marketed to.</li>
            <li>Too soon to see results, but I like the slightly thick consistency and how smoothly it applies.  </li>
            <li>I simply use 2-3 drops of this at night after washing my face &amp; wake up GLOWING, red marks deminishing, wrinkles less defined, and overall smooth skin tone.</li>
            <li>He was very concerned about using an oil but his sensitive skin reacted favorably with no breakouts and less redness.</li>
            <li>Once I tried it, it was refreshing to my face and by the few times I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve noticed a slight change.</li>
            <li>At first I was shocked by its deep amber color, but upon more research I learned that this was normal.  </li>
            <li>I have not used it long enough to give a decent review.  </li>
            <li>I only need 5 drops for my face, so this small bottle is a good size for me since I go through skincare products slowly.</li>
            <li>This is definitely a high quality oil and it will last me quite a long time.</li>
            <li>It is softer and definitely not as dry.  </li>
            <li>When you first put it on, it is a little orange but the color goes away.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to those with eczema&#x27;s, other skin issues and skin scars.</li>
            <li>I guess it was shedding out my old dry skin.  </li>
            <li>my daughter and i have eczema and this works wonders for our dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It has helped clear up several dry patches in my skin.</li>
            <li>I noticed that even when I put a little too much, my skin does not breakout or become too greasy.  </li>

            <li> It has a nice light and non greasy texture that feels great on your skin.</li>
            <li> Even if I don&#x27;t see fewer wrinkles, there is no way for rose hip oil to be anything but beneficial.</li>
            <li> i would recommend rubbing warm on scalp and then using a boarbristle brush to move from root to ends of hair.</li>
            <li> It absorbs rather nicely.</li>

            <li> Absolutely loving this product.</li>
            <li> kind emails and information on their product.</li>
            <li> I use this every night after washing with St. Ives apricot scrub and using the rose water toner.</li>
            <li> also its darker than I anticipated (kind of looks like iodine).  </li>
            <li> I have never used rose hip oil before.  </li>
            <li> It is organic so the smell is not like a rose, so I put a drop of lavender oil with it for added skin conditioning and smell.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that rose hip oil (perhaps from all the vitamin C?)</li>
            <li> Been using this Rose hip oil for about a week.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m impressed with the results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving this product.  </li>
            <li> The correspondence from the Teddie company is awesome ,,, felt like someone was there helping me the whole time.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that my skin looks really good and healthy???</li>
            <li> It absorbs nicely.</li>
            <li> I looove teddie organics rose water spray.</li>
            <li> I spray the rose water on my face then a couple drops of rose oil</li>
            <li> Really love the product and loved that they care about their customers.</li>

            <li> A nice addition to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> This is a nice oil that absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Discount for my honest Nd unbiSed review.</li>
            <li> The sellers are very courteous and follow-up to make sure everything has arrived and is okay.</li>
            <li> My skin breaks out very easily with any kind of oil like argan, coconut, jojoba, etc.</li>
            <li> I am a very natural wearing makeup person so this kind of product suited me best!</li>
            <li> I am using it on an outbreak of rosacea with great success.  </li>
            <li> I read so many amazing things about rosehip oil and was dying to try it</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying my rose hip</li>
            <li> no matter what issue you may be having, if you try the Rosehip Oil, they are sure to be gone in no time at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received product(s)  in exchange for an honest review, which may differ from yours.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin and light too</li>
            <li> It is the best organic Rosehip Oil I bought, so far.     </li>
            <li> and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin with just a perfect natural &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li> This seemed to help those oils penetrate deeper and to be more effective with reducing her scarring and helping her tender skin to heal.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I found this company because their oil smells nutty and earthy and undeniably fresh to me.  </li>
            <li> Well, now that I have been using this rose hip seed oil under my make up, it leaves me skin looking silky, even after I put powder on top.</li>
            <li> Rosehip oil is one of the best skin products available and Teddie provides exactly what Im looking for in my rosehip oil:</li>
            <li> This oil feels great when applied and goes right into my face, neck and décolleté.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s great reviews and the right price point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it is very good results, in a few weeks I have seen very good results&lt;</li>
            <li> Smells great, goes on smoothly, and makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> Growing up in Germany I used to drink Rosehip tea and loved it a lot, knowing it is rich in Vitamin C and many others.</li>
            <li> As someone who has a history of acne and generally irritated skin, this is the best looking my skin has been since childhood.</li>
            <li> My nails feel super strong, and look great.</li>
            <li> Fine product, indeed!</li>
            <li> Very light weight oil that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin.</li>
            <li> I try to use it twice a day (along with Vit. C serum and a very light application of Argan oil).  </li>
            <li> Very smooth, silky, and odorless.</li>
            <li> It´s a very light oil, I love to use it</li>
            <li> I noticed significant improvement within two applications!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure that rosehip oil is a keeper for us, and I&#x27;m very pleased with Teddie Organics.</li>
            <li> Since I have tried most of them without the results that I wanted and never heard of rosehip oit, I decided to try on this organic rosehip seed oil.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil and will not change a thing on it.  </li>
            <li> I love this oil.  </li>
            <li> Love, love, love this oil.</li>

            <li> face mask with it also :).</li>
            <li> am really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> Having stopped using rosehip oil for many months, I found this brand.</li>
            <li> It bothers me more than it bothers him.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased so many products that have shown some results</li>
            <li> At this point I&#x27;ve given it 4 stars because he&#x27;s using it and it appears to be working better than anything we&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> Overall I’m very happy with this oil!</li>

            <li> The company even contacted me to provide more information on it&#x27;s uses.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin looks after I apply it</li>
            <li> i have added coconut oil to this product for a greater effect.</li>
            <li> I love all</li>
            <li> Love love love the rosehip oil, did not break me out at all</li>
            <li> Love this product and company</li>
            <li> Great for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> However, it is very rich and moisturizing  for night.</li>
            <li> It has a rich, amber color and it smells kind of nutty..</li>
            <li> I order many items from amazon and this is the first time that a company contacted me before I received the product (to make sure that I received it in good condition) and they answer any questions that I have, immediately.  </li>
            <li> So far so good!  </li>
            <li> wonderful product, is working nicely on my dry skin:).  </li>
            <li> Leaves it dewy soft, glowing, beautiful.  </li>
            <li> well maybe kind of sweet oil like smell.</li>
            <li> Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The color is amber, and the smell is not so pleasant.</li>
            <li> The owners are amazing as well, quick to respond to any product questions.</li>
            <li> Several people spontaneously told me how great my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> Instantly absorbs, odor free, perfect food for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Put it on a clean face before bed &amp; wake up glowing!</li>
            <li> I have used other brands and am most impressed with this one.</li>
            <li> Although this is my first time using Rosehip Oil, I would highly recommend this brand because of the great results and the very friendly owners who went above and beyond to make sure it made it on time and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> The reason for the four starts is the intense bright orange color of the oil.</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> Most important, it does not clog or irritate my fussy skin.</li>
            <li> Great oil, not greasy, leaves skin soft.</li>
            <li> but I could never get him to buy more because he&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - it makes my skin feel soft and nourished.</li>
            <li> The sellers were really sweet and followed up to make sure I was 100% satisfied with the product</li>
            <li> Beautiful amber colored oil with a light, natural smell akin to apricots.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised in good shape and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and bottle arrived in good care.</li>
            <li> Great product - - thanks so much!!</li>
            <li> Compared to all other oils I have used on my face, this oil has the best feel.</li>
            <li> After all, I want more than just clean and toned skin.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many similar but never received the great outcome like I have with this.</li>
            <li> I was easy to apply and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> The rosehips seed oil arrived very quickly and was as promised.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, they have a great product with excellent follow up/customer care.  </li>

            <li> this makes application easy.  </li>
            <li> The oil soaks in very quickly and there isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>

            <li> the smell is very pleasant as i expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve actually had people tell me how beautiful my skin is looking</li>
            <li> I will most definitely continue using (and loving!).</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an avid user of skin products, but this oil really makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Slight smell as others have said but the product works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping in time, it will help with the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> and hopefully it will help prevent fine lines and wrinkles over time.</li>

            <li> This oil is high quality and effective.</li>
            <li> Overall, super happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I was aware of the color when I ordered the oil but thought it would be absorbed better and more quickly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to see how my skin would react to moisturizing oils instead of creams and lotions, and am very pleased so far.</li>
            <li> I was so amazed and so excited to try it out for myself!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Love the product, shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Worth buying!</li>
            <li> (My boyfriend jokingly tells me I smell like sexy hot tea</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail and was so excited to use it.</li>
            <li> I received wonderful service from this small mom and pop company.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much!</li>
            <li> In my 30&#x27;s my skin is in the best condition of my life due to using rose hips oil daily.</li>
            <li> Just FYI I have found that mixing one drop of this product with a regular amount of original ponds moisturizer has been more effective for me than just the product alone.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different rose hips oil on the market</li>
            <li> So far, I find this to be an excellent essential oil...have been using it as part of my skin care moisturizing</li>
            <li> I have only used the oil for a week but am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> It is great to use for dry skin.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the product for a year now (ordered 3 bottles in total) and I&#x27;ve absolutely loved it until now.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a bit of Vitamin E oil after a good facial wash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice product, and it makes my skin silky soft, and  has not caused any breakouts for me.  </li>
            <li> I know there have been some comments about the smell of this oil, but I didn&#x27;t find them to be true for me.</li>
            <li> I love it so much I use it every day.</li>
            <li> Teddie Organics sent me an email with an attachment full of info about the oil itself.  </li>
            <li> It helps the dryness and gives it that nice natural glow under my makeup.</li>
            <li> feel that this is a very versatile oil, you just need to figure out your favorite way to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used it for a week so far on its own</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying close attention to the ingredients in my cosmetic products lately, and focusing on using products that supply my skin with the nutrients it needs to look and feel it&#x27;s best.</li>
            <li> It really is a miracle for me :)</li>
            <li> First time user of Rosehip Oil and so far, so good.  </li>
            <li> The smell is not bad.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long, but so far I am happy with the results!  </li>
            <li> nice oil made my skin super soft and i have oily skin.</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s skin is super soft after applying this and it absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li> The oil is light and absorbs right into the skin without a greasy feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this company and can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> The other great thing...</li>
            <li> I use it in the morning and night and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> The service was by far superior and the product shipped fast.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery, quality product.</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and</li>
            <li> This oil smells good, is not heavy and seems to be working very well.  </li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li> Received my oil quickly.</li>
            <li> I love how my face feel now, soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It came quickly, too.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> The first bottle had more of a yellow coloring and smelled so good, it was very nutty or like tea.</li>
            <li> Ultimately, I would like a completely honest response from the store owners whether this is in fact pure, because even if it isn&#x27;t, I do like this oil and would love to know its composition.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer for the skin, and is also helping to reduce the appearance of some dark spots I have on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Apparently it is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes predominately grown in Chile.</li>
            <li> you notice the difference the very first day.</li>
            <li> This is such a light nice oil, in a simple tidy bottle.</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly  and did not leave a greasy feel.  </li>
            <li> Ordering was easy and received it in the mail extremely fast.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive so it can&#x27;t tolerate many products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The owners are so friendly and very prompt on questions and the email response!</li>
            <li> If you put too much on, your face will feel super greasy!</li>
            <li> It is pure pressed rose hip oil it is all natural.</li>
            <li> Amazing customer service, this is why I like buying from smaller companies!</li>
            <li> I really like how the product makes my skin feel silky smooth without feeling oily.</li>
            <li> I like that it only take a drop or two and that it doesn&#x27;t stay oily on your skin as it absorbs nicely.  </li>
            <li> it was the same rose hips</li>
            <li> The oil arrived on time and seems fresh.</li>
            <li> (but I did not see a change in my acne scars) but the risk of permanently staining my sheets and clothes wasn&#x27;t really worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> But the Teddie oil actually has a nice bread/green tea smell to it.</li>
            <li> I love the soft feel of my skin after application and can see a difference in the lines and texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> It does have the Rosehip &#x27;smell&#x27; and color - which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all because I use it at night, and the results are definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> It absorbs far better and quicker than coconut oil does, and does not leave an oily residue on your skin after using.</li>
            <li> Purchased this oil specifically to see if it would clear up some stubborn sun damage after trying many things that did not help.  </li>
            <li> Coming from someone who has struggled for years trying to find a solution to acne, this is really worth trying.</li>
            <li> It is far better than argan oil too.</li>
            <li> Not only was it packaged nicely and arrived promptly</li>
            <li> They are a smaller, family run business and they are so kind.</li>
            <li> It may not smell like fresh roses but it work.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference with my face yet, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it for the change in my nails alone.</li>
            <li> So far I am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> I can layer other products on top of it :)</li>
            <li> Due to the color I apply it in the mornings to prevent staining and it works great to avoid breakouts since my skin is very prone to acne.</li>
            <li> It smells vaguely like beach roses, the oil is clean and perfectly tinted the color of the fruit.</li>
            <li> soft, smooth, hydrated and clean.</li>
            <li> if you apply the right amount of oil on your face, it will do wonders for you.</li>
            <li> Andy emailed me almost right after I bought it to give me input on how to use and the benefits.  </li>
            <li> I put it on right before bed</li>
            <li> right after I&#x27;ve applied it.)</li>
            <li> It goes on right under my makeup without any issues problem.</li>
            <li> I hope I spelled that right, anyhow I thought something has got to work</li>
            <li> oil is not oily well maybe if you put a lot on but for me it just absorbs right into my skin.</li>
            <li> This organic rosehip oil hit the spot as it was priced right and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected which is always good.</li>
            <li> Thank you for a high quality light oil for my face.</li>
            <li> :)  Not super sure what to make of this.</li>
            <li> It is a nice, thicker consistency with the orange tint which I guess is the typical mark of purity for this oil; unlike a cheap version I have that has a mineral oil smell and is thinner.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say yet that my hair is growing back - because it hasn&#x27;t been long enough - however, just the motion of doing something nice for myself - and using a substance that has no odd scent to it - makes it wonderful choice.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful rosehip essential oil, goes onto your face silly smooth and even though it&#x27;s not as expensive as most rose-hip oils are, it&#x27;s still wonderful quality!</li>
            <li> Will certainly reorder this product!</li>
            <li> I already had a positive regimen in place for my face and feel that this oil is a good complement to my other skin care products.  </li>
            <li> Only after a few days I notice my face is smoother and it feels good!!</li>
            <li> The oil is not very greasy and absorbs into the skin, which is great for my 2 year old who hates those greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Thanks very much Teddie Organics!</li>
            <li> the teddie organics oil is thicker and absorb by the skin very fast and doesnt feel greasy.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it highly, especially for overall clarity of skin and easy absorption, and I love that it is natural and safe.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be shopping with Teddie Organics in the future, as a result of their amazing support and persistence!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be&lt;br /&gt;Ordering more and soon</li>
            <li> I purchased this funny oil</li>
            <li> I teceived this on Thursday and used it for the first time that night.</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Oil was exactly as I hoped it would be.  </li>
            <li> #34;for all skin types&amp;#34;) + Rosehip oil (teddie organics) as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> Thanks, guys &amp;keep it up!</li>
            <li> Love using this oil, especially in this roughy winter weather.</li>
            <li> and it leaves my sometimes oily skin feeling soft and smooth, while soothing inflammation and redness.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve seen any skin improvements yet, but I&#x27;m willing to keep using it for a while, and should it work out,</li>
            <li> I did put it on my chin the first night</li>
            <li> I look forward to purchasing more products from you in the future!</li>
            <li> I tried using it in the morning as well at first and my skin seems to prefer just once a day application.</li>
            <li> I did experience some tiny bumps on my cheek and forehead, not always so this could just be my skin purging and adjusting but definitely have to say overall this product is wonderful.</li>
            <li> First time using rosehip oil</li>
            <li> Perfect lip balm, especially at bed time:  use the dispensing hand to drip one drop of oil onto the back of the opposite hand, then using my index finger of the dispensing hand</li>
            <li> They are a small company (with a great product), and, judging from their follow up after my purchase, they seem to be very committed to customer satisfaction.</li>
            <li> Saw results the first time of use.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin soft and smooth and it looks like it&#x27;s glowing.</li>
            <li> Seems to be exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> , me I look anywhere from 5 to 10 years younger and that make me feel like I am on top of the world.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described.</li>
            <li> The Teddie rosehip seed oil arrived exactly on the day promised.</li>
            <li> The first week I used it once a day.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ever written a review on a product/item.</li>
            <li> I love this product and look forward to trying all that are offered now and in the future from Teddie Organics.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping to boot!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I have used this about a week now and definitely feel my skin has more of a glow.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company with a couple questions and they replied right away and were very helpful.</li>
            <li> Not greasy and goes right into the skin, just a drop covers whole face.</li>
            <li> have many scars, from my young years as a tomboy, to the multiple surgeries in my adult years, and I was most interested to find out how it would work on them.</li>
            <li> great product,  a little goes a long way on combination skin,  makes my skin very soft , lovely product</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil is packaged nicely with a dropper which is extremely helpful.</li>
            <li> I received my Organic rose hip oil in he mail the other day</li>
            <li> It moisturizers my whole body and make it feel so smooth and young again.</li>
            <li> It refreshes moisture &amp; feels so natural &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> I either use it straight up, or I use it mixed with my favorite night cream, either way I like it.  </li>
            <li> The color of RHS oil I&#x27;ve tried before has been a darker orange-red, while this is more light yellow, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much on its own.</li>
            <li> You can use it pretty much anywhere on your body.</li>
            <li> Zero irritation, no hyperpigmentation, fades dark mark, makes my undereye area feel like rose petals.  </li>
            <li> Above anything, the customer service that I received from this seller was phenomenal; I received multiple friendly emails ensuring that I received and was content with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rosehip oil on my extremely dry skin, it&#x27;s not often that I&#x27;m able to find a product that works well for keeping my skin hydrated.  </li>
            <li> my favorite place to use it is on my dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I put it on before I go to bed at night and wake up with super soft face/skin.  </li>
            <li> The vendor is SUPER nice and helpful, and the product itself absorbs quickly, and hasn&#x27;t broken me out (which I was nervous about).</li>
            <li> favorite way to use it is after I wash my hair, when my hair is still a little damp so it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Teddie Organic Rosehip Oil is bottled in the USA and is 100% pure organic.</li>
            <li> This may be my new HG!!</li>

            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for creating it.</li>
            <li> It does so much for my body when I take it or use it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and I feel like the oil has really evened out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Plus as Andy said, the Orange is high in vitamin C!</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a very timely manner.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be helping somewhat, but I really feel a difference in the softness of my skin.</li>
            <li> be intimidated by the color: it does come straight from the bottle orange.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil.</li>
            <li> so the dropper helps you control how much you use.  </li>
            <li> Also, really appreciated the PDF customer guide for the product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this is a company who REALLY cares and for me that makes a world of difference.  </li>
            <li> the fact that he thought I was wearing makeup really speaks volumes.</li>
            <li> I am really thankful that I came across this product.</li>
            <li> I had such smooth skin</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> You see my hair is very curly and feeezy</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> and I really like the dropper.</li>
            <li> On one hand, it feels really nice on my skin and has seemed to help with the redness I have left over from some facial eczema.</li>
            <li> so I was hesitant of adding more oil to it, but this product actually balanced my natural oil.</li>
            <li> love for dry skin !!</li>
            <li> So far, this has been a MIRACLE for my skin in just one week!!!</li>
            <li> Normally the rose hip oil I bought from this company in the past had a nice deep amber color and had a dry oil texture that absorbed immediately.</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands of Rosehip oil I have used the quality of the oil itself is sooo much better.</li>
            <li> have decided to switch from face lotion to this, and it has been pretty beneficial so far!</li>
            <li> You can layer other creams on top if you need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled with how soft and supple my skin appears, how smoothly my makeup goes on (I wear very little), and how the fine lines around my eyes and along my neck seem to be increasingly less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I also love it for when I&#x27;m especially dry</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve really tried to get away from heavy chemical facial products and am happy with this all natural oil.</li>
            <li> My dry skin soaks it right up leaving me with silky smooth, soft skin.</li>
            <li> after using this a few weeks the severe dry skin ive been struggling with on my legs for over a year has improved greatly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always willing to try new skincare products, and this is by far one of my favorites!  </li>
            <li> One person even asked me if I was wearing some new makeup or something - and I didn&#x27;t even have any makeup on!  </li>
            <li> have not had any new break outs which I&#x27;m very suprised.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for dry skin.  </li>
            <li> , She is older than I am, &amp; I&#x27;m 53.</li>
            <li> I am going to pick up a second bottle for my friend who is pregnant.  </li>
            <li> Good amount of product since you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin &amp; am very prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> Its a great product, but for some reason has a little thicker consistency than other rosehip oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this oil to anyone.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> helped heal and prevent Candida infections in the cracked corners of my lips which I sometimes get when my blood sugar is too high.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I would highly recommend Teddie&#x27;s organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> because it is a natural product is better than other creams and product</li>
            <li> I feel like I need to use a little more than a &#x27;drop&#x27; (more like a long dab) in order to properly cover my face, but I feel like my skin looks nicer</li>
            <li> leaves your face so soft and learned no to use too much.  </li>
            <li> I applied to my daughter who has some fresh scarring from a recent skin infection.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels more hydrated, and less oily!</li>
            <li> I tried so many creams from QVC, HSN and other stores but was very dissappointed to find out that the creams will help for a day or two and then the problem wil come back again.  </li>
            <li> there is a fine line between putting too little oil or too much oil on your face.</li>
            <li> Just right for my daily face moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Teddie Organic Rosehip Oil has become my new nighttime ritual.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of how rosehip oil smells but mix it with argan oil by teddie organics it makes a huge different!</li>
            <li> I want clear and vibrant looking skin.</li>
            <li> Makes for a really nice, subtle look.</li>
            <li> For my surprise the next day my face and neck feel fresh and soft.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels very soft after using it.  </li>
            <li> It is very soft to touch now.</li>
            <li> I highly endorse this company and recommend the rosehip oil for anyone with mature skin.</li>
            <li> considering I have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am always glad to support small, family-owned businesses.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with rose hip oil!</li>
            <li> the drip dispenser is extremely user friendly.  </li>
            <li> Leaves the skin amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> This is epic!</li>
            <li> More than I can say for any oil I&#x27;ve tried in the past.</li>
            <li> On the first day  when I open the bottle, I though that I will smell the aroma of roses.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far after 1 week of everyday use as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see any long-term benefits, but I enjoy it so far!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I suggest only using 1-2 drops at night at first if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The next morning after my first use, I immediately noticed how soft, supple, and glowy my face was.</li>
            <li> So far my skin is very soft with no breakouts.</li>
            <li> This may sound silly but one full line under my eye and to my temple has disappeared!</li>
            <li> I will be loyal customer and can&#x27;t wait to try any other products they may offer.</li>
            <li> After that, my skin has become much softer and it is not dried or red anymore.  </li>
            <li> It only takes two or three drops morning and night on clean dry skin.</li>
            <li> after all but not too much so at the end the skin feels so soft that that it is totally worted&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Tried a couple different kinds of oils with it now, really like wild orange with it.</li>
            <li> I had issues with breakouts on my chest and neck and within 2 days my skin was clear.</li>
            <li> Too early to see results,</li>
            <li> oil!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying it directly to my face,&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> This has helped dramatically with the adult acne I have been experiencing all my life as well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just now learning about this natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , my skin is so soft now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely non-irritating, gentle, and moisturizing</li>
            <li> My face is soft and clear.</li>
            <li> Since it is an oil I thought it would be greasy but far from it.</li>
            <li> So far I like it</li>
            <li> but I like how it feels so far</li>
            <li> With everyone including my 2 year old having eczema, I was looking for a nontoxic, organic treatment for us.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li> and I always thought it was for old ladies.  </li>
            <li> now her cheeks are completely cleared up.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li> So far, this rosehip oil has surpassed coconut oil as part of my skin and hair care routine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It makes the makeup look so natural and w/o oily skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this being a skeptic, and I am beyond pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it over a month, and even my boyfriend noticed how much lighter my scar was.  </li>
            <li> I am 38 years old and began getting Roseacia.</li>
            <li> It makes my hands feel soft.</li>
            <li> I have suffered from acne since I was 11 years old.</li>
            <li> So far, the product has improved the look and feel of my skin.</li>
            <li> This winter nearly killed my skin and now my face feels smooth and supple.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straight from the bottle as well as mixing into facial serums.</li>
            <li> Nice texture, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too oily after application and sinks into skin after a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> Understanding that I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to report long-term use results, I can say that so far I&#x27;m enjoying it and have had absolutely no adverse effects.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it every day since and can see a vast difference in the fine lines and dark spots on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> And such a cute little label/bottle!</li>
            <li> And what is really amazing is it just takes a few drops a day on the area you would like to resolve your issue and as long as you do this daily, IT WILL WORK!!!</li>
            <li> The most that I could loose was less than $20 dollars</li>
            <li> So Teddie&#x27;s Rosehip Oil has definitely earned it&#x27;s place in my new and streamlined beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> course it has only been a few days, but I have noticed my skin becoming clearer</li>
            <li> If this is working like I think it is, I may eliminate or switch other products to find the right mix.  </li>
            <li> (Thanks Gramma...wish I had listened to you a long time ago.)</li>
            <li> I have read so many great reviews of rosehip, but this gave me such a horrible breakout all over my skin</li>
            <li> The Teddie Organics RH oil seems to absorb better into my skin with less greasy residue than other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It is also a great moisturizer, definitely something needed during the cold months.</li>
            <li> Especially with this cold stormy winter,  I find this oil is soothing,  calming  and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> It really help smoothen the scar and soothes dry skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really moisturizing for my dry face.</li>
            <li> but I really needed something for my dry under eyes</li>
            <li> I added a few drops of essential oil ( geranium) because I wanted a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> I have used only for a week so can&#x27;t comment on the effect but doesn&#x27;t irritate even very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> i tried my first bottle of this after my other brand was discontinued.</li>
            <li> I dab the oil on the corners of my lips, then rub over the rest of the lip area, Lips stayed super soft this past winter with almost no chapping.</li>
            <li> I did not know until purchasing this, how many issues that it would address, such as Dry or Itchy Skin or Scalp, Cracked Skin around Elbows and Heels, Ezcema, Rosacea, Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Redness and Uneven Skin</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines.</li>
            <li> My skin was becoming dull and lifeless and I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments since I added this to my regimen!  </li>
            <li> Not sure this hard of rubbing is good for my face.</li>
            <li> It has alot of great uses and isnt bad feeling.</li>
            <li> I had read on multiple websites that this oil may help clear it up some, and</li>
            <li> Even after washing my face the next morning, my face was still soft during the day.  </li>
            <li> After the short time I have used it, I can tell a considerable difference in the appearance of my scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s also baby soft in a way I didn&#x27;t believe was possible.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin extremely soft, especially when using it after toning.</li>
            <li> It did not feel oily or greasy at all and left my skin glowing and silky soft.</li>
            <li> Well either I am now an old lady or we, as a society, have finally gotten hip to the oils and what they can do for us.  </li>
            <li> When I wake up, my face is so soft and supple, and this has definitely given my skin a glow.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and how much my skin has changed in such a short amount of time.</li>
            <li> The sun damage is barely noticible already.  </li>
            <li> I add it to my Lush facial moisturizer in the evening before bed and at the advice of a YouTube makeup artist, I&#x27;ve started adding a drop to my foundation in the morning.</li>
            <li> Wow can instantly feel the difference on my face!</li>
            <li> I hope that everyone will  start to use more natural products topically, and do away with all the unnecessary toxins we are marketed to.</li>
            <li> Too soon to see results, but I like the slightly thick consistency and how smoothly it applies.  </li>
            <li> I simply use 2-3 drops of this at night after washing my face &amp; wake up GLOWING, red marks deminishing, wrinkles less defined, and overall smooth skin tone.</li>
            <li> He was very concerned about using an oil but his sensitive skin reacted favorably with no breakouts and less redness.</li>
            <li> Once I tried it, it was refreshing to my face and by the few times I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve noticed a slight change.</li>
            <li> At first I was shocked by its deep amber color, but upon more research I learned that this was normal.  </li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to give a decent review.  </li>
            <li> I only need 5 drops for my face, so this small bottle is a good size for me since I go through skincare products slowly.</li>
            <li> This is definitely a high quality oil and it will last me quite a long time.</li>
            <li> It is softer and definitely not as dry.  </li>
            <li> When you first put it on, it is a little orange but the color goes away.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to those with eczema&#x27;s, other skin issues and skin scars.</li>
            <li> I guess it was shedding out my old dry skin.  </li>
            <li> my daughter and i have eczema and this works wonders for our dry sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It has helped clear up several dry patches in my skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed that even when I put a little too much, my skin does not breakout or become too greasy.  </li>
            <li> Other brands can kind of smell like a weird beer...</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s actually 100% pure RHS oil and think it may be cut with another oil, because when I went to go store it in the fridge (which is frequently advised to prolong shelf life), it separated and solidified.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing, and has kept my skin so clear since I&#x27;ve started using it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied it to my face directly and used it in conjunction with other products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good moisturizer; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my bad nose or</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially good for this winter weather where dry skin is the worst!</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and I think my occasional breakouts were even less than usual--my skin is soft, dewy, and clearer than before.</li>
            <li> my daughter used to have such dry itchy skin on her cheeks that she would constantly scratch at it taking the skin off and all.</li>
            <li> I have used it about 2 times a day for a few days now for my dry skin and my skin is much softer now.</li>
            <li> my face is clear and my dark circles are reducing.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product long enough to see the benefits.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to attest to all the claims, but from what I have noticed they are spot on.</li>
            <li> Strange orangey oil that makes my skin a different color</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been using product long enough to see all of its benefits.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to review the benefits but will update that</li>
            <li> I dont think I have been using it long enough (1 week) to say that it has done anything for my wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> a good portion of the bottle :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve constantly had battles with my skin (acne) and this past winter I switched to all organic products which really helped, but made it made my skin extremely dry.</li>
            <li> But this rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t at the same time my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry.</li>
            <li> /&gt;highly if you are looking to heal acne scars, dry skin or just an overall skin pick me up.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on the quality of preparation (organic, cold pressed, no additives, amber bottled), and was pleased when it initially arrived.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel so dry anymore, and actually seems to be helping my skin tone even out.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results, though haven&#x27;t noticed any negative ones either.</li>
            <li> I am EXTREMELY acne prone, and not a single blemish has appeared!</li>
            <li> This product was relatively in-expensive compared to other essential oil companies.  </li>
            <li> It is the orange color rosehip seed oil is supposed to be and has only a very faint smell (rancid oil smells like strong fish apparently).</li>
            <li> I have also used this on my dry, peeling skin due to the dry winter season, I have noticed the peeling stop and my skin especially around my fingers are not dry and is healing.</li>
            <li> I love that it is organic, unrefined, and cold pressed with no fillers...</li>
            <li> Mine are a combination of age, acne, sun damage, and minor scarring.  </li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t glowed like it does in a long time.  </li>
            <li> For me it was hair care, and the rough spots on my elbows, which are healing now.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to looking younger every day!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward to effects after long term use.  </li>
            <li> I have Impetigo (minor) and sometimes it flares up.  </li>
            <li> I have been mixing a few drops into my daily moisturizer in the mornings and it really makes my skin look dewy without feeling heavy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> You can apply it directly to the area like I do with my hair, or put a few drops in your hands and then apply.</li>
            <li> for this specific oil, I spent a long time agonizing over which brand to buy.</li>
            <li> If you are going to use this as a facial moisturizer, I suggest using it the same way after your toner, when your face is still slightly damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not sure if I used too much or if it was a reaction with my other skin care products and makeup.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order other products from Teddie Organics.</li>
            <li> The ways to use this are endless and being organic is a total plus!</li>
            <li> personally use it in my hair because of my split ends, though you can use it anywhere that you may need a little extra moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried strengthening polish, creams, and numerous other products to strengthen them, but nothing has worked.</li>
            <li> I do prefer the argon oil by this company though out of the two due to this having a slight yellow tinge to it and the other being clear.</li>
            <li> Tone,&lt;br /&gt;Scars, Stretch Marks, Age Spots, Sun Damaged skin, Brittle Nails and Dry Cuticles.  </li>
            <li> Helps with my dry skin.</li>
            <li> since i have gone no shampoo, i have been looking for solutions for dry scalp, of which i have a problem with in the winter.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had that dry feeling since</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using on my face and hands to get rid of my dry winter skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s help resolve the dry patches I had.</li>
            <li> This has helped bring relief to my dry itchy elbows and softened my cuticles during this winters dry</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and elbows and can see some improvement in the dry skin on my elbows.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t describe this as a dry oil, but neither is it greasy nor does it leave an oily residue.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s uses- dry skin, eczema, etc</li>
            <li> I did not expect the compliments I received only a few days after starting to use this oil!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really getting sold on going back to using what Mother Nature provides, as I think using harsh chemicals makes it hard for your skin to self-heal and retain its equilibrium.</li>
            <li> and it definitely does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li> My face dries out easily in this cold weather.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the most recent bottle they sent me.</li>
            <li> and I was really afraid to try this because my skin usually doesn&#x27;t react well with any kind of oil</li>
            <li> I use on my hands as well as my face as I have very dry skin and sometimes mix in a couple of drops into my moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I use the oil at night and in the morning to combat fine lines and dryness on these cold winter days.  </li>
            <li> On the third day, I noticed a little peeling.  </li>
            <li> so I did a little research before I actually got it.</li>
            <li> but my skin got little red bumps after using it.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and a wedding coming up so was looking for a little extra boost.  </li>
            <li> It can also be used for eczema, psoriasis, and loads of other dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> It does wonders for dry skin around the eye (crows feet) and other lines on the face.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day and only need a few drops to apply to my face and neck.  </li>
            <li> My trouble spots are actually fading some.  </li>
            <li> I rub a few drops of this oil, either alone or in a carrier such as coconut oil</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this for awhile before I reviewed it, and while it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, I have to say that I like it.</li>
            <li> thank you teddie organics for the opportunity to get and use this product lifelong customer</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days and can already see and feel the difference in my face and neck.</li>
            <li> I purchased it to try and help reduce a scar I have on my face and even though its only been a few weeks, I have noticed some lightening already.</li>
            <li> It combats rough winter skin.</li>
            <li> At this point I would say that this is a product that I&#x27;d reorder when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I just received this carefully packaged organic oil...</li>
            <li> Only need a few drops for your face</li>
            <li> This product not only has helped with my scars in the few weeks that I have been using it, but it is helping my acne as well.</li>
            <li> But  it wasn&#x27;t  what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it every day since, and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no breakage.</li>
            <li> I hate the rancid fish smell that a lot of rose hip oils have, but this does not have that.</li>
            <li> Shortly after I started using the oil, the redness has gone down and the scar is definitely less visible.</li>
            <li> and Ive actually noticed my skin is a little clearer!</li>
            <li> I have fairly dry skin, and this alone relieves that tight feeling after an evening shower.</li>
            <li> The other day, I tried to reintroduce some face cream on my skin with this oil and my face started to burn again.  </li>
            <li> Ive tried rosehip oil from a couple other brands, and none compare to this one.</li>
            <li> but I was worried buying this product because reviews of other brands said the oil sometimes had a fishy or rancid smell and looked diluted with cheaper</li>
            <li> I will give it some time to determine other benefits.</li>
            <li> I usually have about 10 spots to cover up, but lately, it&#x27;s only one MAYBE two.</li>
            <li> Just a few drops goes a long way.</li>
            <li> i will not buy other brands again.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely  picky when it comes to a quality product and trust me when I tell you this...  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have that funky smell like other ones I tried.</li>
            <li> will reorder and explore their other products</li>
            <li> But on my second bottle, there is no smell, or a faint scent that smells totally different than my last bottle.</li>
            <li> Once that clears up with my other prescription medicine, I&#x27;m going to try the Rosehip Oil there</li>
            <li> I have a small scar above my lip and will update on how that is improving as time goes.</li>
            <li> Now I use it twice a day and do not use any other products on my face except eye cream and sunblock.</li>
            <li> My face is glowing and there is no more red blotches or bumps.</li>
            <li> I am very partial to suing it on my hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also applied it to the back of my arms at night where I can get keratosis pillars (chicken skin) flare-ups, and my skin looks much calmer in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have kinda dry skin and need  heavy mousturizer..</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> There are other brands out there with less smell and dye.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used it on my elbows, on dark spots by my eyes and even on my lips.</li>
            <li> I no longer have pimples, my dark spots are fading, and the redness around my cheeks and nose is gone.</li>
            <li> Too soon to tell whether it is making a difference on my skin - I hoping to fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> I have very dry/cracked hands in the winter when the cold, dry air hits</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the results months down the road.</li>
            <li> , I mean back in the day,</li>
            <li> My skin looks brighter and smoother and no more dry patches.</li>
            <li> I started using it on my face and noticed my face was a bit less greasy during the day, and that some of my dark spot from acne had lightened.  </li>
            <li> I have noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my skin in just a couple of days, my skin is already looking healthier, where as before I felt I was looking a little dull</li>
            <li> It works just as well as my previous ones.</li>
            <li> I was previously using.</li>
            <li> I have been using it less than a week.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an odd idea putting oil on your face</li>
            <li> Also I have noticed less wrinkles.</li>
            <li> My face does look less discolored.</li>
            <li> Maybe a slight earthy or nutty smell</li>
            <li> Initially put off by the natural scent which to me smelled unpleasant.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of something I used to smell in my mom&#x27;s stable- not &amp;#34;horsey&amp;#34; per se, but a little bit spicy and musky?</li>
            <li> I tried this on my face and it made it a little bit too oily.  </li>
            <li> I used it on a scar on my hand and noticed that it had faded a little.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a little greasy because it is an oil</li>
            <li> so it masks the scent a little.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for a little over two weeks</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little soon for a 5 star rating</li>
            <li> I now feel my skin has a little healthier glow.  </li>
            <li> used a little in my lotion as well as a stringent I made.</li>
            <li> Researching natural ways to improve on my bad (and daily) hair days, I came upon Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> This time of year my skin is usually so dry it is ridiculous but not this year.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I just put some on in the morning and another few drops at night</li>
            <li> I agree with a few reviewers, it does have a somewhat fishy smell to it (which doesn&#x27;t bother me but might bother some).</li>
            <li> I just put a few drops in my moisturizer every morning and night.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks of using the rosehip oil, my skin looked clearer and felt smoother.</li>
            <li> Totally stood behind their products in the kindest of ways</li>
            <li> Had trouble with skin care products all my life, untill I came across this gem.</li>
            <li> I always use powder on my skin after I apply foundation because I need it to soak up excess oil, but the powder ends up being too harsh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> As you can Imagine, I have aquired some pretty bad scars and discoloration over the years.</li>
            <li> I will be using this for a long time and I&#x27;m considering in tossing all my other oils and expensive creams.</li>
            <li> I did notice a few small bumps like heat rash after using the oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the rosehip oil for the past few weeks</li>
            <li> I  like this oil as it is thick and stays put and doesn&#x27;t run down the side of your head or onto your face.</li>
            <li> Smells a little weird and the color is too yellow for me to put on in the morning before make-up.</li>
            <li> Usually, my skin looks pretty bad before I get dressed in the morning.</li>
            <li> For the past year or so, my skin will become scaly because of dryness</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just a skeptic; I know Teddie Organics is a small business</li>
            <li> As a product junkie, I admit I go overboard in mixing and matching just  to find products that deliver what they promise.  </li>
            <li> I have a small scar on my neck that I wanted to reduce the appearance of.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any improvement in my skin&#x27;s coloration (sun spots, acne scars, etc).</li>
            <li> Not sure this is doing anything.</li>
            <li> I only use 2 drops at a time and it does give my skin a faint, but noticeable orange tint that fades overnight.</li>
            <li> Plus since it is a small family owned business, I know its made in sustainably small batches which I am all about.</li>
            <li> I received the Rosehip oil and was so anxious to try it that I washed my face immediately and applied it.</li>
            <li> how could I not love it.</li>
            <li> They offered to send me something different if I was unable to get around the scent.</li>
            <li> I just received my rosehip oil a few days ago and am already seeing quite noticeable results!</li>
            <li> It does have a slight scent but nothing bad, it reminds me a little of vegetable oil or potato chips actually.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain the smell.</li>
            <li> so I have to rub it in really hard</li>
            <li> I hardly smell any odor with this brand of rosehip oil (Teddie Organics).  </li>
            <li> Since I have combination skin, I have always had a hard time balancing the oils and dryness of my skin while wearing makeup.</li>
            <li> I have only begun using this product on my baby&#x27;s chicken pox scars, but immediately, I can tell it is quality.  </li>
            <li> and there is nothing negative to add regarding this product.</li>
            <li> So my doctor prescribed another medication that supposed to be slow release</li>
            <li> just used it for one week now, my black spots , strechmarks and pigments have not gone,maybe it still soon,,, At first it smells awful</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s utterly ridiculous, the metro gel was going to cost me$300.00 out of pocket.</li>
            <li> , I started to use these on the bad areas on everyone in my family and I am noticing a big change in their eczema, they are going away!!!</li>
            <li> Lately my acne has been progressively getting worse.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot of the oil to cover your face and this is a rather thin oil</li>
            <li> You just wont go wrong believe me.</li>
            <li> cant go wrong with this oil...</li>
            <li> but that was organic and didn&#x27;t have any weird additives.</li>
            <li> My son has had a terrible case of eczema for several months.</li>
            <li> I wanted one that wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive</li>
            <li> My skin has been so dry from the insane cold this winter.  </li>
            <li> I have a very difficult time finding things that I can use on my face w/o a reaction.  </li>
            <li> Was very skeptical about using an oil on my face</li>
            <li> Went bad in the 1st month that I had it.</li>
            <li> I purchased it after being frustrated with the cost of medication.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I just received this oil today and am extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed ordering from them!</li>
            <li> The smell is so bad!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product is living up to its reputation! I have rosecea and I mix the rosehip oil with Vitamin E oil - and my skin is happy!</li>
            <li> great product,  a little goes a long way on combination skin,  makes my skin very soft , lovely product</li>
            <li> This is the best oil and moisturizer that I have ever used!!  For the past year or so, my skin will become scaly because of dryness and then when I put a moiturizer on my skin it will become irritated, red and itching.  I tried so many creams from QVC, HSN and other stores but was very dissappointed to find out that the creams will help for a day or two and then the problem wil come back again.  One day I was reading about different types of oils and their benefits. Since I have tried most of them without the results that I wanted and never heard of rosehip oit, I decided to try on this organic rosehip seed oil.  The most that I could loose was less than $20 dollars so I went for it.  Well, let me tell you.  Within two days, I realized that my skin was no longer irritated and red with the use of it.  On the third day, I noticed a little peeling.  I guess it was shedding out my old dry skin.  After that, my skin has become much softer and it is not dried or red anymore.  The other day, I tried to reintroduce some face cream on my skin with this oil and my face started to burn again.  From now on, I will no use anything else but this oil and add nothing to it.  I use it in the morning and night and it absorbs quickly.  When you first put it on, it is a little orange but the color goes away. I noticed that even when I put a little too much, my skin does not breakout or become too greasy.  I love this oil and will not change a thing on it.  I will be using this for a long time and I&#x27;m considering in tossing all my other oils and expensive creams. I highly recommend this oil to anyone. It greatly deserves a 5 stars!!</li>
            <li> So far so good--been using this product for about a week.  Does seem to minimize some of my lines.  I like that it only take a drop or two and that it doesn&#x27;t stay oily on your skin as it absorbs nicely.  I gave a bottle to my daughter and am waiting to hear her verdict on it as well.  Before this she has not used any moisturizer on her face.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  I am using it on an outbreak of rosacea with great success.  It definitely reduces the redness cause by this condition.</li>
            <li> absolutely fabulous!!!! works like nothing else to soften my skin and give a glow.</li>
            <li> EDIT: After emailing Andy and receiving a lot of reassuring information, I&#x27;m more confident about the legitimacy of this product and am really happy with TO&#x27;s willingness to communicate with customers. Once my current bottle runs out I&#x27;ll likely repurchase from here again. :)  Not super sure what to make of this. On one hand, it feels really nice on my skin and has seemed to help with the redness I have left over from some facial eczema. It also wears really well under makeup.  On the other hand, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s actually 100% pure RHS oil and think it may be cut with another oil, because when I went to go store it in the fridge (which is frequently advised to prolong shelf life), it separated and solidified. The color of RHS oil I&#x27;ve tried before has been a darker orange-red, while this is more light yellow, but that doesn&#x27;t mean much on its own. Maybe I&#x27;m just a skeptic; I know Teddie Organics is a small business and I respect that. Ultimately, I would like a completely honest response from the store owners whether this is in fact pure, because even if it isn&#x27;t, I do like this oil and would love to know its composition.  As an aside, I personally like the smell. It reminds me of something I used to smell in my mom&#x27;s stable- not &amp;#34;horsey&amp;#34; per se, but a little bit spicy and musky? That&#x27;s just my take on it, and while I find it pleasant I could see how others might not.</li>
            <li> Amazing! Will order again!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this oil. I&#x27;d heard good things about it and decided to give it a try and am so happy I did! I&#x27;ve actually had people tell me how beautiful my skin is looking which is lovely to hear at my age.  I use it once a day and only need a few drops to apply to my face and neck.  I appreciate that it&#x27;s organic and I love the dropper top which makes it easy and not messy to use.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Product shipped quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time.  Have started using a couple of drops on my face at night.  Too early to see results, but it seems to be really good quality.  Even after washing my face the next morning, my face was still soft during the day.  I&#x27;m going to try it on my nails as well.</li>
            <li> Great product so far. Already has helped safe my stretch marks. The quality of the product seems very good and the oil is very easy to apply. I apply 3 times daily to my pregnancy&lt;br /&gt;stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil to see how my skin would react to moisturizing oils instead of creams and lotions, and am very pleased so far. The smell is faint but definitely more reminiscent of vitamins than roses. Above anything, the customer service that I received from this seller was phenomenal; I received multiple friendly emails ensuring that I received and was content with my purchase. I am always glad to support small, family-owned businesses.</li>
            <li> What can I say? This product delivers! My sister-in-law is from Uraguay. She is very beautiful &amp; her skin is amazing, She is older than I am, &amp; I&#x27;m 53. She told me about the power or &amp;#34;Rosa Mostica&amp;#34; I had to research till I found out it was the same rose hips I grew up with, mom making jam, on Cape Cod in the &#x27;70&#x27;s. This brand is the best I&#x27;ve tried. It smells vaguely like beach roses, the oil is clean and perfectly tinted the color of the fruit. Most important, it does not clog or irritate my fussy skin. It refreshes moisture &amp; feels so natural &amp; clean. Thsank you so much for this amazing product.</li>
            <li> This oil is awesome! My skin looks brighter and smoother and no more dry patches. I&#x27;m 31 and starting to get wrinkles so I&#x27;m using this at night to nip that in the bud. Thank you for a high quality light oil for my face.</li>
            <li> I am using this Rosehip Oil in my line of skin care products. I love the wonderful smell, as well as its healing properties. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> wonderful product and quickly arrived</li>
            <li> Ive tried rosehip oil from a couple other brands, and none compare to this one. Very great quality and leaves me skin looking great and feeling smooth!</li>
            <li> UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using the product for a year now (ordered 3 bottles in total) and I&#x27;ve absolutely loved it until now. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed with the most recent bottle they sent me. It&#x27;s a light yellow color and has a greasy texture to it. Normally the rose hip oil I bought from this company in the past had a nice deep amber color and had a dry oil texture that absorbed immediately. This feels NOTHING like it used to. Hopefully this will sort itself out soon because I was very happy with the company and customer service in the past.&lt;br /&gt;______________________________________&lt;br /&gt;So I read so many amazing things about rosehip oil and was dying to try it but I was worried buying this product because reviews of other brands said the oil sometimes had a fishy or rancid smell and looked diluted with cheaper oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t like that AT ALL. It has a rich, amber color and it smells kind of nutty.. it&#x27;s hard to explain the smell. And it honestly makes my skin feel amazing.. I get hormonal break outs so I&#x27;m going to try it out for a couple months and follow-up with this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service has been outstanding and they even followed up after it shipped to make sure it got to me on time and without breaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall great experience. Will definitely buy this product again and will definitely use this company in the future. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got that rosehip smell and yellowness, so you know it&#x27;s good.  If you enjoy doing you face spa regimen, add this to your list.  You will not be disappointed.  It will give your skin a boost in extra softness that is velvety to the touch.  You don&#x27;t need much to do the job, just a few drops for the face, neck, hands, and decolletage preservation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had to stop using retin A, and I ended up switching for this to beneficial results.  Zero irritation, no hyperpigmentation, fades dark mark, makes my undereye area feel like rose petals.  I say this is a keeper for me.</li>
            <li> Very light weight oil that doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. My skin breaks out very easily with any kind of oil like argan, coconut, jojoba, etc. But this rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t at the same time my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;The color is amber, and the smell is not so pleasant. It smells like pumpkin seed oil.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying my rose hip oil!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been applying it directly to my face,&lt;br /&gt;And belly(stretch marks). I plan on making&lt;br /&gt;A face mask with it also :). I will definitely be&lt;br /&gt;Ordering more and soon because I accidently&lt;br /&gt;Spilled a good portion of the bottle :( oops!&lt;br /&gt;I am really enjoying the product.</li>
            <li> This oil may deserve 5 stars.  I am still in the test phase.  My trouble spots are actually fading some.  Mine are a combination of age, acne, sun damage, and minor scarring.  I scratch my cheeks at night while sleeping on my hands.  My left cheek had a noticible scar and after using this oil for 2 weeks,  I could see a difference. The sun damage on my cheeks has diminished some too.  Very pleased!!  I did notice a few small bumps like heat rash after using the oil.  They didn&#x27;t itch or burn, but were visible to me.  Not sure if I used too much or if it was a reaction with my other skin care products and makeup.  We put a lot stuff on our face just to preserve the youthful glow!  As a product junkie, I admit I go overboard in mixing and matching just  to find products that deliver what they promise.  If this is working like I think it is, I may eliminate or switch other products to find the right mix.  After all, I want more than just clean and toned skin.  I want clear and vibrant looking skin. This may be my new HG!!</li>
            <li> Great oil, not greasy, leaves skin soft. I&#x27;ve only been using 4 drops on my face morning and night for a week. So far my skin is very soft with no breakouts. I will give it some time to determine other benefits. I will definitely order other products from Teddie Organics. Their customer service is the best!</li>
            <li> Having stopped using rosehip oil for many months, I found this brand. It works just as well as my previous ones. Noticed scarring was reduced after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> This order arrived quickly and just as described!</li>
            <li> i love it its super moisturizing. i have added this oil to my hair care routine.</li>
            <li> Very good. Smells a little weird and the color is too yellow for me to put on in the morning before make-up. However, it is very rich and moisturizing  for night.</li>
            <li> I purchased this funny oil I knew nothing about for my boyfriend&#x27;s Rosacea. It bothers me more than it bothers him. He touches up his face with makeup when we go out or when I mention it. I&#x27;ve purchased so many products that have shown some results but I could never get him to buy more because he&#x27;s cheap. That&#x27;s what I think but he tells me he&#x27;s a Zit and so he&#x27;s worried about a break out. I must admit that some did make him break out. He was very concerned about using an oil but his sensitive skin reacted favorably with no breakouts and less redness. At this point I&#x27;ve given it 4 stars because he&#x27;s using it and it appears to be working better than anything we&#x27;ve tried so I really like it. Stay tuned. If its a cure, I&#x27;ll come back with 5 stars.</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! I have been using this daily on my face. I have noticed a vast improvement with the fine lines and wrinkles I have been blessed to have start to disappear. This may sound silly but one full line under my eye and to my temple has disappeared! This has helped dramatically with the adult acne I have been experiencing all my life as well. I usually have about 10 spots to cover up, but lately, it&#x27;s only one MAYBE two. There is a wonderful change in my appearance for the better. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. I have tried many similar but never received the great outcome like I have with this. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this! I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m just now learning about this natural moisturizer.</li>
            <li> love for dry skin !! I used it a lot especially for winter time !</li>
            <li> What a great product this Organic Rosehip Oil is!!! I did not know until purchasing this, how many issues that it would address, such as Dry or Itchy Skin or Scalp, Cracked Skin around Elbows and Heels, Ezcema, Rosacea, Dermatitis, Psoriasis, Redness and Uneven Skin Tone,&lt;br /&gt;Scars, Stretch Marks, Age Spots, Sun Damaged skin, Brittle Nails and Dry Cuticles.  I was so amazed and so excited to try it out for myself!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have many scars, from my young years as a tomboy, to the multiple surgeries in my adult years, and I was most interested to find out how it would work on them. And what is really amazing is it just takes a few drops a day on the area you would like to resolve your issue and as long as you do this daily, IT WILL WORK!!! After the short time I have used it, I can tell a considerable difference in the appearance of my scars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no matter what issue you may be having, if you try the Rosehip Oil, they are sure to be gone in no time at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received product(s)  in exchange for an honest review, which may differ from yours. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I used personally</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product for very long, but so far I am happy with the results!  Great moisturizer for the skin, and is also helping to reduce the appearance of some dark spots I have on my skin.  Am also very impressed with customer service from Teddie Organics.  Would order products from them again!</li>
            <li> Highly recccomemd this product! It has a nice light and non greasy texture that feels great on your skin. I have a small scar on my neck that I wanted to reduce the appearance of. Shortly after I started using the oil, the redness has gone down and the scar is definitely less visible. It is also a great moisturizer, definitely something needed during the cold months. Overall I’m very happy with this oil!</li>
            <li> I teceived this on Thursday and used it for the first time that night. The next day the scars I had massaged it on to were looking lighter. Since then I&#x27;ve used  morning and evening. It&#x27;s Sunday and my hyper pigmemtations and scars are quite a bit lighter. I will most definitely continue using (and loving!).</li>
            <li> This lovely Rosehip Oil is absorbed by the skin almost immediately.  I love the way it feels, my skin is so soft now. Best of all it is a pure product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing it everyday for a few weeks. It&#x27;s definitely non-irritating, gentle, and moisturizing but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve noticed any improvement in my skin&#x27;s coloration (sun spots, acne scars, etc). Will keep using though.</li>
            <li> I have not used this product long enough to see the benefits. However, it shipped fast and it smells nice too.</li>
            <li> So far, this has been a MIRACLE for my skin in just one week!!! Am so thankful I gave this a shot. Love the fact it is organic, as well.</li>
            <li> What an amazing oil, so many uses and naturally made from the earth, so often we spend a fortune on products that contain chemicals that disturb our immune system, everything we put onto our skin absorbs into the blood stream! I read all the benefits of this oil in my herbal books also my grandmother used rosehips for so many uses! I recommend it highly, especially for overall clarity of skin and easy absorption, and I love that it is natural and safe. I hope that everyone will  start to use more natural products topically, and do away with all the unnecessary toxins we are marketed to. Thank you! For letting me share.</li>
            <li> Customer service is A+..... The oil definitely softens my skin. I need more time to determine if it lightens scars etc.</li>
            <li> Feels good on my skin and light too</li>
            <li> Great! The texture feels great. It is the best organic Rosehip Oil I bought, so far.     Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as a moisturizer and I love it.</li>
            <li> This oil is high quality and effective. I&#x27;m so glad I bought it. I use it on my face at night and prefer it over the jojoba oil I was previously using. It soaks in smoothly.</li>
            <li> This is great. It has alot of great uses and isnt bad feeling.</li>
            <li> Helps with my dry skin. Couldn&#x27;t get thru winter without it!!</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Oil was exactly as I hoped it would be.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality.  Arrived on-time.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil! It&#x27;s extremely moisturizing, and has kept my skin so clear since I&#x27;ve started using it. Bottle is made very well, and doesn&#x27;t spill when turned over in luggage. I will continue to be a repeat purchaser of this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil on my skin since day one and I LOVE IT!!!! It has a great scent and moisturizes my skin perfectly without leaving it too greasy.</li>
            <li> Been using as a daily moisturizer for almost a month now ! Love it! Have already had compliments that I look younger!! Yay!!</li>
            <li> Too soon to see results, but I like the slightly thick consistency and how smoothly it applies.  I try to use it twice a day (along with Vit. C serum and a very light application of Argan oil).  And, of course, it&#x27;s organic--a giant plus to me.  Even if I don&#x27;t see fewer wrinkles, there is no way for rose hip oil to be anything but beneficial.</li>
            <li> i have been looking for an essential oil for my hair that does not need a carrier and thank goodness rosehip is one of those. since i have gone no shampoo, i have been looking for solutions for dry scalp, of which i have a problem with in the winter. a few warmed drops applied to scalp and preened makes my hair look amazing. i would recommend rubbing warm on scalp and then using a boarbristle brush to move from root to ends of hair.</li>
            <li> Great seller. Great product.</li>
            <li> Product worked well, I was worried that it would cause acne but it did not. My face is soft and clear. Product didn&#x27;t smell so I didn&#x27;t feel like I had perfume on. I was easy to apply and I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> For those with SENSITIVE/ROSACEA/SUN DAMAGED skin LISTEN morning and nights cetaphil gentle cleanser (not the one that says &amp;#34;for all skin types&amp;#34;) + Rosehip oil (teddie organics) as a moisturizer. You just wont go wrong believe me. One thing tho. there is a fine line between putting too little oil or too much oil on your face. if you apply the right amount of oil on your face, it will do wonders for you. I would recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> The texture of my face has improved.</li>
            <li> Teddie Organic Rosehip Oil is bottled in the USA and is 100% pure organic. Rosehip Oil is the only ingredient listed on the bottle. The bottle contains 1 fl. oz and the dropper top is sealed for your protection. Rosehip Oil helps to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles and stretch marks. It also helps to improve skin tone and elasticity. It only takes two or three drops morning and night on clean dry skin. This oil feels great when applied and goes right into my face, neck and décolleté.</li>
            <li> I mix this with a bit of Vitamin E oil after a good facial wash. My skin hasn&#x27;t glowed like it does in a long time.  Gread Product!!!</li>
            <li> I have tried many different rose hips oil on the market and this is by far the best. I use this as my daily moisturizer and have seen a huge improvement in the clarity of my skin. It&#x27;s cleared my acne, scaring and my overall skin texture is smooth and glowing. In my 30&#x27;s my skin is in the best condition of my life due to using rose hips oil daily. The owners are amazing as well, quick to respond to any product questions. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The Teddie rosehip oil is wonderful, it has done amazing things  for my skin. Thanks for a great product and I will be reordering from Teddie Organics soon.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that the family-owned business is so involved in your 100% satisfaction.</li>
            <li> I recently decided to go on a &#x27;face detox&#x27;, where I stopped using the billion face products in my daily beauty routine for a couple of weeks. I wanted to get back to basics, and I read on a minimalist beauty blog about the benefits of rosehip oil, so I hopped on Amazon to find some. I decided to go with Teddie Organics because of it&#x27;s great reviews and the right price point. I really like it! It smells great, and though I&#x27;m no expert, the quality of packaging and the product is excellent. I&#x27;ve applied it to my face directly and used it in conjunction with other products. I&#x27;ve also applied it to the back of my arms at night where I can get keratosis pillars (chicken skin) flare-ups, and my skin looks much calmer in the morning. My favourite use is adding a dropper-full of the oil to Moroccan ghassoul powder for a face mask. My skin feels amazing afterwards-- soft, smooth, hydrated and clean. I&#x27;m really getting sold on going back to using what Mother Nature provides, as I think using harsh chemicals makes it hard for your skin to self-heal and retain its equilibrium. So Teddie&#x27;s Rosehip Oil has definitely earned it&#x27;s place in my new and streamlined beauty regimen!</li>
            <li> I love this on my cuticles! It absorbs rather nicely. I&#x27;ve also used it on my elbows, on dark spots by my eyes and even on my lips. The ways to use this are endless and being organic is a total plus!</li>
            <li> Quick shipping. Great product.</li>
            <li> First time user of Rosehip Oil and so far, so good.  I only use it at night, since putting it on before applying make up did not work for me.  It&#x27;s a nice product, and it makes my skin silky soft, and  has not caused any breakouts for me.  I either use it straight up, or I use it mixed with my favorite night cream, either way I like it.  I contacted the company with a couple questions and they replied right away and were very helpful.</li>
            <li> I know there have been some comments about the smell of this oil, but I didn&#x27;t find them to be true for me. It&#x27;s pretty amazing what it does on my skin; absorbs easily, and moisturizes. I&#x27;ve used it to make a face cream, and I&#x27;m loving it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the rosehip oil on my extremely dry skin, it&#x27;s not often that I&#x27;m able to find a product that works well for keeping my skin hydrated.  The Rosehip oil has made a big difference in the way my arms and legs look and feel.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> You can never go wrong with rose hip oil! So great for my face! I love the dropper and that it&#x27;s housed in all glass container.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff. I&#x27;m not an avid user of skin products, but this oil really makes my skin feel great. I haven&#x27;t been using the product long enough to attest to all the claims, but from what I have noticed they are spot on. I was offered this product to try out in lieu of my honest opinion and review.</li>
            <li> This is a great product - it makes my skin feel soft and nourished. It can also be used for eczema, psoriasis, and loads of other dry skin problems. I&#x27;ve used this oil on my scalp and it seems to work well; it washes off nicely too. When putting this on your face, 3 drops is really enough (for me). It may feel like you&#x27;re not getting oil on every part of your face, but just keep massaging gently and it should work well. If you put too much on, your face will feel super greasy! Also a caveat: this oil doesn&#x27;t smell of roses, and has the color of iodine (it won&#x27;t stain your skin, though).&lt;br /&gt;An added plus is Teddie Organics&#x27; exceptional customer service!&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used this product long enough to see any long-term benefits, but I enjoy it so far!&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is doing anything. Strange orangey oil that makes my skin a different color so I have to rub it in really hard or I am streaked. Not sure this hard of rubbing is good for my face.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any positive results, though haven&#x27;t noticed any negative ones either. Review might be different if I had the opportunity to use it longer without the multiple emails from the company asking me to review it. I only use 2 drops at a time and it does give my skin a faint, but noticeable orange tint that fades overnight. I have been using it less than a week.</li>
            <li> My face dries out easily in this cold weather. Just a few drops goes a long way. I just put some on in the morning and another few drops at night and I haven&#x27;t had that dry feeling since</li>
            <li> i used different brands of organic rosehip oil.  but nothing like teddie organics.  the photo i attached, teddie organic&#x27;s oil is deeper in color, the one with the lighter color is from different brand.  the teddie organics oil is thicker and absorb by the skin very fast and doesnt feel greasy.  i will not buy other brands again.  love teddie organics making the oil so pure !</li>
            <li> The rosehip oil makes my skin smooth and poreless. The customer service is also excellent.</li>
            <li> Great - helped fade &#x27;age spots&#x27; on my hands!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed a difference in my skin but it does feel good on it.  I mix a couple drops in with my lotion and use it on my face under makeup.  It just feels good on the skin.</li>
            <li> The oil arrived on time and seems fresh. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days and don&#x27;t see much of an effect on my age spots yet. The reason for the four starts is the intense bright orange color of the oil. I don&#x27;t mind it on my skin and would like to use the oil at night but the bright orange color stains the pillowcases. I was aware of the color when I ordered the oil but thought it would be absorbed better and more quickly.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my scar that I have on my arm and feet. It really help smoothen the scar and soothes dry skin. I use this twice a day after shower. Very good product. recommended</li>
            <li> Slight smell as others have said but the product works wonderfully. It has helped clear up several dry patches in my skin. I do prefer the argon oil by this company though out of the two due to this having a slight yellow tinge to it and the other being clear. But it is a good a product!</li>
            <li> I agree with a few reviewers, it does have a somewhat fishy smell to it (which doesn&#x27;t bother me but might bother some). Either way, I LOVE the way this product feels on my skin.</li>
            <li> I  like this oil as it is thick and stays put and doesn&#x27;t run down the side of your head or onto your face. Has no odor. It is very yellow, but doesn&#x27;t seem to discolor skin.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal. Rosehip oil is one of the best skin products available and Teddie provides exactly what Im looking for in my rosehip oil: beautiful orangish color with warm almost earthy tones that my skin loves. Plus since it is a small family owned business, I know its made in sustainably small batches which I am all about. Thanks, guys &amp;keep it up!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Great customer service.  I&#x27;ve used other rosehip oil on my face, but the customer service from Teddie is incredible. They add a very personal feel to an online order, which will keep me as a customer.</li>
            <li> I just received this oil today and am extremely disappointed. The smell is so bad!!! It looks and smells like used vegetable oil from a deep fryer. I WILL BE returning this immediately….</li>
            <li> Love it! Teddie Organics is an awesome company to work with. My skin feels amazing.</li>
            <li> I have ordered rosehip oil before I used Teddie organics and I can tell you nothing compares to the quality of this product.!  It is the best product I have ever used.  What a difference  it made in my skin.  It absorbed quickly  and did not leave a greasy feel.  This product did not have that fishy smell like some there brands that sell rosehip oil.  I am extremely  picky when it comes to a quality product and trust me when I tell you this...  is the best with almost instant results to your skin.  I also felt like the price was  reasonable. The service was by far superior and the product shipped fast.  I will be loyal customer and can&#x27;t wait to try any other products they may offer.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and exceptional customer service ! Love using this oil, especially in this roughy winter weather.</li>
            <li> The sellers were really sweet and followed up to make sure I was 100% satisfied with the product and I was.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It feels nice &amp; smooth on my skin.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly in tip top shape. Very good product. Just right for my daily face moisturizer! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very good product, very good service!</li>
            <li> I bought this for skin care and it works beautifully. I have even toned, moisturized skin. I just put a few drops in my moisturizer every morning and night. I&#x27;ll never go without it again.</li>
            <li> i just bought another bottle of this. it is really good quality rosehip oil. i like that is has a dropper. i can always tell a difference in my skin when i run out of my roship oil.i have already posted a review for this, but i&#x27;m posting another just to reiterate. the seller is immediately available to you via email. it has almost no scent and it does everything rosehip oil says it is supposed to do. i tried my first bottle of this after my other brand was discontinued. i will keep buying this brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I am totally satisfied with the product and the service. Would definitely so business with this company again. Thank you</li>
            <li> Very smooth, silky, and odorless. Really only takes 2-3 drops. Feels wonderful. I added a few drops of essential oil ( geranium) because I wanted a light fragrance.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery, quality product. Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Great product, great company.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loving this product. I was worried about it making my skin oily as I am totally opposed to oil on my face but my skin feels and looks amazing! Will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Teddie&#x27;s Organic Rosehip oil is incredible.  I love the branding and the drip dispenser is extremely user friendly.  I put it on morning and night and it leaves my sometimes oily skin feeling soft and smooth, while soothing inflammation and redness.</li>
            <li> I have been using the rosehip oil for the past few weeks and I am very&lt;br /&gt;impressed. I love the oil but the customer service is even better. I appreciated&lt;br /&gt;their kind emails and information on their product. I would recommend this oil&lt;br /&gt;highly if you are looking to heal acne scars, dry skin or just an overall skin pick me up. I have noticed healing and softness in my skin. I am very pleased and&lt;br /&gt;will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Really great oil!  delivered quickly!  on</li>
            <li> I liked this oil, however, the smell and color where a bit much. My skin felt smoother after using it (but I did not see a change in my acne scars) but the risk of permanently staining my sheets and clothes wasn&#x27;t really worth it. There are other brands out there with less smell and dye.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a little over a month now, along with the teddy rose water toner. I don&#x27;t think my skin has ever looked or felt better. I no longer have pimples, my dark spots are fading, and the redness around my cheeks and nose is gone. Not only does my skin look great, it&#x27;s also baby soft in a way I didn&#x27;t believe was possible. Just FYI I have found that mixing one drop of this product with a regular amount of original ponds moisturizer has been more effective for me than just the product alone. I use this every night after washing with St. Ives apricot scrub and using the rose water toner. I leave this on all night and wake up with beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> Really great product! Love it!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine swears by this stuff so I did a little research before I actually got it. Apparently it is harvested from the seeds of rose bushes predominately grown in Chile. Rosehip seed oil is full of vitamins, antioxidants and essential fatty acids that are known to correct dark spots and hydrate dry, itchy skin, all while reducing scars and fine lines. You can use it pretty much anywhere on your body. I&#x27;ve been using on my face and hands to get rid of my dry winter skin. Since it is an oil I thought it would be greasy but far from it. My dry skin soaks it right up leaving me with silky smooth, soft skin. I love it so much I use it every day. If you are thinking about trying Rosehip oil I say Go For It! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic for dry skin.  I have very dry/cracked hands in the winter when the cold, dry air hits and I have to wash my hands so often.  I rub a few drops of this oil, either alone or in a carrier such as coconut oil and my hands are instantly better.</li>
            <li> Growing up in Germany I used to drink Rosehip tea and loved it a lot, knowing it is rich in Vitamin C and many others. Researching natural ways to improve on my bad (and daily) hair days, I came upon Rosehip oil. Now I am trying anything now - so I ordered a bottle - Teddie Organics had more &amp;#34;bang for their buck&amp;#34; and I am glad I chose this one. I can&#x27;t say yet that my hair is growing back - because it hasn&#x27;t been long enough - however, just the motion of doing something nice for myself - and using a substance that has no odd scent to it - makes it wonderful choice. For me it was hair care, and the rough spots on my elbows, which are healing now.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to looking younger every day!</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have combination skin and this oil does not cause me to have breakouts. It keeps my skin hydrated without being greasy.</li>
            <li> Love the oil. Doesn&#x27;t have that funky smell like other ones I tried. Takes a few minutes to be absorbed.&lt;br /&gt;Customer service was excellent, can&#x27;t ask for anything more.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My face feels smoother every time I use it!</li>
            <li> Expecting the amazing result.</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this for awhile before I reviewed it, and while it&#x27;s only been a few weeks, I have to say that I like it. The vendor is SUPER nice and helpful, and the product itself absorbs quickly, and hasn&#x27;t broken me out (which I was nervous about). I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ve seen any skin improvements yet, but I&#x27;m willing to keep using it for a while, and should it work out, I&#x27;d definitely re-purchase from this vendor.</li>
            <li> excellent company to buy from..customer service is wonderful..cant go wrong with this oil...its a must have...3 days and results are outstanding cant believe it have tried numerous items that have not helped but bam it works..thank you teddie organics for the opportunity to get and use this product lifelong customer</li>
            <li> I have only been using this for a few days and can already see and feel the difference in my face and neck. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Excellent customer service and quality product. will reorder and explore their other products</li>
            <li> It makes my skin extremely soft, especially when using it after toning. I hate the rancid fish smell that a lot of rose hip oils have, but this does not have that. I&#x27;m looking forward to effects after long term use.  ***EDIT: On my second bottle the color and smell vary. The first bottle had more of a yellow coloring and smelled so good, it was very nutty or like tea. But on my second bottle, there is no smell, or a faint scent that smells totally different than my last bottle. The color was also orange. Do they use coloring in their oils? It almost seems like a different oil entirely. Can someone shed light on this?</li>
            <li> I Love this stuff! I put it on my face at night before bed and I have already seen a difference. My skin looks smoother and feels so hydrated. I will definitely be buying this brand again. It is a great price for a great product!</li>
            <li> The customer service is amazing!  Andy emailed me almost right after I bought it to give me input on how to use and the benefits.  It&#x27;s an odd idea putting oil on your face but I&#x27;m giving it a shot.  It&#x27;s been about a week - I put it on my skin everynight but keep away from my chin since I&#x27;m prone to breakouts there.  I did put it on my chin the first night but the next morning woke up with a couple clogged pores - that&#x27;s probably just me though.  I have Impetigo (minor) and sometimes it flares up.  Once that clears up with my other prescription medicine, I&#x27;m going to try the Rosehip Oil there too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: if you think it smells like Roses, it does not.  That was something I wasn&#x27;t expecting... also its darker than I anticipated (kind of looks like iodine).  I don&#x27;t notice any benefits yet, but its only been a week.  I&#x27;m putting it on as directed and looking for improvements!</li>
            <li> I like the product but my skin got little red bumps after using it. My skin is very sensitive so it can&#x27;t tolerate many products. The oil dries quickly which makes it perfect for day or night.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> I love this product.  The customer service was amazing. Excellent product and service from a caring company.  I look forward to purchasing more products from you in the future! Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I tried this on my face and it made it a little bit too oily.  The smell reminds be of sea buckthorn oil.  I used it on a scar on my hand and noticed that it had faded a little.  Will use this on my scars.</li>
            <li> Excellent transaction! The rosehips seed oil arrived very quickly and was as promised.  I use it in conjunction with my coconut oil for an all body moisturizer and I love it!</li>
            <li> Great as a nighttime moisturizer. I suggest only using 1-2 drops at night at first if you have sensitive skin. I tried using it in the morning as well at first and my skin seems to prefer just once a day application. The customer service was excellent and I look forward to trying the jojoba oil as well :)</li>
            <li> Made my face break out! Had zits everywhere!!</li>
            <li> It does not moisturize oily.. so oily skin can use it  ... I have kinda dry skin and need  heavy mousturizer.. just used it for one week now, my black spots , strechmarks and pigments have not gone,maybe it still soon,,, At first it smells awful but i like the smell now... will review again like a month, to see the  impact by the grace of God.</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery! Great product - - thanks so much!! I highly recommend this vendor!</li>
            <li> I have only begun using this product on my baby&#x27;s chicken pox scars, but immediately, I can tell it is quality.  It is a nice, thicker consistency with the orange tint which I guess is the typical mark of purity for this oil; unlike a cheap version I have that has a mineral oil smell and is thinner. My baby&#x27;s skin is super soft after applying this and it absorbs nicely.  The company, Teddie Organics, followed up with me immediately following my order. I then received another personal email from the company letting me know that my order was on the way.  They followed up with a few more emails thereafter to make sure it was received and that I was happy with the product.  Plus,  an email with ideas for uses for the oil.  Impressive!  Needless to say, they have a great product with excellent follow up/customer care.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed ordering from them!</li>
            <li> I used the teddies Rosehip oil and it&#x27;s very nice I definitely see a difference on  my age spots on my hands and my scars from surgeries and I&#x27;ll continue  to buy from Teddie  ,The company is great and ,,I give thumbs up  and all 5 stars  thank you    Gina</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, great product. I use this as a facial moisturizer. Smell is a bit nutty and not my favorite, but my skin looks great after I use it.</li>
            <li> I have never used rose hip oil before.  Especially with this cold stormy winter,  I find this oil is soothing,  calming  and makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> Leaves the skin amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> I love my rosehip oil! I put it on right before bed and it makes my face so smooth in the morning. It&#x27;s especially good for this winter weather where dry skin is the worst!</li>
            <li> Great product and great service! It&#x27;s family owned so the person contacts you to make sure you got it and everything&#x27;s okay with the product. The oil is great -  I use it on my face at night and it&#x27;s really moisturizing for my dry face.</li>
            <li> I chose this product based on the quality of preparation (organic, cold pressed, no additives, amber bottled), and was pleased when it initially arrived. The oil is moisturizing without being greasy, and smells like it should. After a few weeks of using the rosehip oil, my skin looked clearer and felt smoother. I am very pleased, will order again, and have already recommended to a friend.</li>
            <li> I Love this product! Super moisturizing and I can layer other products on top of it :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about the benefits of Rosehip or oil but this is so orange that it stains everything.</li>
            <li> I have been mixing a few drops into my daily moisturizer in the mornings and it really makes my skin look dewy without feeling heavy or oily.&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This oil smells good, is not heavy and seems to be working very well.  My skin feels very soft after using it.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders on skin! Teddie Organics contacted me upon purchase and followed up later to confirm that I had received the product and provided suggestions for use. Amazing customer service, this is why I like buying from smaller companies! This is definitely a high quality oil and it will last me quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Bought it for a scar after surgery and found out that it is also recommended for the face.&lt;br /&gt;Great results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen great results in just a week!</li>
            <li> Not oily,soaks in to skin fast. It is organic so the smell is not like a rose, so I put a drop of lavender oil with it for added skin conditioning and smell.</li>
            <li> Love the product, shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this rosehip oil for almost three weeks now and can honestly say this stuff is amazing! I purchased it to try and help reduce a scar I have on my face and even though its only been a few weeks, I have noticed some lightening already. And this stuff makes my face glow. I did experience some tiny bumps on my cheek and forehead, not always so this could just be my skin purging and adjusting but definitely have to say overall this product is wonderful. And the customer service I&#x27;ve received has been top notch, they reach out to you and answer any questions you may have. I&#x27;m so happy I found this company and can&#x27;t wait to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I bought this a to use as a moisterising face oil. So far I like it and it&#x27;s help resolve the dry patches I had. I put it on my boyfriend and it did ab incredible job of clearing up and soothing the dryness and irritation he had on his cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;As for this specific oil, I spent a long time agonizing over which brand to buy. I wanted one that wasn&#x27;t crazy expensive but that was organic and didn&#x27;t have any weird additives. This brand is perfect. It is the orange color rosehip seed oil is supposed to be and has only a very faint smell (rancid oil smells like strong fish apparently). I&#x27;m really satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> Product arrived as promised in good shape and ready to use. Great service and will order more when needed.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing! I use it every morning and every night! It really does help with the wrinkles but most importantly the scars! I will definitely buy this product again before I run out!! Worth buying! A+</li>
            <li> Goes on easy. Only time will tell of the effectiveness, I suppose. Delivered quickly and with no issues.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands and am most impressed with this one. The oil has a deep color and it is not watery. I think I found the holy grail.</li>
            <li> First time using rosehip oil and I love it. It provides moisture without being oily and has already helped diminish acne scaring. I love that it is organic, unrefined, and cold pressed with no fillers...thank you Teddie Organics!</li>
            <li> Helped prevent and rid Candida infection in corners of mouth/lips. Perfect lip balm, especially at bed time:  use the dispensing hand to drip one drop of oil onto the back of the opposite hand, then using my index finger of the dispensing hand I dab the oil on the corners of my lips, then rub over the rest of the lip area, Lips stayed super soft this past winter with almost no chapping. I also noticed that rose hip oil (perhaps from all the vitamin C?) helped heal and prevent Candida infections in the cracked corners of my lips which I sometimes get when my blood sugar is too high.</li>
            <li> I am in love with Teddie Organics rosehip oil. I&#x27;m a big fan of using RH oil in place of facial moisturizer... The Teddie Organics RH oil seems to absorb better into my skin with less greasy residue than other brands I&#x27;ve used. My skin feels more hydrated, and less oily! Leaves my skin with just a perfect natural &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; look. This is also the best smelling RH oil I&#x27;ve used! Other brands can kind of smell like a weird beer... But the Teddie oil actually has a nice bread/green tea smell to it. (My boyfriend jokingly tells me I smell like sexy hot tea right after I&#x27;ve applied it.) I&#x27;ve already gone through two bottles-- thanks, Teddie Organics.&lt;br /&gt;(Note, I was not paid to write this nor did I receive free products in exchange for this review. This stuff is just my jam- it&#x27;s awesome.)</li>
            <li> see all of its benefits. Will update this review after using product for a longer period of time. Been using this Rose hip oil for about a week. Bought this oil because I have rosacea and it&#x27;s supposed to help. Have noticed a decline in redness from using this oil and the rosewater. Haven&#x27;t been using product long enough to see all of its benefits. Will update this review after using product for a longer period of time</li>
            <li> Compared to other brands of Rosehip oil I have used the quality of the oil itself is sooo much better. I have only been using it for about a week and I can already notice a difference in the way my skin feels and looks. Will for sure be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> Just started using this but I like how it feels so far</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this for a couple of weeks, in place of my nighttime moisturizer and mixed with my daytime moisturizer. I&#x27;ve waited to post a review to see if it affected my occasional hormonal breakouts. I&#x27;m thrilled with how soft and supple my skin appears, how smoothly my makeup goes on (I wear very little), and how the fine lines around my eyes and along my neck seem to be increasingly less noticeable. My husband says I&#x27;m glowing! My skin isn&#x27;t greasy at all, and I think my occasional breakouts were even less than usual--my skin is soft, dewy, and clearer than before. Hooray!&lt;br /&gt;I also used this rosehip oil as a carrier for essential oils I applied to my daughter who has some fresh scarring from a recent skin infection.  This seemed to help those oils penetrate deeper and to be more effective with reducing her scarring and helping her tender skin to heal. I noticed significant improvement within two applications!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty sure that rosehip oil is a keeper for us, and I&#x27;m very pleased with Teddie Organics. They are a small company (with a great product), and, judging from their follow up after my purchase, they seem to be very committed to customer satisfaction. I&#x27;d definitely purchase from them again.</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Saw results the first time of use. I can&#x27;t wait to see the results months down the road.</li>
            <li> Great experience, honest and caring seller... wonderful product, is working nicely on my dry skin:).  Will definately buy again!</li>
            <li> This product is fabulous, it is very smooth and has a very pleasant subtle smell that doesn&#x27;t linger. I use on my hands as well as my face as I have very dry skin and sometimes mix in a couple of drops into my moisturizer. I really like how the product makes my skin feel silky smooth without feeling oily. A little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> I have not used it long enough to give a decent review.  It arrived in good time and well packaged.&lt;br /&gt;What I can say is that it absorbs well and there is nothing negative to add regarding this product.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail and was so excited to use it. I&#x27;ve suffered from acne for years and now that it&#x27;s gone, all it&#x27;s left was acne scars. Once I tried it, it was refreshing to my face and by the few times I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve noticed a slight change. I can&#x27;t wait to see what the final outcome will be!</li>
            <li> Great product and service from the company!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I&#x27;m impressed with the results. Only after a few days I notice my face is smoother and it feels good!! It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily as others I have tried. I have a small scar above my lip and will update on how that is improving as time goes.</li>
            <li> It´s a very light oil, I love to use it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good moisturizer; I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s my bad nose or what, but to me the oil is odorless, which I don&#x27;t mind. I&#x27;ve only just started using it but I think it works well and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy when applied. I only need 5 drops for my face, so this small bottle is a good size for me since I go through skincare products slowly.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Makes my skin soft and smooth and it looks like it&#x27;s glowing. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This oil is really wonderful!  I am so happy I found this company because their oil smells nutty and earthy and undeniably fresh to me.  I will be ordering this brand forever.  I mix it with avocado oil after I oil cleanse my skin.  I do feel like my skin is looking better and I have only used it for three days. Thanks very much Teddie Organics!</li>
            <li> Seems to be exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Went bad in the 1st month that I had it. It does NOT have the USDA organic seal, like in the photo.&lt;br /&gt;I will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> The package is good in the amber bottle</li>
            <li> great oil but my brown spot didn&#x27;t fade. it&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work for me but nice oil made my skin super soft and i have oily skin.No breakout.</li>
            <li> Love the oil! It arrived in a timely manner and was well-packaged. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I received the Rosehip oil and was so anxious to try it that I washed my face immediately and applied it. It did not feel oily or greasy at all and left my skin glowing and silky soft. I have been using it every day since and can see a vast difference in the fine lines and dark spots on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a wonderful product. I will share this with all my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards&lt;br /&gt;Joan Benson</li>
            <li> leaves your face so soft and learned no to use too much.  it  only takes 3-4 drops</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:40b4a57bf3da68575a4f13da618c4fec]]I have heard about how great rosehip oil is great for our skin. With everyone including my 2 year old having eczema, I was looking for a nontoxic, organic treatment for us. I have tried prescription creams and nothing seem to work, I started to use these on the bad areas on everyone in my family and I am noticing a big change in their eczema, they are going away!!! I have also used this on my dry, peeling skin due to the dry winter season, I have noticed the peeling stop and my skin especially around my fingers are not dry and is healing. I highly recommend this to those with eczema&#x27;s, other skin issues and skin scars. The oil is not very greasy and absorbs into the skin, which is great for my 2 year old who hates those greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> This product is just totally amazing. It has helped my skin feel so much more smoother. It is very soft to touch now. Also I have noticed less wrinkles. I did not know this product existed and I am totally grateful for it. Thank you so much for creating it. I will be buying this product again in the future.</li>
            <li> This is one great an awesome item and I am glad I got it because I love it. It is pure pressed rose hip oil it is all natural. I lve anything that is good for you. Items that are organic or natural items are great for your body and this is the greatest it makes me feel so good. It does so much for my body when I take it or use it. It moisturizers my whole body and make it feel so smooth and young again. It is great for my face also and does wonders for my hair and nails. I am so glad when I see people they tel, me I look anywhere from 5 to 10 years younger and that make me feel like I am on top of the world. Thanks for making such a great item.</li>
            <li> I love this rosehip oil&lt;br /&gt;it is very good results, in a few weeks I have seen very good results&lt;br /&gt;It is a little greasy because it is an oil after all but not too much so at the end the skin feels so soft that that it is totally worted&lt;br /&gt;Also because it is a natural product is better than other creams and product</li>
            <li> Got this to put on a scar from thyroid surgery and it is wonderfull. Just after 2 weeks of use the scar isn&#x27;t red anymore at all and i can tell a big difference. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> TEDDIE Organics Rosehip oil is great for stretch marks. I applied 3 times a day for a week now and the marks are definitely lighting up. The elasticity is returning in the area. My skin feels soft and rejuvenated. I recommend this product for anyone that needs repair of skin issues.</li>
            <li> I use this oil under my makeup, as a moisturizer on my body, and even on my hair 😊</li>
            <li> Great product...I use this at night on my face and neck as a PM treatment.  Makes my skin smooth and softens my fine lines.  Not greasy and goes right into the skin, just a drop covers whole face. Organic and natural no chemicals perfect for sensitive skin like mine...Will order again</li>
            <li> Fine product, indeed! I love the soft feel of my skin after application and can see a difference in the lines and texture of my skin. Will certainly reorder this product!</li>
            <li> I love this rosehip oil.  At first I was shocked by its deep amber color, but upon more research I learned that this was normal.  I have combination skin, and I feel like the oil has really evened out my skin.  I also love it for when I&#x27;m especially dry, I put it on at night and wake up with perfectly hydrated skin - much easier to apply make up!  Also, the people at Teddie were really great about answering my questions.  Overall, super happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I just got into essential oils and I am so glad I got this one, love it! :)</li>
            <li> This is epic! It combats rough winter skin. Smooths lines and works as a lip balm!</li>
            <li> I love how my skin feels since I started using this Rosehip Oil.  It is softer and definitely not as dry.  This time of year my skin is usually so dry it is ridiculous but not this year.  My grandmother used to use this stuff and I always thought it was for old ladies.  Ha!  Well either I am now an old lady or we, as a society, have finally gotten hip to the oils and what they can do for us.  I prefer to think the latter is the truth.  Rosehip Oil can be used for so many things...as a matter of fact when I placed my order Teddie Organics sent me an email with an attachment full of info about the oil itself.  I&#x27;ve been using this all over, in my bath and around my eyes but my favorite place to use it is on my dry cuticles.  I can see a difference already.  I&#x27;m loving this product.  (Thanks Gramma...wish I had listened to you a long time ago.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always willing to try new skincare products, and this is by far one of my favorites!  I instantly noticed the difference in my skin once I started using this.  When I wake up, my face is so soft and supple, and this has definitely given my skin a glow.  My skin was becoming dull and lifeless and I&#x27;ve gotten numerous compliments since I added this to my regimen!  Very happy with my purchase!!</li>
            <li> my daughter and i have eczema and this works wonders for our dry sensitive skin. after using this a few weeks the severe dry skin ive been struggling with on my legs for over a year has improved greatly. my daughter used to have such dry itchy skin on her cheeks that she would constantly scratch at it taking the skin off and all. now her cheeks are completely cleared up. this definitely soothed it and helped her to heal up. it works great for your hair as well, just a drop or so massaged through damp hair adds a nice shine without making it greasy. the smell is very pleasant as i expected. i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Lately my acne has been progressively getting worse. I had read on multiple websites that this oil may help clear it up some, and it did.&lt;br /&gt;Of course it has only been a few days, but I have noticed my skin becoming clearer slowly.&lt;br /&gt;I have decided to switch from face lotion to this, and it has been pretty beneficial so far!</li>
            <li> Great Product! It feels &amp; smells wonderful! Put it on a clean face before bed &amp; wake up glowing! I have very sensitive skin &amp; am very prone to breakouts. I have had no problems with this product!</li>
            <li> Great product and great company! Will buy again!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> Such a great product! I have naturally oily skin so I was hesitant of adding more oil to it, but this product actually balanced my natural oil. Also minimize my pores and made my skin tone even. I&#x27;m hooked on this product such a great purchase!!</li>
            <li> Love love this product. Used for about 5 days now and I am already hooked. Made such a difference in my skin in such a short time..how could I not love it. Skin is softer. Light lines I had around my eyes are already fading. Great stuff and great company.</li>
            <li> This has helped bring relief to my dry itchy elbows and softened my cuticles during this winters dry heat.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great quality product that I got when it was discounted. I would highly recommend Teddie&#x27;s organic rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly as described. It was on time. It is a quality product. Exactly what I expected which is always good. I will definitely reorder this product from this supplier again.</li>
            <li> I think I am in love. The Teddie rosehip seed oil arrived exactly on the day promised. The rosehip oil is packaged nicely with a dropper which is extremely helpful. The rosehip oil is light , is considered a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; oil and emollient. I have added it to my moisterizer and using it as an eye make up remover as well. This is a must have product if you are over the age of 20.  I have searched for a product  like this forever. I also like the earthy scent to it. Rosehip oil is helpful in removing sun spots so that experiment is in progress. The correspondence from the Teddie company is awesome ,,, felt like someone was there helping me the whole time. Did I mention that my skin looks really good and healthy???</li>
            <li> The rosehips makes the skin look smoother</li>
            <li> Love this oil.I apply at night. My skin looks better in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping, great communication. Great seller. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Looking forward to buy again.</li>
            <li> I put it on before I go to bed at night and wake up with super soft face/skin.  LOVE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve constantly had battles with my skin (acne) and this past winter I switched to all organic products which really helped, but made it made my skin extremely dry. I heard about Teddy Organics Rosehip Oil and how it helps suppress the dryness yet still nourishes your skin while evening the tone. Day three going strong, it feels and looks really great, glowy and healthy! It goes on right under my makeup without any issues problem. (I used about three-four drops on my T-zones every night and morning) It helps the dryness and gives it that nice natural glow under my makeup. I am a very natural wearing makeup person so this kind of product suited me best! A++ (If you have a tendency to have super oily skin easily I would use it just at night time.)</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of how rosehip oil smells but mix it with argan oil by teddie organics it makes a huge different! it feels good on the skin and not greasy at all. I used it for nighttime moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Received my oil quickly. Initially put off by the natural scent which to me smelled unpleasant. Communicated with Andy from Teddie Organics, and it was suggested to mix with an essential oil to change the scent. Tried a couple different kinds of oils with it now, really like wild orange with it. Plus as Andy said, the Orange is high in vitamin C! Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to review the benefits but will update that later.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough about the customer service from this company. They offered to send me something different if I was unable to get around the scent. Totally stood behind their products in the kindest of ways</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! It does have the Rosehip &#x27;smell&#x27; and color - which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all because I use it at night, and the results are definitely worth it. And such a cute little label/bottle!</li>
            <li> Great product! I love how my face feel now, soft and smooth. The best part is the company, they care enough to email me before and after I received the product to inquire how well I like it and if there&#x27;s any thing they can do. I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> Had trouble with skin care products all my life, untill I came across this gem. I tried coconut oil, avacado oil, olive oil &amp; they all made me break out! I simply use 2-3 drops of this at night after washing my face &amp; wake up GLOWING, red marks deminishing, wrinkles less defined, and overall smooth skin tone. I LOVE YOU TEDDIE ROSEHIPS OIL.</li>
            <li> I started using this Rosehip Oil about a month ago and I have already seen amazing results! I have acne scars all over my cheeks and can see a noticeable difference in the pigmentation since using this oil. Due to the color I apply it in the mornings to prevent staining and it works great to avoid breakouts since my skin is very prone to acne. Although this is my first time using Rosehip Oil, I would highly recommend this brand because of the great results and the very friendly owners who went above and beyond to make sure it made it on time and was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Great oil !! Will order more . Thanks</li>
            <li> Nice texture, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin too oily after application and sinks into skin after a few minutes.  I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the scent, but I&#x27;m getting used to it.  I mix it with my night cream so it masks the scent a little. It came quickly, too. Bonus!</li>
            <li> My face does look less discolored.</li>
            <li> Im loving this product! So far, this rosehip oil has surpassed coconut oil as part of my skin and hair care routine. It absorbs far better and quicker than coconut oil does, and does not leave an oily residue on your skin after using. It also doesnt make you &amp;#34;water repellent&amp;#34; as I noticed coconut oil did when using it as a shaving oil (although I would not recommend that use for this oil). It has not made me break out (as coconut oil did) and Ive actually noticed my skin is a little clearer! I also use it on the ends of my hair to prevent split ends and it definitely does not weigh it down. It does have a slight scent but nothing bad, it reminds me a little of vegetable oil or potato chips actually. I dont think I have been using it long enough (1 week) to say that it has done anything for my wrinkles though. All in all, great product!</li>
            <li> Lovely product! Smells great, goes on smoothly, and makes my skin feel fantastic.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a very timely manner.  It was well packaged with no damage or leakage.  Understanding that I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to report long-term use results, I can say that so far I&#x27;m enjoying it and have had absolutely no adverse effects.  I use it on my face and elbows and can see some improvement in the dry skin on my elbows.  I already had a positive regimen in place for my face and feel that this oil is a good complement to my other skin care products.  I wouldn&#x27;t describe this as a dry oil, but neither is it greasy nor does it leave an oily residue.  It absorbs quickly.  At this point I would say that this is a product that I&#x27;d reorder when this bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> I have been using Rosehip Oil on my face, neck, and chest and have seen a HUGE difference in the last 3 weeks. My skin looked better after 3 days. It is softer, smoother, clearer, and my sun spots are fading. I had issues with breakouts on my chest and neck and within 2 days my skin was clear. When I wash my face, it even feels cleaner. The first week I used it once a day. Now I use it twice a day and do not use any other products on my face except eye cream and sunblock. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product and how much my skin has changed in such a short amount of time. I love it! I order many items from amazon and this is the first time that a company contacted me before I received the product (to make sure that I received it in good condition) and they answer any questions that I have, immediately.  I hope that this review helps answer any questions about Rosehip Oil. This is the first time that I have ever written a review on a product/item. I am that impressed and happy with it.</li>
            <li> After two days the dryness on my forhead disappeared. So far so good</li>
            <li> I bought the rosehip oil to help with rosacea.  It seems to be helping somewhat, but I really feel a difference in the softness of my skin. It doesn&#x27;t feel so dry anymore, and actually seems to be helping my skin tone even out.</li>
            <li> Purchased this oil specifically to see if it would clear up some stubborn sun damage after trying many things that did not help.  I have been using this oil for a little over two weeks and it is phenominal.  The sun damage is barely noticible already.  I love wearing the oil under my makeup too.&lt;br /&gt;It makes the makeup look so natural and w/o oily skin.  Also, customer service is second to none.  I will be a repeat customer!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:2e27befaf356f7c3474293c630b3c611]] If you are looking for a great all purpose oil, this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally use it in my hair because of my split ends, though you can use it anywhere that you may need a little extra moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just take a drop or two and apply it to where you need the moisture the most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be intimidated by the color: it does come straight from the bottle orange. You just need to massage it in where you need it and the color will fade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite way to use it is after I wash my hair, when my hair is still a little damp so it absorbs quickly. If you are going to use this as a facial moisturizer, I suggest using it the same way after your toner, when your face is still slightly damp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also use this as a cuticle oil before you do an at home manicure, just remember to wash your hands well after you&#x27;ve let it set so your nail polish won&#x27;t peel off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel that this is a very versatile oil, you just need to figure out your favorite way to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This bottle has a glass dropper so you can get the precise amount of oil you desire. It makes it very easy to get just the perfect amount. You can apply it directly to the area like I do with my hair, or put a few drops in your hands and then apply. It&#x27;s really easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave you with an oily residue.</li>
            <li> Great product, makes me skin feel moisturized and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil. The smell is not bad. Compared to all other oils I have used on my face, this oil has the best feel. It absorbs nicely. I can use it both in the morning and evening. It&#x27;s also good thing that I can use around my eyes. I have used only for a week so can&#x27;t comment on the effect but doesn&#x27;t irritate even very sensitive skin. I will continue to use and definitely order again</li>
            <li> Absolut perfect quality.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week so far on its own and I love it!! Makes my skin look healthier.&lt;br /&gt;I am planning to use it now as a carrier oil for a homemade serum with Eden Gardens Age Defy Blend.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a short amount of time. Very pleased  with that. I have used it about 2 times a day for a few days now for my dry skin and my skin is much softer now. Hoping it will help fade some of my scars too, but only time will tell. I&#x27;ve used it in my hair and it has helped to soften it too. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and will update if I see or don&#x27;t see changes in my scars.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help heal a scar over my eye but then I decided to try it all over my face.  I did not expect the compliments I received only a few days after starting to use this oil!  Several people spontaneously told me how great my skin looked.  One person even asked me if I was wearing some new makeup or something - and I didn&#x27;t even have any makeup on!  It is working to reduce the appearance of the scar as well.  I don&#x27;t understand why so many people are complaining about a smell.  I hardly smell any odor with this brand of rosehip oil (Teddie Organics).  Maybe a slight earthy or nutty smell but it does not seem fishy at all.  Compared to something like Neem oil this has no smell and my husband didn&#x27;t smell anything either.  I can see the benefit of having the eye dropper included by Teddie bc this makes application easy.  You don&#x27;t need a lot of the oil to cover your face and this is a rather thin oil so the dropper helps you control how much you use.  It absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue.  I have a very difficult time finding things that I can use on my face w/o a reaction.  I had basically given up on finding something like this for my skin and I am so glad that I tried it!  Leaves it dewy soft, glowing, beautiful.  No exaggeration, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Really good oil, good service, great products</li>
            <li> This is such a light nice oil, in a simple tidy bottle. I love this product and look forward to trying all that are offered now and in the future from Teddie Organics.&lt;br /&gt;Super fast shipping to boot!</li>
            <li> Excellent gives a dewy look and helps crows feet.</li>
            <li> I bought this being a skeptic, and I am beyond pleasantly surprised.  I had stitches on my chest from a biopsy and thought I&#x27;d give it a shot on diminishing the appearance of my scar.  I&#x27;ve only been using it over a month, and even my boyfriend noticed how much lighter my scar was.  I started using it on my face and noticed my face was a bit less greasy during the day, and that some of my dark spot from acne had lightened.  Will definitely recommend this and keep it in my routine!</li>
            <li> Lovely rosehip oil! I am a fan! Love that it&#x27;s organic and I do t have to worry about applying this oil to my skin. All the wonderful qualities of rosehip oil with the added bonus of being organic. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I can use it in the morning and because it absorbs so well into my skin my makeup goes on smooth and I don&#x27;t get that greasy look.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it along with the Rosehip water. I purchased it after being frustrated with the cost of medication. I went to a dermatologist and the antibiotics were not working. So my doctor prescribed another medication that supposed to be slow release but my insurance would not cover it. The price was literally $1000.00 for a 30 day supply. That&#x27;s utterly ridiculous, the metro gel was going to cost me$300.00 out of pocket. I am 38 years old and began getting Roseacia. I hope I spelled that right, anyhow I thought something has got to work that is not going to cost me a fortune, I mean back in the day, what did our ancestors do???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I searched online and found some reviews and YouTube videos about the benefits of Rosehip oil. I found this brand on Amazon and based on the reviews I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, I wish I took pictures! My face is glowing and there is no more red blotches or bumps. It&#x27;s smooth as a baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The owners are so friendly and very prompt on questions and the email response!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I used the toner and oil and saw a difference in my skin overnight. Went sans makeup the next day!</li>
            <li> I looove teddie organics rose water spray. .but I&#x27;m head over heels in looove with this rose hip oil!!! I spray the rose water on my face then a couple drops of rose oil this is all I need. .I have oily acne prone skin and I was really afraid to try this because my skin usually doesn&#x27;t react well with any kind of oil but I really needed something for my dry under eyes I&#x27;m 25 but my under eyes are like a desert but most products I use bother my eyes. .after a week of use 2 times a day I definitely see a big difference..smoother and brighter just moisturized..so I decided to start using this on my face and I&#x27;m happy I did because it really smoothes the skin and gives it a radiant glow. .I have not had any new break outs which I&#x27;m very suprised. .this oil is not oily well maybe if you put a lot on but for me it just absorbs right into my skin. .it doesn&#x27;t have a smell well maybe kind of sweet oil like smell. .this is just perfect!!! I think everyone needs to try this. .I will be repurchasing this for the rest of my life!!! Lol</li>
            <li> excellent quality product, arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Its a great product, but for some reason has a little thicker consistency than other rosehip oils I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far after 1 week of everyday use as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great company! Really love the product and loved that they care about their customers. Also, really appreciated the PDF customer guide for the product. Would totally recommend this company and will be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been paying close attention to the ingredients in my cosmetic products lately, and focusing on using products that supply my skin with the nutrients it needs to look and feel it&#x27;s best. Teddie Organic Rosehip Oil has become my new nighttime ritual. I wash my face and apply the Oil to my damp skin as indicated on the bottle. The next morning after my first use, I immediately noticed how soft, supple, and glowy my face was. Highly recommend! I will purchase again!! Teddie Organics has stellar customer service!! Quality products with quality service!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product!  It is really great for my face and I have been using it for over a month with good result.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually really enjoying this addition to my regimen. I add it to my Lush facial moisturizer in the evening before bed and at the advice of a YouTube makeup artist, I&#x27;ve started adding a drop to my foundation in the morning. Makes for a really nice, subtle look. My skin seems softer and smoother. I&#x27;ve really tried to get away from heavy chemical facial products and am happy with this all natural oil. I think it&#x27;s a little soon for a 5 star rating but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I just received this carefully packaged organic oil...AND I love it!  Was very skeptical about using an oil on my face but this is divine!  Instantly absorbs, odor free, perfect food for your skin.  Only need a few drops for your face but I use on my legs , arms etc.  The other great thing...this is a company who REALLY cares and for me that makes a world of difference.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> I like the Rosehip Oil. It makes my hands feel soft. I have mixed it with coconut oil and I&#x27;m using it on my face it makes my face feel smoother. I&#x27;m hoping in time, it will help with the wrinkles and fine lines.</li>
            <li> I received wonderful service from this small mom and pop company. Even before my package arrived, I received an email from the company inviting me to notify them if the product didn&#x27;t arrive in excellent condition and listing some ways I can use the oil. I purchased it to add to a facial moisturizer recipe. However, the email from the company said it also helped with eczema. My son has had a terrible case of eczema for several months. I decided to try the rosehip oil on it. After adding a couple of drops to coconut oil twice a day for 4 days, his eczema is almost gone!</li>
            <li> Love this oil. It&#x27;s great and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the personalized service from Teddie Organics.  Too soon to tell whether it is making a difference on my skin - I hoping to fade dark spots.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more, quick shipping</li>
            <li> Very good!  High quality!</li>
            <li> Great quality! Arrived in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> A lovely product. Beautiful amber colored oil with a light, natural smell akin to apricots. A nice addition to my skin care regimen. I personally oil cleanse at night with hemp oil and then moisturize with a couple drops of hemp oil and a couple drops of this rosehip oil. As someone who has a history of acne and generally irritated skin, this is the best looking my skin has been since childhood.</li>
            <li> So far, I find this to be an excellent essential oil...have been using it as part of my skin care moisturizing and I think I can tell a big difference, especially around the under eye skin.</li>
            <li> I have read great things about Rosehip oil and Teddie Organics does not disappoint.  The product is fantastic. My skin has been so dry from the insane cold this winter.  I have been using it on both my hands, nails and face.  Its great, immediate improvement in skin, definitely better than any hand lotion you will find.  I am going to pick up a second bottle for my friend who is pregnant.  Considering how well rosehip oil is working for me I am sure it will help out with stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Great product &amp; customer service.</li>
            <li> I love the oil and use it every day for my face. Results are amazing!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. I have suffered from acne since I was 11 years old. I am now 26. As you can Imagine, I have aquired some pretty bad scars and discoloration over the years. This product not only has helped with my scars in the few weeks that I have been using it, but it is helping my acne as well. Yesterday morning, my boyfriend actually asked me if I was wearing makeup while we were eating breakfast in our kitchen. Usually, my skin looks pretty bad before I get dressed in the morning. the fact that he thought I was wearing makeup really speaks volumes. I am really thankful that I came across this product. It is helping my skin a lot. Another nice thing is that it works really well under my makeup. Since I have combination skin, I have always had a hard time balancing the oils and dryness of my skin while wearing makeup. I always use powder on my skin after I apply foundation because I need it to soak up excess oil, but the powder ends up being too harsh. I could never find a happy medium. Well, now that I have been using this rose hip seed oil under my make up, it leaves me skin looking silky, even after I put powder on top. It really is a miracle for me :) Coming from someone who has struggled for years trying to find a solution to acne, this is really worth trying. It is far better than argan oil too.</li>
            <li> Great product and amazing company!!</li>
            <li> I received my Organic rose hip oil in he mail the other day and I absolutely love it!!  Not only was it packaged nicely and arrived promptly but it is fabulous!  I use the oil at night and in the morning to combat fine lines and dryness on these cold winter days.  I have noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my skin in just a couple of days, my skin is already looking healthier, where as before I felt I was looking a little dull I now feel my skin has a little healthier glow.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to try this product!</li>
            <li> Ordering was easy and received it in the mail extremely fast. So far, the product has improved the look and feel of my skin. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> The sellers are very courteous and follow-up to make sure everything has arrived and is okay. I have only used the oil for a week but am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> Feels great on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful rosehip essential oil, goes onto your face silly smooth and even though it&#x27;s not as expensive as most rose-hip oils are, it&#x27;s still wonderful quality! Definitely deserving of a 5 star rating!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best ,I&#x27;ve been seeing improvements with my face already and Ive been using for about a week my face is clear and my dark circles are reducing. Its everything you can wish for . I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> Some oils just sit on the face and don&#x27;t actually moisturize. This is a nice oil that absorbs well. You do only need three drops. Rub between palms and press into the skin for 30 seconds or so. I have fairly dry skin, and this alone relieves that tight feeling after an evening shower. More than I can say for any oil I&#x27;ve tried in the past. I would recommend for all skin types. You can layer other creams on top if you need.</li>
            <li> Item arrived as described. This is my first time using Rosehip oil. It smells really nice and has a beautiful rich amber color to it.  Seller has been wonderful in communicating with me and has answered any questions quickly.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, and a wedding coming up so was looking for a little extra boost.  So far so good!  I feel like I need to use a little more than a &#x27;drop&#x27; (more like a long dab) in order to properly cover my face, but I feel like my skin looks nicer</li>
            <li> I have used this about a week now and definitely feel my skin has more of a glow. Hopefully the longer I use it the more of a difference I will see. I would recommend it though.</li>
            <li> Love this oil! I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks but I can tell it has made a huge difference on my face already. This winter nearly killed my skin and now my face feels smooth and supple. The oil soaks in very quickly and there isn&#x27;t a strong smell.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my Rosehip Oil and I would definitely order from Teddie Organics again!  I have been using this oil for about two weeks now and I am starting to see a difference in my skin.  It is doing wonders for my acne and eczema.</li>
            <li> My face feels amazing! Seriously love this!</li>
            <li> Lovely! My skin is a very happy camper! This is my first time using rosehip oil. After some research, I decided to go with this one from Teddie Organics and I am so glad I did! They are a smaller, family run business and they are so kind. They truly care about their customers! My skin looks healthier, brighter, and more supple. It&#x27;s glowing! I am EXTREMELY acne prone, and not a single blemish has appeared! I&#x27;ve been using it every night for the last two weeks. I would definitely recommend and repurchase.</li>
            <li> The follow up is very great</li>
            <li> On the first day  when I open the bottle, I though that I will smell the aroma of roses. But  it wasn&#x27;t  what I expected.  However I decided to use it, so I some drops on  my hand and mixed with my fingers I feel the think and silky mixture. So I though well maybe  it doesn&#x27;t smell good but  maybe it will make the difference in my skin.  I applied that  night . For my surprise the next day my face and neck feel fresh and soft.  It may not smell like fresh roses but it work. I will continue use it, this product is good you notice the difference the very first day.</li>
            <li> I have read so many great reviews of rosehip, but this gave me such a horrible breakout all over my skin and i&#x27;m still trying to get rid of it and it has been a month!! I had such smooth skin now i regret using this! my skin breaksout like never before!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 days on my face &amp; nails. I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference with my face yet, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it for the change in my nails alone. If I don&#x27;t have nail polish on, my nails constantly break. I&#x27;ve tried strengthening polish, creams, and numerous other products to strengthen them, but nothing has worked. I&#x27;m amazed at how strong my nails felt after the 1st time I put the rosehip oil on them. I&#x27;ve used it every day since, and I&#x27;ve had absolutely no breakage. My nails feel super strong, and look great. I&#x27;m completely satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I am pleased with my purchase and will buy this again in the future/</li>
            <li> This is the best moisturizer for nails, skin, and hair. I will not lie I am very partial to suing it on my hair.  You see my hair is very curly and feeezy this oil makes my curls perfect, soft, and brilliant.  We purchase this product at. Discount for my honest Nd unbiSed review.</li>
            <li> Love this product so much! I did a lot of research into clean vegan products and found Teddie Organics. :)</li>
            <li> This is a delightful oil.  I have only used it for a short while, but I will see if the described benefits occur. The oil is light and absorbs right into the skin without a greasy feel. I received this order in record time!  I highly endorse this company and recommend the rosehip oil for anyone with mature skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It is great to use for dry skin. It does not leave an oily feeling. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Leaves your face so smooth and hopefully it will help prevent fine lines and wrinkles over time. Good amount of product since you only need a few drops.</li>
            <li> This organic rosehip oil hit the spot as it was priced right and arrived in a timely manner. The company even contacted me to provide more information on it&#x27;s uses. They recommended that you keep it chilled so I keep it on my bathroom windowsil (hey, it is winter in Minnesota!) It does wonders for dry skin around the eye (crows feet) and other lines on the face.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and bottle arrived in good care. The oil absorbs really quickly, easy to use under makeup and doesn&#x27;t smell too strong. Great for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li> This is amazing!!! I have been using this daily on my face. I have noticed a great improvement with the fine lines and wrinkles. I love the way my skin looks after I apply it and it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue if rubbed in well ! i have added coconut oil to this product for a greater effect.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I use it at night and can tell a different in just a matter of days!  I love all o f it&#x27;s uses- dry skin, eczema, etc... a wonder product!</li>
            <li> Love love love the rosehip oil, did not break me out at all considering I have very sensitive skin. I definitely recommend this oil, you won&#x27;t regret!!!</li>
            <li> Wow can instantly feel the difference on my face! Amazing quality and amazing customer service from their company! Very pleased with this purchase and will be buying again and again! Thank you teddy organics!!!</li>
            <li> used a little in my lotion as well as a stringent I made.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Oil smells like it should and I really like the dropper.</li>
            <li> This product was relatively in-expensive compared to other essential oil companies.  It arrived in a timely manner and was not damaged as it was wrapped well.  I use rosehip in many of my recipes and I&#x27;m happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Thank you</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this straight from the bottle as well as mixing into facial serums. So far I am really enjoying this product.</li>
            <li> I just received my rosehip oil a few days ago and am already seeing quite noticeable results! I will definitely be shopping with Teddie Organics in the future, as a result of their amazing support and persistence! Love this product and company</li>
            <li> I absolutely love how this oil makes my skin feel!</li>
