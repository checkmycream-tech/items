            <li>Love this stuff !  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am in my fifties and have fairly nice skin.  </li>
            <li>but I will say it goes on nice</li>
            <li>Absorbs into skin and gives nice glow.  </li>
            <li>While I wanted miraculous results, this product did provide nice results for an over-the-counter</li>
            <li>and I find that one much more effective.  </li>
            <li>I love this serum as it is very smooth and repairing.</li>
            <li>Love this line.</li>
            <li>my results were fantastic!  </li>
            <li>It squirts the product so that you have to make sure you catch it all</li>
            <li>Love this for skin tightening and wrinkle reduction.  </li>
            <li>I also bought Argan oil and the combination worked better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>My skin looked better.  </li>
            <li>It layers well with your favorite moisturizers.</li>
            <li>use it mostly in the morning before I appy my makeup....</li>
            <li>&quot; this serum - don&#x27;t love it.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells ok, and absorbs well, but the results are nil.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>Others are very pleased so at this price it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>product.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to minimize fine lines and provide a somewhat healthy glow to my skin.  </li>
            <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I researched many brands until I came upon True Radiance.  </li>
            <li>My skin looks super!  </li>
            <li>Make sure a good moisturizing cream after applying the serum and make sure the skin is dry before applying the cream.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with both the Golden Serum and Vitamin A and C Serum.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the Vitamin serum and use that as well over top of the golden serum.</li>
            <li>but this has been a good product for me so far......</li>
            <li>Love it, you can really feel it working.</li>
            <li>Skin tone was brightened tremendously.  </li>
            <li>True Radiance&#x27;s Golden Serum had twenty per cent of the ingredient.</li>
            <li>I see some improvement after a month of use, and although  my skin is very sensitive to many products, I have had no adverse reaction to this serum.  </li>
            <li>I really like how light &amp; creamy this serum is.</li>
            <li>Along with my order of Golden Serum</li>
            <li>I am not unhappy with it.</li>
            <li>Your product keeps the moisture in nearly all day and feels refreshing.</li>
            <li>I brought the Golden Serum.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not unhappy with the results - just not overjoyed either.  </li>
            <li>Very reasonably priced and I shall continue to use.</li>
            <li>I have been impressed so far in using this product as my skin is so soft but yet firm and rejuvenated.</li>
            <li>I said ok because I have only had the product for 3 days</li>
            <li>very little noticable scent and a good summer moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Much less wrinkles and the tigntening is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a slight glow which is nice.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t expect to much at my age</li>
            <li>I use it primarily on my neck; and prior to this bottle I had a bottle of Nerium given to me to try.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I am 55 and have used this product for 6 weeks now and can really notice a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough positive about Golden Serum.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last very long even if you use a couple of drops a day so it can be a little expensive,but the results are incredible.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li>I am 70 years old and I like this product better than any other I have tried for sagging skin.  </li>
            <li>Nearly finished with my bottle and have not seen any improvements beyond what I would get with a much cheaper product.</li>
            <li>It never clogged my pores, which normally happens with new stuff.</li>
            <li>The overall texture of my skin is so much smoother.</li>
            <li>And Nerium is no where near the ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have had a couple of comments how young I look since I have beeen using it and had not noticed those comments before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light-weight which I like, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb completely and if it&#x27;s not penetrating, it&#x27;s not working.  </li>
            <li>Kosmea makes a product called Eighth Natural Wonder</li>
            <li>I tried it because it&#x27;s half the price of the Kosmea - but also half as effective (for me anyway).  </li>
            <li>Using it for a few months with the vitamin serum and eye cream all by True Radiance and my skin is radiant.  </li>
            <li>I seem to only use it occasionally, but really like it when I do.  </li>

            <li> And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I do see a little bit of tightening, but there&#x27;s no WOW factor for me.  </li>

            <li> It was a waste of money.</li>

            <li> I do like the product a lot; Im not sure if I notice changes; so I may need another bottle to find out.</li>
            <li> Not really sure but</li>
            <li> I am not sure.</li>
            <li> I doubt you will be sorry.</li>
            <li> I needed something for the dull  ugly look of my face!  </li>
            <li> What I was unhappy about were the lines that run from the corners of my nose to the corners of my mouth.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just re-ordered this serum - It works very well. My skin is brighter and tighter and looks less tired when I use it regularly. I do agree, however, that the pump is a problem, but you do sort of learn to work around it.</li>
            <li> Love this line. Great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I did not care for this serum. I did not do what the company claimed it would do for my skin. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was watching a TV show where the doctor on the skin care segment recommended using face products that contained the ingredient Argireline.  I researched many brands until I came upon True Radiance.  True Radiance&#x27;s Golden Serum had twenty per cent of the ingredient. Along with my order of Golden Serum I was sent a sample of Vitamin A and C Serum.  I started to use both products and my results were fantastic!  I am in my fifties and have fairly nice skin.  What I was unhappy about were the lines that run from the corners of my nose to the corners of my mouth.  After four weeks of using both products those lines have improved drastically! I am delighted with the results.  The overall texture of my skin is so much smoother. I am so pleased with both the Golden Serum and Vitamin A and C Serum.  I highly recommend these products.</li>
            <li> Feel the same about this as I did the lineless eye cream. I can&#x27;t expect to much at my age but it lasts a long time and has it&#x27;s benefits. I am not unhappy with it.</li>
            <li> Nearly finished with my bottle and have not seen any improvements beyond what I would get with a much cheaper product. Save your $$$.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff !  My skin looks super!  My sister commented that the wrinkles around my eyes are gone!  I am 45 and am hooked.  I use the youth serum too.</li>
            <li> I do like the product a lot; Im not sure if I notice changes; so I may need another bottle to find out. It never clogged my pores, which normally happens with new stuff. I use it primarily on my neck; and prior to this bottle I had a bottle of Nerium given to me to try. For the price of Nerium I can get 2 bottles of this! And Nerium is no where near the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying a product that had the ingredients to firm and moisturize my skin, but Golden Serum is thin, and the applicator wont let you control how much is pumped out. It squirts the product so that you have to make sure you catch it all or it will be wasted, and the amount is too much. Unfortunately, it makes my skin feel dry, and I see absolutely no beneficial effects whatsoever, I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now.</li>
            <li> I have been impressed so far in using this product as my skin is so soft but yet firm and rejuvenated. I cannot say enough positive about Golden Serum.</li>
            <li> Been using for about a month now.  Hasn&#x27;t performed any miracles  but I will say it goes on nice, doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. I use it at night and in the morning before I apply my makeup.  It gives me a slight glow which is nice.</li>
            <li> Love this for skin tightening and wrinkle reduction.  Using it for a few months with the vitamin serum and eye cream all by True Radiance and my skin is radiant.  Much less wrinkles and the tigntening is amazing.  Some of the brown spots have also gone away but I think the vitamin serum is the product that did this.  Not really sure but great combo of products.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a moisturizer like this one as my skin on my face is very dry. Your product keeps the moisture in nearly all day and feels refreshing. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Great product!! I will buy if forever!  It doesn&#x27;t last very long even if you use a couple of drops a day so it can be a little expensive,but the results are incredible.I also bought Argan oil and the combination worked better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used. I reccomend this product to everybody.</li>
            <li> I thought it worked well.  My skin looked better.  I would reccommend it to anyone.  I only used one container.</li>
            <li> I have not tried it yet. it would be helpful if instructions came with the product.  I said ok because I have only had the product for 3 days</li>
            <li> I am 70 years old and I like this product better than any other I have tried for sagging skin.  I see some improvement after a month of use, and although  my skin is very sensitive to many products, I have had no adverse reaction to this serum.  And a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Did not see any results. It was a waste of money. Would not recommend to buy. I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> The moisture is incredible &amp; long-lasting. It layers well with your favorite moisturizers. I use coconut oil on my skin &amp; this product goes well over the oil.</li>
            <li> Make sure a good moisturizing cream after applying the serum and make sure the skin is dry before applying the cream.</li>
            <li> I needed something for the dull  ugly look of my face!  I brought the Golden Serum. Its excellent! My face has dramically changed from worse to actually being pretty again and feeling it! What a difference. And I dont even use it every night, almost but sometimes I forget. Ladies trust me on this. spend the money and try it! I doubt you will be sorry. I am not!</li>
            <li> I am not sure. I have not seen any noticeable results yet.It moisturizes, but I don&#x27;t see the promised lifting.</li>
            <li> I love this serum as it is very smooth and repairing. I am 55 and have used this product for 6 weeks now and can really notice a difference in my skin. I then use a moisturizer over it. Very reasonably priced and I shall continue to use. Love it!</li>
            <li> I really like how light &amp; creamy this serum is. very little noticable scent and a good summer moisturizer. In the winter in Michigan I need a little additional cream for moisture. I have had a couple of comments how young I look since I have beeen using it and had not noticed those comments before. Good ingredients.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I seem to only use it occasionally, but really like it when I do.  Evens and plumps skin.  Diminishes wrinkles.  I see overnight results when I use it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now since December of 2012 and have seen improvement with my skin firming.&lt;br /&gt;There is no miracle for skin as we age but this has been a good product for me so far......I like how it hydrates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly in the morning before I appy my makeup....sometimes in the evening...but I use it sparingly due to the amount and cost.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t discount anything the other reviewers have said because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.  I \\&quot;like\\&quot; this serum - don&#x27;t love it.  For me, it stays a little bit sticky on my face which I don&#x27;t care for.  I can use it at night, but not under make-up.  It&#x27;s light-weight which I like, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb completely and if it&#x27;s not penetrating, it&#x27;s not working.  I do see a little bit of tightening, but there&#x27;s no WOW factor for me.  Kosmea makes a product called Eighth Natural Wonder and I find that one much more effective.  Still, I&#x27;ll use this up and I&#x27;m not unhappy with the results - just not overjoyed either.  I tried it because it&#x27;s half the price of the Kosmea - but also half as effective (for me anyway).  Others are very pleased so at this price it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> Used the entire bottle, saw no change period.&lt;br /&gt;It smells ok, and absorbs well, but the results are nil.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;Bought a $4.97 tub of St. Ives collagen. Love it, you can really feel it working.</li>
            <li> Absorbs into skin and gives nice glow.  My makeup looks great and stays on all day.  Tightens my jaw area and neck.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Other than Roc products, this serum is the only other thing I have found that really works.  Skin tone was brightened tremendously.  Will order again.  I also bought the Vitamin serum and use that as well over top of the golden serum.</li>
            <li> it arrived on time, but this broke my face out so I had to quit using it</li>
            <li> While I wanted miraculous results, this product did provide nice results for an over-the-counter product.&lt;br /&gt;It seemed to minimize fine lines and provide a somewhat healthy glow to my skin.  I will re-order.</li>
