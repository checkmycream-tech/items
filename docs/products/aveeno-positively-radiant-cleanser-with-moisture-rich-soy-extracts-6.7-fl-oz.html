            <li>knew I wanted a gel based cleanser and Aveeno is usually great on my very moody skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely an inexpensive partner to a Clarisonic system, but an absolutely perfect face wash on</li>
            <li>LOVE it.</li>
            <li>I have clearer skin and a more even skin tone.</li>

            <li>Will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li>One of my favorite cleansers.  </li>
            <li>and I love the way it makes my face feel like.  </li>
            <li>Mostly my nephew who did not like washing his face uses it now every day.</li>
            <li>It is my favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I love all the Aveeno products I use.</li>
            <li>It smells good, has a light lather, and rinses clean.</li>
            <li>I really love the scent and it leaves a very clean feel.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very clean without being filmy and has a lovely neutral scent.</li>
            <li>Great product for older skin.</li>
            <li>I love this product and it&#x27;s great for my ultra sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>Pretty good for an aging baby boomer.    </li>
            <li>Pretty good cleanser.</li>
            <li>I bought this product in the mail, and was so excited to use it!</li>
            <li>I found it while on vacation in California and it has become my go to fash wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and always does a great job!</li>
            <li>While it&#x27;s not over-drying, it&#x27;s probably not the best choice for someone with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>like I&#x27;m squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li>My skin is not oily at all or shiny and it is so great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is mild and not irritating, lasts a loooong time, and works great with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I sometimes wear powder and blush, and I have tried other cleansers (Oreal, Neutrogena), but I like this best.</li>
            <li>Easy to use in the shower</li>
            <li>products that are too strong smelling for me.</li>
            <li>Bought this on April 11th and used for about 5 days and all was fine.</li>
            <li>Pretty sure it&#x27;s looking better, too.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it seems fine.  </li>
            <li>Not anything hugely noticeable, yet, that is.</li>
            <li>Overall I was happy with the product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li>so I feel justified in saying that this product made me breakout</li>
            <li>THIS AVEENO SOAP MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH AND BABYLIKE.</li>
            <li>and this is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the Aveeno line.  </li>
            <li>I am 24 years old with oily skin, and I have always loved Aveeno products.</li>
            <li>So far so good with this product.  </li>
            <li>This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve found (among other Aveeno skin products) for improving the quality of my skin, evening out the texture and tone, helping control breakouts, and making it nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The bottle is very nice but one pump doesn&#x27;t seem like enough</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this after getting a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li>I put my Hempz Original lotion(great stuff) on afterwards</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, and I feel clean all day.</li>
            <li>By far the best facial cleanser I have used!</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about this product for me.</li>
            <li>It also has a very noticeable fragrance - one that I would expect more from a body wash instead of a face wash.  </li>
            <li>I need two full pumps to rub over my face because it won&#x27;t lather.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why I love it so much, one cleansing step that gets all of the makeup off.</li>
            <li>Maybe I need to try for 2 weeks to see the full results.</li>
            <li>I feel fresh and light after I use it.</li>
            <li>It has a nice smell and it feels soft on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive, and Aveeno is supposed to be super good at moisture, helpfulness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use two pumps twice daily and my skin is now super bright and glowing.</li>
            <li>I received this product quickly and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li>This product has been my favorite facial cleanser for many years.</li>
            <li>The smell is not unpleasant at all; I am just used to products without perfumes.  </li>
            <li>wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone with acne issues, but for the average woman this is a refreshing and effective cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves a nice, toned but not dry  feeling after use.</li>
            <li>Great product, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used on my face for years now, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much</li>
            <li>The face wash that came with it was great, but a little pricy, and everyone recommended Philosophy...</li>
            <li>This is also great for heavy eye makeup removal.  </li>
            <li>short of words, its amazing in conjunction with the moisturiser.</li>
            <li>I went away from it for a while and used Olay&#x27;s fresh effects products.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a skin cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but would clean effectively.</li>
            <li>just a nice facial moisturizer is about it</li>
            <li>My 57 year old face feels better already.</li>
            <li>What can I say about it, other than it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>This facial cleanser is alright,seem to do a ok job but nothing special.</li>
            <li>You read it right.</li>
            <li>and, the price is right .</li>
            <li>I tend to be a bit oily, and this one strikes just the right balances of cleansing my oiliness without drying me out.</li>
            <li>It looks like pearls, feels like silk, and has a gentle clean fragrance.</li>
            <li>This is a nice cleanser that does not dry the skin and does not clog the pores, yet cleans very well.  </li>
            <li>Love the feel and smell of it when you first open the bottle and with the cleanser and toner my face seems to be getting back to the ph level for nice skin.</li>
            <li>Mild and gentle.  </li>
            <li>Not only does the iridescence make me feel fancy and indulge my girlish side, but it really does give my face a nice glow.</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the face, non-drying</li>
            <li>My face was more radiant instantly but the texture thing happened over a couple days.</li>
            <li>I first used a sample of this cleanser from my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>will safe you some $, since last longer than the foaming aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li>I use it daily and am extremely pleased with both the price and the product.</li>
            <li>She said  the moisturizer feels light and not heavy</li>
            <li>I am an avid fan of Aveeno skin car products and shampoos...</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling feeling soft and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>To deal with this i cut off the top of the bottle (until there&#x27;s about and inch of bottle left at the bottom) and get the rest out by hand.  </li>
            <li>Really like this cleanser!</li>
            <li>This was my economical replacement and it feels just as gentle and soothing on my face.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>your skin bright and luminous&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on skin and everyday</li>
            <li>sure you get this one and not Aveenos basic cleanser as it won&#x27;t have the beads.  </li>
            <li>Not like harsh bleaches----VERY good alternative.</li>
            <li>It leaves your face clean and fresh and not dry.  </li>
            <li>always makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually not brand loyal in this area, but I won&#x27;t be trying any others any time soon.</li>
            <li>After just one use my skin felt so soft, and even though its natural and gentle it worked magic on removing my mascara.</li>
            <li>Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce is a great facial product.  </li>
            <li>No fuss, no muss - gentle cleanser - leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to find in the local stores</li>
            <li>To me hypoallergenic means it does not contain the ingredients or the strong fragrances that are likely to cause an allergic reation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I first used a natural cleanser by a company called Fresh</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m certain that if my skin was dry I would love it though.</li>
            <li>When I would use it on my relatively clean skin first thing in the morning, my face would feel greasy and start breaking out later that day.</li>
            <li>My package came early and this is a great facial wash,  it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li>: How much do you weigh?), and then was told that they could just tell me to stop using the products, because \\&quot;we are not dermatologists.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>For the price they charge for these face products I would have expected better treatment when I had a problem with one.</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t really like its fragrance.  </li>
            <li>have combination skin and this has really helped even everything out.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t have much of a lather.</li>
            <li>Seems to really effect the area around my cheek bone.  </li>
            <li>She really loves the way it leaves her skin feeling.  </li>
            <li>really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li>Thank you so so much Aveeno.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>the face wash really take up makeup and dirt form the face but</li>
            <li>DELIVERY WAS EXTREMELY FAST...</li>
            <li>I have recommended to friends and relatives who desire a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>It really works and is soothing/calming.</li>
            <li>This is non drying gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>However, I am giving 4 stars because I love the soft feeling (luxus) that regular foaming aveeno leaves in my skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on nice &amp; gets makeup off well &amp; yet doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my sensitive skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li>of my favorite parts: I used this daily and it lasted me for several MONTHS.</li>
            <li>As I grew older and my acne subsided, I realized that the stronger products were drying my skin out even after a moisturizer was applied.</li>
            <li>This is the only facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used that cleans my skin without stripping it of all healthy oils.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>while I used it, it made my skin soft and clean, but when I woke up the net morning, my face was COVERED in acne.</li>
            <li>There are tiny beads in this cleanser that help softly scrub your face clean.  </li>
            <li>Gentle, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin &amp; really have to watch what I use.</li>
            <li>I normally wash my face with water but decided to use it bcuz my face was itching.</li>
            <li>I love aveeno and this product last for a long time (4 months)</li>
            <li>Used it for a week, and I didn&#x27;t see any results as far as being any more or less radiant.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t like strong fragrances, especially for facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t lather like crazy because then I can open my eyes to make sure it&#x27;s gotten most of the makeup off my face!  </li>
            <li>I should state however that I have a very clear youthful complexion with combination skin.  </li>
            <li>I started using Aveeno positively radiant and Aveeno clear complexion moisturizer just last week and thus far, my skin has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li>This product hasn&#x27;t broken me and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li>A LITTLE LIGHTER , BUT OVERALL I&#x27;M A SATISFIED CUSTOMER.</li>
            <li>IT HELPED CLEAR MY ACNE.</li>
            <li>and it has defintely helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li>I am waiting to see if it actually improves the texture/tone of my face, but that may be asking too much.  </li>
            <li>Robin Barr, 60 yrs old  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, try just using once a day and see how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li>It does everything it says above except even out skin tone, which is really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li>Its not harsh on my skin</li>
            <li>I definitely use two squirts when I use the heavy make up to make sure that it gets it all off</li>
            <li>I will be throwing this away and going back to my Phisoderm for Sensitive Skin which has a little too much mineral oil for my face, but it is truely hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li>Also seems to mildly lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li>This is the product that I use everyday to clean my face, throat, neck and chest area.  </li>
            <li>I usually fill in an order to get to the free shipping amount form Amazon.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m starting to see more of an uneven skin tone with blotchy red spots.</li>
            <li>But I feel this is pretty typical for my skin during the winter months as it gets pretty dry.  </li>
            <li>THIS IS THE ONLY SOAP I TRUST MY FACE WITH,&amp; I&#x27;M VERY PICKY WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL CLEANSING .</li>
            <li>This is the only facewash I use (my skin is very sensitive and reacts to just about anything else).</li>
            <li>and my face is just now starting to clear up and</li>
            <li>I had so many people ask me what was wrong because before I used this product, my skin was almost always clear.</li>
            <li>This product does not dry the skin out and works well.  </li>
            <li>No dry feeling.  </li>
            <li>I have kind of difficult skin being both oily and dry</li>
    </ol>

            <li> it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> This is nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but a visible improvement would be nice...</li>
            <li> Nice products.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Switching to something softer took some time for my skin to adjust, but this keeps my face very clean and nice.</li>
            <li> You just FEEL clean after you use it - very refreshing and good at getting off light makeup</li>
            <li> knew I wanted a gel based cleanser and Aveeno is usually great on my very moody skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely an inexpensive partner to a Clarisonic system, but an absolutely perfect face wash on</li>
            <li> LOVE it.</li>
            <li> I have clearer skin and a more even skin tone.</li>
            <li> One application, no bs, my skin looked smoother and more radiant.</li>
            <li> I would love if my face looked clearer of age spots, etc.  </li>
            <li> As it is, my face looks better and that is all I might hope for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done the trial &amp; error method &amp; I&#x27;m glad to be done w/</li>
            <li> (so is my skin) :)</li>
            <li> I love this product</li>
            <li> Love this wash, even my teenager steals it out of my bath to use.  </li>
            <li> I love all Aveeno products but this is my favorite fash wash.</li>
            <li> absolutely love the texture of it, it reminds me of a liquid pearl.</li>
            <li> i just love it...</li>
            <li> i love it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I beleve this face wash is for those who really love to wear make up.</li>
            <li> its okay stuff</li>
            <li> I love how this feels.  </li>
            <li> Will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cleansers.  </li>
            <li> and I love the way it makes my face feel like.  </li>
            <li> Mostly my nephew who did not like washing his face uses it now every day.</li>
            <li> It is my favorite cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> I love all the Aveeno products I use.</li>
            <li> It smells good, has a light lather, and rinses clean.</li>
            <li> I really love the scent and it leaves a very clean feel.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very clean without being filmy and has a lovely neutral scent.</li>
            <li> Great product for older skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product and it&#x27;s great for my ultra sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Pretty good for an aging baby boomer.    </li>
            <li> Pretty good cleanser.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the mail, and was so excited to use it!</li>
            <li> I found it while on vacation in California and it has become my go to fash wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and always does a great job!</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not over-drying, it&#x27;s probably not the best choice for someone with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> like I&#x27;m squeaky clean!  </li>
            <li> My skin is not oily at all or shiny and it is so great for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is mild and not irritating, lasts a loooong time, and works great with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I sometimes wear powder and blush, and I have tried other cleansers (Oreal, Neutrogena), but I like this best.</li>
            <li> Easy to use in the shower</li>
            <li> products that are too strong smelling for me.</li>
            <li> Bought this on April 11th and used for about 5 days and all was fine.</li>
            <li> Pretty sure it&#x27;s looking better, too.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it seems fine.  </li>
            <li> Not anything hugely noticeable, yet, that is.</li>
            <li> Overall I was happy with the product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> so I feel justified in saying that this product made me breakout</li>
            <li> THIS AVEENO SOAP MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH AND BABYLIKE.</li>
            <li> and this is gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Aveeno line.  </li>
            <li> I am 24 years old with oily skin, and I have always loved Aveeno products.</li>
            <li> So far so good with this product.  </li>
            <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve found (among other Aveeno skin products) for improving the quality of my skin, evening out the texture and tone, helping control breakouts, and making it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> The bottle is very nice but one pump doesn&#x27;t seem like enough</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this after getting a Clarisonic.</li>
            <li> I put my Hempz Original lotion(great stuff) on afterwards</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, and I feel clean all day.</li>
            <li> By far the best facial cleanser I have used!</li>
            <li> It leaves my face feeling clean without drying it out.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about this product for me.</li>
            <li> It also has a very noticeable fragrance - one that I would expect more from a body wash instead of a face wash.  </li>
            <li> I need two full pumps to rub over my face because it won&#x27;t lather.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why I love it so much, one cleansing step that gets all of the makeup off.</li>
            <li> Maybe I need to try for 2 weeks to see the full results.</li>
            <li> I feel fresh and light after I use it.</li>
            <li> It has a nice smell and it feels soft on my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive, and Aveeno is supposed to be super good at moisture, helpfulness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use two pumps twice daily and my skin is now super bright and glowing.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and my daughter loves it.</li>
            <li> This product has been my favorite facial cleanser for many years.</li>
            <li> The smell is not unpleasant at all; I am just used to products without perfumes.  </li>
            <li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone with acne issues, but for the average woman this is a refreshing and effective cleanser.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves a nice, toned but not dry  feeling after use.</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used on my face for years now, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much</li>
            <li> The face wash that came with it was great, but a little pricy, and everyone recommended Philosophy...</li>
            <li> This is also great for heavy eye makeup removal.  </li>
            <li> short of words, its amazing in conjunction with the moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I went away from it for a while and used Olay&#x27;s fresh effects products.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a skin cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but would clean effectively.</li>
            <li> just a nice facial moisturizer is about it</li>
            <li> My 57 year old face feels better already.</li>
            <li> What can I say about it, other than it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is alright,seem to do a ok job but nothing special.</li>
            <li> You read it right.</li>
            <li> and, the price is right .</li>
            <li> I tend to be a bit oily, and this one strikes just the right balances of cleansing my oiliness without drying me out.</li>
            <li> It looks like pearls, feels like silk, and has a gentle clean fragrance.</li>
            <li> This is a nice cleanser that does not dry the skin and does not clog the pores, yet cleans very well.  </li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell of it when you first open the bottle and with the cleanser and toner my face seems to be getting back to the ph level for nice skin.</li>
            <li> Mild and gentle.  </li>
            <li> Not only does the iridescence make me feel fancy and indulge my girlish side, but it really does give my face a nice glow.</li>
            <li> Very gentle on the face, non-drying</li>
            <li> My face was more radiant instantly but the texture thing happened over a couple days.</li>
            <li> I first used a sample of this cleanser from my dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> will safe you some $, since last longer than the foaming aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li> I use it daily and am extremely pleased with both the price and the product.</li>
            <li> She said  the moisturizer feels light and not heavy</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of Aveeno skin car products and shampoos...</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling feeling soft and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> To deal with this i cut off the top of the bottle (until there&#x27;s about and inch of bottle left at the bottom) and get the rest out by hand.  </li>
            <li> Really like this cleanser!</li>
            <li> This was my economical replacement and it feels just as gentle and soothing on my face.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> your skin bright and luminous&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on skin and everyday</li>
            <li> sure you get this one and not Aveenos basic cleanser as it won&#x27;t have the beads.  </li>
            <li> Not like harsh bleaches----VERY good alternative.</li>
            <li> It leaves your face clean and fresh and not dry.  </li>
            <li> always makes my skin feel soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not brand loyal in this area, but I won&#x27;t be trying any others any time soon.</li>
            <li> After just one use my skin felt so soft, and even though its natural and gentle it worked magic on removing my mascara.</li>
            <li> Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce is a great facial product.  </li>
            <li> No fuss, no muss - gentle cleanser - leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to find in the local stores</li>
            <li> To me hypoallergenic means it does not contain the ingredients or the strong fragrances that are likely to cause an allergic reation.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I first used a natural cleanser by a company called Fresh</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m certain that if my skin was dry I would love it though.</li>
            <li> When I would use it on my relatively clean skin first thing in the morning, my face would feel greasy and start breaking out later that day.</li>
            <li> My package came early and this is a great facial wash,  it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin!</li>
            <li> : How much do you weigh?), and then was told that they could just tell me to stop using the products, because \\&quot;we are not dermatologists.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> For the price they charge for these face products I would have expected better treatment when I had a problem with one.</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t really like its fragrance.  </li>
            <li> have combination skin and this has really helped even everything out.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t have much of a lather.</li>
            <li> Seems to really effect the area around my cheek bone.  </li>
            <li> She really loves the way it leaves her skin feeling.  </li>
            <li> really wanted this product to work.</li>
            <li> Thank you so so much Aveeno.</li>
            <li> and I really like it.  </li>
            <li> the face wash really take up makeup and dirt form the face but</li>
            <li> DELIVERY WAS EXTREMELY FAST...</li>
            <li> I have recommended to friends and relatives who desire a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> It really works and is soothing/calming.</li>
            <li> This is non drying gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> However, I am giving 4 stars because I love the soft feeling (luxus) that regular foaming aveeno leaves in my skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice &amp; gets makeup off well &amp; yet doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dried out.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my sensitive skin clean and soft.</li>
            <li> of my favorite parts: I used this daily and it lasted me for several MONTHS.</li>
            <li> As I grew older and my acne subsided, I realized that the stronger products were drying my skin out even after a moisturizer was applied.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used that cleans my skin without stripping it of all healthy oils.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> while I used it, it made my skin soft and clean, but when I woke up the net morning, my face was COVERED in acne.</li>
            <li> There are tiny beads in this cleanser that help softly scrub your face clean.  </li>
            <li> Gentle, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin &amp; really have to watch what I use.</li>
            <li> I normally wash my face with water but decided to use it bcuz my face was itching.</li>
            <li> I love aveeno and this product last for a long time (4 months)</li>
            <li> Used it for a week, and I didn&#x27;t see any results as far as being any more or less radiant.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t like strong fragrances, especially for facial cleansers.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t lather like crazy because then I can open my eyes to make sure it&#x27;s gotten most of the makeup off my face!  </li>
            <li> I should state however that I have a very clear youthful complexion with combination skin.  </li>
            <li> I started using Aveeno positively radiant and Aveeno clear complexion moisturizer just last week and thus far, my skin has cleared up so much.</li>
            <li> This product hasn&#x27;t broken me and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE LIGHTER , BUT OVERALL I&#x27;M A SATISFIED CUSTOMER.</li>
            <li> IT HELPED CLEAR MY ACNE.</li>
            <li> and it has defintely helped my skin clear up.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see if it actually improves the texture/tone of my face, but that may be asking too much.  </li>

            <li> If you have sensitive skin, try just using once a day and see how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li> It does everything it says above except even out skin tone, which is really what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive combination skin</li>
            <li> Its not harsh on my skin</li>
            <li> I definitely use two squirts when I use the heavy make up to make sure that it gets it all off</li>
            <li> I will be throwing this away and going back to my Phisoderm for Sensitive Skin which has a little too much mineral oil for my face, but it is truely hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Also seems to mildly lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> This is the product that I use everyday to clean my face, throat, neck and chest area.  </li>
            <li> I usually fill in an order to get to the free shipping amount form Amazon.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m starting to see more of an uneven skin tone with blotchy red spots.</li>
            <li> But I feel this is pretty typical for my skin during the winter months as it gets pretty dry.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS THE ONLY SOAP I TRUST MY FACE WITH,&amp; I&#x27;M VERY PICKY WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL CLEANSING .</li>
            <li> This is the only facewash I use (my skin is very sensitive and reacts to just about anything else).</li>
            <li> and my face is just now starting to clear up and</li>
            <li> I had so many people ask me what was wrong because before I used this product, my skin was almost always clear.</li>
            <li> This product does not dry the skin out and works well.  </li>
            <li> No dry feeling.  </li>
            <li> I have kind of difficult skin being both oily and dry</li>
            <li> I typically try new products but I will never stop buying this.</li>
            <li> My skin improved to the point I was willing to go out in public without foundation although still wear foundation for everything other than everyday running around.</li>
            <li> It does not dry my skin out and it leaves no residue as some soap or other facial cleanser does.  </li>
            <li> I got dry patches, red bumps all over my face and peeling like you wouldn&#x27;t believe.</li>
            <li> So, totally not for people who have dry skin.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and cleans deeply.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping I would see it even out a little and lighten up my dark spots but no such luck.</li>
            <li> Its not too harsh for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Something to keep in mind is that a little goes a long way--two pumps are enough for my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> Every time I try to switch, I either break out or get dry patches.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my dry skin.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and does seem to improve my skin texture.  </li>
            <li> I am used to Clinique, but decided to try this for the price, and to see if it would combat my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> It takes the fatigue look after a long day of work!!</li>
            <li> am not a highly allergic person</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> It is a very short pump and short spout and needs a hard pump to get the product out.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that a lot of product is left at the bottom of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Please be careful when you  use this product.</li>
            <li> but my oily skin only worsened and I began to break out a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful about what I use on my face.</li>
            <li> Trouble was, in the morning, I had red blotches all over my face, like a rash.</li>
            <li> I always come back to this cleanser, and even if I use other things, I usually start with this to remove my sunblock and /or makeup.</li>
            <li> Well, I thought, I will just use this the way I use other &amp;#34;face&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> A  pain in the neck, but a problem I&#x27;ve had with other pump-style bottles.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be using any other product after trying this.</li>
            <li> one is used at night, other during the day.  </li>
            <li> I have started other family memebers to use it.  </li>
            <li> I would usually wake up with several pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some other cleanser and it made my face feel waxy which I don&#x27;t like because that means your skin is not breathing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd time using it today, if there&#x27;s a negative impact, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Sorry - Really wanted it to work.  </li>
            <li> and I have some dark spots developing</li>
            <li> Just average.  </li>
            <li> I think this would work well for those with dry skin because it feels a little too heavy after washing with mine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s creamy which is less drying to the skin</li>
            <li> but it does so without the heavy rubbing that I&#x27;ve had to do with the Lancome eye make-up remover</li>
            <li> My skin tone had been blotchy with uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t hydrate it as by the time I have my hair dried with the hair dryer</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and had a hard time getting rid of a few breakouts that seemed to never go away on my chin.</li>
            <li> rinsing are really similar to the expensive, department store</li>
            <li> No more redness, and the bottle lasts for months.</li>
            <li> No overwhelming perfumes.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what happened but after a couple weeks of use this is burning my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had used Aveeno in the past and wanted my daughter to try it out.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is helping to even out my skin tone yet...</li>
            <li> Hight quality and geed price as usually.</li>
            <li> I have used it before in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to foam, but this product doesn&#x27;t do it for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint for me is that I find it difficult to push the pump to get the product out while in the shower.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell by the packaging, but yes, it is</li>
            <li> so far, the acne has left terrible scars on my chin.</li>
            <li> My eyes and nose turned red and itched like crazy.</li>
            <li> I know some people say it doesn&#x27;t lather, but from experience lather doesn&#x27;t always mean it&#x27;s working, that can have a lot to do with the hardness of your lather.</li>
            <li> I have never used an Aveeno product that was not good.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, no more itch</li>
            <li> Must take care in using a small amount, as it can be difficult to rinse off.</li>
            <li> I searched this on Amazon just so I could leave a review for others, because this inexpensive cleanser blows those expensive sephora brands out of the water!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have combination skin, no acne but a weird swollen looking texture issue around the nose and cheeks.  </li>
            <li> and it was just way to expensive.</li>
            <li> I had terrible, painfully acne showing up all over my t-zone, ESPECIALLY my chin and mouth area.</li>
            <li> It smells sooo artificial.</li>
            <li> A must have or at the very least a &#x27;must try&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> Badly.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> the expensive ones don&#x27;t have anything on this, except that they sting your eyes terribly!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Bonus: it&#x27;s a cream instead of a foam, I hate the foam.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my worst enemy.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I used this product at the end of may when my friend accidentally left a bottle of it in my shower. I was impressed while I used it, it made my skin soft and clean, but when I woke up the net morning, my face was COVERED in acne. I had terrible, painfully acne showing up all over my t-zone, ESPECIALLY my chin and mouth area. I had so many people ask me what was wrong because before I used this product, my skin was almost always clear. It&#x27;s been a month and my face is just now starting to clear up and so far, the acne has left terrible scars on my chin. I am so disappointed. Please be careful when you  use this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a month now. I don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin tone. The product has a very pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> This does not seem like face soap to me.  For starters, it is iridescent in appearance.  It also has a very noticeable fragrance - one that I would expect more from a body wash instead of a face wash.  And it doesn&#x27;t lather - I need two full pumps to rub over my face because it won&#x27;t lather.  I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Clinique and didn&#x27;t find it here.</li>
            <li> Bought this on April 11th and used for about 5 days and all was fine. Then started getting a reaction to using it in conjunction with moisturizer. I got dry patches, red bumps all over my face and peeling like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. I called Aveeno&#x27;s 800 number to see if they could suggest how to use the products to negate this reaction or help subside it, but all I got was 5 minutes of questioning (ex.: How much do you weigh?), and then was told that they could just tell me to stop using the products, because \\&quot;we are not dermatologists.\\&quot; I told them what I thought of their customer service and promptly hung up. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to my worst enemy. For the price they charge for these face products I would have expected better treatment when I had a problem with one. Be forwarned! I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER AVEENO PRODUCT AGAIN!!!!!!!!! The only reason I gave this product a one star rating was because amazon wouldn&#x27;t let me get away with no rating at all!</li>
            <li> This product has been my &#x27;go to&#x27; product for quite some time.  Every time I try to switch, I either break out or get dry patches.  This cleanser is perfect for my combination skin.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t lather like crazy because then I can open my eyes to make sure it&#x27;s gotten most of the makeup off my face!  This is also great for heavy eye makeup removal.  I definitely use two squirts when I use the heavy make up to make sure that it gets it all off but it does so without the heavy rubbing that I&#x27;ve had to do with the Lancome eye make-up remover and it doesn&#x27;t leave that oily film that eye makeup removers do.  I love this product and it&#x27;s great for my ultra sensitive skin! A must have or at the very least a &#x27;must try&#x27;!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for cleansers and lotions that will help getting clearer skin.  I read the reviews here and decided to try this.  I have to stop using it since it makes my skin even drier.  So, totally not for people who have dry skin.  Plus, I don&#x27;t really like its fragrance.  It smells sooo artificial. Personally, I&#x27;d prefer some organic or fragrance-free skin care products.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased this after getting a Clarisonic. The face wash that came with it was great, but a little pricy, and everyone recommended Philosophy... but it was also too expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I wanted a gel based cleanser and Aveeno is usually great on my very moody skin. This was perfect! It&#x27;s hard to tell by the packaging, but yes, it is a gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and this has really helped even everything out. My redness is gone (also with help from the Clarisonic). It&#x27;s consistency and the way my skin feels immediately after rinsing are really similar to the expensive, department store brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of my favorite parts: I used this daily and it lasted me for several MONTHS. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. You really only need one pump, maybe two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely an inexpensive partner to a Clarisonic system, but an absolutely perfect face wash on it&#x27;s own. I&#x27;m usually not brand loyal in this area, but I won&#x27;t be trying any others any time soon.</li>
            <li> I searched this on Amazon just so I could leave a review for others, because this inexpensive cleanser blows those expensive sephora brands out of the water!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it. It looks like pearls, feels like silk, and has a gentle clean fragrance. I use it once nightly with my Clarisonic and it has improved and transformed my skin. I have combination skin, prone to acne, redness and dryness. I have tried probably 50+ cleansers, philosophy, Neutrogena, cetaphil, Michael Todd, Simple, St. Ives, clean&amp;clear....etc! This is the only one I recommend. It never dries out my skin. I have clearer skin and a more even skin tone. No more redness, and the bottle lasts for months. I typically try new products but I will never stop buying this.</li>
            <li> You read it right. I have combination skin, no acne but a weird swollen looking texture issue around the nose and cheeks.  One application, no bs, my skin looked smoother and more radiant. It was the craziest thing. I normally wash my face with water but decided to use it bcuz my face was itching. Needless to say, no more itch and I&#x27;m even cuter than I was before. I moistened my face and applied. It didn&#x27;t have much of a lather. I kept it on my face for 10 mins and washed off. My face was more radiant instantly but the texture thing happened over a couple days. This is my 2nd time using it today, if there&#x27;s a negative impact, I&#x27;ll let you know.</li>
            <li> Gentle, doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.  No overwhelming perfumes.  I like how well it cleans and, the price is right .</li>
            <li> I have never used an Aveeno product that was not good.  This is a nice cleanser that does not dry the skin and does not clog the pores, yet cleans very well.  I am waiting to see if it actually improves the texture/tone of my face, but that may be asking too much.  I would love if my face looked clearer of age spots, etc.  And maybe it will.  As it is, my face looks better and that is all I might hope for.</li>
            <li> already looking younger</li>
            <li> I first used a sample of this cleanser from my dermatologist&#x27;s office. After using it, I was hooked. My skin tone had been blotchy with uneven skin tone. My skin improved to the point I was willing to go out in public without foundation although still wear foundation for everything other than everyday running around. And it doesn&#x27;t dry out my dry skin. I ordered 3 bottles elsewhere, could have saved money by purchasing it here. BTW, within the last week, have had 2 people remark that my skin looks like a baby&#x27;s. Pretty good for an aging baby boomer.    Robin Barr, 60 yrs old  [...]</li>
            <li> It takes the fatigue look after a long day of work!!</li>
            <li> A great price for a favorite of mine.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and this cleanser works great. It&#x27;s creamy which is less drying to the skin and I feel like my face is thoroughly cleansed after use. If you have sensitive skin, try just using once a day and see how your skin reacts.</li>
            <li> I love aveeno and this product last for a long time (4 months) altough I use daily with my mia clarisonic still not harming my skin. However, I am giving 4 stars because I love the soft feeling (luxus) that regular foaming aveeno leaves in my skin. Yes, you must try...will safe you some $, since last longer than the foaming aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;xoxo</li>
            <li> I am a big Aveeno fan.  This product arrived quickly, was well packed and in perfect condition.  I use it daily and am extremely pleased with both the price and the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy w/this cleanser! I have sensitive skin &amp; really have to watch what I use. I&#x27;ve done the trial &amp; error method &amp; I&#x27;m glad to be done w/that (so is my skin) :) I put my Hempz Original lotion(great stuff) on afterwards &amp; I&#x27;m good to go!</li>
            <li> Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleanser, 6.7 Ounce is a great facial product.  It leaves your face clean and fresh and not dry.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened but after a couple weeks of use this is burning my skin.  Seems to really effect the area around my cheek bone.  My husband used it once and said he had to get it off as soon as possible because it started burning his skin instantly.  Sorry - Really wanted it to work.  Looks like I&#x27;ll go back to Mary Kay Timewise.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved the Aveeno skincare line. I went away from it for a while and used Olay&#x27;s fresh effects products. I thought they worked for a while but my oily skin only worsened and I began to break out a few weeks ago. I have the same skin care routine every day and it wasn&#x27;t helping my skin. I started using Aveeno positively radiant and Aveeno clear complexion moisturizer just last week and thus far, my skin has cleared up so much. My skin is not oily at all or shiny and it is so great for sensitive skin. Some people complain about how the formula is &amp;#34;too soft&amp;#34; and they don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s cleaning their face. I use a silicone facial scrubber and it works wonders. Hope this review helps!</li>
            <li> Leaves my sensitive skin clean and soft. Great product for older skin.</li>
            <li> I have rosacea so I have to be careful about what I use on my face. This is nice. Cleans with no drying out of the skin.</li>
            <li> my entire family uses this product.  best product for the price.  the expensive ones don&#x27;t have anything on this, except that they sting your eyes terribly!  this one does not.  good for my adolescent son.</li>
            <li> I received this product quickly and my daughter loves it. I had used Aveeno in the past and wanted my daughter to try it out.  She really loves the way it leaves her skin feeling.  She said  the moisturizer feels light and not heavy and I know we will be purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the mail, and was so excited to use it! My skin is pretty sensitive, and Aveeno is supposed to be super good at moisture, helpfulness, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Knowing me, I put it on immediately after it came in the mail. Trouble was, in the morning, I had red blotches all over my face, like a rash. My mom called me this morning, when I was alone. She said &amp;#34;Your rash better?&amp;#34; I responded, &amp;#34;What?&amp;#34; She told me to look in the mirror. Boy, was I horrified at my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t sink in to me that I had a soy milk allergy. Not soy, soy MILK. Maybe that was it? It shouldn&#x27;t have bothered me though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this product to work. Badly. I think if it didn&#x27;t make my face red, it would&#x27;ve worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep on searching for that perfect cleanser, because I haven&#x27;t found it yet. Sigh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helped!</li>
            <li> I just started using this product two weeks ago.  I really love the scent and it leaves a very clean feel.  Not sure if it is helping to even out my skin tone yet...</li>
            <li> This product has QUATERNIUM-15 (FORMALDEHYDE RELEASER), a known carcinogen in it. I love this product but I will stop using it until they get this ingredient out of it. Aveeno: please don&#x27;t give us cancer.</li>
            <li> Love this wash, even my teenager steals it out of my bath to use.  Very gentle on the face, non-drying</li>
            <li> I am an avid fan of Aveeno skin car products and shampoos...</li>
            <li> This product has been my favorite facial cleanser for many years.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin very dry.</li>
            <li> This facial cleanser is alright,seem to do a ok job but nothing special.</li>
            <li> I always come back to this cleanser, and even if I use other things, I usually start with this to remove my sunblock and /or makeup. It is mild and not irritating, lasts a loooong time, and works great with my clarisonic.</li>
            <li> To me hypoallergenic means it does not contain the ingredients or the strong fragrances that are likely to cause an allergic reation.&lt;br /&gt;I am not a highly allergic person but I don&#x27;t like strong fragrances, especially for facial cleansers. When I opened the cap and smelled it, it was like I had just put my face in a bouquet of flowers.  My eyes and nose turned red and itchy. Well, I thought, I will just use this the way I use other &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; products that are too strong smelling for me. I used it as a foot cleanser. My feet turned beet red and itched all the way up to my knees. My eyes and nose turned red and itched like crazy. I will be throwing this away and going back to my Phisoderm for Sensitive Skin which has a little too much mineral oil for my face, but it is truely hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I love all Aveeno products but this is my favorite fash wash. It doesn&#x27;t feel oily, and I feel clean all day.</li>
            <li> This product is great</li>
            <li> I like this product and think it makes my skin look younger.  It is easy to find in the local stores but I get it for a good price on Amazon.  It is convenient to have it shipped to the house.  I usually fill in an order to get to the free shipping amount form Amazon.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell of it when you first open the bottle and with the cleanser and toner my face seems to be getting back to the ph level for nice skin. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> The only cleanser I will use for my face during the day and at night. Refreshing everything morning!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser for years. It takes off all of my makeup, including mascara! That&#x27;s why I love it so much, one cleansing step that gets all of the makeup off. I use my serum, night cream &amp; eye gel and my nighttime skincare is done.  Also, it is the most beautiful glowy liquid. Just very pleasant to use all around.</li>
            <li> i like all products of Aveeno brand. Hight quality and geed price as usually. Thank you so so much Aveeno.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old with oily skin, and I have always loved Aveeno products. I read some of the reviews and thought I would give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the texture of it, it reminds me of a liquid pearl. Used it for a week, and I didn&#x27;t see any results as far as being any more or less radiant. Maybe I need to try for 2 weeks to see the full results. Overall I was happy with the product and will continue using it.</li>
            <li> The best cleanser I&#x27;ve found yet. Smells great and very&lt;br /&gt;gentle.</li>
            <li> i just love it... short of words, its amazing in conjunction with the moisturiser. i love it. its just briliant</li>
            <li> I was searching for a skin cleanser that wouldn&#x27;t dry my skin out, but would clean effectively. I have kind of difficult skin being both oily and dry so I looked through a lot of products and reviews. When I switched to this product I began to breakout after 2 or 3 days of using it. Everything else stayed the same, i.e. my moisturizer, my diet, my exercise, my sleep etc. so I feel justified in saying that this product made me breakout and I definitely won&#x27;t ever buy it gain.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I found it while on vacation in California and it has become my go to fash wash that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and always does a great job!</li>
            <li> I use this cleanser to wash my face and I really like it.  Leaves my skin feeling feeling soft and silky smooth.  My only complaint is that a lot of product is left at the bottom of the bottle.  Can&#x27;t pump it out.  To deal with this i cut off the top of the bottle (until there&#x27;s about and inch of bottle left at the bottom) and get the rest out by hand.  A  pain in the neck, but a problem I&#x27;ve had with other pump-style bottles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m postpartum and dealt with some hormonal skin issues and this was the one product that helped to neutralize them. 10 months after and still using it every morning and evening. It&#x27;s also great with makeup removal.</li>
            <li> No fuss, no muss - gentle cleanser - leaves skin feeling clean and soft.  I only hope they are telling the truth when they say no animal testing involved.</li>
            <li> Really like this cleanser! It&#x27;s gentle enough for everyday use and I see a brighter appearance in my skin just after one use. Definitely give it a try!</li>
            <li> Mild and gentle.  You just FEEL clean after you use it - very refreshing and good at getting off light makeup (although I still use an eye-makeup remover along with it).  While it&#x27;s not over-drying, it&#x27;s probably not the best choice for someone with extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on nice &amp; gets makeup off well &amp; yet doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dried out.  By far the best facial cleanser I have used!</li>
            <li> This is a product that continues to work for me.  Very pleased with the results and the price.</li>
            <li> This product does not dry the skin out and works well.  My only complaint for me is that I find it difficult to push the pump to get the product out while in the shower.  It is a very short pump and short spout and needs a hard pump to get the product out.</li>
            <li> Pretty good cleanser. Seems to do the job. Must take care in using a small amount, as it can be difficult to rinse off.</li>
            <li> It does everything it says above except even out skin tone, which is really what I was looking for. Its not too harsh for my sensitive skin. I feel fresh and light after I use it. It has a nice smell and it feels soft on my face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 36 and I have some dark spots developing and I&#x27;m starting to see more of an uneven skin tone with blotchy red spots. Not anything hugely noticeable, yet, that is. I was really hoping I would see it even out a little and lighten up my dark spots but no such luck. On to the next one.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Cleans all the makeup away without drying! Easy to use in the shower...bonus!</li>
            <li> I receive this product on its scheduled time.  So far so good with this product.  My daughter turned me on to the facial wash.  She has been using aveeno for years... I thought that I would give it a try.  It does not dry my skin out and it leaves no residue as some soap or other facial cleanser does.  I am happy with this.</li>
            <li> Great product, it&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve used on my face for years now, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin too much</li>
            <li> I beleve this face wash is for those who really love to wear make up. the face wash really take up makeup and dirt form the face but its okay stuff</li>
            <li> THIS AVEENO SOAP MAKES MY FACE SMOOTH AND BABYLIKE. THIS IS THE ONLY SOAP I TRUST MY FACE WITH,&amp; I&#x27;M VERY PICKY WHEN IT COMES TO FACIAL CLEANSING . IT ALSO MADE MY FACE A LITTLE LIGHTER , BUT OVERALL I&#x27;M A SATISFIED CUSTOMER. DELIVERY WAS EXTREMELY FAST...</li>
            <li> Just average.  Nothing special about this product for me. But I guess at 52 I need to stop hoping for miracles.</li>
            <li> Just love this stuff it does not get rid of brown spots lol as it states just a nice facial moisturizer is about it</li>
            <li> I love how this feels.  It gives you a feeling that your skin is firmer and glowing.  I won&#x27;t be using any other product after trying this.</li>
            <li> Love aveeno products!</li>
            <li> Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Aveeno is my go-to skin cleanser for every occasion.  No negatives.  I have recommended to friends and relatives who desire a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I have used it before in the past.</li>
            <li> The cleanser make my skin softer and with one use. Use the lotion that comes with this product.</li>
            <li> This is being alternated with the pads...one is used at night, other during the day.  3 weeks, no visible improvement that I can see.  I&#x27;m switching as soon as this stuff is gone, unless I get money to buy something else.  I don&#x27;t expect miracles, but a visible improvement would be nice...</li>
            <li> I know some people say it doesn&#x27;t lather, but from experience lather doesn&#x27;t always mean it&#x27;s working, that can have a lot to do with the hardness of your lather. I love the iridescence (make sure to shake the bottle!!). Not only does the iridescence make me feel fancy and indulge my girlish side, but it really does give my face a nice glow. I first used a natural cleanser by a company called Fresh and it was just way to expensive. This was my economical replacement and it feels just as gentle and soothing on my face. After just one use my skin felt so soft, and even though its natural and gentle it worked magic on removing my mascara. I&#x27;ll be putting this item on my subscription list.</li>
            <li> I use this on a regular basis.  For the price point, it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t dry out my face and cleans deeply. always makes my skin feel soft and clean. very happy with this product</li>
            <li> Received as scheduled and is a great product. I bought it to use with my power face scrub brush and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> When I was younger, I struggled with acne and would use products that were definitely stronger than this. As I grew older and my acne subsided, I realized that the stronger products were drying my skin out even after a moisturizer was applied. Switching to something softer took some time for my skin to adjust, but this keeps my face very clean and nice. It doesn&#x27;t stop the occasional hormone or stress induced acne flare, but it keeps my pores and skin relatively clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to someone with acne issues, but for the average woman this is a refreshing and effective cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: it&#x27;s a cream instead of a foam, I hate the foam.</li>
            <li> This product is a perfect addition to my skin care program. It leaves my face feeling clean without drying it out. It&#x27;s perfect for my needs as a woman with aging skin.</li>
            <li> My package came early and this is a great facial wash,  it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin! Will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> This is the product that I use everyday to clean my face, throat, neck and chest area.  It leaves my skin soft and smooth.  I will use this product forever.  I will recommend this to my friends and relatives.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, have been using it or years.  It keeps my skin looking healthy and youthful even without makeup!</li>
            <li> This is the cleanser my daughter loves.  She is very happy with the quality of this product.  Thank you for making this possible!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. IT HELPED CLEAR MY ACNE. I AM VERY PLEASED.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this Aveeno facial cleanser for years. I tend to be a bit oily, and this one strikes just the right balances of cleansing my oiliness without drying me out.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! My 57 year old face feels better already. Pretty sure it&#x27;s looking better, too.</li>
            <li> This cleanser cleans well and does not irritate my skin; it gets all of the makeup off without overly drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> One of my favorite cleansers.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and does seem to improve my skin texture.  Also seems to mildly lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> Nice for sensitive skin.  Leaves a nice, toned but not dry  feeling after use.</li>
            <li> This is an affordable face cleanser, which works great! I have sensitive combination skin and this is gentle and effective. I highly recommend it. Something to keep in mind is that a little goes a long way--two pumps are enough for my entire face and neck.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years and I love the way it makes my face feel like.  I have started other family memebers to use it.  Mostly my nephew who did not like washing his face uses it now every day.</li>
            <li> It really works and is soothing/calming. Not like harsh bleaches----VERY good alternative.</li>
            <li> This is the only facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used that cleans my skin without stripping it of all healthy oils. I have combination skin and had a hard time getting rid of a few breakouts that seemed to never go away on my chin. This did the trick. It smells good, has a light lather, and rinses clean. My face feels so good every time I use it!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the Aveeno line.  Nice products.  Now if I could just look like Jennifer Aniston (spokesperson for Aveeno if you didn&#x27;t know.).</li>
            <li> This product is one of the best I&#x27;ve found (among other Aveeno skin products) for improving the quality of my skin, evening out the texture and tone, helping control breakouts, and making it nice and soft.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for several weeks now in the morning (I use something else at night) and it works well.  The bottle is very nice but one pump doesn&#x27;t seem like enough so I always have to do at lest two.  I use this with my Clarisonic face brush and it lathers up very nice.  Everyone has different skin and everyone&#x27;s skin reacts differently to products.  This product hasn&#x27;t broken me and leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth.  It doesn&#x27;t hydrate it as by the time I have my hair dried with the hair dryer I feel like I need some face lotion on.  But I feel this is pretty typical for my skin during the winter months as it gets pretty dry.  I would repurchase this cleaner in the future and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using Aveeno for a long time.  It is my favorite cleanser.  What can I say about it, other than it is a good product and does what it is supposed to do.  But just like anything else, you have to find the cleanser that works best for you.  I do not wear liquid make up.  I sometimes wear powder and blush, and I have tried other cleansers (Oreal, Neutrogena), but I like this best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not for oily/acne prone skin. When I would use it on my relatively clean skin first thing in the morning, my face would feel greasy and start breaking out later that day. When I would use it to take my make up off before I went to bed I would usually wake up with several pimples.</li>
            <li> This is the only facewash I use (my skin is very sensitive and reacts to just about anything else). It&#x27;s very clean without being filmy and has a lovely neutral scent.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! I noticed brighter looking skin with in 1 days use. I accidentally ended up leaving it while we went out of town and I couldn&#x27;t wait to buy another! I needed it now. It makes a difference and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin shiny or oily. In fact I&#x27;ve had a reduction in blackheads since using this. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now.</li>
            <li> I use two pumps twice daily and my skin is now super bright and glowing. When you pump it out you can tell that its luminous. Its not harsh on my skin and it has defintely helped my skin clear up. I&#x27;ve used some other cleanser and it made my face feel waxy which I don&#x27;t like because that means your skin is not breathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Lots of product, two pumps twice a day lasted me 3.5 months!&lt;br /&gt;Makes your skin bright and luminous&lt;br /&gt;Gentle on skin and everyday use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None!</li>
            <li> This is non drying gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s because I&#x27;m used to foam, but this product doesn&#x27;t do it for me. I was very disappointed. I should state however that I have a very clear youthful complexion with combination skin.  I think this would work well for those with dry skin because it feels a little too heavy after washing with mine.  It does feel silky but like I said for someone with combination skin it might be too greasy/heavy. I feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup. I&#x27;m certain that if my skin was dry I would love it though.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  No dry feeling.  Removes all makeup.  Leaves me refreshed and feeling like I&#x27;m squeaky clean!  I love all the Aveeno products I use.</li>
            <li> There are tiny beads in this cleanser that help softly scrub your face clean.  I keep one in the shower and one by my sink and use it every day.  It has a very tiny fragrance that just smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on your skin either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you get this one and not Aveenos basic cleanser as it won&#x27;t have the beads.  I made that mistake once.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t pay attention to whether or not it was scented, so when I used it, I was kinda bummed at the smell.  I am used to Clinique, but decided to try this for the price, and to see if it would combat my dry skin.  The smell is not unpleasant at all; I am just used to products without perfumes.  Otherwise, it seems fine.  I will probably try something unscented next time.</li>
