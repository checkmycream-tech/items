            <li> This perfume was not like i expected its too weak i didn&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> It wasnt what i was looking for and it didn&#x27;t smell good. It smelled cheap and basically I wasted money purchasing it.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine was given this perfume and I love hers.  So I purchased myself some and this stinks.  I smelt it and threw it away immediately.</li>
            <li> i ordered this hoping it was a scent that i would like. What i got was a LONG LASTING fRAGRANCE THAT DOES NOT OFFEND !! I  I will be making future purchases of this scented oil.. in TRUTH I prefer this oil to a spray,splash, or much too expensive perfume that does Not blend well with my dna....</li>
            <li> I was given the name of this fragrance by a friend who was wearing it is a sweet clean smell that reminds me of sweetheart soap. I love it and it stays with me all day!</li>
            <li> Great smell..my wife loves it too!!... And we&#x27;re white!!!!</li>
            <li> It smells absolutely horrid . . . nothing at all like the &amp;#34;actual&amp;#34; Black Woman fragrance oil.  Think BRUT for Men . . .  : (</li>
            <li> This perfume oil is a wonderful scent.  Every time I wear it, I get tones of compliments.  Was wondering if you have other products that smell this good..</li>
            <li> I love this oil..the fragrance is the best long lasting head turning just an awesome and pleasant smell....wish it came in a larger bottle can&#x27;t keep my Daughter. Granddaughter. Out of mine...even after giving them one of there own..;+)</li>
            <li> Great product!!!! Sent last fotever</li>
            <li> Did not expect it to smell so good and the scent last for along time. Will be ordering more at a later date</li>
            <li> Excellent body oil will highly reccommend!</li>
            <li> I like my black women oil</li>
            <li> I would never order this item again. It&#x27;s does not have a nice smell. I smelled Black Woman on another woman and it smelled really good. She told me it was a roll on oil. My husband even said, &amp;#34;please do not ever wear that stinky oil&amp;#34;, and I must agree. If this is selling I not sure why, I have tried to give it away and once they smell it they do not want it. I will not send it back because it did not cost that much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very long lasting smell. It smells good.</li>
            <li> I really like this. Thank ya seller. Have a great day.</li>
            <li> The product was excellent, just like I expected.</li>
            <li> This is a very very long lasting fragrance that smells clean and fresh. Almost like you just got out of the shower kind of smell. It reminds me a lot of Odyssey from Avon. Cant use too much though cause it can be very overpowering. Just a little goes a long way. I would not were it everyday. I would just use it occassionaly because i would get tired of it very quickly. This way it&#x27;ll be a nice clean soft fresh suprise every now and then.</li>
            <li> This oil is just the best.....people ask me all the time what I am wearing...this is my favorite body oil ....the scent lasts all day...what a great price...great quality</li>
            <li> Very weak! Far from the original Black Woman fragrance! Definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for this scent for a while. It is exactly what I had been looking for and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome fragrance and it last a couple of days. I love it, about to order it again.</li>
            <li> I never got the tie pen or the necklace set</li>
