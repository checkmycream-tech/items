    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Otherwise, great product!!</li>
            <li>Wonderful to soothe sore lady parts after birth</li>
            <li>Excellent for postpartum healing.</li>
            <li>This was wonderful to have after giving birth.</li>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>You can use the leftover liquid from heating up the tea bag to make frozen &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34; which are a perfect compliment to the heat when you&#x27;re feeling swollen.</li>
            <li>would say it is a very fair price for 6 bags -</li>
            <li>Good deal for the price!</li>
            <li>i bought some sitz bath herbs from the herb shop that were a fraction of the price and were very potent!</li>
            <li>This was great to come home and soak in the tub with.</li>
            <li>This was great, I felt the bath herbs were soothing</li>
            <li>They are great in the tub or frozen on pads for soothing after childbirth.</li>
            <li>These are amazing!</li>
            <li>the smell from the herbs was pleasant and relaxing to sit in.</li>
            <li>I discovered these herbal sachets when I had my 4th baby, and I absolutely loved them.</li>
            <li>I used this when I had my babies and loved it.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know if the product itself is good or not.</li>
            <li>It smells good.</li>
            <li>But, the brand is good, so i trust it.</li>
            <li>Good product, would buy again.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>A lot more work than I thought!  </li>
            <li>These herbal pouches are amazing-</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s kind of like a tea bag that you put in your underwear.</li>
            <li>Took it to the hospital in a warm thermos.  </li>
            <li>Was very easy to use and helped a ton after baby was born.</li>
            <li>think if I used them sooner, it would have been more beneficial.</li>
            <li>It smelled lovely.</li>
            <li>I got in and relaxed from time to time squeezing the tea bag and releasing more tea into the water.</li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed playing with it too.</li>
            <li>I love most of the products from this company and this didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li>I should have read the reviews or package more closely before I purchased.</li>
            <li>I was thinking this was something you add to a bath to soak in, but it is more like a tea bag that you steep and then wear in your underwear.</li>
            <li>This just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Kept it in a warm thermos and filled my peri bottle with it.  </li>
            <li>Love all their products.</li>
            <li>Although the price may seemed to be cheap here, but the bag of each herbs are very easy to tear.</li>
            <li>Yes, I have had midwives assure me that baths are good after having babies, just sanitize the tub first</li>
            <li>I used the remaining couple of sachets in super hot Sitz baths, and found that they were great.</li>
            <li>These are quick and easy to use!  </li>
            <li>I personally adore baths and have a beautiful tub to take them in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed or not, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li>(Just place a frozen sachet on a clean pad, or use one of the tea soaked pads.)</li>
            <li>I think these bath herbs helped with my healing and if nothing else they made me feel special.</li>
            <li>They are organic &amp; gentle and I bought a huge supply of them!  </li>
            <li>So much so, that I have gifted them to others.</li>
            <li>Cover in boiling water, let cool and steep.</li>
            <li>and I healed quickly after the birth of my son.</li>
            <li>(there&#x27;s salt in there, and salt isn&#x27;t great on open wounds), and really didn&#x27;t provide any relief for me.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing.</li>
            <li>This new packaging is reportedly very easy to tear and product spills out even with gentle use, so I won&#x27;t be buying it again in this packaging.</li>
            <li>I was looking for more of an herbal bath packet like those that I got from my midwife (more of a dark tea-like bath)</li>
            <li>in order to get the full benifits, you need to steep this much longer than suggested on the box.  </li>
            <li>It was supposed to be a gift, so it didn&#x27;t really look good to present to the new mom.</li>
            <li>As a first time parent, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with my body.</li>
            <li>I added the tea bag under the hot flowing water and watched as it tinted the tub a bit brown.</li>
            <li>Overall I love the Earth</li>
            <li>Love the entire Earth Mamma Angel Baby line!</li>
            <li>There really isn&#x27;t a lot of leftover liquid to make a good bath, it&#x27;s very weak-smelling and light in color, and the pads are very uncomfortable to just put in your underwear, not to mention that they kind of stain</li>
            <li>Easy to use and provides instant relief!  </li>
            <li>I have used these herbs with my last two episiotomies and believe that they have given me quick recoveries!</li>
            <li>very calming on the body</li>
            <li>I used one and it didn&#x27;t really do much for me</li>
            <li>and I still feel they are very soothing and</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any tearing, but greatly appreciated this product.  </li>
            <li>Follow the directions and be gentle</li>
            <li>I steeped them in sitz baths after delivery and they really helped speed up the healing process, I feel.</li>
            <li>Very relaxing.</li>
            <li>i found it very soothing.</li>
            <li>oh and it costs too much.</li>
            <li>Very soothing.  </li>
            <li>The tea bag is very soothing on perenium pain post birth.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with pain.</li>
            <li>I may try these again if we have another baby, but for the time being, make SURE you are purchasing from Earth Mama Angel Baby and not some other place.</li>
            <li>This is a must have for every new Mom!</li>
            <li>Product used to be available loose with a fill it yourself</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>At the very least, it was good for temporary, immediate pain relief.  </li>
            <li>these are a bit more expensive than buying loose herbs to make a soak with, but I didnt end up using nearly half of what I bought for my last birth, so I think these are ideal!</li>
            <li>Recommend for EVERY natural or vaginal delivery momma!</li>
            <li>I would recommend using in a pad versus in a sitz pad for more targeted relief (for other reviewers who said that the remaining liquid was not enough to be soothing in a bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Completely relaxing.</li>
            <li>and it really isn&#x27;t a lot of work - it&#x27;s as simple as boiling water in the kettle and letting them steep!</li>
            <li>They say to just use the pad directly on your \\&quot;lady parts\\&quot; and use the leftover liquid for the bath.  </li>
            <li>It also didn&#x27;t feel as therapeutic as the old version.  </li>
            <li>Not recommended if you are serious about trying to get better.</li>
            <li>The herbs would spill out easily and the herbs are not strong enough to heal your wound.</li>
            <li>I found these pads to be less useful as they just burst in the water.  </li>
            <li>I mean that&#x27;s ok, but it just wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li>she lied about the shipping date, the package arrived in a plain manila envelope so the box was crushed, and by the time I got the herbs, I was mostly healed down there after birth.</li>

            <li> she lied about the shipping date, the package arrived in a plain manila envelope so the box was crushed, and by the time I got the herbs, I was mostly healed down there after birth.</li>
            <li> You can use the steeped water in a sitz bath, but it&#x27;s probably not strong enough for the whole bath tub.</li>
            <li> I use 2 herbal pouches and steep for at least 15-20 minutes in boiling hot water before using.</li>
            <li> Ordering again for me and my new little girl!</li>
            <li> Completely not acceptable</li>
            <li> and they actually took some of the swelling down and eased the pain.</li>
            <li> the seller I purchased from (I left him his own bad review) was called Good Earth Store or something like that, it was just horrible.</li>
            <li> but as other reviewers have mentioned, the individual bags are not strong enough.</li>
            <li> Once they had cooled, I poured the &amp;#34;tea&amp;#34; on to one or two Natracare pads, and put the pads and the wet sachets into the freezer to use after delivery.</li>
            <li> and these are not really it.  </li>
            <li> and you have to sit on a towel to avoid getting everything you sit on wet.  </li>
            <li> As other have said, I thought it was like a tea bag for the bath, rather than a wet pad you held against your nether regions.  </li>
            <li> that worked extremely well.</li>
            <li> Not only did I use the &amp;#34;tea bags&amp;#34; against my very swollen lady parts, but also used the remaining liquid in additional maxi pads, put in the freezer, and then used ice cold.</li>
            <li> I froze mine, it&#x27;s super cold.</li>
            <li> You do have to handle the sachets, once they&#x27;ve been soaking, a little carefully, like you would any tea bag.</li>
            <li> In the past, the bath herbs were designed to be used loose in the bath, but I put them in a cloth bag to contain them.  </li>
            <li> I went ahead and tried it anyway, but it stung a little</li>
            <li> I had a VERY bad internal laceration with surgery following delivery, so my healing process was a little longer than normal.</li>
            <li> they come in little packets and are not potent at all.</li>
            <li> I found this product a little late, but I felt it stll worked.</li>
            <li> I brewed some in a pot on the stove and poured a bit onto long overnight pads, and put them in the freezer, so I can get the benifit of the cold to decrease swelling, and the herbs to help heal any tears.</li>
            <li> NOT A GOOD IDEA to mail a box in an envelope.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t as bad with this delivery as there was no tearing.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> very calming on the body</li>
            <li> These herbal pouches are amazing- but as other reviewers have mentioned, the individual bags are not strong enough. I use 2 herbal pouches and steep for at least 15-20 minutes in boiling hot water before using. As a doula I recommend them to all my clients.</li>
            <li> A lot more work than I thought!  I wanted to freeze them but they come out kinda liquid even after days in freezer... still used but dont think they help!  Get ice packs instead</li>
            <li> I will not purchase the product again. Although the price may seemed to be cheap here, but the bag of each herbs are very easy to tear. The herbs would spill out easily and the herbs are not strong enough to heal your wound. Not recommended if you are serious about trying to get better.</li>
            <li> This is not what I thought it would be. I thought it would be some salts or something you could just throw in the bath tub to soak in post partum but it&#x27;s kind of like a tea bag that you put in your underwear. Meh. I used one and it didn&#x27;t really do much for me so I ended up throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Completely relaxing. Recommend for EVERY natural or vaginal delivery momma! Definitely will be including in my baby shower gifts to friends!!</li>
            <li> I discovered these herbal sachets when I had my 4th baby, and I absolutely loved them. To use them, a couple weeks before delivery, I boiled about a cup of water and then let the sachet soak for 5-10 minutes. Once they had cooled, I poured the &amp;#34;tea&amp;#34; on to one or two Natracare pads, and put the pads and the wet sachets into the freezer to use after delivery. (Just place a frozen sachet on a clean pad, or use one of the tea soaked pads.) I used the remaining couple of sachets in super hot Sitz baths, and found that they were great. You do have to handle the sachets, once they&#x27;ve been soaking, a little carefully, like you would any tea bag. They were soothing on itchy stitches, helped heal bruising, and I felt like I just healed a lot faster. These are now a must have in my book!</li>
            <li> Product used to be available loose with a fill it yourself bag and that worked extremely well. This new packaging is reportedly very easy to tear and product spills out even with gentle use, so I won&#x27;t be buying it again in this packaging.</li>
            <li> This was for my daughter-in-law &amp; well received.  She stated that the herbs helped postpartum.</li>
            <li> I found this product a little late, but I felt it stll worked. I had a VERY bad internal laceration with surgery following delivery, so my healing process was a little longer than normal. I used these 5 weeks post partum and they actually took some of the swelling down and eased the pain. I continue to use them (9 weeks PP) and I still feel they are very soothing and comforting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if I used them sooner, it would have been more beneficial. Otherwise, great product!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get to use had an emergency csection I&#x27;ll be passing it along to another mama</li>
            <li> As a first time parent, I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with my body. This was great to come home and soak in the tub with.</li>
            <li> I had a natural birth at a birthing center (meaning no epidural, just me pushing the baby out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased these and these were a lifesaver! Not only did I use the &amp;#34;tea bags&amp;#34; against my very swollen lady parts, but also used the remaining liquid in additional maxi pads, put in the freezer, and then used ice cold. Talk about relief! I would recommend using in a pad versus in a sitz pad for more targeted relief (for other reviewers who said that the remaining liquid was not enough to be soothing in a bath).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have given some of my left over tea bags (2-3 bags) to a neighbor who also found them to be soothing, and have been recommending them to all my momma friends ever since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say it is a very fair price for 6 bags - and it really isn&#x27;t a lot of work - it&#x27;s as simple as boiling water in the kettle and letting them steep!</li>
            <li> I used this when I had my babies and loved it. Got it as a gift for a dear friend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and provides instant relief!  I didn&#x27;t have any tearing, but greatly appreciated this product.  And it&#x27;s all-natural ingredients that promote healing.</li>
            <li> Was very easy to use and helped a ton after baby was born. Follow the directions and be gentle and you won&#x27;t have any bursting problems. I never had one burst open.</li>
            <li> I have used these herbs with my last two episiotomies and believe that they have given me quick recoveries! So much so, that I have gifted them to others.</li>
            <li> Wonderful to soothe sore lady parts after birth</li>
            <li> This is a must have for every new Mom!</li>
            <li> After I had my baby I was eager to get home and into the tub. Yes, I have had midwives assure me that baths are good after having babies, just sanitize the tub first so you don&#x27;t introduce bacteria to your healing body. I personally adore baths and have a beautiful tub to take them in. I added the tea bag under the hot flowing water and watched as it tinted the tub a bit brown. It smelled lovely. I got in and relaxed from time to time squeezing the tea bag and releasing more tea into the water. I was worried I would break the tea bag but that never happened and I really enjoyed playing with it too. I think these bath herbs helped with my healing and if nothing else they made me feel special.</li>
            <li> Excellent for postpartum healing. Cover in boiling water, let cool and steep. I froze mine, it&#x27;s super cold.</li>
            <li> This was wonderful to have after giving birth. I used them in the bath to help heal and relax, as well as placing a steeped pack in my underwear for perineum care.</li>
            <li> they come in little packets and are not potent at all. and they are WAY overpriced...i bought some sitz bath herbs from the herb shop that were a fraction of the price and were very potent!</li>
            <li> These saved my &amp;#34;bottom&amp;#34; post-partum.  I steeped them in sitz baths after delivery and they really helped speed up the healing process, I feel. At the very least, it was good for temporary, immediate pain relief.  I love most of the products from this company and this didn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer stated, I also was expecting a bath packet that could be used as a soak in the tub.. these instruct the user to press the herbal packet against your privates while you&#x27;re in the tub. I mean that&#x27;s ok, but it just wasn&#x27;t what I expected. I should have read the reviews or package more closely before I purchased. I would rather have something that soaks in the water like a tea bag and then you soak in the tub..&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the seller I purchased from (I left him his own bad review) was called Good Earth Store or something like that, it was just horrible. I got my package THREE WEEKS after ordering, he/she lied about the shipping date, the package arrived in a plain manila envelope so the box was crushed, and by the time I got the herbs, I was mostly healed down there after birth. I may try these again if we have another baby, but for the time being, make SURE you are purchasing from Earth Mama Angel Baby and not some other place.</li>
            <li> This was great, I felt the bath herbs were soothing and I healed quickly after the birth of my son. I didn&#x27;t even need to use all of the packets in the box.</li>
            <li> Very relaxing. I used 2-3 bags at a time, in bath water for post partum soak. I felt like it helped aid in healing. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I was looking for more of an herbal bath packet like those that I got from my midwife (more of a dark tea-like bath) and these are not really it.  They say to just use the pad directly on your \\&quot;lady parts\\&quot; and use the leftover liquid for the bath.  There really isn&#x27;t a lot of leftover liquid to make a good bath, it&#x27;s very weak-smelling and light in color, and the pads are very uncomfortable to just put in your underwear, not to mention that they kind of stain and you have to sit on a towel to avoid getting everything you sit on wet.  So if you are looking strictly for herbal bath packets, don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
            <li> i found it very soothing. It was alot of work just to use it tho i would have preferd to just throw it in the bath. oh and it costs too much.</li>
            <li> I was thinking this was something you add to a bath to soak in, but it is more like a tea bag that you steep and then wear in your underwear. You can use the steeped water in a sitz bath, but it&#x27;s probably not strong enough for the whole bath tub.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift so I don&#x27;t know if the product itself is good or not. It smells good. But the box was shipped in an envelope. NOT A GOOD IDEA to mail a box in an envelope. So the package arrived smashed. It was supposed to be a gift, so it didn&#x27;t really look good to present to the new mom.</li>
            <li> These are quick and easy to use!  They rapidly increase your rate of healing, a definite must have!</li>
            <li> Actually, i didn&#x27;t use it till now ,it&#x27;s prepared for a month later. But, the brand is good, so i trust it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  My baby boy instantly calms and soothes in the bath with these herbs!  They are organic &amp; gentle and I bought a huge supply of them!  All of the Earth Mama Angel Baby products are perfection!</li>
            <li> As other have said, I thought it was like a tea bag for the bath, rather than a wet pad you held against your nether regions.  I went ahead and tried it anyway, but it stung a little (there&#x27;s salt in there, and salt isn&#x27;t great on open wounds), and really didn&#x27;t provide any relief for me.  I only used two and ended up throwing the rest away.</li>
            <li> I guess I didn&#x27;t fully read the instructions before purchasing. I didn&#x27;t intend to ever make the tea bag and then place it on myself. I prefer the concentrated sitz baths from Motherlove over this just for convenience. Overall I love the Earth Mama Angel Baby company products. This just isn&#x27;t my favorite.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Very soothing.  Took it to the hospital in a warm thermos.  Kept it in a warm thermos and filled my peri bottle with it.  Helped with recovery.  Highly recommend.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Good product, would buy again. Use this after my son was born. Ordering again for me and my new little girl!</li>
            <li> seemed to help with the pain after delivering my 2nd son.  I wasn&#x27;t as bad with this delivery as there was no tearing.  However I do believe this helped aid in a quicker healing and the smell from the herbs was pleasant and relaxing to sit in.</li>
            <li> These are amazing! They are great in the tub or frozen on pads for soothing after childbirth. Love the entire Earth Mamma Angel Baby line!</li>
            <li> The tea bag is very soothing on perenium pain post birth.  You can use the leftover liquid from heating up the tea bag to make frozen &amp;#34;padsicles&amp;#34; which are a perfect compliment to the heat when you&#x27;re feeling swollen.</li>
            <li> In the past, the bath herbs were designed to be used loose in the bath, but I put them in a cloth bag to contain them.  I found these pads to be less useful as they just burst in the water.  It also didn&#x27;t feel as therapeutic as the old version.  I&#x27;m not sure if the formula has changed or not, but I wasn&#x27;t impressed.</li>
            <li> in order to get the full benifits, you need to steep this much longer than suggested on the box.  I have made some &#x27;padcicles&#x27; for post partum, and plan to use the rest to soak in the tub with. I brewed some in a pot on the stove and poured a bit onto long overnight pads, and put them in the freezer, so I can get the benifit of the cold to decrease swelling, and the herbs to help heal any tears. these are a bit more expensive than buying loose herbs to make a soak with, but I didnt end up using nearly half of what I bought for my last birth, so I think these are ideal!</li>
            <li> Love all their products. Really helps with pain. Definitely worth purchasing. Wish I would&#x27;ve gotten them sooner.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this item and it arrived damaged and the box had been taped back together.  It was ordered as a gift for someone.  Completely not acceptable</li>
