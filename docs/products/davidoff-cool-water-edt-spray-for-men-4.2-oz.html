            <li>This purchase was an outstanding value.</li>
            <li>This is one of My favorites in The Sweet Smells department of Toilette waters!</li>
            <li>It has quickly become one of my favorite scents.</li>
            <li>for day or night, you will love this amaizing sport, clean and sensual fragance, the whole audience will notice your fresh presence while you use it!!!  </li>
            <li>I love the clean scent of Cool Water.  </li>
            <li>A clean aroma, captures the nostrils of the prey like birds to a feather.  </li>
            <li>Did not smell ANYTHING like the original Cool Water, and the smell goes away quickly</li>
            <li>The scent lasts practically all day and is a classic scent in own right having been established for quite some time.  </li>
            <li>I started wearing Cool Water about a year before it hit the US market.  </li>
            <li>He said, &amp;#34;Mambo and Cool Water</li>
            <li>This fragrance has a very mild smell, brings good feelings,  just a little smell is already fixed,  loved,  I recommend.</li>
            <li>and I need to find a new cologne, will you help me?&amp;#34;  I did better than that</li>
            <li>Thank you very much</li>
            <li>Got what I wanted at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>You will definitely stand out from everyone else and for many hours without being overpowering with just 2 sprays.  </li>
            <li>Some friends comment that they know when I&#x27;m around because of that certain scent.  </li>
            <li>Thanks a lot.</li>
            <li>Great deal for Cool Water....have even heard it smells similar to Green Irish Tweed</li>
            <li>Not a scent I thought I would have went for as it is a lighter scent than I would normally go for</li>
            <li>When it starts to dry down it becomes more complex while retaining it&#x27;s clean freshness.  </li>

            <li> I started wearing Cool Water about a year before it hit the US market.  It&#x27;s almost all I wear and people have come to expect it.  Some friends comment that they know when I&#x27;m around because of that certain scent.  I love the clean scent of Cool Water.  It&#x27;s not an expensive brand, I know, but for me it&#x27;s become a classic I&#x27;ll continue to wear.</li>
            <li> very good item, the cool water by davidoff for men was the same item to the picture, i&#x27;m very happy with the perfume</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for his birthday.  He hasn&#x27;t been able to find it in stores for years.  We started looking at colognes one day and I asked him what his favorite was.  He said, &amp;#34;Mambo and Cool Water but they quit making them years ago and I need to find a new cologne, will you help me?&amp;#34;  I did better than that, I came online and found them here!!  When he opened them up he was so elated!!!  He had no idea you could find this online (my man is a MANS MANS by every definition - he doesn&#x27;t shop, he&#x27;s rugged, outdoorsie and shoots guns - that says it all!).  They arrived on time and in great condition.  He&#x27;s super happy and so am I.  He smells so SEXY!!!  Now he smells as good as he looks...oh ya!!</li>
