            <li>I make a natural scalp and hair treatment and this pure, and wonderful oil has made it so much better!</li>
            <li>It comes in a bottle where the oil is easy to use without it spilling everywhere.</li>
            <li>If your into making your own homemade hair products jojoba oil should be first on your list.</li>
            <li>It seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s 100% Pure and its a very light oil.</li>
            <li>The oil is good for natural hair.</li>
            <li>, THANK YOU, CAME RIGHT ON TIME!</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my stretched ears (00G) and wow am I impressed!</li>
            <li>This is another oil that I love so much.</li>
            <li>The jojoba oil is light and easy to apply, or wash off when you use too much.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the company for putting such a great product out there.</li>
            <li>Really nice product, and the service from this company was very efficient ( fast)</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t feel as good as other organic 100% jojoba oils.</li>
            <li>However, I make my own hair care products and with this added to the mixture my hair and scalp does not feel as dry.</li>
            <li>It absorbed so fast into my scalp as I applied it.</li>
            <li>slightly more orangey yellow than in the picture.</li>
            <li>I have still be tweaking the ratios, from changing to this one from my other brand since this was a better value its good to me though I&#x27;m hoping some tea tree and maybe avocado oil will help a little more or maybe mixed with.</li>
            <li>Very high quality oils to mix inside your butters or to just place in your bath water.</li>
            <li>I use it to oil my scalp and it has been very instrumental in my hair growth.</li>

            <li>I really like the organic oil.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin feeling smooth and comfortable, not tight, sticky, burning, or rough.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I clean with only water by gently scrubbing with my fingers or a washcloth, and then apply only this when I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>, I didn&#x27;t realize that it would clear his skin in this manner.</li>
            <li>I think I prefer the clear jojoba because it looks cleaner.</li>
            <li>It just smells natural.</li>
            <li>I received about half bottle full.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to calm it down a bit when applied to already blemished skin, however.</li>

            <li> doesn&#x27;t feel as good as other organic 100% jojoba oils. leaves a feeling of oiliness and doesn&#x27;t smell good either!</li>
            <li> This is another oil that I love so much. I use this oil in my hair also along with other oils and it does wonders. It&#x27;s a really great buy and the shipping is very fast. I will be repurchasing this oil.</li>
            <li> Oil just as described by seller. Love that it&#x27;s 100% Pure and its a very light oil. I use it to oil my scalp and it has been very instrumental in my hair growth. This oil isn&#x27;t heavy at all and actually give a soothing feel once applied</li>

            <li> i am happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Very good Quality! thank you!</li>
            <li> The oil is great.  I received about half bottle full.  In the shipment the oil leaked</li>
            <li> I make a natural scalp and hair treatment and this pure, and wonderful oil has made it so much better!</li>
            <li> The oil is good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Awesome and great price!</li>
            <li> Very good size for the price. I have no complaints about this product. This seems to be a very good reliable vendor. I&#x27;ve ordered other products from them as well.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this jojoba oil, makes my skin glow and look moisturized.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS, THANK YOU, CAME RIGHT ON TIME!</li>
            <li> I stopped using commercial cleansers and moitsurizers almost a year ago. Since then, I noticed my skin getting somewhat dry and flaky and needed to bring back the moisture. The jojoba oil is light and easy to apply, or wash off when you use too much. You also do not need to use very much (i dab it on with a piece of tissue or cotton ball and then rinse briefly to remove anything that is too thick) so even a small bottle lasts quite a while. It keeps my skin feeling smooth and comfortable, not tight, sticky, burning, or rough. I no longer have dry peeling patches, which says a lot considering nothing makes for dry air like winter in Wisconsin!&lt;br /&gt;It lost one point because I had read, and perhaps incorrectly assumed, that this would help combat acne. I clean with only water by gently scrubbing with my fingers or a washcloth, and then apply only this when I get out of the shower. While it does make my skin appear \\&quot;fresher\\&quot; it hasn&#x27;t seemed to do anything about acne. I still get the occasional blemish, especially when the hormones are raging, and using this doesn&#x27;t stop it. It does seem to calm it down a bit when applied to already blemished skin, however.</li>
            <li> Really good quality butter! I order from this company a lot because I feel that I&#x27;m purchasing quality. My man&#x27;s father had a really bad case of eczema from Chemotherapy, his skin looked like that of an alligator and he could not find relief to get any sleep. I purchase these butters and made a body butter and in about a week and a half, his skin was totally clear from the dry patches that he had previously suffered from. I was trying to help him sleep, I didn&#x27;t realize that it would clear his skin in this manner. Very high quality oils to mix inside your butters or to just place in your bath water. Thanks to the company for putting such a great product out there.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. This is my third purchase. I use it in my homemade soaps. This is the best price you will find on the internet. And I challenge you to see for yourself. It&#x27;s is a great product and has wonderful properties for you skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Great oil would buy again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my stretched ears (00G) and wow am I impressed! It comes in a bottle where the oil is easy to use without it spilling everywhere. If you&#x27;re looking for something to keep your skin from drying out or chapping, this is definitely it. It may have a earthy smell, but it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell. It just smells natural. It&#x27;s also so easy to apply! It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin with a oily feeling or make you break out. It&#x27;s actually really amazing! I would definitely recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had been using their coconut oil and decided to try their jojoba oil.  I use their coconut oil after my shower and add it to my body lotion.  I have been using jojoba oil as a makeup remover and decided to give this brand a try.  Does a great job removing my makeup and this 8 oz size is a great buy.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery on an excellent product.</li>
            <li> If your into making your own homemade hair products jojoba oil should be first on your list. I purchased this to make my own hair oil. It absorbed so fast into my scalp as I applied it. I can&#x27;t wait to use for my other recipes I have. The price was great too! If you browse for brands for jojoba oil you&#x27;ll see you pay about the same amount as this brand but for only 2-4 oz. of the oil. If you want to use this as a hair oil for growth like me remember to add essential oils to boost the effects. I&#x27;m also going to try out other carrier oils such as argan and avocado.</li>
            <li> slightly more orangey yellow than in the picture. It seems to work just fine. I think I prefer the clear jojoba because it looks cleaner.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, and the service from this company was very efficient ( fast)</li>
