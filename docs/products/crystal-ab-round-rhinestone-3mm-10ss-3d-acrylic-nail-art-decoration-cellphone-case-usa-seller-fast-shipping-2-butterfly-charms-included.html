            <li>There very pretty</li>
            <li>It is hard to find rhinestones in AB finish that does not scratch off easily, but these were looked great upon arrival.</li>
            <li>Totally ordering more !</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Would purchase again, would be nice if they had a local store.  </li>
            <li>Worth the wait</li>
            <li>The delivery was super fast!</li>
            <li>I got it super fast!</li>
            <li>These were cute and the type I wanted, just was expecting them to be bigger, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the details right!</li>
            <li>I got the stones VERY fast.</li>
            <li>and they got here very fast</li>
            <li>however,DIDNT SAY the they also have the hot fix glue on back/can be used 4 more purposes than just cell phones/nail art,can also use my hot fix tool 2 bling-out me &amp; my teenage daughters clothing/accessories/&amp; my Chi-Weenie&#x27;s collars &amp; outfits.</li>
            <li>I love how they sparkle only thing</li>
            <li>Exact size need.</li>
            <li>I really like this product it was exactly as described the AB crystal</li>
            <li>VERY SPEEDY SHIPPING.100%</li>
            <li>That was fast ...</li>
            <li>They are also very shiny</li>
            <li>Thanks again</li>
            <li>but I was looking for real 3mm gems not 2mm gems or 2.something mm gems.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.  </li>
            <li>they got here fast.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast (US seller), clear and pretty.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised on how fast they got delivered.</li>
            <li>I highly doubt I&#x27;ll be ordering again</li>
            <li>They took awhile to receive but as expected with how cheap they are.</li>
            <li>In the picture they look colorful in person they dont look the same...</li>
            <li>not dull looking at all.</li>
            <li>the stones are pretty and the color are nice but alil expensive which I really didn&#x27;t like but</li>
            <li>so I figured that these would, in fact, be 3mm gems and would fit in between the other two sizes.</li>
            <li>There not small and not to big the right size for nail design.</li>
            <li>reason for purchasing shipping was OK speed not super fast but got here in enough time</li>
            <li>They are in reality much closer to being 2mm nail gems - and yes the photos show them on a nail but now that I have some real 3mm gems to look at (they arrived on the same day with these)</li>
            <li>I exchanged them for the 4mm (and received a little bit less since they are larger for the same price) and they&#x27;re perfect!</li>
            <li>I tryed to buy exact same ones at a swapmeet for $10bucks a baggy.</li>
            <li>Yes this came early and I will write a very descriptive review 5 LITTLE Baggies came all wrapped nearly (that was great) and when I open it there&#x27;s about 10-15 little gems in each Baggie!</li>
            <li>Had it looked at by professional and they are not crystal.</li>
            <li>but i got it early with a thank you note attached.</li>
            <li>they dont loose shine... not plastic and the price is very reasonable...</li>
            <li>they come in 3 days or less.. VERY FAST SHIPPING i will be placing another order.</li>
            <li>They are very pretty but a little to big for nails.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I ordered these crystals, but when I received them they were ordinary rhinestones!</li>

            <li> I was so excited when I ordered these crystals, but when I received them they were ordinary rhinestones!</li>
            <li> Have big black flat backs.. Would not order this particular product again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very dissatisfied and WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY!</li>
            <li> im going to hold on to them rather then send them back because im sure ill use em for something!</li>
            <li> but it takes to long to arrive 3-4 weeks</li>
            <li> I decided to order this item and it came 2 days earlier than the expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> I received regular old clear rhinestones and I am not happy about that as that was may</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed they are nothing like the picture not even same quantity very smal amount and very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> Hard to get the true scale of something so small!)</li>
            <li> Not the size expected</li>
            <li> Not what expected....</li>
            <li> ugh not what expected bye</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t what the other reviewers are stating they got</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so shocked how quick I received my shipment.</li>
            <li> they came in these 5 little zip bags.</li>
            <li> Not cheap looking.</li>
            <li> and I felt these were too small.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what I received were not the same AB rainbow crystals as pictured</li>
            <li> The ones I got are 1.5mm VERY SMALL.</li>
            <li> very small.</li>

            <li> Great quality rhinestones. It is hard to find rhinestones in AB finish that does not scratch off easily, but these were looked great upon arrival. will order again!</li>
            <li> I love these they shine so good very eye catching</li>
            <li> None of the promised *bonus* little gold butterfly charms included :-( no big deal, just don&#x27;t promise and not deliver.</li>
            <li> This are super shinny, makes the nail sparkle a lot. All though I had some with out the pack part &amp; I&#x27;m unable to use them like that. That&#x27;s why I took one star off.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so shocked how quick I received my shipment. I ordered it Friday evening &amp; got it Monday! That was fast ... I love how they sparkle only thing is their a lot smaller than I thought they were &amp; it doesn&#x27;t look like there&#x27;s 500pcs they came in these 5 little zip bags. For the price  though I won&#x27;t complain , it&#x27;s enough to do my nails .. But other than that I love them! :-)</li>
            <li> These were cute and the type I wanted, just was expecting them to be bigger, but that&#x27;s my fault for not reading the details right! But I love them!</li>
            <li> Just right, beautiful color, almost like having real diamonds. Perfect for nails.&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was awesome.  Would purchase again, would be nice if they had a local store.  AWESOME</li>
            <li> The delivery was super fast! I was very surprised on how fast they got delivered. They are also very shiny i havent had a chance to use them but i am very excited to see how they look on a set of nails.</li>
            <li> So beautiful. They shine rainbow and they are sooooo perfect. They came in just a couple of days from over seas !!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Just wanted to thank you very nice product and made my wife very happy. She liked them alot. Thanks again</li>
            <li> These crystal are beautiful.. I use them for my nails design everyone loves them even the guys they always compliment me... There not small and not to big the right size for nail design.</li>
            <li> Yes this came early and I will write a very descriptive review 5 LITTLE Baggies came all wrapped nearly (that was great) and when I open it there&#x27;s about 10-15 little gems in each Baggie! I&#x27;m very dissatisfied and WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! I recommend not to buy these there are not 500 gems ! Yes I counted them and I&#x27;m very disappointed I WILL NOT BE BUYING FROM THEM AGAIN.</li>
            <li> I like the product I use it a lot I need to order more but it takes to long to arrive 3-4 weeks I waited</li>
            <li> They are very pretty but a little to big for nails. I still love them</li>
            <li> I got it super fast! 3 days! They don&#x27;t have the shine of swarvoski crystals but they&#x27;re very pretty still. Worth it for sure. Shipping was pricey though.</li>
            <li> the stones are pretty and the color are nice but alil expensive which I really didn&#x27;t like but nice tho</li>
            <li> I originally ordered the 3mm but I wanted to cover my entire nail and I felt these were too small. I exchanged them for the 4mm (and received a little bit less since they are larger for the same price) and they&#x27;re perfect! The seller was very prompt and courteous when I asked for an exchange. Will purchase from seller again</li>
            <li> Great product for price</li>
            <li> I didnt like the product because I thought the rhinestones would be bigger like in 3mm but it was like a 1mm</li>
            <li> Shipped fast (US seller), clear and pretty.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these will order more next time</li>
            <li> THEY ARE GOOD QUALITY, VERY VERY FAST SHIPPING. i WILL BE BUYING MORE. i RECOMMEND THESE IT IS A NICE SIZE AND VERY SPARKLY.</li>
            <li> This pack has just oodles of crystals.  They&#x27;re very nice and iridescent, and again, there&#x27;s so many of them!  Great pack at a good price.  It arrived quickly and as advertised.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Did not like the product . Had it looked at by professional and they are not crystal. Have big black flat backs.. Would not order this particular product again</li>
            <li> There are a lot of people like me that look for the products with the best reviews very carefully. I decided to order this item and it came 2 days earlier than the expected delivery date. The crystals are so easy to use and I get many compliments on my nails! Thank you! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately what I received were not the same AB rainbow crystals as pictured I received regular old clear rhinestones and I am not happy about that as that was may reason for purchasing shipping was OK speed not super fast but got here in enough time I&#x27;m really disappointed I didn&#x27;t what the other reviewers are stating they got I highly doubt I&#x27;ll be ordering again</li>
            <li> I really like this product it was exactly as described the AB crystal do not look cheap they shine very very brightly and I am glad that I purchased this item</li>
            <li> I thinks its a good product for nail art and the real good thing is come real fast less then a week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably my own fault for not looking closer at the pictures (though I though I had! Hard to get the true scale of something so small!) but when I looked at my own ruler all appeared ok. I had tiny 2mm nail gems and 4mm craft gems to compare to so I figured that these would, in fact, be 3mm gems and would fit in between the other two sizes. They are in reality much closer to being 2mm nail gems - and yes the photos show them on a nail but now that I have some real 3mm gems to look at (they arrived on the same day with these) I can see that they could also be used as nail gems... but I was looking for real 3mm gems not 2mm gems or 2.something mm gems. Taken in and disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I ordered these crystals, but when I received them they were ordinary rhinestones! So disappointed!</li>
            <li> Great product, crystals are very clear, great for nail art</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.  Exact size need. Not cheap looking. Would order again.</li>
            <li> they are pretty cute i love the size they will work good when its time to to spring time pop out nails cant wait to use them</li>
            <li> Love the gems !!!!!! Really cute and super fast shipping love them. And super affordable. I tryed to buy exact same ones at a swapmeet for $10bucks a baggy. Will be coming back for more ! :)</li>
            <li> I love these crystals ! I started off using the cheap plastic ones and noticed the shine went away really quick and wondered if there was better and there is !!! This is the best Crystal rhinestones i&#x27;ve used so far I use it on acrylic nails and they don&#x27;t ever lose shine! MUST BUY</li>
            <li> I really love these nail crystals i order them almost every week.. they come in 3 days or less.. VERY FAST SHIPPING i will be placing another order. they dont loose shine... not plastic and the price is very reasonable... love these HIGHLY RECOMMEND!&lt;br /&gt;LOVE THESE CRYSTALS!!</li>
            <li> Not the size expected but I&#x27;m still using them :-) they got here fast. 4 stars for that. Gana have to double check the size next time tho</li>
            <li> I do a lot of nail art,  and when I saw these stones, I was in LOVE! love the price, quantity and color! I got the stones VERY fast. They came nicely packed. the only thing is that these stones ARE NOT 3MM. The ones I got are 1.5mm VERY SMALL. im going to hold on to them rather then send them back because im sure ill use em for something!</li>
            <li> Good batch very useful</li>
            <li> Definitely will order again. It came in on time and the crystal look just like what in the picture. But it wasn&#x27;t 500 crystal more like 200.</li>
            <li> I love my rhinestones!! Such a great value! Exactly what I wanted! I was so happy when I received my package! I&#x27;m a happy customer! Thank you!</li>
            <li> In the picture they look colorful in person they dont look the same... Not what expected....ugh not what expected bye</li>
            <li> I loved this set. At the time of purchase didn&#x27;t know about the extra butterflies. I loved the rhinestones as well. I use this for my polymer clay and it worked out wonderfully. Not only the product was good but i got it early with a thank you note attached.I will buy from this seller in the future.</li>
            <li> They took awhile to receive but as expected with how cheap they are. Worth the wait I love them!  Perfect for nail art.</li>
            <li> This product is not by far anything like what I expected and waited for. Jewels mixed and quantity is way under whats described.</li>
            <li> There very pretty and they got here very fast and I also got the two butterfly charms</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed they are nothing like the picture not even same quantity very smal amount and very cheap looking.</li>
            <li> LOVE. perfect for repairs and diy projects ad reasonably priced</li>
