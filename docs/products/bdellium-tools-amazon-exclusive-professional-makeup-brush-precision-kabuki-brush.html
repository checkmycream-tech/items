            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a brush to apply liquid foundation flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>and they are well made and have the best price!!!</li>
            <li>I use it for liquid foundation and it applies it flawlessly.</li>
            <li>I have to agree with others that tis brush is very good for foundation application.  </li>
            <li>Great makeup brush</li>
            <li>This brush was great.</li>
            <li>It was very easy to apply my liquid makeup to get a flawless look.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not to say this one isn&#x27;t a great brush; it is a fantastic brush and you should be very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>Great quality and blends amazingly.</li>
            <li>This brush is a good purchase.</li>
            <li>The color is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>it creates nice airbrushed finish.</li>
            <li>I was really impressed by reviews which indicated Bdellium tools are professional quality products.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect...</li>
            <li>This was an untried (by me) brand, but I took a leap and am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I was really enjoying this brush, but then it broke after I cleaned it 3xs or so.....</li>
            <li>I love the purple brushes they add some cuteness.</li>
            <li>If I didn&#x27;t have them side by side, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference in quality and purpose.  </li>
            <li>thats how much I love this brush, applies foundations and powder like a dream.</li>
            <li>I love this brush as well</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this brush.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels on my face.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad that I bought two.</li>
            <li>so you need to put more effort in making sure that all of the foundation comes out when you wash the brush without getting any water into the ferrule of the brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just okay</li>
            <li>This brush is so awesome and does such a great job with my liquid foundation especially with blending it all in.</li>
            <li>It gives me a good finish and it also cleans up really well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Bdellium, Mac and Sigma are my favorite brushes Bdellium has this unique 957 brush</li>
            <li>year later both brushes are doing great, but I find myself reaching for the E.L.F brand more than the Bdellium.</li>
            <li>better than  a lot of higher end brushes i have tried</li>
            <li>I have a brush cleaner, but mainly clean it with shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this brush after reading so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>So soft and blends flawlessly love the whole  bdellium line I have tons of their brushes and will continue to buy more!</li>
            <li>i really like this product it works great especially for the price.</li>
            <li>However, I don&#x27;t agree that the Bdellium version is worth 3-5x as much unless it also lasts many times longer.  </li>
            <li>Very versatile, easy to use, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very fast and wrapped nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Made</li>
            <li>I have a very limited budget for beauty so getting the best price for an item is very important to me, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on quality either.  </li>
            <li>I love this brush, it is super soft.</li>
            <li>this  brush is very very dense, gives you medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more on the stiff side, professional quality, great brush to add to my collection of Bdelllium brushes</li>
            <li>However, every time I apply it seems cakey without the right tool.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It is a soft brush and makeup goes on smoothly.  </li>
            <li>I used to use flat foundation brushes, but this one is much better.  </li>
            <li>Such a soft amazing quality brush.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft.</li>
            <li>UP too much of the foundation (try cleaning it!)&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Both seem very sturdy to me</li>
            <li>very well made</li>
            <li>A much needed brush to add to anyone&#x27;s brush collection.</li>
            <li>It is the right size to fit in the smaller areas of my face and it buffs like no other.  </li>
            <li>I will be purchasing a few more.</li>
            <li>with very soft and dense materials.&lt;br /&gt;Picks up enough product but not too much, blends easily,&lt;br /&gt;will</li>
            <li>So soft but dense.</li>
            <li>i already have 2 sets of natural bristled bdellium brushes.</li>
            <li>They are both extremely soft but have enough stiffness to apply foundation, which is what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So far it has held up through several washings and no loose bristles.</li>
            <li>The Bdellium has a slightly smaller head and *slightly* more densely packed bristles, but the individual bristles have a little less stiffness, so the net effect is zero.  </li>
            <li>It is a little stiff though like other reviewers said, but amazing still.</li>
            <li>However after receiving it, I find it nearly identical to the E.L.F. studio powder brush which can be obtained for only $3 (or less during their frequent sales).</li>

            <li> NOT good at blending liquid foundation - looks uneven</li>

            <li> I bought this to apply cream foundation, but it&#x27;s a bit stiff when it comes to blending. So I only give it a three because it doesn&#x27;t work well for the purpose I bought it for. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it when applying liquid foundation, so that&#x27;s what I use it for now when I&#x27;m not using my stippling kabuki.</li>
            <li> This brush is a good purchase. I use it for my foundation. It gives me a good finish and it also cleans up really well.&lt;br /&gt;I have another brush from Bdellium and I would definitely purchase another.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever, perfect for foundation, I recommend it. I use it everyday. It doesn&#x27;t shed. perfect for liquid foundation.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a brush to apply liquid foundation flawlessly.  I only recently started \\&quot;needing\\&quot; a foundation with my makeup. However, every time I apply it seems cakey without the right tool.  I have a very limited budget for beauty so getting the best price for an item is very important to me, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on quality either.  I was really impressed by reviews which indicated Bdellium tools are professional quality products.  However after receiving it, I find it nearly identical to the E.L.F. studio powder brush which can be obtained for only $3 (or less during their frequent sales). That&#x27;s not to say this one isn&#x27;t a great brush; it is a fantastic brush and you should be very happy with it.

If I didn&#x27;t have them side by side, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell the difference in quality and purpose.  The Bdellium has a slightly smaller head and *slightly* more densely packed bristles, but the individual bristles have a little less stiffness, so the net effect is zero.  Both brushes take equal pressure to bend the same amount.  They are both extremely soft but have enough stiffness to apply foundation, which is what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if I have any quality issues with either brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One year later both brushes are doing great, but I find myself reaching for the E.L.F brand more than the Bdellium.</li>
            <li> This is my second order of this same brush, I have 2 thats how much I love this brush, applies foundations and powder like a dream. Bdellium, Mac and Sigma are my favorite brushes Bdellium has this unique 957 brush and they are well made and have the best price!!!</li>
            <li> One of the nicest brushes I have ever owned. So soft but dense. The color is absolutely gorgeous. I use mine for applying powder and buffing. I recommend.</li>
            <li> i already have 2 sets of natural bristled bdellium brushes. Mineral Essential 10 Piece Set and  Eye Essential 12 Piece Set (both are studio line) . I got this 957 synthetic brush  for liquid, cream and powder products. it creates nice airbrushed finish. this  brush is very very dense, gives you medium to full coverage. very well made</li>
            <li> I love this brush as well i use this to apply my liquid foundation to buff the product into my face to give an even application.  It is the right size to fit in the smaller areas of my face and it buffs like no other.  i would recommend this brush to everyone.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this brush. It&#x27;s super soft. I love the way it feels on my face. I use it for liquid foundation and it applies it flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Just received this brush yesterday and I&#x27;m so glad that I bought two. Such a soft amazing quality brush. A much needed brush to add to anyone&#x27;s brush collection.</li>
            <li> I love this brush, it is super soft. It is a little stiff though like other reviewers said, but amazing still. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the price. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a blush brush though, because it lays down A LOT of color.</li>
            <li> Very versatile, easy to use, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived very fast and wrapped nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Made with very soft and dense materials.&lt;br /&gt;Picks up enough product but not too much, blends easily,&lt;br /&gt;will definitely be purchasing this and other bdellium tools soon!</li>
            <li> This brush is so awesome and does such a great job with my liquid foundation especially with blending it all in. The downside is that the liquid foundation gets caught way up inbetween the tight bristles so you need to put more effort in making sure that all of the foundation comes out when you wash the brush without getting any water into the ferrule of the brush.</li>
            <li> I find that this brush is not as dense as my regular B&#x27;dellium brush (with the yellow handle). It&#x27;s just okay</li>
