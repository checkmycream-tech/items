    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>While it is beautiful and flattering on the face, it doesn&#x27;t deliver the wonderful health boost of the Korres \\&quot;Ginger &amp; Vitamins\\&quot; product.</li>
            <li>The color is very good and neutral.  </li>
            <li>I am not at all happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Sometimes great, sometime breakouts.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  </li>
            <li>I am in my 60&#x27;s and the coverage is very nice</li>
            <li>I have combination fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I am delighted with the foundation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to be a good match for my fair skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I will continue with this line.</li>
            <li>It is non-toxic, and the shades Porcelain and Cashmere seem to work for my medium fair, rose tint skin.</li>
            <li>Easy to apply, great coverage, moisturizing and</li>
            <li>This makeup stick is beautiful, silky smooth and smells so nice.  </li>
            <li>It spreads nicely with a sponge and is buildable (which means that you can layer it if you need to without having to start all over).&lt;br /</li>
            <li>Just a nice smell I guess.</li>
            <li>The foundation is clean, provides good coverage, and is not overly \\&quot;fragrant\\&quot;.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I LOVE that about</li>
            <li>I will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>I have been using this foundation for probably five years or more.</li>
            <li>I chose this product because I love organic skin care and color cosmetics.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It wasn&#x27;t able to cover my blemishes and it would all be &#x27;gone&#x27; after an hour or two, this was even after using a finishing powder over it.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love Mychelle soaps and skin care, but I will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li>It gives a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my aging skin, though I use it with mineral powder to give more of a matte finish to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone.</li>
            <li>I really do love  MyChelle.</li>
            <li>I layer it a bit to get more coverage.  </li>
            <li>it is pretty good and better than the ones with all the chemicals</li>
            <li>Love this easy to use stick and it passes EWG rating.</li>
            <li>First time I have used this makeup and I&#x27;m very pleased.  </li>
            <li>I could literally sleep in it and remove it the next morning and be HAPPY with the overnight results.</li>
            <li>It blends really smoothly.</li>
            <li>I recommend trying it, but either figure it&#x27;s a cheap risk, or find a store with samples.</li>
            <li>I was also looking for cruelty free product.</li>
            <li>This goes on so smooth and creamy but that is also one of the issues I have with it.  </li>
            <li>If you put this on your eyelids it is too smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>and it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t show every wrinkle.</li>
            <li>The color of this foundation is fair with yellow undertones.  </li>
            <li>Not earthy but not too sweet either.</li>
            <li>Carry in your purse for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li>have very oily skin and break out easily (even in my 30&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have tried many, many different foundations in a broad range of pricing, but none have allowed me to wear them for more than a couple of hours before wanting to scratch my face off.</li>
            <li>Mychelle is both more reasonably priced and much, much easier to apply.</li>
            <li>so for me, that&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a more natural foundation.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using Mychelle skin care, but this particular foundation was way too oily for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin never looked better than when Korres was a regular component of my regimen.</li>
            <li>The only two foundations I&#x27;ve ever been able to use that</li>
            <li>The darker color works well as a bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;(Javier&#x27;s wife) ;)</li>
            <li>I wear makeup everyday and need a good foundation.</li>
            <li>I am flagrantly allergic to lavender &amp; rosemary, which makes health &amp; beauty purchases very tricky for me since the industry DOTES on these ingredients.</li>
            <li>It made my skin shiny, and it was very oily.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this foundation after reading reviews.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t use much on my lids and set it with a mineral powder.</li>
            <li>I just have to remember to really slather the lotion on before I use this.</li>
            <li>This is a creamy more natural than regular makeup miracle.  </li>
            <li>I chose this product because it&#x27;s organic, spread easily on my skin, can layer it evenly, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>This foundation does feel a little greasy, no matter what, but it&#x27;s good lasting coverage,</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth unless you have dry skin...</li>
            <li>Recommend highly.  </li>
            <li>I wish the coverage was a little better...</li>
            <li>It creates a soft, luminous glow that is very flattering to all ages.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the trick is to apply a light moisturizer first and give that a few minutes to soak in.</li>
            <li>I usually use Estee Lauders Fresh Air which covers well but feels light on your skin.</li>
            <li>My shadows were creasing very early in the day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s all natural and never irritates (even if i have to apply it over a blemish!)</li>
            <li>This is the first brand I have found that I can comfortably wear for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Only complaint is that it is not a completely matte finish, but i top with a light, natural powder to set.</li>
            <li>have been searching everywhere for a natural formula that will provide all of the benefits of that Korres product.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m not quite there</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle makeup, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else even close, in this price range and with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I will keep looking for natural makeup products.</li>
            <li>It never irritates my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product did not go on smoothly, felt heavy on my skin and made me look like I had a ton of make up on.</li>
            <li>last more than a few hours, and 3) don&#x27;t make me break out</li>
            <li>and i thought actually made my skin look older.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cover completely, but it has a pretty natural look and doesn&#x27;t feel terribly heavy on my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love a few swipes of the Mychelle stick in the morning for fairly heavy coverage that lasts all day.</li>
            <li>I have some uneven skin tone and some acne scars I&#x27;m trying to cover, and it works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I can usually tell within 10 minutes whether I need to wash them off right away as I begin with a runny nose.  </li>

            <li> This product is also a bit oily feeling which had me a little worried.  </li>

            <li> I like that it is not filled with toxic chemicals.</li>
            <li> And no breakouts or bad reactions, which is unusual for my skin.</li>
            <li> are this Mychelle stick and Vincent Longo Water Canvas ($60 for a small compact).</li>
            <li> I have had foundations in the past that seem to highlight the breakout...</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t hate Mychelle products over all, just this particular one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> seriously...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s why I am using it, not to make it look worse.</li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The color of this foundation is fair with yellow undertones.  It goes on smooth unless you have dry skin...then it flakes.  I wish the coverage was a little better...all and all it is pretty good and better than the ones with all the chemicals</li>
            <li> I bought this when I could no longer get Korres USA&#x27;s \\&quot;Ginger &amp; Vitamins\\&quot; foundation because Johnson &amp; Johnson removed it from the market and pulled it from all shelves in America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been searching everywhere for a natural formula that will provide all of the benefits of that Korres product. So far, I&#x27;m not quite there but this was a close call with Mychelle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&gt; The foundation is clean, provides good coverage, and is not overly \\&quot;fragrant\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; It spreads nicely with a sponge and is buildable (which means that you can layer it if you need to without having to start all over).&lt;br /&gt;&gt; It combines well with other brands and products.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; It creates a soft, luminous glow that is very flattering to all ages. I LOVE that about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&gt; I am flagrantly allergic to lavender &amp; rosemary, which makes health &amp; beauty purchases very tricky for me since the industry DOTES on these ingredients. This product contains one or both AND it is unlabeled, falling under the \\&quot;essential oils\\&quot; catch-all listing.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; While it is beautiful and flattering on the face, it doesn&#x27;t deliver the wonderful health boost of the Korres \\&quot;Ginger &amp; Vitamins\\&quot; product. That Korres product is the only one that I have ever used which actually IMPROVES the condition of my (no longer youthful) skin. I could literally sleep in it and remove it the next morning and be HAPPY with the overnight results. My skin never looked better than when Korres was a regular component of my regimen. Bottom line, Don&#x27;t forget to cleanse before bed if you choose Mychelle Cream Foundation.</li>
            <li> First time I have used this makeup and I&#x27;m very pleased.  It covers, however you can&#x27;t tell you are wearing makeup.  It is non-toxic, and the shades Porcelain and Cashmere seem to work for my medium fair, rose tint skin. I will be purchasing again for sure.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply, great coverage, moisturizing and I love that&#x27;s it&#x27;s all natural and never irritates (even if i have to apply it over a blemish!) I have a problem with chemical foundations causing my eyes to water. Not this one. It blends really smoothly. Only complaint is that it is not a completely matte finish, but i top with a light, natural powder to set.</li>
            <li> The only two foundations I&#x27;ve ever been able to use that: 1) match my skin tone 2) last more than a few hours, and 3) don&#x27;t make me break out are this Mychelle stick and Vincent Longo Water Canvas ($60 for a small compact). Mychelle is both more reasonably priced and much, much easier to apply. Love a few swipes of the Mychelle stick in the morning for fairly heavy coverage that lasts all day. I&#x27;ve found the trick is to apply a light moisturizer first and give that a few minutes to soak in. This foundation does feel a little greasy, no matter what, but it&#x27;s good lasting coverage, so for me, that&#x27;s worth it. And no breakouts or bad reactions, which is unusual for my skin. It&#x27;s not a miracle makeup, but I haven&#x27;t found anything else even close, in this price range and with natural ingredients. I recommend trying it, but either figure it&#x27;s a cheap risk, or find a store with samples. As a foundation stick, it&#x27;s not for everyone. And the colors on the computer are way off.</li>
            <li> I have been using this foundation for probably five years or more. I like that it is not filled with toxic chemicals. I read labels of products all the time. I  won&#x27;t buy things that are going to be harmful for me.</li>
            <li> 6 years ago I suddenly acquired a sensitivity/allergy to an ingredient or ingredients in makeup. I have tried many, many different foundations in a broad range of pricing, but none have allowed me to wear them for more than a couple of hours before wanting to scratch my face off. I can usually tell within 10 minutes whether I need to wash them off right away as I begin with a runny nose.  This is the first brand I have found that I can comfortably wear for at least 8 hours. Now, I am courageous enough to go that next step &amp; try the the Mychelle eye makeup.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because I love organic skin care and color cosmetics. I enjoy using Mychelle skin care, but this particular foundation was way too oily for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have very oily skin and break out easily (even in my 30&#x27;s).&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t hate Mychelle products over all, just this particular one.&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t able to cover my blemishes and it would all be &#x27;gone&#x27; after an hour or two, this was even after using a finishing powder over it.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I have combination fair skin.  The product coverage is medium with a dewey, luminous finish. If you&#x27;re looking for a matte finish, this may not be for you.  This product is also a bit oily feeling which had me a little worried.  I have acne with combination dry/oily spots on my face.  The oily feeling is only temporary.  I do not find it to be to greasy during the day.  I do like the final look and it seems to last.</li>
            <li> This makeup stick is beautiful, silky smooth and smells so nice.  The color is very good and neutral.  Recommend highly.  Carry in your purse for a quick touch up.</li>
            <li> I am not at all happy with this product. It made my skin shiny, and it was very oily. After a couple of hours, you couldn&#x27;t even tell I&#x27;d put it on. I will keep looking for natural makeup products. I love Mychelle soaps and skin care, but I will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> Love this easy to use stick and it passes EWG rating. It&#x27;s so hard to find truly natural ingredient cosmetics but this is one of them.</li>
            <li> It never irritates my sensitive skin. It gives a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to my aging skin, though I use it with mineral powder to give more of a matte finish to the &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; zone. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a bit shiny. The darker color works well as a bronzer.&lt;br /&gt;(Javier&#x27;s wife) ;)</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this foundation after reading reviews. Its so hard to find foundations that are all natural so i thought this might be the one. It made my pores look bigger and i thought actually made my skin look older. Didn&#x27;t  make my skin break out so that was a plus.</li>
            <li> I chose this product because it&#x27;s organic, spread easily on my skin, can layer it evenly, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product, and I will continue with this line.</li>
            <li> I tried this foundation based on other reviews. I was also looking for cruelty free product. I wear makeup everyday and need a good foundation. This product did not go on smoothly, felt heavy on my skin and made me look like I had a ton of make up on. I usually use Estee Lauders Fresh Air which covers well but feels light on your skin.The cost is about the same as Mychelle. I wish they would have offered sample size to try prior to purchase because this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> This is a creamy more natural than regular makeup miracle.  I have problem skin. Sometimes great, sometime breakouts.  This goes on so smooth and creamy but that is also one of the issues I have with it.  If you put this on your eyelids it is too smooth and creamy. My shadows were creasing very early in the day. Now I don&#x27;t use much on my lids and set it with a mineral powder. When I am having a breakout is doesn&#x27;t rough up the dry skin around the breakout. It covers it enought and then I do a little concealer. I have had foundations in the past that seem to highlight the breakout...seriously...that&#x27;s why I am using it, not to make it look worse.It has a smell to it that I love and unfortunately cannot pin point either. Sorry. Not earthy but not too sweet either. Just a nice smell I guess.</li>
            <li> I really do love  MyChelle. I am delighted with the foundation. I am in my 60&#x27;s and the coverage is very nice and it goes on smoothly and doesn&#x27;t show every wrinkle.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a more natural foundation.  I&#x27;m trying to stay away from chemicals for myself and my nursing child.  I went without makeup for a while, but go to where I was wanting some to even out my skin.  I found this and thought I&#x27;d try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be a good match for my fair skin.  The coverage is light-medium.  I layer it a bit to get more coverage.  I have some uneven skin tone and some acne scars I&#x27;m trying to cover, and it works pretty well.  It doesn&#x27;t cover completely, but it has a pretty natural look and doesn&#x27;t feel terribly heavy on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have is that it dries out my already dry skin.  I have to use a lot of lotion before I use this so I don&#x27;t get flaking.  It can give me a shiny finish, which I don&#x27;t like, so I finish with a powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m happy with it.  I just have to remember to really slather the lotion on before I use this.</li>
