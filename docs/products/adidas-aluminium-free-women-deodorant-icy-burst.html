            <li>It&#x27;s the best out there if you are an athlete and sweats a lot like I do!</li>
            <li>This deodorant is  the best there is.</li>
            <li>Very good.</li>
            <li>Addidas created a great product.  </li>
            <li>Smells great</li>
            <li>I tried it because I cannot use antiperspirants and had read this was a great alternative.</li>
            <li>What I didn&#x27;t expect was that when I came home and removed my clothing, I still smelled great.</li>
            <li>It has a very nice smell.</li>
            <li>It smells great on me, works well for me, doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, and I can feel good that it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum.</li>
            <li>The smell was pleasant and not overbearing.</li>
            <li>it is aluminum free, which is the best of all.</li>
            <li>Seeing as this got good reviews I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Of course it not as good as an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li>The Adidas Aluminum Free deodorant works exceptionally well and has an awesome smell.  </li>
            <li>Very pleased with product</li>
            <li>It has good protection, smells nice and</li>
            <li>Smells good, works good, and is better for your health.  </li>
            <li>I will be buying more, because wearing an aluminum-free deodorant is important to me, and the efficacy of this product really impressed me.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy more of this stuff in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li>It kind of controls sweating.</li>
            <li>Also, even when I liked it and had no burning</li>
            <li>So far this is the best one.</li>
            <li>This stuff smells good and for the first couple months I LOVED it.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li>and I work out at a gym three or more times a week.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li>BUT , I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING MORE OUNCES , BUT</li>
            <li>Most aluminum-free deodorant don&#x27;t work --</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT BECAUSE WE</li>
            <li>THAT IT&#x27;S SAFE FOR EVERYBODY.</li>
            <li>Most aluminum free deodorants make you stinkier than if you wore nothing at all.</li>
            <li>I wish this was more easily available.</li>
            <li>HOWEVER WISH IT WAS MORE ACCESSIBLE AS OPOSE</li>
            <li>Too strong.  </li>
            <li>Aluminum free, yes, but this product contains Triclosan, which has been linked to endocrinological disorders.  </li>
            <li>This product was purchased for my wife who prefers aluminum free products.</li>
            <li>Wanted to pass along my satisfaction with the Adidas Aluminum Free deodorant.  </li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>As a pregnant woman I&#x27;ve been struggling to find an aluminium free deodorant.</li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite deodorant.</li>
            <li>I have one unused Adidas available if anyone wants it.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that has kept me smelling nice after I&#x27;ve been profusely sweating.</li>
            <li>Did not seem to do as well as I remembered from my first purchase of Adidas a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>Triclosan has already been banned in most countries because it&#x27;s such a health hazard</li>
            <li>I Have tried a lot of natural deodorants because of the fact that they&#x27;re aluminum free</li>
            <li>I am an avid runner and weight lifter.  </li>
            <li>So after using it once, i switched back to my favorite product--same brand aluminium free-pure powder.</li>
            <li>The fitness fresh scent is awful...smells WAY too much like mens cologne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s by far the best aluminium-free deodorant out there, and I should know, as I&#x27;ve tested Trader Joe&#x27;s (a distant second), Soft &amp; Dri, Body Shop, and Tom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>I live in houston, TX!!  </li>
            <li>The product doesn&#x27;t suppress the sweat (and you really don&#x27;t want to suppress sweat, because it&#x27;s the body&#x27;s way of ridding itself of toxins), but rather absorbs it and masks odor.</li>
            <li>I hope they reconsider, because their \\&quot;cotton tech\\&quot; technology really did work.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this as much as I do.</li>
            <li>I know they are marketed to women, but men for the record - the product works very well for me.  </li>
            <li>I thought I had finally found an aluminum free deodorant that works...</li>
            <li>so much as sticky.</li>
            <li>I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent more money on the &amp;#34;fitness fresh&amp;#34; version of this before I had the burning.</li>
            <li>It has been difficult to find aluminum free deodorant that has a scent suitable for women and works!  </li>
            <li>maybe if there were more demand for it, the price would go down somehow.</li>
            <li>For that, it does a decent job.</li>
            <li>This is the only healthy antiperspirant for women that actually works.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant because it actually controls odor, helps with sweat and has no aluminum in it which stains the arm pits of any white shirts I have.</li>
            <li>so I had high hopes.</li>
            <li>Then one day after walking home from work and having to head straight back out to a function I re-applied just to freshen up... without showering or shaving first ...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>I got it in the mail today, ripped it open, smelled it, and put it on right away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find but aluminum free and worth searching out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have only use this deodorant since I first used it about 11 yrs ago.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>With this product i feel extremely confident I wont have sweat stains in my pits after an arduous workout.  </li>
            <li>I had had slight burning on a couple mornings that I put this on right after shaving...</li>
            <li>I have used many other brands, all of which do very little for perspiration.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint is the cost, however it is  definitely worth it to have something that works!</li>
            <li>As I have said I have tried some very expensive Aluminum free deodorants and have been less than satisfied.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have found that Alvera Aloe Unscented Roll-on works better and was much less expensive and can be purchased at health food stores.  </li>
            <li> Other reviewers have had similar problems with burning and irritation.</li>
            <li> but they just don&#x27;t work for very long and don&#x27;t help control sweat at all.</li>
            <li> This keeps me surprisingly dry and doesn&#x27;t have a funky odor at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I am not a particularly sweaty person</li>
            <li> I notice discomfort and little red dots on my skin.</li>
            <li> Yes, but I expected this, because this deodorant is not an antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t wet...</li>
            <li> not strong enough</li>
            <li> typically buy unscented and tried Icy Burst.</li>
            <li> It seem that Addidas has stopped making this product and the alternatives are few.  </li>
            <li> I try to use a stone or natural deodorant but when it fails I turn to this item.</li>
            <li> I disliked that it felt tacky after I applied it.</li>
            <li> After paying a ton for it I realized it has triclosan in it which is probably the worst thing a pregnant woman could put on open pores.</li>
            <li> Small size for the price</li>
            <li> INSIDE I GOT A SMALL TRAVEL SIZE DEODERATNT.  </li>
            <li> I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine and several others only to be disappointed.</li>
            <li> but the day I re-applied it late in the day was awful.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally 30 deodorants and hated them all.</li>
            <li> And all the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants smelled terrible on me, or were terribly formulated for me.</li>

            <li> Smells good, works good, and is better for your health.  Can&#x27;t ask for better.</li>
            <li> Small size for the price</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has been difficult to find aluminum free deodorant that has a scent suitable for women and works!  One stick will last me about two to three months and I work out at a gym three or more times a week. I have sensitive skin and I have tried a variety of scents, non of which have bothered me. My only complaint is the cost, however it is  definitely worth it to have something that works!</li>
            <li> Did not care for the fragrance.  Too strong.  Did not seem to do as well as I remembered from my first purchase of Adidas a couple years ago.  That fragrance was Powder..something.  I have found that Alvera Aloe Unscented Roll-on works better and was much less expensive and can be purchased at health food stores.  I have one unused Adidas available if anyone wants it.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE PRODUCT BUT , I THOUGHT I WAS GETTING MORE OUNCES , BUT INSIDE I GOT A SMALL TRAVEL SIZE DEODERATNT.  THE PICTURE CAN BE DECIVEING</li>
            <li> Aluminum free, yes, but this product contains Triclosan, which has been linked to endocrinological disorders.  The product doesn&#x27;t suppress the sweat (and you really don&#x27;t want to suppress sweat, because it&#x27;s the body&#x27;s way of ridding itself of toxins), but rather absorbs it and masks odor. For that, it does a decent job. However, the Triclosan factor is enough that I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Addidas created a great product.  Most aluminum-free deodorant don&#x27;t work -- but this one does.  I tried Tom&#x27;s of Maine and several others only to be disappointed. Noticed a smell.  It seem that Addidas has stopped making this product and the alternatives are few.  I hope they reconsider, because their \\&quot;cotton tech\\&quot; technology really did work.</li>
            <li> This is the only healthy antiperspirant for women that actually works.</li>
            <li> not strong enough but i like it anyway</li>
            <li> It has good protection, smells nice and it is aluminum free, which is the best of all.</li>
            <li> still stains clothes is there something else i could try that wouldnt stain my white shirts if so let me know</li>
            <li> Smells great BUT this gets a one star because it contains TRICLOSAN. As a pregnant woman I&#x27;ve been struggling to find an aluminium free deodorant. Seeing as this got good reviews I decided to give it a try. After paying a ton for it I realized it has triclosan in it which is probably the worst thing a pregnant woman could put on open pores. Triclosan has already been banned in most countries because it&#x27;s such a health hazard so why would someone use it in deodorant?</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant because it actually controls odor, helps with sweat and has no aluminum in it which stains the arm pits of any white shirts I have. I Have tried a lot of natural deodorants because of the fact that they&#x27;re aluminum free but they just don&#x27;t work for very long and don&#x27;t help control sweat at all. The only issue I have with this deodorant is that no one carries anymore. I have no idea why and would prefer not to have to pay $11 for it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best out there if you are an athlete and sweats a lot like I do!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT BECAUSE WE AS WOMEN DO NOT NEED ALUMINUM IN OUR BODIES. THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL AND GIVES YOU PEACE OF MIND KNOWING THAT IT&#x27;S SAFE FOR EVERYBODY. THIS PRODUCT GETS FIVE STARS PLUS!!! HOWEVER WISH IT WAS MORE ACCESSIBLE AS OPOSE TO ORDERING ONLINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BE BLESSED!!!</li>
            <li> This product was purchased for my wife who prefers aluminum free products. She has been using it for sometime with no dissatisfaction.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product</li>
            <li> I could not use this product.  I made the skin under my arm peel off. I tried it because I cannot use antiperspirants and had read this was a great alternative. It was not for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think I&#x27;d like this as much as I do. Most aluminum free deodorants make you stinkier than if you wore nothing at all. But I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. This keeps me surprisingly dry and doesn&#x27;t have a funky odor at the end of the day. I&#x27;ll buy more of this stuff in a heartbeat!</li>
            <li> Wanted to pass along my satisfaction with the Adidas Aluminum Free deodorant.  I have used many other brands, all of which do very little for perspiration.  The Adidas Aluminum Free deodorant works exceptionally well and has an awesome smell.  I know they are marketed to women, but men for the record - the product works very well for me.  I am an avid runner and weight lifter.  With this product i feel extremely confident I wont have sweat stains in my pits after an arduous workout.  If you have been hesitant to try the product because it is marketed to women, do yourself a favor and order the product.  I have been told Adidas stopped manufacturing the product, if so, we need to organize a campaign to keep the product on the market.  As I have said I have tried some very expensive Aluminum free deodorants and have been less than satisfied.</li>
            <li> The scent was below my expectation, smells like a regular soap. So after using it once, i switched back to my favorite product--same brand aluminium free-pure powder.</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite deodorant. I have tried literally 30 deodorants and hated them all. I refuse to use those regular antiperspirants because I don&#x27;t want to put aluminum on my body. And all the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; deodorants smelled terrible on me, or were terribly formulated for me. This deodorant is  the best there is. It smells great on me, works well for me, doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, and I can feel good that it doesn&#x27;t contain aluminum. I hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I try to use a stone or natural deodorant but when it fails I turn to this item. It&#x27;s hard to find but aluminum free and worth searching out.&lt;br /&gt;I typically buy unscented and tried Icy Burst. The smell was pleasant and not overbearing.</li>
            <li> I got it in the mail today, ripped it open, smelled it, and put it on right away. Then I went to the gym and did the Stairmaster for 20 minutes, and ran for another thirty. Did I sweat? Yes. Did the sweat show on my underarms? Yes, but I expected this, because this deodorant is not an antiperspirant. What I didn&#x27;t expect was that when I came home and removed my clothing, I still smelled great. I&#x27;ve tried Tom&#x27;s, Crystal Essence, sweat stones, seemingly everything. This is the only thing that has kept me smelling nice after I&#x27;ve been profusely sweating. Way to go, Adidas...all day I dream about...sweating (only with this stuff)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pricey, but maybe if there were more demand for it, the price would go down somehow. I will be buying more, because wearing an aluminum-free deodorant is important to me, and the efficacy of this product really impressed me.</li>
            <li> Very good. Non antiperspirant. Deodorant only!!!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a deodorant replacing the one with aluminum.  I tried several of them. So far this is the best one. and keep in mind I live in houston, TX!!  I didnt have any rush. No allergic reactions. It has a very nice smell. Of course it not as good as an antiperspirant. It kind of controls sweating. Yet there is some wetness. You need to reapply every two-three hours. and you cannot apply it when you are sweaty. Otherwise you reek. i will keep searching. but this one will stay as my backup.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells good and for the first couple months I LOVED it. I thought I had finally found an aluminum free deodorant that works...Then one day after walking home from work and having to head straight back out to a function I re-applied just to freshen up... without showering or shaving first ...and it felt like my arm-pits were on FIRE. I had had slight burning on a couple mornings that I put this on right after shaving...which I could deal with... but the day I re-applied it late in the day was awful. Ever since then this stuff has begun to irritate my skin whenever I use it. I notice discomfort and little red dots on my skin. Also, even when I liked it and had no burning I disliked that it felt tacky after I applied it. I would try to let it &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; before getting dressed but it wasn&#x27;t wet...so much as sticky. Other reviewers have had similar problems with burning and irritation. But a friend of mine swears by this stuff so I had high hopes. I wish I hadn&#x27;t spent more money on the &amp;#34;fitness fresh&amp;#34; version of this before I had the burning. The fitness fresh scent is awful...smells WAY too much like mens cologne. Now they are both just collecting dust in my bathroom drawer. So beware and try it for a couple months before you buy more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m trying the aluminum-free Soft&amp;Dri deodorant. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a week...but so far so good.</li>
            <li> I wish this was more easily available. It&#x27;s by far the best aluminium-free deodorant out there, and I should know, as I&#x27;ve tested Trader Joe&#x27;s (a distant second), Soft &amp; Dri, Body Shop, and Tom&#x27;s. I am not a particularly sweaty person but Adidas is the only one that keeps me stink-free all day, and actually works somewhat as an antiperspirant. It&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> Had to have while getting radiation. I won&#x27;t use it now that I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT---THIS IS MY SECOND ORDER AFTER SUFFERING WITH &amp;#34;ALUMINUM&amp;#34; AND THIS DEODORANT WORKS LIKE A CHAMP!!!</li>
            <li> I have only use this deodorant since I first used it about 11 yrs ago.  I can only find it on-line since no stores seem to carry it, or it has been discontinued.  I cannot use deodorant with aluminum in it and this one is the only one that works.  I sure hope I am wrong in that it is discontinued.</li>
