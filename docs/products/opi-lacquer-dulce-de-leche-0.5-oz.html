            <li> Beautiful and elegant nude shade.</li>
            <li> Love my OPI nail polishes.  Although delayed, their response was immediate.</li>
            <li> Love the color and pigmented</li>
            <li> This polish is easy to apply, color depth improves when applied twice and wears well.  It&#x27;s not an in-your face color which I prefer.</li>
            <li> Love OPI colors . Very nice pale brownish pink.</li>
            <li> The best neutral shade ever. Been wearing this for years.</li>
            <li> I purchased all 14 bottles of this color when I thought the local beauty supply that I purchase from said that this color would be discontinued. This color does for your nails as the perfect nude pump does for your legs. Makes your hands/nails look sexy, sleek and sophisticated. It&#x27;s professional enough for the office as well as sexy enough for going out at night, and it goes with just about anything you wear. I absolutely LOVE IT!</li>

            <li> I had one of these already but i couldn&#x27;t open the bottle after only one for  two uses. This one works fine. Its a tad bit more orangey than I remember. I like it to be a more transparent in color.</li>
            <li> Love this color.  It appears more pink in the photo but in reality it was very nude, the perfect shade of nude.  I painted this on my fingers and toes and then added OPI Rose of Light glitter on top.  So happy!</li>

            <li> I love OPI nail polish and always take my own with me to the nail salon.  I was trying to find a color that is now discontinued ~ this unfortunately is too light but I have added color to it to try to match</li>
            <li> I love this nail polish! I first saw it in a teachers room and put it on immediately. I loved the color and knew I had to buy it.
