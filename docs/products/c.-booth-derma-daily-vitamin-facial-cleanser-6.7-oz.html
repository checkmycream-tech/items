            <li>It helped to reduce oil and made my skin look good.</li>
            <li>Love the product!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t have a nice smell.  </li>
            <li>Nice cleanser.  </li>
            <li>It is by FAR the best.  </li>
            <li>Great results fast!</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>L-Oreal cleanser is much better.</li>
            <li>I use Booth products daily,I think they are the best on the market especially for ageing skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li>plus my skin is shiny and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love all the ingredients</li>
            <li>I kept using the cleanser for maybe another week or so, but things didn&#x27;t get better.</li>
            <li>Love this brand and this product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will update after a couple more weeks of continued use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t my favorite cleanser</li>
            <li>but it sure gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Very nice smell and cleans very well.</li>
            <li>Feels soooooo good on my skin, leaves it super smooth even without cream after.</li>
            <li>first, this cleanser was great and seemed to get my skin clean.</li>
            <li>Great facial cleanser, I would purchase again. :)</li>
            <li>This is a gentle, but thorough cleanser....a favorite of mine!</li>
            <li>very,  very mild,  didn&#x27;t feel it could do the job if you&#x27;re really looking to remove makeup or get any kind of exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>, please, folks, let us keep sellers educated and honest about sell-by and expiration dates, especially when it comes to better products with no preservatives, because you will literally be burned every time!  </li>
            <li>and you feel free to research the components of it at your leisure.</li>
            <li>I use Swisspers exfoliating pads I got on here and rinse it off with warm filtered water.. and so far my face looks better than it&#x27;s looked in a lonnng time.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to wash my face with soap and not break out...</li>
            <li>Keeps my face clean.</li>
            <li>but leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>but my face feels better and even looks noticeably better after using this, more than any other face wash i have used.</li>
            <li>Will be buying this from now on instead, my face feels clean and fresh after I wash with it.</li>
            <li>It feels mild, yet it dissolves my water proof mascara.</li>
            <li>Very happy with the product, have been using BWC Vitamin C facial cleansing soap which is about the same amount at twice the price as this</li>
            <li>This is normally a great, gentle daily cleanser to be followed by a mild, light, nutrient-filled face lotion (a sample tube of which came “free” with my order of the exfoliating scrub, but was also too old a product to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not dry out your face like others and does a nice job removing my face makeup.</li>
            <li>Booth products are made from nothing but the best of natural and organic extracted and whole ingredients (fruit, herbs, vegetables, vitamins), which DO NOT last much beyond the sell-by date.</li>
            <li>Besides asking about the freshness of the product before buying, write reviews afterward and tell about your experiences, even if you don&#x27;t feel it worth your time and money to return the products each and every time.</li>
            <li>And it didn&#x27;t really make my face feal clean.  </li>
            <li>purely rancid!</li>
            <li>So a good value, cant give it 5 stars because it was advertised that makeup comes off completely, my makeup does come off but there are still remnants of my mascara left.</li>
            <li>i like that it has safer ingredients in it than most personal care products.</li>
            <li>I have been told many times since starting the C Booth regime that I don&#x27;t look 50 - With insistent, disbelief and needed to see my id.</li>
            <li>And now about 5 days later the bumps do look about 30% better (just started)</li>
            <li>It is exactly like the non foaming cetaphil at the drug store,</li>
            <li>Does not irritate my acne and makes my skin feel clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>This leaves my face clean, soft and dewy and it is non-drying.</li>
            <li>NOTHING works better and gets all the make off, even eye liner, and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like this product.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, just be aware!</li>
            <li>Gentle cleanser</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really like it.  </li>
            <li>and I see no difference really.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for acne control I&#x27;m going to share my whole acne stack</li>
            <li>I really wanted this cleanser to work for me.</li>
            <li>This wash smells fresh and it leaves my face feeling soft</li>
            <li>I actually stopped washing my face with any kind of soap with chemicals or natural because my skin is so sensitive to whatever I put on it.</li>
            <li>: Of course this one is my main wash I also picked up a benzoyl peroxide 10% wash on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like the natural product list.</li>
            <li>having a reaction like this is nothing new to me.</li>
            <li>my skin is dry and sensitive, and i have tried many facial cleansers.</li>
            <li>Clear, Meaningful Beauty, and a few others.  </li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a great deal of change but at the same time my issues haven&#x27;t grown worse.</li>
            <li>We are both liking this stuff so far and seems to work for all skin types!</li>
            <li>but it definitely leaves a fresh youthful glow without any major expense to my pockets.</li>
            <li>It leaves my face feeling clean but not dry and stretched.</li>
            <li>The negative reviews may be enough to stimulate some positive change, and the positive reviews enough to encourage sellers to sell nothing but fresh product.e positive reviews enough to encourage sellers to sell nothing but fresh product.</li>
            <li>Almost like it was old.  </li>
            <li>This is the cleaner that I spent years looking for - something that helps my skin, leaves it clean and soft, not dry.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s made my skin clear soft and shiny like it used to look.</li>
            <li>Granted, I have sensitive skin, so</li>
            <li>So far, I like it, generous size bottle.</li>
            <li>I am older and outside a lot</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t normally spend this much on a facial cleanser</li>
            <li>/&gt;About a week after I stopped using the cleanser, the bumps were gone and my skin was back to normal.</li>
            <li>My skin seemed less sensitive after using this consistently as well.</li>
            <li>I actually bought it thinking it was a different C. Booth product, but its a decent wash, I don&#x27;t feel it takes my make up off though.</li>
            <li>This makes it very hard to find skin products that work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be sure that it was indeed this cleanser breaking me out, I started using it again a couple months later.</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a facial cleanser that does not dry out my face and yet cleans it.  </li>
            <li>We have very different skin, mine tends to be on the dry side and his on the oily side, both sensitive.  </li>

            <li> We have very different skin, mine tends to be on the dry side and his on the oily side, both sensitive.  </li>
            <li> After using some indian herb bar of soap called Medix and other natural oils</li>
            <li> As nice as Philosophy washes, but less expensive</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong/harsh so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin if you need that extra wash.</li>
            <li> I’ve remarked in my other reviews of the same order group  </li>
            <li> this one does not irritate or leave my skin too dry either.</li>
            <li> My skin had gotten so dry from the tap water I had to buy filtered water instead.</li>
            <li> but the dry skin is still there.</li>
            <li> After using other C Booth products I was drawn to their facial care line due to me trying EVERYTHING under the sun to combat my acne.</li>
            <li> My face no longer suffers from the cystic acne i was getting in a few places, so this has worked better than a $50 prescription face wash in that sense.</li>
            <li> After about a week and a half of use, I started to break out it in little red bumps on my forehead and around my temple.</li>
            <li> Other reviews convinced me to buy this brand/product.</li>
            <li> I just now started rubbing my face with witchazel and a couple other products I found on here to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> By now I wouldve broke out with any other face soap.</li>
            <li> From now on, I plan to ask the sellers how old their products are BEFORE I purchase, because claims of &amp;#34;NEW,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;BRAND NEW,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;SHRINK WRAPPED,&amp;#34; obviously mean less than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It even clears up swollen red spots if I rub my skin too hard.</li>
            <li> oily.. dark spots after pimples....</li>
            <li> I was down to rubbing my face with filtered bottled water every day and sometimes put honey on it....</li>
            <li> less soapy residue.</li>
            <li> The is a little glycol in it</li>
            <li> the rash never totally went away and left bad milia bumps on my face for 5 months.</li>
            <li> each useless bottle going to join the next in the darkened cabinet, to try and put out of mind all of the wasted expense.</li>
            <li> I am disabled with chronic illness and unable to go out and shop myself, so it is frustrating to have to sit and home and wait to determine whether or not my purchases are going to be a complete waste of money</li>
            <li> but it just went from about a 10+ to 5... still not healthy looking.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, there is an ingredient in this cleanser that does not agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so sad about that, but what can I do?</li>
            <li> I bought I broke out in a bad rash all around my eyes and cheeks...</li>

            <li> This is my second bottle of this.  Gentle cleanser but leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li> i found out about this when i received a trial sample from Rite Aid. my skin is dry and sensitive, and i have tried many facial cleansers. i purchased the regular size after trying this. i love it. this one does not irritate or leave my skin too dry either. i like that it has safer ingredients in it than most personal care products. i like that it has vitamins in it too. My face no longer suffers from the cystic acne i was getting in a few places, so this has worked better than a $50 prescription face wash in that sense. i don&#x27;t normally spend this much on a facial cleanser but my face feels better and even looks noticeably better after using this, more than any other face wash i have used.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really like it.  Didn&#x27;t have a nice smell.  Almost like it was old.  And it didn&#x27;t really make my face feal clean.  L-Oreal cleanser is much better.</li>
            <li> I use Booth products daily,I think they are the best on the market especially for ageing skin.Was an awesome price.</li>
            <li> This is the cleaner that I spent years looking for - something that helps my skin, leaves it clean and soft, not dry. I have been told many times since starting the C Booth regime that I don&#x27;t look 50 - With insistent, disbelief and needed to see my id. I am not saying it takes years off but it definitely leaves a fresh youthful glow without any major expense to my pockets.</li>
            <li> This is the best facial cleanser.  I have been searching for a facial cleanser that does not dry out my face and yet cleans it.  I have found it and will purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Keeps my face clean. I don&#x27;t wear makeup, but it works well as dirt remover + moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Best product..love it. Great results fast!</li>
            <li> I have been using the c. Booth micro vitamin C facial scrub and when I re-ordered that product I decided to try this Daily Facial Cleanser. It feels mild, yet it dissolves my water proof mascara. It leaves my face feeling clean but not dry and stretched. I like using this for my nightly face cleansing. I use a PCA Skin creamy cleanser in the morning to remove the Weleda skin food moisturizer I put on for overnight. I am older and outside a lot so I need to work to keep my skin nourished and moist.</li>
            <li> Feels soooooo good on my skin, leaves it super smooth even without cream after. even works great with a clairasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using c. Booth Derma Daily Vitamin Cleanser for over a year. Love the product! Great cleanser...less soapy residue.</li>
            <li> Very nice smell and cleans very well. I really like the natural product list. The is a little glycol in it but it is almost at the bottom of the list.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product, have been using BWC Vitamin C facial cleansing soap which is about the same amount at twice the price as this and I see no difference really. Will be buying this from now on instead, my face feels clean and fresh after I wash with it.</li>
            <li> I actually bought it thinking it was a different C. Booth product, but its a decent wash, I don&#x27;t feel it takes my make up off though.</li>
            <li> I have no complaints. Other reviews convinced me to buy this brand/product. My skin seemed less sensitive after using this consistently as well. If you&#x27;re looking for acne control I&#x27;m going to share my whole acne stack and you feel free to research the components of it at your leisure. I have no acne issues since starting all this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hormonal control on the skin: Nizoral shampoo with Ketoconazole: use every 3rd day as a wash and let sit 3 min, rinse&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supplements for oil production and fat metabolism: In the morning I take 100mg B6 and 500mg Acetyl L carnitine, before lunch I take 1.5g B5 (pantothenic acid) and 500mg Acetyl L Carnitine, and at bed 1.5g B5, 500mg ALC, and 100mg Zinc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Toner: use cotton pads with Dickinson&#x27;s witch hazel toner. Read the reviews for it. I just use that when my skin gets shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes: Of course this one is my main wash I also picked up a benzoyl peroxide 10% wash on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll find answers by search for acne and the stuff I listed here. Consider it the holy grail! Hope this helps!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve been able to wash my face with soap and not break out... plus my skin is shiny and healthy looking. I actually stopped washing my face with any kind of soap with chemicals or natural because my skin is so sensitive to whatever I put on it. I was down to rubbing my face with filtered bottled water every day and sometimes put honey on it.... that&#x27;s it. My skin had gotten so dry from the tap water I had to buy filtered water instead. That got rid of some of the dryness but it just went from about a 10+ to 5... still not healthy looking.  After using some indian herb bar of soap called Medix and other natural oils I bought I broke out in a bad rash all around my eyes and cheeks... the rash never totally went away and left bad milia bumps on my face for 5 months. I just now started rubbing my face with witchazel and a couple other products I found on here to get rid of them. And now about 5 days later the bumps do look about 30% better (just started) but the dry skin is still there. This stuff finally got rid of the dryness I&#x27;ve had for a cpl years now plus it&#x27;s evening my skin tone out. I use Swisspers exfoliating pads I got on here and rinse it off with warm filtered water.. and so far my face looks better than it&#x27;s looked in a lonnng time. I&#x27;ve used it twice now and it&#x27;s made my skin clear soft and shiny like it used to look. By now I wouldve broke out with any other face soap. I&#x27;ve had problems with everything... pimples.. dryness.. oily.. dark spots after pimples....It even clears up swollen red spots if I rub my skin too hard. If youve got effed up skin like I do this is the only soap I&#x27;d use. Smells good too.</li>
            <li> Second time I have ordered this product.  Does not irritate my acne and makes my skin feel clean and soft.  Love it.</li>
            <li> very,  very mild,  didn&#x27;t feel it could do the job if you&#x27;re really looking to remove makeup or get any kind of exfoliation.  It is exactly like the non foaming cetaphil at the drug store,</li>
            <li> I really wanted this cleanser to work for me. I absolutely love all the ingredients and I already use the c. Booth Deram 24 antioxidant moisturizer - which works wonderfully for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, this cleanser was great and seemed to get my skin clean. It helped to reduce oil and made my skin look good. After about a week and a half of use, I started to break out it in little red bumps on my forehead and around my temple. I kept using the cleanser for maybe another week or so, but things didn&#x27;t get better. So I stopped using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a week after I stopped using the cleanser, the bumps were gone and my skin was back to normal. Granted, I have sensitive skin, so having a reaction like this is nothing new to me. This makes it very hard to find skin products that work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to be sure that it was indeed this cleanser breaking me out, I started using it again a couple months later. The same thing happened. Sadly, there is an ingredient in this cleanser that does not agree with my skin. I&#x27;m so sad about that, but what can I do? If you have sensitive skin, just be aware!</li>
            <li> I have been searching for years for a face wash that works for my skin.  I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Excellent face wash.  I will keep  this in stock all the time.  Thank you for a wonderful, non drying face wash.</li>
            <li> This leaves my face clean, soft and dewy and it is non-drying. Great facial cleanser, I would purchase again. :)</li>
            <li> Ive tried Mary Kay, Neutragena, J&amp;amp;J Clear, Meaningful Beauty, and a few others.  NOTHING works better and gets all the make off, even eye liner, and doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like this product. It is by FAR the best.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued.</li>
            <li> As nice as Philosophy washes, but less expensive</li>
            <li> This is a gentle, but thorough cleanser....a favorite of mine!</li>
            <li> So far, I like it, generous size bottle. So a good value, cant give it 5 stars because it was advertised that makeup comes off completely, my makeup does come off but there are still remnants of my mascara left. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Nice cleanser.  Does not dry out your face like others and does a nice job removing my face makeup. However, I do have to use something extra to get rid of my mascara, so keep that in mind if your looking for something to take care of that too.&lt;br /&gt;My husband likes this too. We have very different skin, mine tends to be on the dry side and his on the oily side, both sensitive.  We are both liking this stuff so far and seems to work for all skin types!</li>
            <li> Love this brand and this product.</li>
            <li> The Daily Vitamin Facial Cleanser smells--yet again--just like the Kojic Acid, the Deep Wrinkle Filler, and the Phyto Nutrient eye cream-- purely rancid! This is normally a great, gentle daily cleanser to be followed by a mild, light, nutrient-filled face lotion (a sample tube of which came “free” with my order of the exfoliating scrub, but was also too old a product to use).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I’ve remarked in my other reviews of the same order group  it got so that I was dreading the receipt of Amazon packages as these products trickled in, each useless bottle going to join the next in the darkened cabinet, to try and put out of mind all of the wasted expense. I am disabled with chronic illness and unable to go out and shop myself, so it is frustrating to have to sit and home and wait to determine whether or not my purchases are going to be a complete waste of money I cannot afford.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, I am going to try not to let myself be fooled in future, and hope my ideas below are helpful for others, in ordering any products with expiration dates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C. Booth products are made from nothing but the best of natural and organic extracted and whole ingredients (fruit, herbs, vegetables, vitamins), which DO NOT last much beyond the sell-by date. From now on, I plan to ask the sellers how old their products are BEFORE I purchase, because claims of &amp;#34;NEW,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;BRAND NEW,&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;SHRINK WRAPPED,&amp;#34; obviously mean less than nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, please, folks, let us keep sellers educated and honest about sell-by and expiration dates, especially when it comes to better products with no preservatives, because you will literally be burned every time!  Besides asking about the freshness of the product before buying, write reviews afterward and tell about your experiences, even if you don&#x27;t feel it worth your time and money to return the products each and every time. The negative reviews may be enough to stimulate some positive change, and the positive reviews enough to encourage sellers to sell nothing but fresh product.e positive reviews enough to encourage sellers to sell nothing but fresh product.</li>
            <li> This wash smells fresh and it leaves my face feeling soft</li>
            <li> After using other C Booth products I was drawn to their facial care line due to me trying EVERYTHING under the sun to combat my acne. There isn&#x27;t a great deal of change but at the same time my issues haven&#x27;t grown worse. This facial wash is nourishing and non drying. It feels great when lathering on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update after a couple more weeks of continued use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mid-day cleanser - after work/school/working-out. It isn&#x27;t strong/harsh so it won&#x27;t dry out your skin if you need that extra wash. It isn&#x27;t my favorite cleanser but it sure gets the job done.</li>
