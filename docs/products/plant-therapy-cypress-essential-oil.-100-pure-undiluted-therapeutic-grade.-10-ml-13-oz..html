            <li>great, strong smelling product.  </li>
            <li>The quality of the oils is as good OR BETTER than popular MLM brands but don&#x27;t have the inflated prices.</li>
            <li>and I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to need the surgery.</li>
            <li>Bought it for hair treatments and aromatherapy,  I have to be honest</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Nice woodsy scent - will have to find more uses for this one.</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy has so far delivered great products!</li>
            <li>and I believe it is of great quality for a very decent price.  </li>
            <li>I was beginning to think that I might be one of those people who has to have the surgery more than once.  </li>
            <li>My hands are feeling so much better.</li>
            <li>Put some on a hematoma and it is gone like magic.</li>
            <li>Smells ok.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m ordering more.</li>
            <li>I was happy to find this at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Seems like a very good oil, although it is the first time I have purchased this brand as well as this particular &#x27;scent&#x27;.</li>
            <li>In my mind I guess I was expecting a strong pungent grab-me-by-the-nose product.</li>
            <li>smells great and so much better than the typical pine used in most fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Clean and woody and creates a relaxing mood, i&#x27;d have to say.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Plant Therapy is a fantastic company.</li>
            <li>free shipping also helps to make these oils affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product arrived on time and was as expected for a fair price!</li>
            <li>They promote safe usage and really care about their customers.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li>It was very effective, and now I&#x27;ve got it on hand for other uses as well.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this oil and would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>but I guess with all the benefits its worth it.</li>
            <li>Very pleasant slightly peppery smell, high strength, will last me quite a while.  </li>
            <li>I have already ordered more essential oils from this company!</li>
            <li>Researched EO companies online and will continue to purchase based on quality and pricing ;-)</li>
            <li>/&gt;(I add the oil to a basic unscented roll-on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s more info</li>
            <li>if interested...</li>
            <li>this is a wonderful oil for the face, for any black and blue marks and a general all around oil.  </li>
            <li>Cypress oil is certified pure.</li>
            <li>Plant therapy is a trusted source for pure therapeutic grade oils to use in aromatherapy recipes.</li>
            <li>A great company that stands behind their products and have gained my trust -</li>
            <li>and I can tell the shipper really cares, has integrity.</li>
            <li>I only wish the Plant Therapy EOs were available via Amazon Prime so it could arrive in 2 days instead of 5 days.  </li>
            <li>I was very please with my order and would order again</li>
            <li>It does seem to fade fast</li>
            <li>Prefect - really grassy but woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, item as describe.</li>
            <li>Decent oil for the price.</li>
            <li>At this point I can not recommend highly since I have just started using it.</li>
            <li>It has a strong therapeutic smell, but is dampened when used with other oils.</li>
            <li>He likes it and he has very sensitive skin and has had no issue.</li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t feeling it when I unscrewed the cap, I kept sniffing deeply trying to get a sense of what it smelled like.</li>
            <li>a house spray or roll-on since it&#x27;s spicy, masculine and not to pricey</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>ad in 2 drops of clove or cinnamon oil to get some warmth as well (think icy hot) add organic almond oil or fractionated coconut oil to fill the rest of bottle.</li>
            <li>Smells decent, but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li>Actually find I have to be careful how much I use.  </li>

            <li> I bought this essential oil to use as part of my anticellulite lotion recipe I found on Pinterest.  It has a pleasant smell and works great for what I bought it for.  I&#x27;m looking forward to other recipes I can use it in.</li>
            <li> I love it! It is exactly what I wanted, at a great price, and the top labeling is perfect! I have already ordered more essential oils from this company!</li>

            <li> Good aroma. Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy is a fantastic company. Not only is there customer service the best I have ever dealt with, the oils are of the best quality. The quality of the oils is as good OR BETTER than popular MLM brands but don&#x27;t have the inflated prices. No up-line to pocket your hard earned money! Just a great family business doing what they do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plant Therapy has certified aromatherapists on staff to help with your questions. They promote safe usage and really care about their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The free shipping also helps to make these oils affordable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Cypress oil is certified pure. It is 100% essential oil and will need to be diluted with the carrier oil if used topically.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find this at a decent price. Product arrived on time and was as expected for a fair price!</li>
            <li> This is being used with a mixture of other essential oils for massage. It has a strong therapeutic smell, but is dampened when used with other oils. At this point I can not recommend highly since I have just started using it.</li>
            <li> I bought Cypress because I read that it might help with Carpal Tunnel.  I have had surgery once and the way my hands have been feeling,  I was beginning to think that I might be one of those people who has to have the surgery more than once.  I decided to try Cypress rather than go the surgery route and I swear, it is helping.  I use it in conjunction with the Plant Therapy Pain-Aid Synergy and I honestly don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m going to need the surgery. My hands are feeling so much better. This is a top grade oil!!</li>
            <li> Wish they would have included the &amp;#34;uses&amp;#34; for this oil.</li>
            <li> A great company that stands behind their products and have gained my trust - I Highly recommend! :)</li>
            <li> this is a wonderful oil for the face, for any black and blue marks and a general all around oil.  Put some on a hematoma and it is gone like magic. My 5 lb. Papillion rides my arm when we ride in my friend&#x27;s car, hence the hematomas. Very good quality oil and I can tell the shipper really cares, has integrity.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected. Good quality. Can&#x27;t complain about anything. I would definitely recommend this product to any one who uses essential oils.</li>
            <li> This EO arrived well packaged and I believe it is of great quality for a very decent price.  Using this in family for pain management for bone spurs in hand---it&#x27;s working.  I only wish the Plant Therapy EOs were available via Amazon Prime so it could arrive in 2 days instead of 5 days.  Otherwise, I am extremely happy with this purchase and would order again from this supplier.</li>
            <li> I was very please with my order and would order again</li>

            <li> Plant therapy is a trusted source for pure therapeutic grade oils to use in aromatherapy recipes. I will use them always.</li>
            <li> Bought it for hair treatments and aromatherapy,  I have to be honest I don&#x27;t love the scent but I guess with all the benefits its worth it.</li>
            <li> Starting to build my EO collection.  Nice woodsy scent - will have to find more uses for this one.</li>
            <li> Very pleasant slightly peppery smell, high strength, will last me quite a while.  Actually find I have to be careful how much I use.  Good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Great oil, great smell!! Using this to try and help my husband&#x27;s hair regrown and get thicker again before he looses it! Using it with castor oil ... great combo to help regrow eyelashes and make them thicker also! That&#x27;s my next to try!</li>
            <li> Plant Therapy has so far delivered great products!</li>
            <li> Smells decent, but doesn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> great, strong smelling product.  Recommend plant therapy due to the quality and price.  Will buy again and recommend to anyone looking in to essential oils.</li>

            <li> This product did not help in any way shape or form it just smelled good,i used it for a hemroid problem and it did nothing @ all i wound up going for surgery</li>
            <li> Prefect - really grassy but woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> Used this in a balding serum for my brother.  He likes it and he has very sensitive skin and has had no issue.</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> smells great and so much better than the typical pine used in most fragrances.&lt;br /&gt;Clean and woody and creates a relaxing mood, i&#x27;d have to say.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering more. Goes well with lemon oil and can use it&lt;br /&gt;for a house spray or roll-on since it&#x27;s spicy, masculine and not to pricey&lt;br /&gt;(I add the oil to a basic unscented roll-on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;here&#x27;s more info if interested...&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Good smell. Not sure what else to say!</li>
