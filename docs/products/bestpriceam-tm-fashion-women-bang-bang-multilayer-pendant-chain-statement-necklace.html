            <li> Gold looks fake and necklace is flimsy and weak looking. Bought another one just to confirm and it;s the same. For the money is childish wear not something to look nice with a cute clothes.</li>
            <li> Tangles up and is a pain to untangle throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Great necklace and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Very cute and wasn&#x27;t tangled!  Nice to wear any time of year (or weather) under an open-neck blouse or over a tee.  I was surprised at the quality for such a small price!</li>

            <li> Cute chain. Nice length.</li>
            <li> Really nice neckale. I&#x27;ve been looking for a double neckale for a while now and finally I got one I really like. The chain is thin but doesn&#x27;t look like other cheap chains you get for the price. This one looks like if it was silver. I got many compliments on it. Arrived before original delivery date too!</li>
            <li> Looks great, decent quality for price. Was not tangled and did not break as others have noted.</li>
            <li> Looks cheap. The golden color looks better</li>
            <li> This is a great piece of jewelry to wear with open neck blouses and dresses,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute. Looks like the picture. The chain is longer than I thought but i like it a lot. It came in much earlier than expected (said it would arrive between 7/1 &amp; 7/22 - it came in the mail on 6/21) I&#x27;m happy with it overall just wish it was shorter.</li>
            <li> The necklace is very pretty but it tangles up around my neck alot. Kind of a pain to wear because it just starts eventually choking me the longer I wear.</li>

            <li> Really cute for the price</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this. The necklace is not dainty and cute as it appears. It&#x27;s much bigger and looks like junk. Definitely got what I paid for here.</li>
            <li> I received this beautiful necklace in a timely manner.  After using the necklace, I noticed that it gets tangled very quickly and it takes extra work to unlink it to straighten out the layers.  I would not recommend this necklace.  Sorry. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I RAVELS UP AND IS TOO JUMBLED UP, I THINK I WILL GIVE IT TO MY DAUGHTER.</li>

            <li> pretty cheap feeling to it, but, what you expect, i got it for $3</li>
            <li> Broke Immediately when I got it!!!! All I did was put it on!!</li>
            <li> cute but the &amp;#34;silver&amp;#34; color rubs off very quickly. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> longer than I was anticipating...</li>
            <li> Looks nothing like the pic. It is a very junky, thick alloy. Price is cheap, so is necklace.</li>
            <li> Very cheap.. Like something your get out of a bubble gum machine. Looks 50x nicer in the picture than in real life and the layers do not fall that far apart from each other. They are right on top of each other practically</li>
            <li> lays very nice on the neck, especially with a white sweater!!</li>
            <li> Cheap and seller is dishonest.</li>
