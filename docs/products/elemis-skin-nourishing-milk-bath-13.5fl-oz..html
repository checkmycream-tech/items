    <ol>
            <li>If you can take the expense, even if it&#x27;s just to treat yourself every one in a great while, give it a try.</li>
            <li>Great for winter dryness and summer skin.</li>
            <li>awesome product- love it</li>
            <li>Wife loves this as a lotion for wintertime she feels that it lasts longer than most and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>it is well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li>I saw this milk bath and read the good reviews about it, so I got it.  </li>
            <li>Skin feels wonderful and I smell fabulous......</li>
            <li>and I never felt so good.  </li>
            <li>I too tried it on a cruise and loved it.  </li>
            <li>sometimes I use it after a shower its not as good as the lotion</li>
            <li>but it is good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also been very satisfied with the customer service from this seller.  </li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey but using it more like a lotion without rinsing is very effective.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a satisfied customer both of the seller and the product!</li>
            <li>I bought this after receiving its amazing benefits from a pedicure at a spa.</li>
            <li>I bought this to primarily use as lotion which works great.</li>
            <li>I really liked it then.  </li>
            <li>Rather than putting a couple of capfuls in a bath; I fill my sink with warm water and add one capful.  </li>
            <li>I fell in love with Elemis while on a cruise, and was delighted to find it was available from amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it in the shower as well, but really like that beautiful lotion on after I shower.  </li>
            <li>It was used on my hands in conjunction with Elemis Exotic</li>
            <li>This is not the case as your skin will literally drink it in and thirst for more.</li>
            <li>Sure</li>
            <li>I use is mostly as a moisturizer after my shower.  </li>
            <li>I might just spring for more Elemis.</li>
            <li>Have bought more as gifts.</li>
            <li>A bit pricey but absolutely worth it!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s marvelously smoothing and softening, as other reviewers have noted.</li>
            <li>I tried this on a cruise and liked it very much.</li>
            <li>first experienced this one-of-a-kind product while contracting at a very exclusive spa in La Jolla, CA.  </li>
            <li>Several hours after applying it I am still able to smell the pleasant fragrance.</li>
            <li>makes your skin smooth  and silky.  </li>
            <li>Its delicate fragrance is delicious, like a lovely afterthought.  </li>
            <li>This rich, luxuriant, buttery, yet feathery light, lotion delivers.  </li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ve fallen in love, maybe for the first time, with a skin care product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s an indulgence, but it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I love it so much this is my 7th bottle!</li>
            <li>Introduced to the Elemis line while on a cruise during a spa package special.</li>
            <li>I had the full treatment</li>
            <li>I just dump a few capfuls in the bathtub a couple of times a week and soak with a good bood for about 15 minutes and it works miracles!  </li>
            <li>Works well in the bath and smells fresh and clean as a reg moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It works miraculously on my dry skin and leaves a wonderful light scent on my skin for a long time.</li>
            <li>but it is worth it.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It has a soft, lovely frangrace which does not compete with one&#x27;s perfume.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a fairly watery liquid and you might think because of this it would not do much for dry skin.</li>
            <li>, if this product can rejuvenate my skin, where people are actually commenting how incredibly soft my hands are, it&#x27;s got to be good.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product on a cruise ship.</li>
            <li>I first tried Elemis Milk bath when I was on a cruise.   </li>
            <li>It seems to do exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li>first then use this 2-3 times a week.  </li>
            <li>I like to put up to a capful in my bath for a long soak, or apply during a hot shower for a light scent and smooth finish.</li>
            <li>I tried two other Elemis products during my free spa demo and liked them equally as well.</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this product very often.</li>
            <li>Too, you really don&#x27;t need to use much if you&#x27;re using it as an after bath or shower moisturizer for the body.</li>
            <li>Sometimes you really do get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>It really does take away the dryness that winter climates can cause.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to everyone!</li>
            <li>I purchased  later and greatly enjoy soaking in it.  </li>
            <li>However using in the bath works very well also.</li>
            <li>After using Elemis Skin Nourishing Milk Bath on my clients, I was absolutely amazed at the condition of my hands (so much so, that I am writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>suffer from a couple of different dry skin ailments, eczema being one, but this moisturizer has had an amazingly soothing effect on them.</li>
            <li>First discovered this product on cruise ship, and use it directly on skin.  </li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the price of the Elemis face cream at $124 was just too high, though the results of just one application were great.</li>
            <li>I live in the California desert.</li>
            <li>I used these products the first day of the cruise and still felt the effects 7 days later!  </li>
            <li>I am completely sold!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised at how moisturized my skin was after the bath!</li>
            <li>So soft!  </li>
            <li>It was AMAZING to say the least!  </li>
            <li>This product&#x27;s only con is the price, but it does come in a large bottle and with measured use</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s worth the $$$ spent.  </li>
            <li>I also had pretty dry skin on my elbows.  </li>
            <li>I originally bought this on a cruise a few years ago and once I got it home</li>
            <li>My favorite other products:  ...to look younger, Relastin Revitalizer  ...to feel younger, MBT Bongers massager  ...to live longer, Weil Daily Anti-Oxidant Tablets</li>
            <li>A bottle lasts a long time though as lotion is very wattery.</li>
            <li>My skin is so much clearer, the scarring is nearly gone, and my elbows aren&#x27;t dry!  </li>
            <li>My product had slightly leaked during shipping (probably from freezing and thawing) and they conveniently replaced the product lost without making me jump through hoops to make it right.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very relaxing and solves the dry skin problem!      </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not anywhere near as dry as I used to be.  </li>

            <li> and I&#x27;m not anywhere near as dry as I used to be.  </li>
            <li> I have not found another product which elimiates dry, flakey skin in such a short time.  </li>
            <li> When I relaized that I don&#x27;t even spend this much on shoes usually, I realized too</li>
            <li> It has a faint baby powder scent, which only reinforces the fact that it takes your skin back to baby smooth quality.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently struggled with incredibly dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Due to the expense, I use it once a day at bedtime on my hands and the last couple of days, I&#x27;ve also used it on my feet.  </li>
            <li> It has helped me get rid of my dry skin problem!  </li>
            <li> I mix together a big pinch of the salt glow, and about a half cap of the milk bath.  </li>
            <li> I have bought countless products that promise to do what Elemis does, for less money, but they didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Fear not if you have any other skin type, this one is for all of them.</li>
            <li> The only thing you will feel, after applying Elemis to your skin, is unbelievable softness, like a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it is rather expensive - it&#x27;s the real deal!  </li>
            <li> Using a few capfuls in a bath will also bring relief for dry skin.</li>
            <li> And it truly does take away dry itchy skin that harsh weather causes.</li>
            <li> That would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> Living in frigid Iowa winter temperatures take a real toll on my entire body, but especially my hands.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with my body, but I was so tired of being dry and itchy and wanted something other than lotion to help solve my problem!  </li>
            <li> a final, and personal note, having OCD, and consequently, a very difficult hand-washing compulsion</li>
            <li> Never, and I mean NEVER, with any other moisturizer has my skin felt so</li>
            <li> We have very little humidty and very hard water, and this product alleviates all of that itchy, dry, prickle skin that comes with these conditions.</li>
            <li> I thought I was saving money, and being responsibly frugal, but, as it turns out, I wasted my money on crap (forgive me for being a little</li>
            <li> I usually use apricot oil in my bath to help hydrate my skin.</li>
            <li> It would be a shame to waste it!</li>
            <li> I found this skin cream expensive at $50+ and no better than a $10 product.</li>
            <li> However I must use it sparingly, it is on the expensive side for my budget.  </li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle for $66 and stupidly packed it in my carryon luggage, where it was considered a security risk (it&#x27;s a lotion, not a liquid or a gel, but it \\&quot;had to go\\&quot; regardless).</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I originally bought this on a cruise a few years ago and once I got it home forgot about it, then when cleaning the bathroom ran across it decided instead of throwing it away I would use it up and realized why I bought it! It works miraculously on my dry skin and leaves a wonderful light scent on my skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product on a cruise ship. It was used on my hands in conjunction with Elemis Exotic Frangipani Monoi Moisture Melt. The next day I awoke to know that I HAD to have these products!  Living in frigid Iowa winter temperatures take a real toll on my entire body, but especially my hands.  I used these products the first day of the cruise and still felt the effects 7 days later!  It was AMAZING to say the least!  I&#x27;ve tried just about EVERYTHING to get me through the Iowa winters with often cracked and bleeding cracks in my hands.  I&#x27;m sold! Due to the expense, I use it once a day at bedtime on my hands and the last couple of days, I&#x27;ve also used it on my feet.  I am completely sold!  For me, it&#x27;s worth the $$$ spent.  I&#x27;ve also been very satisfied with the customer service from this seller.  My product had slightly leaked during shipping (probably from freezing and thawing) and they conveniently replaced the product lost without making me jump through hoops to make it right.  I&#x27;m a satisfied customer both of the seller and the product!</li>
            <li> This stuff Rocks!  I live in the California desert. We have very little humidty and very hard water, and this product alleviates all of that itchy, dry, prickle skin that comes with these conditions.</li>
            <li> I found this skin cream expensive at $50+ and no better than a $10 product. I would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> I use to get acne on upper back and arms, and it would leave quite a bit of scarring.  I also had pretty dry skin on my elbows.  This product was recommended to me on an Carnival cruise, along with the Lime and Ginger Salt Glow.  My massage therapist recommended using these two products together when showering, instead of another scrub.  I mix together a big pinch of the salt glow, and about a half cap of the milk bath.  It has done wonders.  My skin is so much clearer, the scarring is nearly gone, and my elbows aren&#x27;t dry!  Using it this way has also made it last quite a while.  I purchased these products in October, and am just thinking about stocking up now so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently struggled with incredibly dry skin.  I go through lotion like it&#x27;s water!  I don&#x27;t know what the deal is with my body, but I was so tired of being dry and itchy and wanted something other than lotion to help solve my problem!  I saw this milk bath and read the good reviews about it, so I got it.  It has helped me get rid of my dry skin problem!  I just dump a few capfuls in the bathtub a couple of times a week and soak with a good bood for about 15 minutes and it works miracles!  My skin soaks up the moisture and I&#x27;m not anywhere near as dry as I used to be.  It&#x27;s very relaxing and solves the dry skin problem!      Carolyn  My favorite other products:  ...to look younger, Relastin Revitalizer  ...to feel younger, MBT Bongers massager  ...to live longer, Weil Daily Anti-Oxidant Tablets</li>
            <li> I bought this after receiving its amazing benefits from a pedicure at a spa. When I relaized that I don&#x27;t even spend this much on shoes usually, I realized too I probably wouldn&#x27;t buy this product very often. But oh the wonderous effects on my skin! Never, and I mean NEVER, with any other moisturizer has my skin felt so baby smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a fairly watery liquid and you might think because of this it would not do much for dry skin. This is not the case as your skin will literally drink it in and thirst for more. Using a few capfuls in a bath will also bring relief for dry skin. Fear not if you have any other skin type, this one is for all of them. It has a faint baby powder scent, which only reinforces the fact that it takes your skin back to baby smooth quality. Several hours after applying it I am still able to smell the pleasant fragrance. Too, you really don&#x27;t need to use much if you&#x27;re using it as an after bath or shower moisturizer for the body. A dime size amount for the calves, thighs and arms each will likely suffice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer from a couple of different dry skin ailments, eczema being one, but this moisturizer has had an amazingly soothing effect on them. I think I&#x27;ve fallen in love, maybe for the first time, with a skin care product. If you can take the expense, even if it&#x27;s just to treat yourself every one in a great while, give it a try. Sometimes you really do get what you pay for. This is one of those times.</li>
            <li> I bought the Elemis nourishing milk bath after have a spa treatment on a recent cruise.  This combined with the fangapani oil makes your skin smooth  and silky.  It really does take away the dryness that winter climates can cause. I highly recommend it to everyone! Sure it&#x27;s an indulgence, but it&#x27;s worth every penny! And it truly does take away dry itchy skin that harsh weather causes.</li>
            <li> I fell in love with Elemis while on a cruise, and was delighted to find it was available from amazon.</li>
            <li> First discovered this product on cruise ship, and use it directly on skin.  I don&#x27;t even put it in bath as directions suggest.</li>
            <li> Works well in the bath and smells fresh and clean as a reg moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I first tried Elemis Milk bath when I was on a cruise.   I really liked it then.  I purchased  later and greatly enjoy soaking in it.  However I must use it sparingly, it is on the expensive side for my budget.  That would be my only complaint.</li>
            <li> A bit pricey but absolutely worth it!! I use as a lotion and not in the bath. Skin feels wonderful and I smell fabulous......no need for perfume. Great for winter dryness and summer skin. I love it so much this is my 7th bottle! A bottle lasts a long time though as lotion is very wattery. Amazon also was the cheapest I found on the internet.</li>
            <li> I usually use apricot oil in my bath to help hydrate my skin. I bought this to primarily use as lotion which works great. However using in the bath works very well also. I was surprised at how moisturized my skin was after the bath! But the product lasts longer when used as lotion vs. for baths.</li>
            <li> I have used this product since 2005.  I was on a cruise ship and the spa used Elemis products, exclusively.  I had the full treatment and I never felt so good.  That hooked me and I buy it all the time now.  I use is mostly as a moisturizer after my shower.  I&#x27;ve used it in the shower as well, but really like that beautiful lotion on after I shower.  Give it a try....it&#x27;s a little pricey but it is worth it.</li>
            <li> awesome product- love it</li>
            <li> So soft!  Don&#x27;t have a bath without it! Can be used in bath or as a lotion. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I tried this on a cruise and liked it very much. It&#x27;s marvelously smoothing and softening, as other reviewers have noted. I purchased a bottle for $66 and stupidly packed it in my carryon luggage, where it was considered a security risk (it&#x27;s a lotion, not a liquid or a gel, but it \\&quot;had to go\\&quot; regardless). I ended up ditching it in its box in the airport trash in San Juan, PR, and I hope somebody else saw me and picked it up. It would be a shame to waste it! I tried two other Elemis products during my free spa demo and liked them equally as well. Unfortunately, the price of the Elemis face cream at $124 was just too high, though the results of just one application were great. I might just spring for more Elemis. It seems to do exactly what it promises.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this as a lotion for wintertime she feels that it lasts longer than most and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> Rather than putting a couple of capfuls in a bath; I fill my sink with warm water and add one capful.  I shower first then use this 2-3 times a week.  I have not found another product which elimiates dry, flakey skin in such a short time.  I too tried it on a cruise and loved it.  It has a soft, lovely frangrace which does not compete with one&#x27;s perfume.  It is a bit pricey but using it more like a lotion without rinsing is very effective.  If you can give it a try...it is well worth it!!!!</li>
            <li> Introduced to the Elemis line while on a cruise during a spa package special. This product&#x27;s only con is the price, but it does come in a large bottle and with measured use it&#x27;ll last a long time. I like to put up to a capful in my bath for a long soak, or apply during a hot shower for a light scent and smooth finish.</li>
            <li> I use this bath soap in the bath......sometimes I use it after a shower its not as good as the lotion but it is good.</li>
            <li> Elemis Skin Nourishing Milk Bath is the Creme de la Creme of its genre.  This rich, luxuriant, buttery, yet feathery light, lotion delivers.  Its delicate fragrance is delicious, like a lovely afterthought.  The only thing you will feel, after applying Elemis to your skin, is unbelievable softness, like a baby&#x27;s behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first experienced this one-of-a-kind product while contracting at a very exclusive spa in La Jolla, CA.  As a licensed massage therapist, I&#x27;ve used, and been exposed to, some of the finest lotions, and oils, and creams that you can imagine.  After using Elemis Skin Nourishing Milk Bath on my clients, I was absolutely amazed at the condition of my hands (so much so, that I am writing this review).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is rather expensive - it&#x27;s the real deal!  I have bought countless products that promise to do what Elemis does, for less money, but they didn&#x27;t.  I thought I was saving money, and being responsibly frugal, but, as it turns out, I wasted my money on crap (forgive me for being a little blunt).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final, and personal note, having OCD, and consequently, a very difficult hand-washing compulsion, if this product can rejuvenate my skin, where people are actually commenting how incredibly soft my hands are, it&#x27;s got to be good.</li>
            <li> Gift for mother-in-law.  She LOVES the way it feels on her skin. Have bought more as gifts.</li>
