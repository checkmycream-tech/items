            <li>Anyhow, I received this great moisturizer for my 100% honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>This product never claims to be noncomedogenic, so we knew there was a good chance he couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li>And, honestly, at this price...it&#x27;s a great deal, anyway.</li>
            <li>I like this cream a lot I have been using it in the morning with a vitamin c serum and a good spf</li>
            <li>It is just a superior product with no additives or parabens.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with it.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use, doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing smell and works great.</li>
            <li>I also like that the company e-mails you after the purchase to let you know they are available for questions or concerns and that they will do anything to make you happy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on the skin and feels great.</li>

            <li>My wife was happy to get this product for free to try out.</li>

            <li>I actually love a good retinol cream.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product that I agreed to try at no charge for an honest report, and I will doubtless continue using it.</li>
            <li>The pump dispenser is nice, and i like that it is not fragranced.</li>
            <li>I can honestly say, I will be a life time</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how this cream got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li>but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>All opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li>What i didn&#x27;t like is that its odorless, If it did have a scent I could not tell honestly.</li>
            <li>also noticed that my skin started to have this really nice glow to it</li>
            <li>It smells nice to</li>
            <li>The cream comes in a nice, compact container.</li>
            <li>The scent is almost undectable, which is nice.</li>
            <li>These are my honest opinions on trying this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like lotion for your eyes to help lighten and youthfulize (yup, made up my own word)</li>
            <li>that’s nice to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light scent is perfect for my sensitive skin and it leaves my skin perfectly hydrated and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li>Now, on the anti-aging topic, I honestly don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkling YET</li>
            <li>I did receive this for a reduced price for an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li>and i liked it alot.</li>
            <li>I also found on days when I did not wear makeup that the serum plus moisturizer was nice.</li>
            <li>Nothing spectacular.  </li>

            <li>This moisturizer feels great, and absorbs quickly with no tacky feeling or residue.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The potency of the retinol is touted on the label, however I find the moisturizer to be very easy on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I find using retinols at night when my skin is in restorative mode, to be most effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect moisturizer that will keep my skin soft and glowing no matter what the weather brings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is my truthful and honest opinion on this product.</li>
            <li>I received a discount for honestly reviewing it, and am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>By far the best vitamin A topical&lt;br /&gt;treatment</li>
            <li>The texture of the product is nice and creamy, not greasy and absorbs very quickly into skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim has amazing customer service, they will respond promptly if you have any questions or concerns.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to try this since I have also tried their Hyaluronic Acid Serum and loved it</li>
            <li>Non - greasy plus is a very light cream so it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores.</li>
            <li>It seems to help minimize pores, and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smoothly.</li>

            <li>Beautiful and effective packaging, quick shipping and does exactly what it claims.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly was not, and that was great because you get a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>When you put all these fabulous ingredients together you have one amazing skin care cream moisturizer I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>I know a lengthy skincare regimen might not always be possible, so multi-purposed products are our best bet.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has added retinol and antioxidants to target the visible signs of aging and to keep our skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I love it and planning on telling friends and family about this product.</li>
            <li>For more information on this product please view my blog review at http://beautynproducts.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/foxbrim-anti-aging-moisturizer-and-retinol-cream/</li>
            <li>It was more of a suddle scent.</li>
            <li>Which i enjoyed because i dont like products with an overbearing smell.</li>
            <li>My skin looks more supple and</li>
            <li>Well, I can sweeten it even more because they do not test on animals</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it does not have one of those scents that make me sneeze.</li>
            <li>Many beauty products make me sneeze and have an allergy attack.</li>
            <li>However, I have been using this for about a month, and I couldn&#x27;t have wished for better results</li>
            <li>but I have to say that this is one of the top ones on my list.</li>
            <li>so I already knew I would love the moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, so far so good!</li>
            <li>I can easily recommend this product, even though I was provided one or more products by either Tomoson or the manufacturer for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I had stopped using retinol because it was a bit to drying for my already dry skin this one is loaded with moisturizers and is the best of both worlds .</li>
            <li>have been using this product, and very quickly I was able to notice a reduction in the lines on my face.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my skin look and feel so healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li>This smells so good, the pump is easy to use and u do not need to use very much at a time :</li>
            <li>I must say I am pretty impressed so far!</li>
            <li>It absorbs easy and that makes for easy application of foundation over the top of this product.</li>
            <li>Not only is the retinol cream helping my skin, but the customer service is incredible.</li>
            <li>made my make up look more smooth</li>
            <li>you could tell her skin was more smooth</li>
            <li>So far, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li>I love that it is frangrance free and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>Their complete anti-aging moisturizer is another great addition.  </li>
            <li>that if you want great skin, you have to start young and be consistant.</li>
            <li>As you know many of the products I review are supplied through Tomoson and they have supplied me with some fantastic products, this moisturizer is no exception.</li>
            <li>really did like this product, and loved how it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li>But I find it has a light, pleasant scent and makes my skin feel very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product came right on time and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>It has a pump like dispenser that makes it easy to control the amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Received item as described and very quick.</li>
            <li>My skin feels tighter and looks bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li>moisturizer absorbs into the skin easily and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling like some moisturizers do.</li>
            <li>I could go a whole day and not worry too much about having incredibly oily skin.</li>
            <li>The cream comes in a pump bottle and it is easy to dispense the amount you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It applied easily without being too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Its not to strong  or over drying.  </li>
            <li>Get the best and don&#x27;t settle for less, and of course reap the benefits, and most of the time the benefits are the ones you love smiling at you, and you can read it in their eyes and smile when they look at you.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li>the most for true skin correction.</li>
            <li>It was fine if I added Foxbrim Ultra Lift Treatment with Hyaluronic Acid as it helped retain moisture, but I still had the irritation issue.</li>
            <li>It was fine going on</li>
            <li>IT IS NOT GREASY, AND I CAN SEE MY FINE LINES BEING MINIMIZED.  </li>
            <li>I will have to use it for longer to get the full benefits, but this seems like a great retinol for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and easy to apply, with no burning or tingling.</li>
            <li>so I want to help my fine lines, but I don&#x27;t want to have</li>
            <li>if you want to reduce wrinkles and lighten up sun spots, I suggest getting the Best Facial Serum and trying it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free with the rule of giving my honest opinion when finished...</li>
            <li>Once I got it going, it has worked fine.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels super!</li>
            <li>It comes in an easy to dispense pump an the cream is rich, creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve really been enjoying it!</li>
            <li>I received my order pretty quick which I LOVE!</li>
            <li>The Retinol cream has made a huge difference with my face.</li>

            <li>The moisturizer is light and absorbs well without leaving an oily feeling.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I received a free sample of this product to review.</li>
            <li>Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a good product, just not for my skin type.</li>
            <li>The products packaging is nice and sleek and it actually feels really nice to the touch.</li>
            <li>I think it’s not only because of its quick absorption but also because it is a light weight and works great under BB cream.</li>

            <li>Only been using about a week, but feels light and smooth going on and good to the skin.</li>
            <li>When I got this I was excited.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m too excited.</li>
            <li>Nope not disappointed in this product at all.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try out another one of Foxbrim&#x27;s products when I got this one.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is creamy and rich.</li>
            <li>you know Retinol is not always friendly to work with.</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>I liked it because it left my skin very smooth and hydrate.</li>
            <li>It is a rich and creamy moisturizer that goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li>Goes on clean and non oily.</li>
            <li>The cream is smooth and odorless and goes on quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I really love the products my face glows and is more soft.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is thick and creamy, yet goes on light leaving the perfect amount of moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li>I mostly used it in the evenings since it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF and retinol can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li>This cream is not heavy on your skin at all ,after you apply you will see your skin more healthy looking</li>
            <li>but I can tell right away, that this product glides on so easily and is odor-free.</li>
            <li>They have created a silky smooth moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling clean, fresh and toned.  </li>
            <li>I use a moisturizer everyday but because I have very fair skin I prefer to use a moisturizer with sunscreen in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, it is important to wear a good, broad spectrum sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li>All of Foxbrim&#x27;s products are organic and all-natural, and this one comes with the handy pump bottle so there is no waste</li>
            <li>I did need to use an extra moisturizer since retinol tends to be drying, but otherwise I had a good experience with this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s looks so healthy and has really helped with my breakouts.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li>but it is an overall good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have been enjoying it and it has not broken me out at all.</li>
            <li>I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>

            <li>The Retinol Cream &amp; Moisturizer is a lightweight cream, goes on smoothly and leaves my face both looking and feeling refreshed, so smooth and soft, I love it.</li>

            <li>I did not detect a scent but some reviewers are saying mild scent .&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one absorbs quickly into you skin, i would recommend using it at night, since the sun can cause retinol to become inactive.</li>
            <li>and they can advise you quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer quickly absorbs into my skin.</li>
            <li>and it absorbs into my skin super quickly...which is always a plus.</li>
            <li>It is barely scented which allows for he use of one&#x27;s own perfume and body sprays.  </li>

            <li>It absorbed quickly into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave any ind of oily or greasy residue.</li>

            <li>This Retinol Cream Moisturizer is absorbed quickly and leaves no sheen or oily residue at all, the skin absorbs it all evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the skin looks much smoother!!</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying products from Foxbrim, and I got two products to review from them the moisturizer and the youthful radiance eye cream!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely keep this product in my line up of preventative and maintaining healthy skin!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!</li>

            <li>absorbs quickly, non greasy and really moisturizes your skin!</li>
            <li>and I see that there are the right products in the cream so it should do what it says it does.  </li>

            <li>the right ingredients to where it&lt;</li>
            <li>Retinoids degrade in sunlight, so use this moisturizer at night right before bedtime</li>
            <li>This cream seems to be the right strength &amp; mix.  </li>
            <li>this by far is the best product ive used in a long time i have tried many other products and never have got any results until now</li>
            <li>I did not pay full price for this, but gladly would in the future.</li>
            <li>I have used it for a week and a half and have noticed that my skin looks better and feels better.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get the product out, I liked that it wasn&#x27;t really scented heavily and when I used it, it didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy like some of these products do.</li>
            <li>In case this happens to you, just be sure the top is screwed on tightly</li>
            <li>Although this moisturizer is very rich and creamy but not greasy, absorbs quickly into my skin for deep hydration.</li>
            <li>Great daily facial mosturizer.</li>
            <li>But I prefer to use retinol only in the nights, because I have sensitive and fair skin and the contact with the sun irritates and hurts me.</li>
            <li>I am confident that I now have a new addition to my daily beauty-care routine, thanks to the convenient pump that allows for easy application.</li>
            <li>The bottle seems small, but one pump is all you need, and my bottle has been providing me with an amazing product for over a month now!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used anything like this before</li>
            <li>if you use toner or serum use that first then apply this moisturiser.</li>
            <li>I love that it can do that and still moisturize my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li>I am a cheapskate, so I always make sure that I use ALL - whatever is left in the container.</li>
            <li>It has left  my under eye area feelui&amp;ntilde;g softer and looking more refreshed.</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is fragrance free, silky to the touch, and dries clear.  </li>
            <li>I love that this product takes the place of multiple products.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I like about the product is the ingredients list.</li>
            <li>The moisturizer made my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li>It feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It made my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I received the Fox Brim Complete Anti- Aging Moisturizer free and for review.  </li>
            <li>I’m excited to share with you my “Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim Review!”</li>
            <li>that by itself puts it above many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I first ordered this for my husband.  </li>
            <li>I love to use products with retinol, because unlike retinoid a, they do the same job, just that retinol does not irritate you skin, or make it peel.</li>
            <li>This is my first moisturizer with Retinol that says it will not cause dryness to the face.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>It took WAY too many pumps to get out enough product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, the pump feature did not work, so had to shake it out.</li>
            <li>This is a light and airy cream, that goes on and absorbs seamlessly.  </li>
            <li>The product does not ball up whatsoever - instead it blends in smoothly and completely.</li>
            <li>~~ Does exactly as it says in listing</li>
            <li>This is the first time trying out this brand</li>
            <li>This retinol cream made my face feel tightened with the first use.</li>
            <li>When I first heard of Fox Brim</li>
            <li>You will noty be sorry this is an awesome product</li>
            <li>, I loved how hydrated my face started to feel after a few times using it.</li>
            <li>have dry skin and this moisturizer is not dense/ rich enough to hydrate my skin, however, I still use it as it&#x27;s ingredients are wonderful and my skin feels nourished afterwards; I apply a heavier moisturizer afterwards to help hydrate and combat my dry skin type.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim is a 1% Retinol moisturizer that is gentle for the most sensitive of skins and yet a powerful formula that will have you seeing results in days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But after reading the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try, being aware that retinol (vitamin A) is the biggest fighter against those oh so unsightly wrinkles</li>
            <li>but I am loving this formula it doesnt irritate my skin the way the other retinol was.</li>
            <li>I have researched all of the ingredients, as I always do, and am satisfied that everything is good for your skin with nothing weird or harmful.</li>
            <li>Not enough time to really fall in love with a face product.</li>
            <li>Foxbrim was nice enough to send me a bottle of their Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer to review.</li>
            <li>I have nothing but positive things to say about how the moisturizer feels.  </li>
            <li>I love the way my skin feels after applying the Retinol cream and am looking forward to seeing the long term benefits.</li>
            <li>the tube inside the unit is lost somewhere in the container so every time I use it I have to pretty much pound it into my hand.  </li>
            <li>I found the Foxbrim Anti-Aging Moisturizer to be a light, creamy product that feels nice and makes a good base for applying makeup.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth, sinks in to get to work right away!</li>
            <li>and i do not have those dry spots any more.</li>
            <li>The pump makes it easy to get just enough to cover your face.</li>
            <li>Even after just a couple of days I noticed that my skin had a healthier glow to it and that it was super soft.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, feels like a regular moisturizer and works well under foundation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just simple and since I&#x27;m applying it close to my nose (and am not a fan of strong scents)</li>
            <li>Also, my understanding is that if the concentration of retinal is high enough to be effective than it may also make your skin a little more sun</li>
            <li>ingredients include 1% pure retinol, aloe, and vitamin E.</li>
            <li>Well, this one certainly did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m allergic to certain fragrances</li>
            <li>I use this everyday and love it!</li>
            <li>Since I have started using this cream, my face has a new glow to it, leaving my face younger -looking as well as healthy.</li>
            <li>Its not bad, I can only smell it if I put it right in front of my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used some of their products in the past and been pleased with the results, so I was excited to test this one out.</li>
            <li>and I have begun to see fine lines, especially around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li>I’m starting to get fine lines around my nose, mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li>It felt a little drying after I applied it on its own.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, just a dallop, to do the whole face</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the anti aging side of it.  </li>
            <li>but I really don&#x27;t feel like it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>we really like the moisturizer alot.</li>
            <li>High quality and RESULTS!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this, its a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>It includes Vitamin A as one of its composition, but in a reasonable amount.</li>
            <li>Absorbs fast and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>The container is sturdy and has a pump under the cap, that lets you control how much product you want to pump out.</li>
            <li>As an esthetician, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I could feel the retinol gently working.</li>
            <li>It is very silky and works well under make-up.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not saying it should hurt or that i want to experience any of the side-effects retinol can have on the skin (I usually don&#x27;t much at all)</li>
            <li>is not oily and it absobes really quikly  </li>
            <li>Makes my face really shiny and oily.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>Even some of the acne scars I have had since my teen years are beginning to smooth out.</li>
            <li>First off, I have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Their formulation in this product made my skin look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li>My face seems tighter thanks to the retinol.  </li>
            <li>I like fancy bottles and lets face it, the bottle isn&#x27;t very fancy.  </li>
            <li>so i really can&#x27;t give any reviews about this .&lt;br</li>
            <li>company was really helpful, and to me customer service says a lot when you are communicating with a Brand</li>
            <li>I have pretty normal skin</li>
            <li>It left my skin very moist, smooth for almost whole day.</li>
            <li>The pump is convenient and I use just one pump to cover my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li>I really do like this as a night-time moisturizer.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really say that I saw a noticeable change in that.</li>
            <li>A: Will gently exfoliate the skin from the inside out making it look for youthful and radiant.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t have to dig your fingers in a jar and contaminate the whole moisturizer</li>
            <li>purchased a promotional sample of this item, in return for my objective and genuine opinion.</li>
            <li>I use to use too much</li>
            <li>I do feel that I can recommend this product and really like that it is basically organic in origin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much for the sample product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It really does work.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another thing I love about Foxbrim is that their cream uses only 100% natural and organic ingredients with no parabens or additives.</li>
            <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li>It absorbs well and made my skin feel nice but didn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling like some moisturizers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that the company states that they ONLY use 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li>normally prefer a heavier, creamier moisturizer but would not hesitate to use the Foxbrim Anti-Aging during warmer weather when a heavier moisturizer feels a bit too much here in the hot, humid South.</li>
            <li>I have recently been trying to find more natural products for my skin and rejoiced that I found one that also contained retinol.</li>
            <li>It has no foul chemical smell like most of these kinds of creams do and the directions are simple and clear.</li>
            <li>As it did seem to smooth out fine lines, but I could not use it long term to fully see the potential benefits.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Application is simple and clean.</li>
            <li>I feel that this moisturizer will help combat those fine lines with long term use.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to honestly comment on the effectiveness against acne and the like.</li>
            <li>The pump bottle delivery makes it easy to get just the right amount of product for one, full application on my entire face and down my neck.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a small price to pay for beautiful skin that will last into old age!</li>
            <li>I have used other Foxbrim products before and found them to be high quality and well packaged, so I was pleased to try the retinol moisturizer.</li>
            <li>My face tends to be on the sensitive side and turns red easily.</li>
            <li>and if you have dry skin you can feel how soft your face feels you will definitely love this moisturizer</li>
            <li>For starters the bottle it comes in is very nice, not to big and not to small either.</li>
            <li>But, at full price, with a *money back guarantee</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, or dark circles, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t help to get on top of the situation before it starts.</li>
            <li>I have had no ill results of using this moisturizer, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>The cream is very light, not oily and does not leave a tight feeling as some moisturizers do.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Even though I am only 22 years old with decent skin, I have noticed a genuine change in my skin&#x27;s texture, smoothness, and uniformity in color.</li>
            <li>my skin tone looked more even, my acne scars are less visible  </li>
            <li>This cream is a better moisturizer than my previous one.</li>
            <li>She said she would recommend this product to anyone older.</li>
            <li>Based on the good reviews I had purchased two &#x3D; double trouble.</li>
            <li>Well, this one is particularly for under your eyes</li>
            <li>This moisturizer has everything you need in a moisturizer it leaves your skin so smooth and soft and at the same time enriching and restoring  your skin.</li>
            <li>and it really soaked in well, giving my skin a very soft feel.</li>
            <li>I opened it and it was pretty much empty, so back to order more.  </li>
            <li>This tells me Foxbrim has their customers well being in mind and is a brand that is high on the integrity scale.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend to try this brand.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li>Foxbrim has a pure 1% Retinol formula alongside soothing enriched natural antioxidants like Vitamin A to give you all the benefits of Retinol without the downtime.</li>
            <li>And I also love the little pump application.</li>
            <li>and I wake up every morning with a fresh looking face with unbelievably unnoticeable fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>I think this is helping my quest to stay forever young since it is a decent moisturizer!</li>
            <li>Other Retinol products are just too strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>really am liking this product so far.</li>
            <li>is a light moisturizer and it sinks into my skin almost immediately&lt;</li>
            <li>skin looks much brighter and feels baby soft</li>
            <li>I think that if you have normal skin this product would be beneficial.</li>
            <li>But overall, this product seems well worth it.</li>
            <li>The effective retinol complex will help restore your skins youth.</li>
            <li>That is a few reasons why I love</li>
            <li>After application you will feel your skin noticeably tighter; this is normal.</li>
            <li>It became even more oil, patch and limp.</li>
            <li>and I was able to notice a difference after using it a few times.</li>
            <li>Light cream that goes on easy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin that gets irritated quit easily.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, just a small smell that honestly just smells like a plain, scent free moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for a few days, but I love the lightness of it; I like that it is a cream and not a gel; I like the way it absorbs and does not feel greasy; the cream soaks in quickly and leaves skin feeling soft and looking hydrated.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Verdict: I did not notice any vast changes in the quality of my skin, but this relatively lightweight moisturizer was an easy addition to my skincare</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t live with my mother</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new products.</li>
            <li>your not doing anything yet to fight the visible signs of aging or would like to try something new.</li>
            <li>Because I live in AZ, I use this as a night cream, as retinol can cause sensitivity to the sun.</li>
            <li>Effective Retinol Complex for all of the restorative benefits without the worry.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li>I was under strong impression, that this bottle was used previously.</li>
            <li>you control how much product comes out, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li>So this makes me very conscious of my choice when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li>use the moisturizer less for what lines I already have than to prevent new fine lines or wrinkles from forming.</li>
            <li>Although I am not sure that I see a difference in my skin yet, I love this product.</li>
            <li>So far, my vote is 5 stars!</li>
            <li>it let the skin feels so soft like baby skin!</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my face for about a week now and notice some fine smoothing of the undereye skin, as well as a slight lightening of my freckles.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-aging claims, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I really like what it&#x27;s done so far.</li>
            <li>enjoyed using this moisturizer each night for the past month.</li>
            <li>This can also be mixed with your foundation if you want a more natural look like a bb cream does which is always a nice trick to do if you feel your foundation is too thick and heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li>It has a light smell that you barely notice, it sinks in to your skin and POOF, disappears.</li>
            <li>No strong smell, easy to apply, non greasy.</li>
            <li>The second bottle had little bit more product.</li>
            <li>This product combats aging as well as helping clear up acne problems.  </li>
            <li>Although, it&#x27;s meant to clear pores, it can clog it with overuse.</li>
            <li>and it leave skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, yet even after extended use, this moisturizer never broke my skin out in any way.</li>
            <li>Finally a product that delivers great results on 65 year old tired looking skin!  </li>
            <li>However, this stuff is gentle enough that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with drying or peeling at all.</li>
            <li>Has it improved my appearance as far as anti-aging?</li>
            <li>Its non drying, leaving your skin soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li>Too early too tell if any changes.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft without leaving it greasy or sticky</li>
            <li>, I decided to try this Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim.</li>
            <li>What I like about this is that it&#x27;s formulated for even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>FOXBRIM is a complete Anti-Aging moisturizer and has Vitamin A + Antioxidants.</li>
            <li>They do use mostly natural.</li>
            <li>It comes in a pump bottle, it is a white medium thickness and one pump covers my whole face.</li>
            <li>really like this moisturizer for numerous reasons.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 46 years old</li>
            <li>/&gt;With sensitive skin and a preference for low-key fragrances, I used to think I was an oddity.</li>
            <li>Foxbrim completely catered to my tastes</li>
            <li>The sale price (currently under $18) makes it an absolute steal in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it, its non greasy and leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not heavy.</li>
            <li>Old lady smell.</li>
            <li>I tried “Youthful Radiance Eye Cream” by Foxbrim before but this time I applied “Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer” from this brand.</li>
            <li>Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer through Tomoson.</li>
            <li>but its baby soft after a week of using this.it</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of  Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim  to review for my blog.</li>
            <li>It does not leave her skin feeling greasy at all, just soft and supple.</li>
            <li>For those of us that are always busy</li>
            <li>A natural moisturizer and anti-inflammatory agent, Aloe will soothe and hydrate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>have only been using for a couple weeks and can already tell a difference.my skin looks much younger.smoother</li>
            <li>After replacing my cleanser and going ALL NATURAL, I need a moisturizer to fix my errors.</li>
            <li>For those of us that are always busy</li>
            <li>This leaves my face so soft, I use it twice a day and there is a noticeable difference in my skin after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li>Foxbrim has created a complete anti-aging moisturizer that has Vitamin A (that is what Retinol is, folks) in it - 1% Retinol which is the desired amount in non-prescription products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I’m in my early 30’s</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin, but never had any burning or itching from using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She also loves the fact that it is made out of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It does make your skin soft.</li>
            <li>Another plus for this moisturizer would be that it is made up of 100% natural and organic ingredients, with no parabens or additives.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that it kept my skin soft and moist and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>As I have only been using it a month, I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-aging benefits though I believe some of the ingredients can be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After opening and re-closing it, I pumped a few more times and it finally worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It left my face feeling more moisturized after a few days.</li>
            <li>This cream is very light it gets absorbed into my skin very fast and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive and combination skin.</li>
            <li>While I still have the occasional break outs, I know my active lifestyle in hot Arizona is the major contributor, and other than washing my face more times a day than I ever could, I will have to deal with this until the fall.</li>
            <li>I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li>However, my problem areas are less red and overall my skin has a soft, healthy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Instantly cools and refreshes the face, and I have fine lines that ARE less noticeable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll try to stay as youthful looking as possible (since I plan on acting that way) ;)&lt;</li>
            <li>Now, after only a couple of weeks, the product is almost completely gone, so there hasn&#x27;t been enough time to determine if it has had a positive effect.</li>
            <li>His face is extremely sensitive and breaks out easily, so finding the right moisturizer for him is difficult.  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say as I feel I would have to use it much longer to give a review on that subject.</li>
            <li>I think it is because of the Vitamin A and all the other skin supporting all natural additions which are &amp;#34;Green Tea (Antioxidant), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Vitamin E, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>At first I was worried my tube might have been empty</li>
            <li>I find it a mild moisturizer, I did not experience any flaking, drying or skin irritation (like I usually do when adjusting to a new retinol).</li>
            <li>I like trying out new products, especially if they work!</li>
            <li>but then 2 days later I was very red and really flaking.  </li>
            <li>but after a few seconds it starts pumping and just a bit of this light cream is enough to moisturize.</li>
            <li>What I like about the Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer, is that it is made with ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li>I think with more extended use, it&#x27;s likely that it would help slow the signs of aging.</li>
            <li>Being in my mid 30&#x27;s, I am fully aware that sooner or later, I will be starting to see wrinkles and lines on my face.</li>
            <li>Goes on easily, also a little goes a LONG way so apply sparingly!</li>
            <li>i have only a few fine lines starting, but like to be proactive.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this as a regular cream for daily use for wrinkles and skin imperfections.</li>
            <li>I was also plesently happy with the scent, it didnt smell bad at all.</li>
            <li>Even if you aren&#x27;t into alternative or natural treatments, Science has shown Vitamin A and Antioxidants especially to assist with healing and restoring.</li>
            <li>I felt like it made a marked difference in the size of my pores and in the overall smoothness and radiance of my skin.</li>
            <li>It also has  Aloe vera, Sunflower oil, Palm oil, and Vitamin E, and soothing natural antioxidants for the ultimate skin repair</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the last couple of weeks and so far I like it</li>
            <li>I have finally found a moisturizer that does not burn my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>I like to give myself a head start by pushing back the signs of aging early on in life.</li>
            <li>Plus only 100% all natural and organic ingredients are used.</li>
            <li>the same professional results</li>
            <li>If you are sensitive to scents this could possibly be something you may want to look in to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li>AND they use only natural and organic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I also love that it has decreased my breakouts.</li>
            <li>This product has left my skin feeling firm and full, and over all moisturized.</li>
            <li>I use to have certain dry spots on my face especially around my nose</li>
            <li>is a very lightweight moisturizer, so if you suffer from extremely dry skin this may not be enough moisture for you.</li>
            <li>My mother is in her late 60’s and was excited to try the moisturizer after reading about all the benefits.</li>
            <li>The switch from summer to fall and winter is always a tough time for my skin, especially since autumn is my favorite time of year</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried quite a few new samples lately and Foxbrim is the latest that was sent to me to test out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Foxbrim Vitamin C Serum for about three months and the results were so dramatic that I decided to pair it with the Vitamin A Retinol Cream, and I am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>, it is not nearly as dry.</li>
            <li>There is a faint chemical smell to it when you first squeeze it out that I didn&#x27;t care for, but it does fade off quickly.</li>
            <li>I like them very much, however I think that because this has retinol in it, it caused my skin to break out with little red blotches.</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m enjoying it and use along with other Foxbrim products, like the Peptide Complex and Orange Blossom Water Toner.  </li>
            <li>Foxbrim you have a complete anti-aging moisturizer all in a single bottle.</li>
            <li>My mom has pretty saggy thin skin since she lost a lot of weight and is getting older.</li>
            <li>I found that the pump was a little hard to work; it would often take several pumps to dispense an appropriate amount of product.</li>

            <li> Anyhow, I received this great moisturizer for my 100% honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> This product never claims to be noncomedogenic, so we knew there was a good chance he couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> And, honestly, at this price...it&#x27;s a great deal, anyway.</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot I have been using it in the morning with a vitamin c serum and a good spf</li>
            <li> It is just a superior product with no additives or parabens.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with it.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s light on the skin and feels great.</li>

            <li> I actually love a good retinol cream.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product that I agreed to try at no charge for an honest report, and I will doubtless continue using it.</li>
            <li> The pump dispenser is nice, and i like that it is not fragranced.</li>
            <li> I can honestly say, I will be a life time</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this cream got so many good reviews.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s nice</li>
            <li> but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> All opinions are my own.)</li>
            <li> What i didn&#x27;t like is that its odorless, If it did have a scent I could not tell honestly.</li>
            <li> also noticed that my skin started to have this really nice glow to it</li>
            <li> It smells nice to</li>
            <li> The cream comes in a nice, compact container.</li>
            <li> The scent is almost undectable, which is nice.</li>
            <li> These are my honest opinions on trying this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like lotion for your eyes to help lighten and youthfulize (yup, made up my own word)</li>
            <li> that’s nice to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light scent is perfect for my sensitive skin and it leaves my skin perfectly hydrated and healthy feeling.</li>
            <li> Now, on the anti-aging topic, I honestly don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkling YET</li>
            <li> I did receive this for a reduced price for an honest opinion.  </li>
            <li> and i liked it alot.</li>
            <li> I also found on days when I did not wear makeup that the serum plus moisturizer was nice.</li>

            <li> This moisturizer feels great, and absorbs quickly with no tacky feeling or residue.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The potency of the retinol is touted on the label, however I find the moisturizer to be very easy on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I find using retinols at night when my skin is in restorative mode, to be most effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect moisturizer that will keep my skin soft and glowing no matter what the weather brings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> Beautiful and effective packaging, quick shipping and does exactly what it claims.  </li>

            <li> I have had not one breakout and am finding that my face and neck are benefiting with a tightening and just healthy toned look.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many neck creams and seen no change.  </li>
            <li> and I found the Foxbrim line to be reputable and most of all the results prove themselves.  </li>
            <li> More and more products are coming out with anti-aging ingredients.</li>
            <li> I am sure to use sunscreen with this as well.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ok if it gets on your cheek.</li>
            <li> I totally love that feeling.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can use it without having my makeup slide off after applying it.</li>
            <li> I also love that it contains organic ingredients</li>

            <li> I use this mostly at night, but often both in the morning and night, but I am better at remembering it at night.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer and it&#x27;s made by a reliable brand.</li>
            <li> surely there is something better on the market.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love everything about this moisturizer and the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> I also love that it comes in a pump bottle for two reasons.</li>
            <li> I know a lengthy skincare regimen might not always be possible, so multi-purposed products are our best bet.</li>
            <li> so you can get the most out of</li>
            <li> I love that I can read the ingredients list and know what they are and have heard of them before.</li>
            <li> When you put all these fabulous ingredients together you have one amazing skin care cream moisturizer I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I know a lengthy skincare regimen might not always be possible, so multi-purposed products are our best bet.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has added retinol and antioxidants to target the visible signs of aging and to keep our skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I love it and planning on telling friends and family about this product.</li>
            <li> For more information on this product please view my blog review at http://beautynproducts.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/foxbrim-anti-aging-moisturizer-and-retinol-cream/</li>
            <li> It was more of a suddle scent.</li>
            <li> Which i enjoyed because i dont like products with an overbearing smell.</li>
            <li> My skin looks more supple and</li>
            <li> Well, I can sweeten it even more because they do not test on animals</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it does not have one of those scents that make me sneeze.</li>
            <li> Many beauty products make me sneeze and have an allergy attack.</li>
            <li> However, I have been using this for about a month, and I couldn&#x27;t have wished for better results</li>
            <li> but I have to say that this is one of the top ones on my list.</li>
            <li> so I already knew I would love the moisturizer as well.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, so far so good!</li>
            <li> I can easily recommend this product, even though I was provided one or more products by either Tomoson or the manufacturer for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I had stopped using retinol because it was a bit to drying for my already dry skin this one is loaded with moisturizers and is the best of both worlds .</li>
            <li> have been using this product, and very quickly I was able to notice a reduction in the lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my skin look and feel so healthy and smooth.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, the pump is easy to use and u do not need to use very much at a time :</li>
            <li> I must say I am pretty impressed so far!</li>
            <li> It absorbs easy and that makes for easy application of foundation over the top of this product.</li>
            <li> Not only is the retinol cream helping my skin, but the customer service is incredible.</li>
            <li> made my make up look more smooth</li>
            <li> you could tell her skin was more smooth</li>
            <li> So far, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love that it is frangrance free and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> Their complete anti-aging moisturizer is another great addition.  </li>
            <li> that if you want great skin, you have to start young and be consistant.</li>
            <li> As you know many of the products I review are supplied through Tomoson and they have supplied me with some fantastic products, this moisturizer is no exception.</li>
            <li> really did like this product, and loved how it made my skin feel.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li> But I find it has a light, pleasant scent and makes my skin feel very soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product came right on time and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> It has a pump like dispenser that makes it easy to control the amount.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Received item as described and very quick.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tighter and looks bright and vibrant.</li>
            <li> moisturizer absorbs into the skin easily and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling like some moisturizers do.</li>
            <li> I could go a whole day and not worry too much about having incredibly oily skin.</li>
            <li> The cream comes in a pump bottle and it is easy to dispense the amount you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It applied easily without being too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Its not to strong  or over drying.  </li>
            <li> Get the best and don&#x27;t settle for less, and of course reap the benefits, and most of the time the benefits are the ones you love smiling at you, and you can read it in their eyes and smile when they look at you.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin and has a very light scent.</li>
            <li> the most for true skin correction.</li>
            <li> It was fine if I added Foxbrim Ultra Lift Treatment with Hyaluronic Acid as it helped retain moisture, but I still had the irritation issue.</li>
            <li> It was fine going on</li>
            <li> IT IS NOT GREASY, AND I CAN SEE MY FINE LINES BEING MINIMIZED.  </li>
            <li> I will have to use it for longer to get the full benefits, but this seems like a great retinol for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and easy to apply, with no burning or tingling.</li>
            <li> so I want to help my fine lines, but I don&#x27;t want to have</li>
            <li> if you want to reduce wrinkles and lighten up sun spots, I suggest getting the Best Facial Serum and trying it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free with the rule of giving my honest opinion when finished...</li>
            <li> Once I got it going, it has worked fine.</li>
            <li> and my skin feels super!</li>
            <li> It comes in an easy to dispense pump an the cream is rich, creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve really been enjoying it!</li>
            <li> I received my order pretty quick which I LOVE!</li>
            <li> The Retinol cream has made a huge difference with my face.</li>

            <li> Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a good product, just not for my skin type.</li>
            <li> The products packaging is nice and sleek and it actually feels really nice to the touch.</li>

            <li> When I got this I was excited.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m too excited.</li>
            <li> Nope not disappointed in this product at all.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out another one of Foxbrim&#x27;s products when I got this one.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is creamy and rich.</li>
            <li> you know Retinol is not always friendly to work with.</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> I liked it because it left my skin very smooth and hydrate.</li>
            <li> It is a rich and creamy moisturizer that goes on super smooth.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and non oily.</li>
            <li> The cream is smooth and odorless and goes on quickly without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I really love the products my face glows and is more soft.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is thick and creamy, yet goes on light leaving the perfect amount of moisture in my skin.</li>
            <li> I mostly used it in the evenings since it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF and retinol can make your skin more sensitive to the sun.</li>
            <li> This cream is not heavy on your skin at all ,after you apply you will see your skin more healthy looking</li>

            <li> I use a moisturizer everyday but because I have very fair skin I prefer to use a moisturizer with sunscreen in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, it is important to wear a good, broad spectrum sunscreen during the day.</li>
            <li> All of Foxbrim&#x27;s products are organic and all-natural, and this one comes with the handy pump bottle so there is no waste</li>
            <li> I did need to use an extra moisturizer since retinol tends to be drying, but otherwise I had a good experience with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looks so healthy and has really helped with my breakouts.</li>
            <li> I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> but it is an overall good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have been enjoying it and it has not broken me out at all.</li>

            <li> It absorbed quickly into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave any ind of oily or greasy residue.</li>

            <li> This Retinol Cream Moisturizer is absorbed quickly and leaves no sheen or oily residue at all, the skin absorbs it all evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the skin looks much smoother!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying products from Foxbrim, and I got two products to review from them the moisturizer and the youthful radiance eye cream!  </li>

            <li> I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!</li>

            <li> absorbs quickly, non greasy and really moisturizes your skin!</li>

            <li> the right ingredients to where it&lt;</li>
            <li> Retinoids degrade in sunlight, so use this moisturizer at night right before bedtime</li>
            <li> This cream seems to be the right strength &amp; mix.  </li>
            <li> this by far is the best product ive used in a long time i have tried many other products and never have got any results until now</li>
            <li> I did not pay full price for this, but gladly would in the future.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a week and a half and have noticed that my skin looks better and feels better.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get the product out, I liked that it wasn&#x27;t really scented heavily and when I used it, it didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy like some of these products do.</li>
            <li> In case this happens to you, just be sure the top is screwed on tightly</li>
            <li> Although this moisturizer is very rich and creamy but not greasy, absorbs quickly into my skin for deep hydration.</li>
            <li> Great daily facial mosturizer.</li>
            <li> But I prefer to use retinol only in the nights, because I have sensitive and fair skin and the contact with the sun irritates and hurts me.</li>
            <li> I am confident that I now have a new addition to my daily beauty-care routine, thanks to the convenient pump that allows for easy application.</li>
            <li> The bottle seems small, but one pump is all you need, and my bottle has been providing me with an amazing product for over a month now!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used anything like this before</li>
            <li> if you use toner or serum use that first then apply this moisturiser.</li>
            <li> I love that it can do that and still moisturize my skin at the same time.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.</li>
            <li> I am a cheapskate, so I always make sure that I use ALL - whatever is left in the container.</li>
            <li> It has left  my under eye area feelui&amp;ntilde;g softer and looking more refreshed.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fragrance free, silky to the touch, and dries clear.  </li>
            <li> I love that this product takes the place of multiple products.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I like about the product is the ingredients list.</li>
            <li> The moisturizer made my skin so soft and smooth</li>
            <li> It feels soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It made my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I received the Fox Brim Complete Anti- Aging Moisturizer free and for review.  </li>
            <li> I’m excited to share with you my “Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim Review!”</li>
            <li> that by itself puts it above many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I first ordered this for my husband.  </li>
            <li> I love to use products with retinol, because unlike retinoid a, they do the same job, just that retinol does not irritate you skin, or make it peel.</li>
            <li> This is my first moisturizer with Retinol that says it will not cause dryness to the face.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> It took WAY too many pumps to get out enough product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, the pump feature did not work, so had to shake it out.</li>
            <li> This is a light and airy cream, that goes on and absorbs seamlessly.  </li>
            <li> The product does not ball up whatsoever - instead it blends in smoothly and completely.</li>
            <li> ~~ Does exactly as it says in listing</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying out this brand</li>
            <li> This retinol cream made my face feel tightened with the first use.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of Fox Brim</li>
            <li> You will noty be sorry this is an awesome product</li>
            <li> , I loved how hydrated my face started to feel after a few times using it.</li>
            <li> have dry skin and this moisturizer is not dense/ rich enough to hydrate my skin, however, I still use it as it&#x27;s ingredients are wonderful and my skin feels nourished afterwards; I apply a heavier moisturizer afterwards to help hydrate and combat my dry skin type.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim is a 1% Retinol moisturizer that is gentle for the most sensitive of skins and yet a powerful formula that will have you seeing results in days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But after reading the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try, being aware that retinol (vitamin A) is the biggest fighter against those oh so unsightly wrinkles</li>
            <li> but I am loving this formula it doesnt irritate my skin the way the other retinol was.</li>
            <li> I have researched all of the ingredients, as I always do, and am satisfied that everything is good for your skin with nothing weird or harmful.</li>
            <li> Not enough time to really fall in love with a face product.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim was nice enough to send me a bottle of their Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer to review.</li>
            <li> I have nothing but positive things to say about how the moisturizer feels.  </li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after applying the Retinol cream and am looking forward to seeing the long term benefits.</li>
            <li> the tube inside the unit is lost somewhere in the container so every time I use it I have to pretty much pound it into my hand.  </li>
            <li> I found the Foxbrim Anti-Aging Moisturizer to be a light, creamy product that feels nice and makes a good base for applying makeup.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth, sinks in to get to work right away!</li>
            <li> and i do not have those dry spots any more.</li>
            <li> The pump makes it easy to get just enough to cover your face.</li>
            <li> Even after just a couple of days I noticed that my skin had a healthier glow to it and that it was super soft.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, feels like a regular moisturizer and works well under foundation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just simple and since I&#x27;m applying it close to my nose (and am not a fan of strong scents)</li>
            <li> Also, my understanding is that if the concentration of retinal is high enough to be effective than it may also make your skin a little more sun</li>
            <li> ingredients include 1% pure retinol, aloe, and vitamin E.</li>
            <li> Well, this one certainly did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m allergic to certain fragrances</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it!</li>
            <li> Since I have started using this cream, my face has a new glow to it, leaving my face younger -looking as well as healthy.</li>
            <li> Its not bad, I can only smell it if I put it right in front of my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some of their products in the past and been pleased with the results, so I was excited to test this one out.</li>
            <li> and I have begun to see fine lines, especially around my eyes and mouth.</li>
            <li> I’m starting to get fine lines around my nose, mouth and eyes.</li>
            <li> It felt a little drying after I applied it on its own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, just a dallop, to do the whole face</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the anti aging side of it.  </li>
            <li> but I really don&#x27;t feel like it does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> we really like the moisturizer alot.</li>
            <li> High quality and RESULTS!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this, its a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> It includes Vitamin A as one of its composition, but in a reasonable amount.</li>
            <li> Absorbs fast and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> The container is sturdy and has a pump under the cap, that lets you control how much product you want to pump out.</li>
            <li> As an esthetician, I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I could feel the retinol gently working.</li>
            <li> It is very silky and works well under make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not saying it should hurt or that i want to experience any of the side-effects retinol can have on the skin (I usually don&#x27;t much at all)</li>
            <li> is not oily and it absobes really quikly  </li>
            <li> Makes my face really shiny and oily.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream.</li>
            <li> Even some of the acne scars I have had since my teen years are beginning to smooth out.</li>
            <li> First off, I have real sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Their formulation in this product made my skin look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li> My face seems tighter thanks to the retinol.  </li>
            <li> I like fancy bottles and lets face it, the bottle isn&#x27;t very fancy.  </li>
            <li> so i really can&#x27;t give any reviews about this .&lt;br</li>
            <li> company was really helpful, and to me customer service says a lot when you are communicating with a Brand</li>
            <li> I have pretty normal skin</li>
            <li> It left my skin very moist, smooth for almost whole day.</li>
            <li> The pump is convenient and I use just one pump to cover my whole face and neck.</li>
            <li> I really do like this as a night-time moisturizer.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t really say that I saw a noticeable change in that.</li>
            <li> A: Will gently exfoliate the skin from the inside out making it look for youthful and radiant.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to dig your fingers in a jar and contaminate the whole moisturizer</li>
            <li> purchased a promotional sample of this item, in return for my objective and genuine opinion.</li>
            <li> I use to use too much</li>
            <li> I do feel that I can recommend this product and really like that it is basically organic in origin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks so much for the sample product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It really does work.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another thing I love about Foxbrim is that their cream uses only 100% natural and organic ingredients with no parabens or additives.</li>
            <li> and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
            <li> It absorbs well and made my skin feel nice but didn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling like some moisturizers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love that the company states that they ONLY use 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li> normally prefer a heavier, creamier moisturizer but would not hesitate to use the Foxbrim Anti-Aging during warmer weather when a heavier moisturizer feels a bit too much here in the hot, humid South.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying to find more natural products for my skin and rejoiced that I found one that also contained retinol.</li>
            <li> It has no foul chemical smell like most of these kinds of creams do and the directions are simple and clear.</li>
            <li> As it did seem to smooth out fine lines, but I could not use it long term to fully see the potential benefits.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is simple and clean.</li>
            <li> I feel that this moisturizer will help combat those fine lines with long term use.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to honestly comment on the effectiveness against acne and the like.</li>
            <li> The pump bottle delivery makes it easy to get just the right amount of product for one, full application on my entire face and down my neck.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a small price to pay for beautiful skin that will last into old age!</li>
            <li> I have used other Foxbrim products before and found them to be high quality and well packaged, so I was pleased to try the retinol moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My face tends to be on the sensitive side and turns red easily.</li>
            <li> and if you have dry skin you can feel how soft your face feels you will definitely love this moisturizer</li>
            <li> For starters the bottle it comes in is very nice, not to big and not to small either.</li>
            <li> But, at full price, with a *money back guarantee</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, or dark circles, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t help to get on top of the situation before it starts.</li>
            <li> I have had no ill results of using this moisturizer, and I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> The cream is very light, not oily and does not leave a tight feeling as some moisturizers do.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Even though I am only 22 years old with decent skin, I have noticed a genuine change in my skin&#x27;s texture, smoothness, and uniformity in color.</li>
            <li> my skin tone looked more even, my acne scars are less visible  </li>
            <li> This cream is a better moisturizer than my previous one.</li>
            <li> She said she would recommend this product to anyone older.</li>
            <li> Based on the good reviews I had purchased two &#x3D; double trouble.</li>
            <li> Well, this one is particularly for under your eyes</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has everything you need in a moisturizer it leaves your skin so smooth and soft and at the same time enriching and restoring  your skin.</li>
            <li> and it really soaked in well, giving my skin a very soft feel.</li>
            <li> I opened it and it was pretty much empty, so back to order more.  </li>
            <li> This tells me Foxbrim has their customers well being in mind and is a brand that is high on the integrity scale.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend to try this brand.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> Foxbrim has a pure 1% Retinol formula alongside soothing enriched natural antioxidants like Vitamin A to give you all the benefits of Retinol without the downtime.</li>
            <li> And I also love the little pump application.</li>
            <li> and I wake up every morning with a fresh looking face with unbelievably unnoticeable fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I think this is helping my quest to stay forever young since it is a decent moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Other Retinol products are just too strong for my skin.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> really am liking this product so far.</li>
            <li> is a light moisturizer and it sinks into my skin almost immediately&lt;</li>
            <li> skin looks much brighter and feels baby soft</li>
            <li> I think that if you have normal skin this product would be beneficial.</li>
            <li> But overall, this product seems well worth it.</li>
            <li> The effective retinol complex will help restore your skins youth.</li>
            <li> That is a few reasons why I love</li>
            <li> After application you will feel your skin noticeably tighter; this is normal.</li>
            <li> It became even more oil, patch and limp.</li>
            <li> and I was able to notice a difference after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> Light cream that goes on easy, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin that gets irritated quit easily.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, just a small smell that honestly just smells like a plain, scent free moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for a few days, but I love the lightness of it; I like that it is a cream and not a gel; I like the way it absorbs and does not feel greasy; the cream soaks in quickly and leaves skin feeling soft and looking hydrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Verdict: I did not notice any vast changes in the quality of my skin, but this relatively lightweight moisturizer was an easy addition to my skincare</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t live with my mother</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new products.</li>
            <li> your not doing anything yet to fight the visible signs of aging or would like to try something new.</li>
            <li> Because I live in AZ, I use this as a night cream, as retinol can cause sensitivity to the sun.</li>
            <li> Effective Retinol Complex for all of the restorative benefits without the worry.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li> I was under strong impression, that this bottle was used previously.</li>
            <li> you control how much product comes out, which is a major plus.</li>
            <li> So this makes me very conscious of my choice when it comes to beauty products.</li>
            <li> use the moisturizer less for what lines I already have than to prevent new fine lines or wrinkles from forming.</li>
            <li> Although I am not sure that I see a difference in my skin yet, I love this product.</li>
            <li> So far, my vote is 5 stars!</li>
            <li> it let the skin feels so soft like baby skin!</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face for about a week now and notice some fine smoothing of the undereye skin, as well as a slight lightening of my freckles.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-aging claims, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I really like what it&#x27;s done so far.</li>
            <li> enjoyed using this moisturizer each night for the past month.</li>
            <li> This can also be mixed with your foundation if you want a more natural look like a bb cream does which is always a nice trick to do if you feel your foundation is too thick and heavy on your skin.</li>
            <li> It has a light smell that you barely notice, it sinks in to your skin and POOF, disappears.</li>
            <li> No strong smell, easy to apply, non greasy.</li>
            <li> The second bottle had little bit more product.</li>
            <li> This product combats aging as well as helping clear up acne problems.  </li>
            <li> Although, it&#x27;s meant to clear pores, it can clog it with overuse.</li>
            <li> and it leave skin feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, yet even after extended use, this moisturizer never broke my skin out in any way.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that delivers great results on 65 year old tired looking skin!  </li>
            <li> However, this stuff is gentle enough that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with drying or peeling at all.</li>
            <li> Has it improved my appearance as far as anti-aging?</li>
            <li> Its non drying, leaving your skin soft &amp; supple.</li>
            <li> Too early too tell if any changes.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft without leaving it greasy or sticky</li>
            <li> , I decided to try this Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim.</li>
            <li> What I like about this is that it&#x27;s formulated for even sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> FOXBRIM is a complete Anti-Aging moisturizer and has Vitamin A + Antioxidants.</li>
            <li> They do use mostly natural.</li>
            <li> It comes in a pump bottle, it is a white medium thickness and one pump covers my whole face.</li>
            <li> really like this moisturizer for numerous reasons.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 46 years old</li>
            <li> /&gt;With sensitive skin and a preference for low-key fragrances, I used to think I was an oddity.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim completely catered to my tastes</li>
            <li> The sale price (currently under $18) makes it an absolute steal in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it, its non greasy and leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not heavy.</li>
            <li> Old lady smell.</li>
            <li> I tried “Youthful Radiance Eye Cream” by Foxbrim before but this time I applied “Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer” from this brand.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer through Tomoson.</li>
            <li> but its baby soft after a week of using this.it</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of  Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim  to review for my blog.</li>
            <li> It does not leave her skin feeling greasy at all, just soft and supple.</li>
            <li> For those of us that are always busy</li>
            <li> A natural moisturizer and anti-inflammatory agent, Aloe will soothe and hydrate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> have only been using for a couple weeks and can already tell a difference.my skin looks much younger.smoother</li>
            <li> After replacing my cleanser and going ALL NATURAL, I need a moisturizer to fix my errors.</li>
            <li> For those of us that are always busy</li>
            <li> This leaves my face so soft, I use it twice a day and there is a noticeable difference in my skin after a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim has created a complete anti-aging moisturizer that has Vitamin A (that is what Retinol is, folks) in it - 1% Retinol which is the desired amount in non-prescription products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I’m in my early 30’s</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin, but never had any burning or itching from using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She also loves the fact that it is made out of all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It does make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> Another plus for this moisturizer would be that it is made up of 100% natural and organic ingredients, with no parabens or additives.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that it kept my skin soft and moist and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li> As I have only been using it a month, I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-aging benefits though I believe some of the ingredients can be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After opening and re-closing it, I pumped a few more times and it finally worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It left my face feeling more moisturized after a few days.</li>
            <li> This cream is very light it gets absorbed into my skin very fast and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive and combination skin.</li>
            <li> While I still have the occasional break outs, I know my active lifestyle in hot Arizona is the major contributor, and other than washing my face more times a day than I ever could, I will have to deal with this until the fall.</li>
            <li> I have pretty dry skin</li>
            <li> However, my problem areas are less red and overall my skin has a soft, healthy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Instantly cools and refreshes the face, and I have fine lines that ARE less noticeable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to stay as youthful looking as possible (since I plan on acting that way) ;)&lt;</li>
            <li> Now, after only a couple of weeks, the product is almost completely gone, so there hasn&#x27;t been enough time to determine if it has had a positive effect.</li>
            <li> His face is extremely sensitive and breaks out easily, so finding the right moisturizer for him is difficult.  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say as I feel I would have to use it much longer to give a review on that subject.</li>
            <li> I think it is because of the Vitamin A and all the other skin supporting all natural additions which are &amp;#34;Green Tea (Antioxidant), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Vitamin E, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> At first I was worried my tube might have been empty</li>
            <li> I find it a mild moisturizer, I did not experience any flaking, drying or skin irritation (like I usually do when adjusting to a new retinol).</li>
            <li> I like trying out new products, especially if they work!</li>
            <li> but then 2 days later I was very red and really flaking.  </li>
            <li> but after a few seconds it starts pumping and just a bit of this light cream is enough to moisturize.</li>
            <li> What I like about the Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer, is that it is made with ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li> I think with more extended use, it&#x27;s likely that it would help slow the signs of aging.</li>
            <li> Being in my mid 30&#x27;s, I am fully aware that sooner or later, I will be starting to see wrinkles and lines on my face.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, also a little goes a LONG way so apply sparingly!</li>
            <li> i have only a few fine lines starting, but like to be proactive.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this as a regular cream for daily use for wrinkles and skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> I was also plesently happy with the scent, it didnt smell bad at all.</li>
            <li> Even if you aren&#x27;t into alternative or natural treatments, Science has shown Vitamin A and Antioxidants especially to assist with healing and restoring.</li>
            <li> I felt like it made a marked difference in the size of my pores and in the overall smoothness and radiance of my skin.</li>
            <li> It also has  Aloe vera, Sunflower oil, Palm oil, and Vitamin E, and soothing natural antioxidants for the ultimate skin repair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last couple of weeks and so far I like it</li>
            <li> I have finally found a moisturizer that does not burn my sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> I like to give myself a head start by pushing back the signs of aging early on in life.</li>
            <li> Plus only 100% all natural and organic ingredients are used.</li>
            <li> the same professional results</li>
            <li> If you are sensitive to scents this could possibly be something you may want to look in to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients.</li>
            <li> AND they use only natural and organic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also love that it has decreased my breakouts.</li>
            <li> This product has left my skin feeling firm and full, and over all moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use to have certain dry spots on my face especially around my nose</li>
            <li> is a very lightweight moisturizer, so if you suffer from extremely dry skin this may not be enough moisture for you.</li>
            <li> My mother is in her late 60’s and was excited to try the moisturizer after reading about all the benefits.</li>
            <li> The switch from summer to fall and winter is always a tough time for my skin, especially since autumn is my favorite time of year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few new samples lately and Foxbrim is the latest that was sent to me to test out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Foxbrim Vitamin C Serum for about three months and the results were so dramatic that I decided to pair it with the Vitamin A Retinol Cream, and I am extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> , it is not nearly as dry.</li>
            <li> There is a faint chemical smell to it when you first squeeze it out that I didn&#x27;t care for, but it does fade off quickly.</li>
            <li> I like them very much, however I think that because this has retinol in it, it caused my skin to break out with little red blotches.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m enjoying it and use along with other Foxbrim products, like the Peptide Complex and Orange Blossom Water Toner.  </li>
            <li> Foxbrim you have a complete anti-aging moisturizer all in a single bottle.</li>
            <li> My mom has pretty saggy thin skin since she lost a lot of weight and is getting older.</li>
            <li> I found that the pump was a little hard to work; it would often take several pumps to dispense an appropriate amount of product.</li>
            <li> It is smooth going on and hydrates my face making the small lines much less noticeable.  </li>
            <li> At first,  I had a hard time getting it to dispense through the pump.</li>
            <li> This did a good job at managing my pimple woes around the T-Zone and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, too badly.</li>
            <li> There also is no overwhelming scent, which I really appreciate.</li>
            <li> My worry lines, developing crows feet, and dark circles are beginning to completely disappear, and it looks radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I guess the product is ok so far other than that disappointment</li>
            <li> I am 45 years old and definitely have uneven skin tone, age spots, and wrinkles around my eyes, mouth, and on my forehead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried numerous moisturizers throughout the years and have spent countless amounts of money on them,</li>
            <li> A heavily moisturizing face product that makes my skin soft and stays hydrated!</li>
            <li> One being that you won&#x27;t waste product because you control how much product comes out of the bottle and two, because unlike other moisturizers where you have to dip your fingers into the product, with this product you will not run into that problem.</li>
            <li> AND, in a very short time, the DEEP wrinkles I had near my jaw (from looking down) are REMARKABLY less.  </li>
            <li> It feels so soft and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> important, they are rendered useless if</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t vouche for longterm results, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> The Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer takes the place of a serum, targeted treatment, and a moisturizer saving us a few steps.</li>
            <li> The Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer takes the place of a serum, targeted treatment, and a moisturizer saving us a few steps.</li>
            <li> I just started using this a few days ago, so I will give my first impression and then return in a few weeks to give an update as to results in my skin tone.</li>
            <li> I really like how this moisturizer is really thick and creamy.</li>
            <li> Being  stuck with it, I eventually  mixed it with Vaseline and am using it every other day that way.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> Only having to use one pump this product will last a little while.</li>
            <li> I have not used this cream for very long and have not noticed any anti-aging benefits as of now.</li>
            <li> A change in medication turned my aging, yet oily and acne-prone skin, incredibly dry.  </li>
            <li> my skin is dry in some spots and oily in others.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and it has not been too oily or too dry since adding this into the mix.</li>
            <li> I also find that some of the products with retinol dry me out</li>
            <li> My skin is usually dry as the Sahara but not after using this product.</li>
            <li> All of my dry spots have cleared up.</li>
            <li> The cream has a clean, slightly floral smell but nothing perfume-y or skin irritating.</li>
            <li> “Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer” has a little pump which needed a bit patience to start working!</li>
            <li> I am one of those people who could not live without applying moisturizer to my face after shower or toning/cleansing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer every night for the past month.</li>
            <li> I use these every morning as a part of my daily routine and these haven&#x27;t let me down yet.</li>
            <li> It takes very little to cover my entire face and neck, so the bottle will last anywhere from 3-6 months, depending on how it&#x27;s used</li>
            <li> Although other reviewers have claimed to have a tiny amount of trouble with it, I have had no such problems.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for less than a week.</li>
            <li> Only slightly drying.</li>
            <li> have to use my little finger to deep it in to use the cream</li>
            <li> but a little extra here</li>
            <li> My wife does not see any anti-age changes yet, but she has only used it for a little while.</li>
            <li> - you only need a few drops at a time to work wonders.  </li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone, acne scars and occasional breakouts</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even want to call it a fragrance because that&#x27;s not really what it is.</li>
            <li> over time minus the&lt;br /&gt;irritation.  </li>
            <li> The only thing missing in this formula is a sunscreen.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money in my opinion....</li>
            <li> She has not experienced any flakes, dryness, or irritation from the Retinol, the 1% Retinol seems to be gentle on her skin.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;It leaves absolutely no residue on my skin&lt;</li>
            <li> has absolutely no scent to it, for me</li>
            <li> I could definitely notice a tightening of the skin after using for just a few days.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast but pump was broken, the quality of product was not what I expected.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not fun for my dry skin areas.</li>
            <li> I prefer natural or subtle solutions, like this brand.</li>
            <li> a little bit goes long way.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I love how soft and firm it leaves my skin.goes on creamy and thick but absorbs quickly.winter weathers bad on your skin</li>
            <li> I have used other Foxbrim products and I have never been dissatisfied with any of their products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also using other products from this line.</li>
            <li> I have used other Foxbrim products before and they have not irritated my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I learned that a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> The list of ingredients besides the retinol, include items such as green tea, Vitamin E, shea butter, organic aloe vera!</li>
            <li> but I wonder to the potency since I have not felt any adjustment to my skin as I have with other retinol treatments I have used.</li>
            <li> The anti aging moisturizer lives up to all the other Fox Brim products.  </li>
            <li> I initially tried the product I was not able to get any product out.</li>
            <li> I have used other Foxbrim products and they deliver results every time.</li>
            <li> which was concern for me as I have been loosing weight over the past several years and</li>
            <li> She loves this product and will continue to use it to see all the other benefits it has in store.</li>
            <li> I have reviewed a lot of different kinds of moisturizers in the past</li>
            <li> Although I cannot see any major difference in the past two weeks of using it, I feel my face and is a little tighter and firmer.</li>
            <li> A proven synergistic blend of active botanicals and skin rejuvenating Retinol and Panthenol (Vitamin B5) make this moisturizer an unparalleled option in restorative skin care.</li>
            <li> I have used retinol products in the past that didn&#x27;t work for me because it dried my skin out and left scaly patches.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a serum to fight wrinkles and dark circles.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, no effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> complaint is that the product is wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap -</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is with the bottle pump as it just forcefully squirts out the product and sometimes takes a few tries.</li>
            <li> Dark spots are fading and my skin appears smoother.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is slow working, but I am starting to see results.</li>
            <li> that sunlight breaks it down.  </li>
            <li> fo keep the flacky look down on my nose.</li>
            <li> I had to flip  the bottle up side down and dump all the product into the bottle cup.</li>
            <li> (The one thing I agree with other reviewers about is that the pump is a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> and it actually had negative effects, so use a little bit on your skin.</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference in after 1 week and a half</li>
            <li> it is so much less drying that others I have used .</li>
            <li> Little over half of the cup, Id say.</li>
            <li> This cream has made a noticeable difference in my skin... was a little concerned about break outs, it seemed every Retin A product I tried would break me out.</li>
            <li> cream is a little heavy</li>
            <li> It still felt quite heavy, yet nothing would come out.  </li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and moisturized without any greasy residue or weird smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ingredients: Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Sunflower oil, Palm oil, Pentylene glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, polysorbate 20, Potassium phosphate, Vitamin e, CassiaAngustifolia seed polysaccharide, Glyceryl stearate, Cetyl alcohol, Stearic acid, Kosher vegetable glycertin, Organic jojoba oil, Green tea, Propolis, Shea butter, Vitamin b5, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl glycerin, Xanthan gum &amp; Citric Acid</li>
            <li> I have a few items from this line as well.</li>
            <li> Smell is a bit off in my humble opinion</li>
            <li> but it gives her a tighter feeling after a few day and night of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to all products Foxbrim makes, I have their Vitamin C moisturizer as well, I use the Retinol and Vitamin C and alternate each day between each.</li>
            <li> It does not feel heavy on the skin either.</li>
            <li> Well i just arrived a few days ago</li>
            <li> im a firm believer</li>
            <li> When you have a product as well as this product is plus all the organic natural ingredents, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Some listed ingredients include; Aloe Vera, Sunflower oil, Palm oil, Vitamin E, Jojoba oil, Green tea and Shea butter.</li>
            <li> For instance, and my biggest mistake had been using a cleanser that dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I used it in the evening for a few reasons.</li>
            <li> this is the one for me,you can&#x27;t go wrong with all the benfits it offers your skin</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old man, and have always had terrible dry skin, and have extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used everyday now for about 5 days and have noticed I small difference in the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> I guess I am a little prissy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed very little improvement over one month use.</li>
            <li> there was very little product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy or oily like some of the moisturizers I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> products tend to make me break out with small blemishes but this one did not.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;it does not have small tube to push out the cream</li>
            <li> This one did not cause any excessive drying of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive skin, and have had bad experiences with Retinol products in the past.</li>
            <li> Anyone can afford this skin care line, at least I can.  </li>
            <li> and I tend to spend a lot of time outside with chilly winds drying out my face.</li>
            <li> It is thick but does not break my skin out.</li>
            <li> This product is creamy without being greasy or too thick; I would definitly recommend it!</li>
            <li> but I have also read to put it on thinly.  </li>
            <li> poor product and poor case.</li>
            <li> But seriously, it&#x27;s a radical freeing, antioxident...for your face!</li>
            <li> I reached out to Troy at Foxbrim to request some recommendations for my difficult skin.</li>
            <li> But with this one, it would be difficult to do just as that.</li>
            <li> ,* what&#x27;s to go wrong?  </li>
            <li> I have oily skin and it has been difficult finding moisturizers that did not add to my skin issues.</li>
            <li> With oily skin is so difficult to find creams that I can wear and also work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid to try something else that might cause acne, so I&#x27;ll stick with this for now.</li>
            <li> Very silly feel.</li>
            <li> but I might have just got a bad one.</li>
            <li> It dries my skin out badly, but I also understand, that&#x27;s one of side effect of Retinol.</li>
            <li> I wanted to return this moisturizer badly, but was out of state and missed the chance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been fighting those bad boys for a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hate the container.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Gets rid of wrinkles and moisturizes without a greasy feeling. Great for everyday use and can be used around the eyes.</li>
            <li> Very nice moisturizer! It&#x27;s not greasy or irrational to the skin. I&#x27;ve used it in the morning and the evening and it leave skin feeling soft. I&#x27;m not a fan of the airless pump but I might have just got a bad one. Contacted customer service and they quickly worked on a satisfactory solution.</li>
            <li> As always Foxbrim never disappoints when it comes to skin care.  Beautiful and effective packaging, quick shipping and does exactly what it claims.  They have created a silky smooth moisturizer that leaves your skin feeling clean, fresh and toned.  This product combats aging as well as helping clear up acne problems.  Foxbrim&#x27;s products are NEVER tested on animals and this one is paraben and additive free.  It also contains Vitamin A and antioxidants so it is good for any part of your body, not just your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the ingredients is Retinol, a well-known skincare ingredient.  All of Foxbrim&#x27;s products are organic and all-natural, and this one comes with the handy pump bottle so there is no waste - you only need a few drops at a time to work wonders.  This one bottle will last you at least a few months :)  Plus they have a money-back guarantee so nothing to lose!  I received a complimentary product to test.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I have extremely sensitive skin, yet even after extended use, this moisturizer never broke my skin out in any way. It also lifted my skin immediately, just as it said it would. I have been extremely impressed with the effects of this cream. It takes very little to cover my entire face and neck, so the bottle will last anywhere from 3-6 months, depending on how it&#x27;s used (I&#x27;m just guessing at this, so don&#x27;t hold me to it). I used my moisturizer twice each day. I can easily recommend this product, even though I was provided one or more products by either Tomoson or the manufacturer for review purposes. I would never recommend a product I wouldn&#x27;t use myself, though.</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream for 2 weeks and I do notice a nice difference. I say &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; because it has only been a short period of time. Just yesterday, I took notice of the tightness and clarity of my skin. I have done a lot of research and I see that there are the right products in the cream so it should do what it says it does.  I also like that the company e-mails you after the purchase to let you know they are available for questions or concerns and that they will do anything to make you happy. Give this product a try. It comes at a great price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Retinol Cream for about a week now and I love it!  I don&#x27;t know if this Anti-Aging cream has a &#x27;GLOW&#x27; Benefit, but this is how I feel after I apply the cream to my face.  It seems like it gives my face an after glow, which I LOVE!.  I have used other Foxbrim products and I have never been dissatisfied with any of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take much, just a dallop, to do the whole face and I use this stuff day and night.  One of the features I like about this anti-aging cream is the bottle.  It has a pump like dispenser that makes it easy to control the amount.&lt;br /&gt;#1antiagingcream  #foxbrim</li>
            <li> Great product. Customer service was fantastic. Will repurchase this product.</li>
            <li> Love the way it feels on my skin! I have used everyday now for about 5 days and have noticed I small difference in the texture of my skin. I was told by my boyfriend that my skin looked &amp;#34; pretty&amp;#34; . He does not know I have changed my skincare routine. I&#x27;m also using other products from this line. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wished it was bigger. I can see that I will have to reorder sooner then I like.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!! I just ordered 3 more!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the fact that I am only 28 or what but I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in the anti aging side of it.  However, it did seem to make my face a bit softer.</li>
            <li> This may have been good if the two bottles I bought weren&#x27;t empty</li>
            <li> I actually love a good retinol cream. I don&#x27;t use it to treat my wrinkles, per se, but instead to treat my acne. This did a good job at managing my pimple woes around the T-Zone and it didn&#x27;t dry my skin out, too badly. I did need to use an extra moisturizer since retinol tends to be drying, but otherwise I had a good experience with this product.</li>
            <li> This is another great moisturizer by Foxbrim. It&#x27;s light weight and good for an everyday moisturizer. It keeps your skin hydrated and it has beneficial ingredients to prevent wrinkles from forming and even to lessen them. This can also be mixed with your foundation if you want a more natural look like a bb cream does which is always a nice trick to do if you feel your foundation is too thick and heavy on your skin. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to try a new moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing part is good but I really don&#x27;t feel like it does what it says it does. I feel like I started to break out even keep more when using this. I&#x27;ve only used it for a week so I&#x27;ll update my review if things change.</li>
            <li> I love Foxbrim products! This moisturizer is great. It has a mild scent. Non - greasy plus is a very light cream so it doesn&#x27;t clog your pores. Does as it states. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 1-1/2 months.  A change in medication turned my aging, yet oily and acne-prone skin, incredibly dry.  I see no improvement at all in wrinkles, etc., but it does not cause acne.  Except for the one time I let it touch my nose -instant zit.  I hate the container.  It still felt quite heavy, yet nothing would come out.  I opened it and it was pretty much empty, so back to order more.  I&#x27;m afraid to try something else that might cause acne, so I&#x27;ll stick with this for now.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin that gets irritated quit easily. I have used other Foxbrim products before and they have not irritated my skin at all. I like them very much, however I think that because this has retinol in it, it caused my skin to break out with little red blotches. It felt a little drying after I applied it on its own. It was fine if I added Foxbrim Ultra Lift Treatment with Hyaluronic Acid as it helped retain moisture, but I still had the irritation issue. I think that if you have normal skin this product would be beneficial. As it did seem to smooth out fine lines, but I could not use it long term to fully see the potential benefits. I like that it contains organic ingredients and that it is not animal tested. It comes in a pump, that let’s you control how much product comes out, which is a major plus. The texture of the product is nice and creamy, not greasy and absorbs very quickly into skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim has amazing customer service, they will respond promptly if you have any questions or concerns. That to me speaks volumes about a company.  Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer is a good product, just not for my skin type.</li>
            <li> Finally a product that delivers great results on 65 year old tired looking skin!  I have been using the product twice a day for about a week and I am extremely happy with the results. I have been using Foxbrim Vitamin C Serum for about three months and the results were so dramatic that I decided to pair it with the Vitamin A Retinol Cream, and I am extremely pleased with the results.  I am getting many , many compliments. Even my husband has noticed the difference! It is literally a miracle. My skin is plump, lifted, and toned, and it has that youthful glow back. Bye, bye wrinkles and age spots. Even my turkey neck is diminishing. I am going to try the toner next!</li>
            <li> i have only a few fine lines starting, but like to be proactive. i dont even have to use it every night to eliminate that deep line between my eyes. love this company</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my skin feel hydrated and healthy. I use it as a night cream. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This face cream did NOTHING for my complexion. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Not only is the retinol cream helping my skin, but the customer service is incredible. I reached out to Troy at Foxbrim to request some recommendations for my difficult skin. You would think that he would of pushed other Foxbrim products on me, but instead he gave me great advice for a balanced skin care regime. This tells me Foxbrim has their customers well being in mind and is a brand that is high on the integrity scale. I will be a loyal customer from this point on.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works as advertised. Very happy with the end state.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t love this stuff. I felt like it was greasy for my already too oily face. it may work better for others.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used anything like this before and I am very pleased with it.  I use it at night before I go to bed as I have red that sunlight breaks it down.  So night applications is the best.  I have used it for a week and a half and have noticed that my skin looks better and feels better.  I started using it cause of wrinkles i was getting on my forehead and around my eyes.  I have had no irritation with this but I have also read to put it on thinly.  All in all I am very happy with it.  I got it free to try and review and plan on getting more when mine runs low.</li>
            <li> I have insanely sensitive skin, and have had bad experiences with Retinol products in the past. However, this stuff is gentle enough that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with drying or peeling at all. It leaves my skin soft and moisturized without any greasy residue or weird smell. It seems to help minimize pores, and goes on very smoothly.</li>
            <li> i recieved a 1oz bottle of foxbrim anit-aging moisturiszer. it has vitm a adn antioxidants. it was even made in the USA and not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my mom and i both tried it for about 3 weeks. we used moring and night on our face and necks as recommend after washing our face. if you use toner or serum use that first then apply this moisturiser. the moisturizer is white and creamy kinda silky feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it only took about 1-2 pumps of it to go all over the face and neck. a little bit goes long way. for me it helped were my skin is dry in some spots and oily in others. i even used it right before putting on my makeup fo keep the flacky look down on my nose. made my make up look more smooth and even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my mom use it the same way i did. her skin tone started to look more even and she had a brighter glow on her face. she said her face felt more fresh from using it. you could tell her skin was more smooth looking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we are not saying this is a mircal in a bottle my no means but we are saying it does take time to work and you avhe to keep it up. i started to see some results before my mom. everyones skin is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;we do plan on using this more. we really like the moisturizer alot. we do recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I am loving the Foxbrim brand! This cream is awesome. It goes on smooth, and isn&#x27;t greasy. It&#x27;s light on the skin and feels great. Love it&#x27;s ingredients. I also love that it has decreased my breakouts. Received this product for review.</li>
            <li> Foxbrim Retinol Cream BEST Retinol Moisturizer with Advanced Complex - WOW this stuff really is amazing! I have been using a Vitamin C Serum with hyaluronic Acid as well as a basic retinol but I am loving this formula it doesnt irritate my skin the way the other retinol was. It was fine going on but then 2 days later I was very red and really flaking.  This Foxbrim retinol does not cause this problem with me.  I think it is because of the Vitamin A and all the other skin supporting all natural additions which are &amp;#34;Green Tea (Antioxidant), Panthenol (Vitamin B5), Vitamin E, Jojoba Oil, Shea Butter&amp;#34;.  I got this product on a promotion to try it out and review and I really think it pays to try few different variations when it comes to skin care because I was &amp;#34;OK&amp;#34; with what I was using but.....I am VERY happy with this it feels like an upgrade!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer. I have only used it for a few days, but I love the lightness of it; I like that it is a cream and not a gel; I like the way it absorbs and does not feel greasy; the cream soaks in quickly and leaves skin feeling soft and looking hydrated. I love the pump dispenser. I have researched all of the ingredients, as I always do, and am satisfied that everything is good for your skin with nothing weird or harmful. I appreciate a company that does not have to rely on chemicals in their list of ingredients to make their product more marketable. I recommend this product that I agreed to try at no charge for an honest report, and I will doubtless continue using it.</li>
            <li> I have been reviewing all of FoxBrim&#x27;s products based on promotional codes.  Simply put, this is a combination of every item that has been proven to prevent aging.  Although I couldn&#x27;t prove to you that my skin&#x27;s aging has slowed down, I can tell you this brand is so incredible my skin looks amazing thanks to their products and that the array of preventative ingredients are excellent.  Even if you aren&#x27;t into alternative or natural treatments, Science has shown Vitamin A and Antioxidants especially to assist with healing and restoring.</li>
            <li> This stuff feels great... goes on smooth and leaves my skin looking nice even prior to makeup.  My skin is reacting well to the Retinol as well :)</li>
            <li> I love this solution. I use these every morning as a part of my daily routine and these haven&#x27;t let me down yet. For about /2 the price of stores this is a great option. Delivery was super fast and great quality.</li>
            <li> I use this product at bedtime 15 minutes following a Vitamin C serum application. I&#x27;ve noticed very little improvement over one month use. I am 45 years old and definitely have uneven skin tone, age spots, and wrinkles around my eyes, mouth, and on my forehead. I will continue to use this product another month in hopes that I will see improvement.</li>
            <li> I love Foxbrims product line. This retinol cream is no different. High quality and RESULTS! I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and I can definitely feel a difference in my skins texture and look. It&#x27;s looks so healthy and has really helped with my breakouts. I love that it can do that and still moisturize my skin at the same time. I would definitely recommend this, its a fantastic product. I did receive my bottle at a promotional price but that does not affect my opinion of the product. This has been my experience using it. I hope you found this information and experience helpful for you.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product. I love the size/shape of the dispenser. I comes as like a pump. I learned that a little goes a long way! It doesn&#x27;t really have a scent, just a small smell that honestly just smells like a plain, scent free moisturizer. Its not bad, I can only smell it if I put it right in front of my nose. It makes my skin immediately softer!</li>
            <li> I have been using the product for 2 weeks now, and I like it. I am one of those people who could not live without applying moisturizer to my face after shower or toning/cleansing. Being in my mid 30&#x27;s, I am fully aware that sooner or later, I will be starting to see wrinkles and lines on my face. So this makes me very conscious of my choice when it comes to beauty products. I prefer natural or subtle solutions, like this brand. It includes Vitamin A as one of its composition, but in a reasonable amount. The only drawback I see - I am not a fan of the pump dispensing. I am a cheapskate, so I always make sure that I use ALL - whatever is left in the container. But with this one, it would be difficult to do just as that. So far, I am happy with the product.</li>
            <li> I love the way this moisturizer makes my face feel. My face can be oily at times so I was worried this moisturizer would add to the problem but it does not at all, nor does it cause my face to break out. I have been using foxbrim for about two weeks now. Although I am not sure that I see a difference in my skin yet, I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love all their products, packaged well, dispense well, great ingredients, can not beat the pricing.  Anyone can afford this skin care line, at least I can.  Reasonable and a great guarantee.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of creams and moisturizers, but this one actually does what it claims. Light cream that goes on easy, a little goes a long way. Absorbs fast and is not greasy. I use morning and night, and use under my makeup. Instantly cools and refreshes the face, and I have fine lines that ARE less noticeable. And my husband says my complexion looks great ! I only wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT, MUST GET.</li>
            <li> Great product I&#x27;ll definitely buy again my skin looks great and feels great</li>
            <li> Great retinol cream. I like the smell and texture of this cream.  Its not to strong  or over drying.  I highly recommend this as a regular cream for daily use for wrinkles and skin imperfections.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it will do and I would recommend. I bought this as a gift and my mom was happy to gotten it and tried it. Was a good buy for her.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice product. It has left  my under eye area feelui&amp;ntilde;g softer and looking more refreshed.</li>
            <li> Goes on clean and non oily. Can be used under makeup without issue. A little bit goes a long way! Has it improved my appearance as far as anti-aging? I really can&#x27;t say as I feel I would have to use it much longer to give a review on that subject. But I find it has a light, pleasant scent and makes my skin feel very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Organic Aloe Vera, Organic Sunflower oil, Palm oil, Pentylene glycol, Phospholipids, Retinol, polysorbate 20, Potassium phosphate, Vitamin e, CassiaAngustifolia seed polysaccharide, Glyceryl stearate, Cetyl alcohol, Stearic acid, Kosher vegetable glycertin, Organic jojoba oil, Green tea, Propolis, Shea butter, Vitamin b5, Phenoxyethanol, Ethylhexyl glycerin, Xanthan gum &amp; Citric Acid&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Specs: The perfect moisturizer to enjoy the benefits of Retinol (Vitamin A) without worry. A proven synergistic blend of active botanicals and skin rejuvenating Retinol and Panthenol (Vitamin B5) make this moisturizer an unparalleled option in restorative skin care. Restore skin firmness. Renew elasticity and thickness. Prevent clogged pores. Promote skin cell turnover while fighting free radical damage. Finally, enjoy renewed skin health you can see.</li>
            <li> I just started using this a few days ago, so I will give my first impression and then return in a few weeks to give an update as to results in my skin tone. but I can tell right away, that this product glides on so easily and is odor-free. The list of ingredients besides the retinol, include items such as green tea, Vitamin E, shea butter, organic aloe vera! The container is sturdy and has a pump under the cap, that lets you control how much product you want to pump out. So far, my vote is 5 stars!</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST MOISTURIZER.  IT IS NOT GREASY, AND I CAN SEE MY FINE LINES BEING MINIMIZED.  I USE IT BOTH UNDER MY MAKEUP AND AT BEDTIME.  THIS IS A MUST HAVE!!</li>
            <li> I had never heard of Foxbrim prior to this review, but I have to say that I do like it. It&#x27;s not greasy, which is a big concern when it comes to moisturizers - as some can leave me with a breakout! There is a feeling of firming when it&#x27;s on my skin, which I like, and it keeps my skin feeling hydrated.</li>
            <li> This lotion feels great once it&#x27;s on.  I have pretty dry skin and it really soaked in well, giving my skin a very soft feel.</li>
            <li> This product is slightly more oily than I like in a moisturizer, but it has not yet caused me additional break outs.  My skin is soft and more even toned.  Overall I&#x27;m enjoying it and use along with other Foxbrim products, like the Peptide Complex and Orange Blossom Water Toner.  My skin is healing and the texture is improving.</li>
            <li> Absolutely an awesome retinol moisturizer. The cream is smooth and odorless and goes on quickly without feeling greasy. I put it on before bed every night (it&#x27;s best not to use it during the day as it can lead to sunburns). Even though I am only 22 years old with decent skin, I have noticed a genuine change in my skin&#x27;s texture, smoothness, and uniformity in color. I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for about 5-6 weeks and will definitely repurchase when I run out. It&#x27;s a small price to pay for beautiful skin that will last into old age! (The one thing I agree with other reviewers about is that the pump is a little flimsy. However, I&#x27;ve never had a problem with it.)</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is fragrance free, silky to the touch, and dries clear.  My skin feels smooth after application - it does NOT seem shiny or oily.  I tried this under my makeup, and did not have any issues.  I love that this product takes the place of multiple products.  It saves me time, and space in my cabinet.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. As an esthetician, I highly recommend! Smells good and goes on well.</li>
            <li> I received this to review. I have a few items from this line as well. I really love the products my face glows and is more soft. I love it.</li>
            <li> Again I reviewed another great product from this company.  It feels light weight on my face and its greasy at all.  Gives my skin a great complexion.  Worth buying in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great smell, and great texture. Looking forward to seeing the progress of this over time!</li>
            <li> Okay. Smell is a bit off in my humble opinion</li>
            <li> Girlfriend uses this all the time, says it makes her look younger. I agree!</li>
            <li> My wife was happy when I gave her this product as a gift! She said is very good.</li>
            <li> I like the ingredients; my skin is oily, so I&#x27;ll probably use this more in the winter. I could feel the retinol gently working. The pump dispenser is nice, and i like that it is not fragranced.</li>
            <li> I have hyperpigmentation, uneven skin tone, acne scars and occasional breakouts this cream has helped me with all of these skin problems. I have been using it for over 2 weeks I noticed a difference in after 1 week and a half my skin tone looked more even, my acne scars are less visible  and my pores looked smaller as well. This cream is very light it gets absorbed into my skin very fast and doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell I would recommend it to anyone with sensitive and combination skin.</li>
            <li> This was purchased at a lower cost in exchange to test and review in my best and most honest opinion. I had my mother try this since she likes products like this. I don&#x27;t live with my mother so I couldn&#x27;t take any before and after photo. She likes this cream. My mom has pretty saggy thin skin since she lost a lot of weight and is getting older. She likes how this product tones her face. Although, it could be just her doing exercise on her face when applying the product but it gives her a tighter feeling after a few day and night of use. She said she would recommend this product to anyone older.</li>
            <li> I have not used this cream for very long and have not noticed any anti-aging benefits as of now. It is very silky and works well under make-up. I love that it is frangrance free and non-greasy. I did not pay full price for this, but gladly would in the future. It is make-up counter quality without the price!</li>
            <li> I have used other Foxbrim products before and found them to be high quality and well packaged, so I was pleased to try the retinol moisturizer. The first thing I like about the product is the ingredients list. The first two (greatest amount)  ingredients are organic, as well as others. Several of the ingredients are &amp;#34;wildcrafted&amp;#34; or kosher. I like eating organic because it is &amp;#34;cleaner&amp;#34; and the same goes for the products I put on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;The potency of the retinol is touted on the label, however I find the moisturizer to be very easy on my skin. I&#x27;m not saying it should hurt or that i want to experience any of the side-effects retinol can have on the skin (I usually don&#x27;t much at all) but I wonder to the potency since I have not felt any adjustment to my skin as I have with other retinol treatments I have used. This is a creamy but light moisturizer which absorbs easily and leaves my skin soft, as a moisturizer should. The packaging recommends use morning and/or night but I have only used it as a night cream because I always try to use a cream with sunscreen during the day for protection and I find using retinols at night when my skin is in restorative mode, to be most effective. The pump bottle delivery makes it easy to get just the right amount of product for one, full application on my entire face and down my neck. The cream has a clean, slightly floral smell but nothing perfume-y or skin irritating. I will have to use it for longer to get the full benefits, but this seems like a great retinol for someone with sensitive skin. *Discount given for unbiased opinion. I would recommend the product and order from the seller again.</li>
            <li> Love the retinal cream!! I look great &amp; my skin feels great!!!</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer! It helps strengths my skin and it doesn&#x27;t go on too think or feel sticky. I have noticed a change in my skin&#x27;s elasticity since I started using it. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> it let the skin feels so soft like baby skin! is not oily and it absobes really quikly  the skin looks much smoother!!</li>
            <li> Works great!  Notice a difference in my skin&#x27;s appearance after just a few uses!</li>
            <li> So far I really like this product.  I have been using it on my face for about a week now and notice some fine smoothing of the undereye skin, as well as a slight lightening of my freckles.  It is smooth and easy to apply, with no burning or tingling.</li>
            <li> Makes my face really shiny and oily. I also haven&#x27;t experienced any noticeable changes with complexion or reduction in acne. Maybe I need to use the product longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: The seller of this product was very kind and even offered me a refund with no questions asked. That&#x27;s a rarity these days and says a lot about the integrity of the company.</li>
            <li> i love this moisturizer it is very light and i love the fact that i feel the retinol</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve become addicted to all products Foxbrim makes, I have their Vitamin C moisturizer as well, I use the Retinol and Vitamin C and alternate each day between each. I love the way my skin feels after applying the Retinol cream and am looking forward to seeing the long term benefits. I&#x27;ve tried numerous moisturizers throughout the years and have spent countless amounts of money on them, when I got the chance to review this product, I was beyond happy. I can honestly say, I will be a life time Foxbrim customer and already have my eye out on their toner and mud mask. You will not be disappointed in this product!</li>
            <li> Im always going for a retinol product since it is very good for the skin. This product is a definite must try. Its non drying, leaving your skin soft &amp; supple. No strong smell, easy to apply, non greasy. It does not feel heavy on the skin either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using for less than a week. Too early too tell if any changes. The lotion does make face seem softer.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this cream got so many good reviews. It dries my skin out badly, but I also understand, that&#x27;s one of side effect of Retinol. I wanted to return this moisturizer badly, but was out of state and missed the chance. Being  stuck with it, I eventually  mixed it with Vaseline and am using it every other day that way.&lt;br /&gt;One more thing: I couldn&#x27;t get any product out of the bottle, the pump is just way too short. I had to flip  the bottle up side down and dump all the product into the bottle cup. It BARELY filled it up. Little over half of the cup, Id say. I was under strong impression, that this bottle was used previously. Based on the good reviews I had purchased two &#x3D; double trouble. The second bottle had little bit more product. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Goes on easily, also a little goes a LONG way so apply sparingly! Doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, feels like a regular moisturizer and works well under foundation. Makes my skin feel soft without leaving it greasy or sticky so that&#x27;s nice and it didn&#x27;t break me out like a lot of things do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this to review but my opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> (Product received for review. All opinions are my own.) I&#x27;d never heard of Foxbrim before, but I&#x27;m glad I have now! I&#x27;m over 40, with oily skin prone to acne.  This moisturizer feels great, and absorbs quickly with no tacky feeling or residue. My skin feels great, looks good, and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> The switch from summer to fall and winter is always a tough time for my skin, especially since autumn is my favorite time of year and I tend to spend a lot of time outside with chilly winds drying out my face. I&#x27;m always on the lookout for the perfect moisturizer that will keep my skin soft and glowing no matter what the weather brings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my ongoing quest, I decided to try this Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim. I&#x27;ve used some of their products in the past and been pleased with the results, so I was excited to test this one out. What I like about this is that it&#x27;s formulated for even sensitive skin. So though it contains Retinol, it&#x27;s combined with soothing antioxidants that won&#x27;t leave skin red or flaky. In fact, the number one ingredient is Aloe Vera which we all know provides a cooling, soothing sensation and helps with inflammation and itching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream comes out light and creamy from the convenient pump bottle. It can be applied all over the face and neck. It absorbed quickly into my skin and didn&#x27;t leave any ind of oily or greasy residue. Something great about this cream as opposed to ones that just moisturize- it actually clears your pores and tightens them, which helps with bumps and breakouts. I felt like it made a marked difference in the size of my pores and in the overall smoothness and radiance of my skin. I think with more extended use, it&#x27;s likely that it would help slow the signs of aging. For now I&#x27;m happy with the shiny, glowing appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I love about Foxbrim is that their cream uses only 100% natural and organic ingredients with no parabens or additives. PLUS their products are not tested on animals and come with a money back guarantee!</li>
            <li> I am 52 and trying to take care of skin. Most retinols come in a serum that seems difficult to use. I really like this cream. Only been using about a week, but feels light and smooth going on and good to the skin. Purchase thru a promotion for evaluation.</li>
            <li> I have used retinol products in the past that didn&#x27;t work for me because it dried my skin out and left scaly patches. Foxbrim&#x27;s Retinol Cream has been working well for me because not only does it work as an anti-aging product for me but it also does a great job as a moisturizer. It&#x27;s like hitting two birds with one stone - I am moisturizing my skin and at the same time, I am pampering it with anti-aging serum. I must say that this product is a must try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Feels great on my skin</li>
            <li> I received my order pretty quick which I LOVE! The products packaging is nice and sleek and it actually feels really nice to the touch. When I popped the clear top off I pushed the pump and the moisturizer came right out, I needed two pumps for my face (which was a good amount for my face &amp; neck). When I pumped the second time I got nothing so I kept pumping and after about 8-10 pumps I got product. At first I was worried my tube might have been empty but it certainly was not, and that was great because you get a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this moisturizer!! It feels so soft and a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s not greasy or oily like some of the moisturizers I have tried in the past. And it holds up amazingly with the summer heat &amp; humidity. There also is no overwhelming scent, which I really appreciate. The moisturizer made my skin so soft and smooth and I could feel and see immediate results! I have been using it in the morning and before I go to bed and my skin has never looked or felt better! This is my go to moisturizer now. I have such wonderful results that I now just put it on &amp; walk out the door. I am so in love with this product, I don&#x27;t know how I got by without this in my life before.</li>
            <li> Received item as described and very quick. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice a day for only ten days, and already my skin is smoother, my pores appear smaller, and my acne is clearing up. Even some of the acne scars I have had since my teen years are beginning to smooth out.</li>
            <li> Hello welcome to my blog here I have my FOXBRIM REVIEW. This is my truthful and honest opinion on this product. For starters the bottle it comes in is very nice, not to big and not to small either. It is 1fl oz. FOXBRIM is a complete Anti-Aging moisturizer and has Vitamin A + Antioxidants. It also has  Aloe vera, Sunflower oil, Palm oil, and Vitamin E, and soothing natural antioxidants for the ultimate skin repair moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really did like this product, and loved how it made my skin feel. What i didn&#x27;t like is that its odorless, If it did have a scent I could not tell honestly. However it is a very good product, I loved how hydrated my face started to feel after a few times using it. I use to have certain dry spots on my face especially around my nose and i do not have those dry spots any more. ﻿&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that my skin started to have this really nice glow to it, i have not had this until i started Y.  My overall opinion on this product is that it does as promised fresher, radiant, smoother, touchable skin. Only thing i wish is that it had a scent , but besides that i am glad i was able to try this product and i am very happy with my results.</li>
            <li> Creamy and moisturizing! I&#x27;ve been using it for a week, so far so good!</li>
            <li> First off, I have real sensitive skin. I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new products. I was in the market for a moisturizer to help with dryness and red spots on my face. I used this product to get clearer skin on my forehead and nose.&lt;br /&gt;After using this for a week, the redness has cleared up and my skin feels great. Foxbrim, once again, nails another product. Their formulation in this product made my skin look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li> FoxBrim has a wonderful collection of beauty products that help fight the hands of time.  Their complete anti-aging moisturizer is another great addition.  It is smooth going on and hydrates my face making the small lines much less noticeable.  I had no problem incorporating this to my beauty routine, nor any problem wearing the product under my makeup.  My face seems tighter thanks to the retinol.  Ohhh, how I love retinol.  It does wonders.  The only reason the product gets a 4 star rating and not a 5, is well I guess I am a little prissy.  I like fancy bottles and lets face it, the bottle isn&#x27;t very fancy.  Anyhow, I received this great moisturizer for my 100% honest opinion.  Regardless of that fact, I incorporate all products in my life and see how they work for me.  I hope you will find that they work as well for you!</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for my mom because I love this brand and the ingredients they use. They do use mostly natural. My mom loves it. I love all their creams and lotions.</li>
            <li> This smells so good, the pump is easy to use and u do not need to use very much at a time :0&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it makes my skin feel!!</li>
            <li> My take on the product:&lt;br /&gt;I really am liking this product so far. I have been using it about a week and my skin feels super! My face tends to be on the sensitive side and turns red easily. I am happy to say this does not make it red and I do not have any blemishes either. It feels soft and smooth. It comes in a pump bottle, it is a white medium thickness and one pump covers my whole face. It doesn&#x27;t have any smell which I like for face products. I will continue to use this product and would recommend it to family and friends.</li>
            <li> This product works excellent. It made my skin so soft and smooth. Has a very nice light scent.</li>
            <li> poor product and poor case.</li>
            <li> Effective Retinol Complex for all of the restorative benefits without the worry.&lt;br /&gt;ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients. No parabens or additives. I use after Foxbrim&#x27;s vitamin c serum, my skin is always moisturized.</li>
            <li> This stuff is pretty cool, Ive never tried anything like it before so I was completly not expecting anything. After a while of using it, I noticed my face felt more moisturized and smooth, which is awesome. It smells nice to so thats a plus!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last couple of weeks and so far I like it, it has a nice texture and it applies smoothly onto my skin. I have only been using it for a couple of weeks so I cannot say anything about the anti-aging parts but it is an overall good moisturizer. I have been enjoying it and it has not broken me out at all.</li>
            <li> So far I love this cream. I can&#x27;t vouche for longterm results, but I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and so far I like it.</li>
            <li> I love Retinol products and have been using them for years.&lt;br /&gt;We purchased this Foxbrim Retinol cream in a&lt;br /&gt;promotion for testing and review.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this moisturizer for numerous reasons.&lt;br /&gt;This cream also contains beneficial vitamins,&lt;br /&gt;green tea, and shea butter.  It is a lightweight&lt;br /&gt;moisturizer and does not leave me feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it as a night cream since it does&lt;br /&gt;not contain SPF, which is important for me to use.</li>
            <li> The cream comes in a nice, compact container. The airless pump is looks and functions smoothly. Although other reviewers have claimed to have a tiny amount of trouble with it, I have had no such problems.  The cream itself leaves my skin feeling both refreshed and moisturized. There is no greasy or slimy feelings either. Along with that, there has been no itchiness or irritation. I have nothing but positive things to say about how the moisturizer feels.  I haven&#x27;t used the product long enough to honestly comment on the effectiveness against acne and the like. But overall, this product seems well worth it.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging! And I also love the little pump application. The pump makes it easy to get just enough to cover your face. I only needed one pump to cover nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that it is ok to use under make up. It is light and goes on smooth. It absorbs easy and that makes for easy application of foundation over the top of this product. I use a moisturizer everyday but because I have very fair skin I prefer to use a moisturizer with sunscreen in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am only 33 so I can&#x27;t say I have seen any anti-aging benefits. However, my problem areas are less red and overall my skin has a soft, healthy appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients include 1% pure retinol, aloe, and vitamin E. These natural ingredients offer many benefits including anti-aging, healing, acne treatment, and hydration. Also this moisturizer is paraben free, and cruelty free. The company is great and offers a 100% money back guarantee so you can try it with no risks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.  Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I received the Fox Brim Complete Anti- Aging Moisturizer free and for review.  Another score for Fox Brim.  The anti aging moisturizer lives up to all the other Fox Brim products.  It comes in an easy to dispense pump an the cream is rich, creamy and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It dos contain 1% retinol, and I know retinol can cause some redness and irritation.  However, this was not the case.  It made my skin feel smooth and it even looked more radiant.  As in all Fox Brim products the ingredients are 100% natural and organic so you literally feel better using them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The cream is very light, not oily and does not leave a tight feeling as some moisturizers do.  It is barely scented which allows for he use of one&#x27;s own perfume and body sprays.  This is a product I would definitely recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOMdaf1c53d050484809d72b4d6d4cb5881&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&amp;lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Still waiting on the results. These spots didn&#x27;t come over night &amp; I don&#x27;t think they would leave overnight. Takes time. Check back with me in couple of month&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I love my moisturizers and his is no disappointment. I have been using this one and another foxbrim moisturizer and they&#x27;re both great! This one goes on smoothly, firms my skin and is fragrance free... I have finally found a moisturizer that does not burn my sensitive skin... I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase and I&#x27;m sure you will be too!!!</li>
            <li> This cream has made a noticeable difference in my skin... was a little concerned about break outs, it seemed every Retin A product I tried would break me out. But after reading the positive reviews, I decided to give it a try, being aware that retinol (vitamin A) is the biggest fighter against those oh so unsightly wrinkles</li>
            <li> Excellent product highly recommend</li>
            <li> I apply it every night to my cleansed  face and I wake up every morning with a fresh looking face with unbelievably unnoticeable fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I am loving this moisturizer! I have added it to my morning and evening routine along with the Vitamin C serum. The scent is almost undectable, which is nice. My skin has been brighter and smoother. I have combination skin and it has not been too oily or too dry since adding this into the mix.</li>
            <li> The Retinol cream has made a huge difference with my face. I have had not one breakout and am finding that my face and neck are benefiting with a tightening and just healthy toned look.  I have tried so many neck creams and seen no change.  I&#x27;m 46 years old and I found the Foxbrim line to be reputable and most of all the results prove themselves.  They are affordable too for those on a budget like myself.</li>
            <li> I’m excited to share with you my “Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim Review!” I like to give myself a head start by pushing back the signs of aging early on in life. Plus I also like to use anti-aging moisturizer on my face, neck, hands and feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Foxbrim you have a complete anti-aging moisturizer all in a single bottle. The effective retinol complex will help restore your skins youth. Plus only 100% all natural and organic ingredients are used. So theres no worry of paragons or additives added and its not tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your not doing anything yet to fight the visible signs of aging or would like to try something new. Fortify and enrich your skin, while reaping all the benefits.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I can use a retinol product again with Foxbrim. it is so much less drying that others I have used . I had stopped using retinol because it was a bit to drying for my already dry skin this one is loaded with moisturizers and is the best of both worlds . it is is really nice packaging and is easy to use . I did not detect a scent but some reviewers are saying mild scent .&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample to try in order to make an informed review but my opinions are my own thanks for looking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few new samples lately and Foxbrim is the latest that was sent to me to test out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With sensitive skin and a preference for low-key fragrances, I used to think I was an oddity. Foxbrim completely catered to my tastes so I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m not as unusual as I once believed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim Retinol Moisturizer has a very simple smell to it. I don&#x27;t even want to call it a fragrance because that&#x27;s not really what it is. It&#x27;s not frilly or floral. Not even pungent. It&#x27;s just simple and since I&#x27;m applying it close to my nose (and am not a fan of strong scents) that by itself puts it above many products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is simple and clean. I use a dab about the size of a pea on each side of my face and similar amount on my forehead. It has a silky texture with no greasy feel to it. It absorbs well and made my skin feel nice but didn&#x27;t leave a heavy feeling like some moisturizers do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some products tend to make me break out with small blemishes but this one did not. The suggested retail price ($80) seems a bit steep but it has been &amp;#34;on sale&amp;#34; every time I&#x27;ve looked it up. The sale price (currently under $18) makes it an absolute steal in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a moisturizer that isn&#x27;t too fragrant, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling and absorbs well, this is a great one to try.</li>
            <li> Well i just arrived a few days ago so i really can&#x27;t give any reviews about this .&lt;br /&gt;  cherrie</li>
            <li> It is helping to exfoliate, hooray, I&#x27;ve been given this cream to review and am pleased with the results so far.</li>
            <li> I first ordered this for my husband.  His face is extremely sensitive and breaks out easily, so finding the right moisturizer for him is difficult.  This product never claims to be noncomedogenic, so we knew there was a good chance he couldn&#x27;t use it.  After a couple of days, it came to me.  I have had no problem with clogged pores from this product.  AND, in a very short time, the DEEP wrinkles I had near my jaw (from looking down) are REMARKABLY less.  I can&#x27;t even get over it.  I&#x27;ve been fighting those bad boys for a decade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this only once a day instead of twice, and only for about 5 days.  It&#x27;s going to be an amazing product.  I received a discount for honestly reviewing it, and am glad I did.  But, at full price, with a *money back guarantee,* what&#x27;s to go wrong?  If, like me, you&#x27;re looking for a solution to those pesky hard-to-lose wrinkles, give it a try!  And, honestly, at this price...it&#x27;s a great deal, anyway.</li>
            <li> By far the best vitamin A topical&lt;br /&gt;treatment I&#x27;ve invested in.  You&lt;br /&gt;get the same professional results&lt;br /&gt;gradually over time minus the&lt;br /&gt;irritation.  The key ingredient here&lt;br /&gt;aside from vitamin A is phospholipids.&lt;br /&gt;As a licensed esthetician I&#x27;ve learned&lt;br /&gt;that phospholipids are encapsulated&lt;br /&gt;vehicles designed to transport nutrients&lt;br /&gt;straight to our underlying skin cells&lt;br /&gt;and release them overtime to ensure&lt;br /&gt;quality and effectiveness without risking&lt;br /&gt;irritation to the surrounding skin.  So even&lt;br /&gt;though ingredient percentages&lt;br /&gt;are important, they are rendered useless if&lt;br /&gt;no scientific means of delivery like phospho-&lt;br /&gt;lipids are being used to encapsulate these&lt;br /&gt;vitamins.  So I give this product a full five&lt;br /&gt;stars for the ensured quality and effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;backed by their incorporated technology in&lt;br /&gt;delivering the right ingredients to where it&lt;br /&gt;matters the most for true skin correction.</li>
            <li> Great consistency. I love to use products with retinol, because unlike retinoid a, they do the same job, just that retinol does not irritate you skin, or make it peel. Its very safe to use, and if you consistant you start noticing great benefits. This one absorbs quickly into you skin, i would recommend using it at night, since the sun can cause retinol to become inactive. im a firm believer that if you want great skin, you have to start young and be consistant. This moiturizer does a great job. These are my honest opinions on trying this product. I thinks its fantastic.</li>
            <li> This cream is a better moisturizer than my previous one. It is thick but does not break my skin out. I have noticed an improvement in my skin after just a week. Will keep using.</li>
            <li> When I got this I was excited. More and more products are coming out with anti-aging ingredients. This is my first moisturizer with Retinol that says it will not cause dryness to the face.&lt;br /&gt;When I initially tried the product I was not able to get any product out. I pumped it forever and nothing was happening. I thought there was a tube suppose to be in there reaching to the bottom of the container. I opened it and didn&#x27;t note any tube inside. I messaged the company and they notified me that their container is an airless pump which means as you pump it the bottom rises and pushes the product up and out. After opening and re-closing it, I pumped a few more times and it finally worked.&lt;br /&gt;The company was really helpful, and to me customer service says a lot when you are communicating with a Brand and they can advise you quickly and efficiently. In case this happens to you, just be sure the top is screwed on tightly, I think that was the issue at the time..&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to the product!&lt;br /&gt;I think the cream is the perfect consistency and it does not cause any sensitivity or irritation. I am sure to use sunscreen with this as well. It is smooth and quick absorbing. There is no scent either. If you are sensitive to scents this could possibly be something you may want to look in to.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this for review, however this does not effect my thoughts and opinions.</li>
            <li> I got it yesterday and i could not push it to make the cream come out&lt;br /&gt;it does not have small tube to push out the cream&lt;br /&gt;I have to use my little finger to deep it in to use the cream</li>
            <li> I like it, its non greasy and leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not heavy. I haven&#x27;t had any break outs since using it. I have pretty normal skin but sometimes moisturizers upset the balance of my skin and this is not the case with this item.</li>
            <li> A heavily moisturizing face product that makes my skin soft and stays hydrated!</li>
            <li> FEELS GREAT ON THE FACE I AM HAPPY WITH IT</li>
            <li> Moisturizes without feeling greasy, wonderful ingredients, and with a lovely light smell. I&#x27;m 30 so I want to help my fine lines, but I don&#x27;t want to have shall we say... Old lady smell. You know the one I&#x27;m talking about. Some night creams reek of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Foxbrim doesn&#x27;t. It has a light smell that you barely notice, it sinks in to your skin and POOF, disappears. No greasiness, no nastiness, and doesn&#x27;t give me a migraine, and for that, I am thankful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Foxbrim! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> I use this everyday and love it! Highly recommended. I think my skin texture has improved. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Whoo Hoo!!!&lt;br /&gt;Another serum with Aloe and...yes yes...you guessed it! Vitamin C! I know, I know.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m too excited. But seriously, it&#x27;s a radical freeing, antioxident...for your face! Well, this one is particularly for under your eyes but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ok if it gets on your cheek. The word &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34; is on there after all. Lol. It&#x27;s a serum to fight wrinkles and dark circles. It&#x27;s like lotion for your eyes to help lighten and youthfulize (yup, made up my own word) your skin.&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no funky smell or sticky residue after using this. In fact, I use it in the morning before putting on makeup. I don&#x27;t have wrinkles yet, or dark circles, but I figured it couldn&#x27;t help to get on top of the situation before it starts. I&#x27;ll try to stay as youthful looking as possible (since I plan on acting that way) ;)&lt;br /&gt;Is this enough to say it&#x27;s your daily dose of Vitamin C? Why no...but a little extra here and there doesn&#x27;t hurt either.&lt;br /&gt;And if you want to reduce wrinkles and lighten up sun spots, I suggest getting the Best Facial Serum and trying it out for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free with the rule of giving my honest opinion when finished...This was pretty cool! Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> I tried “Youthful Radiance Eye Cream” by Foxbrim before but this time I applied “Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer” from this brand.I tell you what, both of them were great. “Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer” has a little pump which needed a bit patience to start working! but after a few seconds it starts pumping and just a bit of this light cream is enough to moisturize. Although this moisturizer is very rich and creamy but not greasy, absorbs quickly into my skin for deep hydration. It left my skin very moist, smooth for almost whole day. I liked it because it left my skin very smooth and hydrate. Besides my make up set nicely over this moisturizer which is one another good point about it. I think it’s not only because of its quick absorption but also because it is a light weight and works great under BB cream.</li>
            <li> ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients. No parabens or additives.  Now that’s the part I like, and I also like that this product has not tested on animals, and if you feel about animals the way I do that’s nice to know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are you doing to fight the signs of aging that is so noticeable? Now’s the time to do something for yourself, to fortify and enrich your marvelous skin. Ladies this is the only one we have so let&#x27;s take care of it.  Get the best and don&#x27;t settle for less, and of course reap the benefits, and most of the time the benefits are the ones you love smiling at you, and you can read it in their eyes and smile when they look at you.  Ahhhhh  I totally love that feeling.  Nope not disappointed in this product at all.</li>
            <li> I recently had the opportunity to use and review Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer through Tomoson. As you know many of the products I review are supplied through Tomoson and they have supplied me with some fantastic products, this moisturizer is no exception. First it&#x27;s important to know that I&#x27;m 45 and I have begun to see fine lines, especially around my eyes and mouth. It&#x27;s distressing looking in the mirror and not seeing the same girl that is in my heart. This moisturizer is helping me find this girl again. I&#x27;ve been using it now for over two weeks and I can feel a difference in my skin, it is not nearly as dry. The creamy moisturizer goes on without feeling oily and it is absorbed quickly. I love that I can use it without having my makeup slide off after applying it. I also love that it contains organic ingredients and it isn&#x27;t tested on animals. Additionally, Foxbrim offers a 100% money-back guarantee if you aren&#x27;t satisfied with their product. The only thing missing in this formula is a sunscreen. I think that would be great because it would eliminate a step to my beauty routine. Please give this product a try, you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money, no effect on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love how soft and firm it leaves my skin.goes on creamy and thick but absorbs quickly.winter weathers bad on your skin but its baby soft after a week of using this.it comes packaged well and ships quickly.foxbrim is top notch and will be my skin care from now on.great custiomer service as well.</li>
            <li> This is one of the lightest moisturizers I have ever used. It&#x27;s light scent is perfect for my sensitive skin and it leaves my skin perfectly hydrated and healthy feeling. I have used other Foxbrim products and they deliver results every time. This is no exception. My skin is brighter and more even. My worry lines, developing crows feet, and dark circles are beginning to completely disappear, and it looks radiant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the moisturizer less for what lines I already have than to prevent new fine lines or wrinkles from forming. It is easy on my sensitive skin and works great! My skin feels tighter and looks bright and vibrant. I feel younger when I use this moisturizer because it looks younger. This moisturizer is thick and creamy, yet goes on light leaving the perfect amount of moisture in my skin. The pump is convenient and I use just one pump to cover my whole face and neck. I use this mostly at night, but often both in the morning and night, but I am better at remembering it at night. I love this moisturizer and it&#x27;s made by a reliable brand.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try out another one of Foxbrim&#x27;s products when I got this one. First, the pump wasn&#x27;t very good. It took WAY too many pumps to get out enough product to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I was able to get the product out, I liked that it wasn&#x27;t really scented heavily and when I used it, it didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy like some of these products do. I also find that some of the products with retinol dry me out and that&#x27;s not fun for my dry skin areas. This one did not cause any excessive drying of my skin. I really do like this as a night-time moisturizer. Now, on the anti-aging topic, I honestly don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkling YET so I can&#x27;t really say that I saw a noticeable change in that. I&#x27;m all about preventing the wrinkles from ever happening so I am being proactive with my skin. I think this is helping my quest to stay forever young since it is a decent moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I read the wonderful reviews and thought this would be the perfect product for me. First of all, the pump feature did not work, so had to shake it out. Now, after only a couple of weeks, the product is almost completely gone, so there hasn&#x27;t been enough time to determine if it has had a positive effect. A total waste of money in my opinion....surely there is something better on the market.</li>
            <li> One thing I learned at an early age is make sure my skin stays moisturized. I use a moisturizer in the morning and evening. What I like about the Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer, is that it is made with ONLY 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients. No parabens or additives. Not tested on animals. Everything you’ve come to expect from Foxbrim. That is a few reasons why I love Foxbrim!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer absorbs into the skin easily and doesn’t leave a greasy feeling like some moisturizers do. I love how it makes my skin look and feel so healthy and smooth. This will help keep their skin looking moisturized, plump and younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I’d recommend this product to anyone looking for some help with aging or wrinkles. Or if your just looking for a great everyday moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love everything about this moisturizer and the way it makes my skin feel. I love that this moisturizer is very light which helps it to sink into my skin absorbing almost instantly. After application you will feel your skin noticeably tighter; this is normal. This is the moisturizer&#x27;s way of telling you it is working. I also love that it comes in a pump bottle for two reasons. One being that you won&#x27;t waste product because you control how much product comes out of the bottle and two, because unlike other moisturizers where you have to dip your fingers into the product, with this product you will not run into that problem. You will not have to worry about contaminating your face or your moisturizer and can always rest assured that each application of the product is clean and free of germs and bacteria. I also love that the company states that they ONLY use 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients. No parabens or additives. Not tested on animals. Everything you&#x27;ve come to expect from Foxbrim. I highly recommend this product to everyone looking for a great anti-aging moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of  Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim  to review for my blog. My mother is in her late 60’s and was excited to try the moisturizer after reading about all the benefits. The container has a pump on the top which is perfect for dispensing the right amount and keeping the moisturizer sanitary. It absorbs quickly into the skin and has a very light scent. My mother loves how it makes her skin feel after she puts it on her face. It does not leave her skin feeling greasy at all, just soft and supple. She has not experienced any flakes, dryness, or irritation from the Retinol, the 1% Retinol seems to be gentle on her skin. She is really happy with the results and will continue using Foxbrim products. She is also using Foxbrim’s Youthful Radiance Eye Cream.</li>
            <li> I love Foxbrim&#x27;s products, they are always great and this one is no exception. For those of us that are always busy I know a lengthy skincare regimen might not always be possible, so multi-purposed products are our best bet. The Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer takes the place of a serum, targeted treatment, and a moisturizer saving us a few steps. This moisturizer has added retinol and antioxidants to target the visible signs of aging and to keep our skin looking healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin A: Will gently exfoliate the skin from the inside out making it look for youthful and radiant. When using a product that uses Vitamin A always wear a sunscreen and let your Esthetician know before getting any chemical peels! Retinoids degrade in sunlight, so use this moisturizer at night right before bedtime so you can get the most out of this moisturizer!&lt;br /&gt;Jojoba Oil: The closest natural oil to your skin&#x27;s own sebum, this oil works great with your skin to deeply hydrate without clogging your pores.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe: A natural moisturizer and anti-inflammatory agent, Aloe will soothe and hydrate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This is a light moisturizer and it sinks into my skin almost immediately&lt;br /&gt;It leaves absolutely no residue on my skin&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels noticeably tighter after using this moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;I like that this moisturizer comes in a pump so you don&#x27;t have to dig your fingers in a jar and contaminate the whole moisturizer&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks much brighter and feels baby soft&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This is a very lightweight moisturizer, so if you suffer from extremely dry skin this may not be enough moisture for you. This would still be a great treatment for anti-aging, just add a heavier moisturizer on top.&lt;br /&gt;This has absolutely no scent to it, for me</li>
            <li> I heard about this product from a lady at work, and figured this is something I could benefit from.  I am a 25 year old man, and have always had terrible dry skin, and have extremely sensitive skin.  This is a light and airy cream, that goes on and absorbs seamlessly.  This product has left my skin feeling firm and full, and over all moisturized.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying products from Foxbrim, and I got two products to review from them the moisturizer and the youthful radiance eye cream!  I must say I am pretty impressed so far! When you have a product as well as this product is plus all the organic natural ingredents, you can&#x27;t go wrong. I can&#x27;t always use organic usually because of pricing issues, but I found this to be pretty competitive among competitors pricing at just $17.95 (current Amazon pricing) I love that I can read the ingredients list and know what they are and have heard of them before. There aren&#x27;t 45 letter words that are just chemicals. Some listed ingredients include; Aloe Vera, Sunflower oil, Palm oil, Vitamin E, Jojoba oil, Green tea and Shea butter. When you put all these fabulous ingredients together you have one amazing skin care cream moisturizer I&#x27;ve been using this moisturizer for a couple of weeks and I&#x27;ve really been enjoying it! This moisturizer is creamy and rich. I have combination/oily skin, and this did not make me feel too oily throughout the day. I put it on after my serum and before my primer. The product does not ball up whatsoever - instead it blends in smoothly and completely. I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-aging claims, since I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I really like what it&#x27;s done so far. I love that it&#x27;s made with all organic and natural ingredients and has a money-back guarantee</li>
            <li> the tube inside the unit is lost somewhere in the container so every time I use it I have to pretty much pound it into my hand.  I guess the product is ok so far other than that disappointment</li>
            <li> Reviewing after 1 week because of email request from Foxbrim. Not enough time to really fall in love with a face product. Today it is just ok!</li>
            <li> Other Retinol products are just too strong for my skin.  This cream seems to be the right strength &amp; mix.  It is light &amp; I can use it day &amp; night.  Make-up goes on smoothly for me.  I have no after-effects, no stinging or redness.  Foxbrim products are the best!  I did receive this for a reduced price for an honest opinion.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Foxbrim has become a dependable source of beauty products for me. The bottle seems small, but one pump is all you need, and my bottle has been providing me with an amazing product for over a month now! My pores look amazing, and my skin has definitely firmed up- which was concern for me as I have been loosing weight over the past several years and felt that I had some droop as a result. I am no longer self conscience when I look in the mirror or go out in public! While I still have the occasional break outs, I know my active lifestyle in hot Arizona is the major contributor, and other than washing my face more times a day than I ever could, I will have to deal with this until the fall. Because I live in AZ, I use this as a night cream, as retinol can cause sensitivity to the sun. I have had no ill results of using this moisturizer, and I have sensitive skin. I will definitely keep this product in my line up of preventative and maintaining healthy skin!</li>
            <li> Love this product great will buy again .I have only been using for a couple weeks and can already tell a difference.my skin looks much younger.smoother and you cannot see my pores at all now</li>
            <li> First off, I received this Product quicker than I expected and in perfect condition. The Retinol Cream &amp; Moisturizer is a lightweight cream, goes on smoothly and leaves my face both looking and feeling refreshed, so smooth and soft, I love it. Since I have started using this cream, my face has a new glow to it, leaving my face younger -looking as well as healthy. I have NO complaints!! I am confident that I now have a new addition to my daily beauty-care routine, thanks to the convenient pump that allows for easy application.</li>
            <li> This Retinol Cream Moisturizer is absorbed quickly and leaves no sheen or oily residue at all, the skin absorbs it all evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I have dry skin and this moisturizer is not dense/ rich enough to hydrate my skin, however, I still use it as it&#x27;s ingredients are wonderful and my skin feels nourished afterwards; I apply a heavier moisturizer afterwards to help hydrate and combat my dry skin type.&lt;br /&gt;This cream has no fragrance added, which is a big plus to me.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a promotional sample of this item, in return for my objective and genuine opinion.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer works for me. I have oily skin and it has been difficult finding moisturizers that did not add to my skin issues. I have been making a lot of mistakes with my skin because it is oil. For instance, and my biggest mistake had been using a cleanser that dried out my skin. It became even more oil, patch and limp. After replacing my cleanser and going ALL NATURAL, I need a moisturizer to fix my errors. This retinol cream was that. It brought my youth back into my skin. I could go a whole day and not worry too much about having incredibly oily skin. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while and it&#x27;s has smoothed out my skin, clear up so bothersome acne scars and my face seems more plump. My trick is too use a dab. I use to use too much and it actually had negative effects, so use a little bit on your skin. Although, it&#x27;s meant to clear pores, it can clog it with overuse.</li>
            <li> Deeply moisturizing retinol cream.  I love how it was very quenching to my pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only complaint is that the product is wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap - it was a pill to unravel all the bubbles.</li>
            <li> Not too oily. Very silly feel.</li>
            <li> You have to try!!I love Foxbrim&#x27;s products, they are always great and this one is no exception. For those of us that are always busy I know a lengthy skincare regimen might not always be possible, so multi-purposed products are our best bet. The Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer takes the place of a serum, targeted treatment, and a moisturizer saving us a few steps. This moisturizer has added retinol and antioxidants to target the visible signs of aging and to keep our skin looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product ~~ Does exactly as it says in listing ~~ I love it and planning on telling friends and family about this product.</li>
            <li> I like this cream a lot I have been using it in the morning with a vitamin c serum and a good spf moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The cream is a little heavy so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne prone skin and it does not seem to be effecting my acne at all (not making me break out).</li>
            <li> Great daily facial mosturizer. I could definitely notice a tightening of the skin after using for just a few days. It&#x27;s non greasy and hydrates my skin well. There is a faint chemical smell to it when you first squeeze it out that I didn&#x27;t care for, but it does fade off quickly. I am happy to recieve this item to review.</li>
            <li> this by far is the best product ive used in a long time i have tried many other products and never have got any results until now</li>
            <li> This leaves my face so soft, I use it twice a day and there is a noticeable difference in my skin after a couple weeks. The Vitamin A gives you a softer brighter complexion. For more information on this product please view my blog review at http://beautynproducts.wordpress.com/2014/09/08/foxbrim-anti-aging-moisturizer-and-retinol-cream/</li>
            <li> Love it! absorbs quickly, non greasy and really moisturizes your skin!</li>
            <li> This is the first time trying out this brand and i liked it alot. This retinol cream made my face feel tightened with the first use. I was also plesently happy with the scent, it didnt smell bad at all. It was more of a suddle scent. Which i enjoyed because i dont like products with an overbearing smell. Also i thought t felt light weight when applied to my skin. I have added this to my daily routine and would suggest you give it a shot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free - for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers</li>
            <li> Foxbrim has created a complete anti-aging moisturizer that has Vitamin A (that is what Retinol is, folks) in it - 1% Retinol which is the desired amount in non-prescription products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Foxbrim Anti-Aging Moisturizer with Vitamin A for about two weeks now - morning and evening. I cleanse my face and then apply a serum followed by a moisturizer. I found the Foxbrim Anti-Aging Moisturizer to be a light, creamy product that feels nice and makes a good base for applying makeup. I also found on days when I did not wear makeup that the serum plus moisturizer was nice. The cream comes in a pump bottle and it is easy to dispense the amount you desire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally prefer a heavier, creamier moisturizer but would not hesitate to use the Foxbrim Anti-Aging during warmer weather when a heavier moisturizer feels a bit too much here in the hot, humid South. I do feel that I can recommend this product and really like that it is basically organic in origin.</li>
            <li> Very good results for me using as directed. This company has wonderful customer service! I will purchase again if not Sold Out!</li>
            <li> There are facial moisturizers and then there are facial moisturizers that replenish, restore, treat, and rebuild our skin. Here is that product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer by Foxbrim is a 1% Retinol moisturizer that is gentle for the most sensitive of skins and yet a powerful formula that will have you seeing results in days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever tried Retinol you know Retinol is not always friendly to work with. It can cause dryness, irritation, and even flakiness. Foxbrim has a pure 1% Retinol formula alongside soothing enriched natural antioxidants like Vitamin A to give you all the benefits of Retinol without the downtime. You simply have all the benefits of collagen building, pore unclogging, acne clearing, discoloration healing and simply radiant skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am loving this gentle powerhouse of 100% organic and natural ingredients. It is just a superior product with no additives or parabens. Plus they do not test of animals. And you are a lover of pets you know that is just as important as the ingredients within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So trust, prepare for your skin transformation, and order today for your answer to truly beautiful skin.</li>
            <li> When I first heard of Fox Brim I was excited. I like trying out new products, especially if they work! Well, this one certainly did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all on my skin, and it soaked in wonderfully without any caking or messiness. It didn&#x27;t stick to my fingers when applying and I was able to notice a difference after using it a few times. My skin looks more supple and enlightened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really easy to use, doesn&#x27;t have an overbearing smell and works great. What more could you want?! Well, I can sweeten it even more because they do not test on animals AND they use only natural and organic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is totally amazing!</li>
            <li> I really enjoy using this Anti-Aging Moisturizer. I’m in my early 30’s and it’s time to start fighting those signs of aging. I’m starting to get fine lines around my nose, mouth and eyes. I really like how this moisturizer is really thick and creamy. It spreads evenly on my face with just one pump. Only having to use one pump this product will last a little while. The moisturizer quickly absorbs into my skin. It doesn’t leave any oily residue like some moisturizers can. My skin stays refreshed and moisturized all day. I’ve been using this moisturizer for almost a month now and my skin is balanced and hydrated. I feel that this moisturizer will help combat those fine lines with long term use. I also like that it doesn’t have a fragrance. I’m allergic to certain fragrances and I didn’t have to worry about a fragrance triggering my allergies.</li>
            <li> Retinol simply cannot be beat for reducing lines on the face. ( I am not even imagining it, I have read medical studies on it!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product, and very quickly I was able to notice a reduction in the lines on my face. I have sensitive skin, but never had any burning or itching from using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also didn&#x27;t have any break outs. I was very pleased with the results and will be happy to have this in my medicine cabinet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much for the sample product for review on my blog.</li>
            <li> My wife was happy to get this product for free to try out. She didn&#x27;t pay for it, but she is happy to know (if she buys more) the product has a money back guarantee. She also loves the fact that it is made out of all natural ingredients. I love the fact that it does not have one of those scents that make me sneeze. Many beauty products make me sneeze and have an allergy attack. This one does not. My wife does not see any anti-age changes yet, but she has only used it for a little while. She does notice that this moisturizer does moisturize her skin, making it softer and healthier looking. She loves this product and will continue to use it to see all the other benefits it has in store.</li>
            <li> there was very little product in the bottle.</li>
            <li> LOVED IT!!!! Works to make my skin fell aoft smoothe and look 100% rejuventaed. You will noty be sorry this is an awesome product and I def recommend it!!!!</li>
            <li> Nothing spectacular.  It does make your skin soft.</li>
            <li> I loved this product and the way it made my skin feel!  Absolutely amazing.  I use it in the morning and at night and I wake up with a refreshed face.  Great product and I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Another Foxbrim product that works. I use this with their Vitamin C products to create an overall regimen of anti-aging. Goes on smooth, sinks in to get to work right away!</li>
            <li> Great product, definitely show some improves on my skin in just a couple of days. Smell very nice and the package is very well made!</li>
            <li> This is great for me for those pesky little lines that think they&#x27;re jumping on board now that I&#x27;m &amp;#34;in my forties&amp;#34; and works equally great on my two teens going through puberty.  I use it around my eyes and forehead, the kids use it on their t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to order more!</li>
            <li> Application: I found that the pump was a little hard to work; it would often take several pumps to dispense an appropriate amount of product. There was no noticeable fragrance. I mostly used it in the evenings since it doesn&#x27;t contain SPF and retinol can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. It applied easily without being too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Verdict: I did not notice any vast changes in the quality of my skin, but this relatively lightweight moisturizer was an easy addition to my skincare routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free.</li>
            <li> This retinol cream is amazing! I have already noticed a difference in the wrinkles on my forehead. Love it!</li>
            <li> This was a bit of a gamble for me because I have never used a moisturizer before. However, I have been using this for about a month, and I couldn&#x27;t have wished for better results and I am sk happy that I made the choice that I did. The moisturizer is so light and it absorbs into my skin super quickly...which is always a plus. Even after just a couple of days I noticed that my skin had a healthier glow to it and that it was super soft. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, and I can&#x27;t wait to try more of their products!</li>
            <li> Foxbrim was nice enough to send me a bottle of their Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer to review. I have reviewed a lot of different kinds of moisturizers in the past but I have to say that this is one of the top ones on my list. It is a rich and creamy moisturizer that goes on super smooth. Every morning before make up I would put this on and it would make a great base for my make up. Another plus for this moisturizer would be that it is made up of 100% natural and organic ingredients, with no parabens or additives. I am completely impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to try this since I have also tried their Hyaluronic Acid Serum and loved it so I already knew I would love the moisturizer as well.  It works great on my oily skin and I really LOVE that their products are 100% Natural and Organic Ingredients. No parabens or additives. Not tested on animals!</li>
            <li> Loving this product so far. It feels oil free and light on my face. Although I cannot see any major difference in the past two weeks of using it, I feel my face and is a little tighter and firmer.</li>
            <li> This product is creamy without being greasy or too thick; I would definitly recommend it! For a full review, visit: http://meghanmariesite.wordpress.com/2014/09/25/foxbrims-complete-anti-aging-moisturizer/</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any changes yet., But I am hoping to it seems to be a very nice product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Foxbrim Complete Anti-Aging Moisturizer every night for the past month. I find it a mild moisturizer, I did not experience any flaking, drying or skin irritation (like I usually do when adjusting to a new retinol). The moisturizer is light and absorbs well without leaving an oily feeling. My skin feels soft after application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer comes in a sleek pump container. At first,  I had a hard time getting it to dispense through the pump. Once I got it going, it has worked fine. One pump dispenses enough product for my face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Foxbrim: this product can be used morning or night, can be worn under makeup. I used it in the evening for a few reasons. First of all, it is important to wear a good, broad spectrum sunscreen during the day. Also, my understanding is that if the concentration of retinal is high enough to be effective than it may also make your skin a little more sun sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I enjoyed using this moisturizer each night for the past month. I found that it kept my skin soft and moist and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. As I have only been using it a month, I can&#x27;t really speak to the anti-aging benefits though I believe some of the ingredients can be effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a free sample of this product to review.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! It really does work. Highly recommend it..</li>
            <li> I really love this cream! I have recently been trying to find more natural products for my skin and rejoiced that I found one that also contained retinol. My skin is usually dry as the Sahara but not after using this product. By morning my skin still feels moisturized and looks radiant. The only complaint I have is with the bottle pump as it just forcefully squirts out the product and sometimes takes a few tries. I may have lost a bit of product fighting with it. However I wouldn&#x27;t change my rating since I want to rate the actual cream. Also the company was so wonderful to send me a replacement and refund my money when my 1st pump didn&#x27;t work at all. Great customer care with this company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fan number one of retinol creams. Can be used morning and night. But I prefer to use retinol only in the nights, because I have sensitive and fair skin and the contact with the sun irritates and hurts me. If you plan to use the cream in the day you only have to wear sunscreen. I absolutely love this moisturizer. It goes on very smoothly. With oily skin is so difficult to find creams that I can wear and also work for me. This cream anti-aging works perfectly in my skin. I highly recommend to try this brand.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
            <li> &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;TOP4fdc52d86efb4a245854bb67923a10cc&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;img style&#x3D;&amp;#34;display: none&amp;#34; src&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/images/front/pixel.png&amp;#34; &amp;#62;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this cream! It has no foul chemical smell like most of these kinds of creams do and the directions are simple and clear. The product came right on time and was packaged nicely. You should roll the bottle between your hands for about a minute or gently shake it for a few seconds before applying it to get everything back mixed up. I apply this day and night after toning my face with rosewater and its perfect under make up. It doesn&#x27;t burn which is also a plus and I still have a bunch left!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free using &amp;#60;a href&#x3D;&amp;#34;http://www.tomoson.com/?code&#x3D;BOTTOM4fdc52d86efb4a245854bb67923a10cc&amp;#34; rel&#x3D;&amp;#34;nofollow&amp;#34;&amp;#62;Tomoson.com&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
            <li> Maybe it is slow working, but I am starting to see results. Dark spots are fading and my skin appears smoother.</li>
            <li> Only slightly drying. Been using once a day for about 10 days. No improvement in skin yet...too soon to tell, but glad not irritating.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast but pump was broken, the quality of product was not what I expected. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer has everything you need in a moisturizer it leaves your skin so smooth and soft and at the same time enriching and restoring  your skin.This cream is not heavy on your skin at all ,after you apply you will see your skin more healthy looking and if you have dry skin you can feel how soft your face feels you will definitely love this moisturizer this is the one for me,you can&#x27;t go wrong with all the benfits it offers your skin</li>
            <li> They cream was nice. It left my face feeling more moisturized after a few days. All of my dry spots have cleared up.</li>
