            <li>No crustiness or discomfort, easy to apply, keeps eyeliner and shadows in place.</li>
            <li>Easy to put on</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth eye shadow applies easily.  </li>
            <li>the best part is you need VERY LITTLE...</li>
            <li>Well worth the money!</li>
            <li>and since then I purchased the full size product here on Amazon...</li>
            <li>...then I finish off with a quick press of a translucent powder to set everything...</li>
            <li>Even if it&#x27;s warm outside, it still holds up</li>
            <li>primer itself looks a bit different than what most of us are used to seeing...</li>
            <li>I grab first to apply...</li>
            <li>it never fails.</li>
            <li>The best i have ever use, just need a tiny bit, seriously very small amount, I don&#x27;t get creasing even on my lower lashes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Usually my eyelids would look like they needed to be dabbed with a Clean and Clear Oil Absorbing Sheet about 3-4 hours into my makeup application and now after using this brand</li>
            <li>and it seems to reasonably hold the powder in place and give it a smoother look.</li>
            <li>Really works to keep eye shadow from sticking in creases of lid.</li>
            <li>Really like this product and have bought refills.</li>
            <li>and then I close my eyes and gently tap, tap, tap on my eyelids (</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t soak in as fast so watch your shadow application timeframe.</li>
            <li>Just a little dab works great and the tube lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye primer because I&#x27;m getting older</li>
            <li>I went over a year before I needed a new one.</li>
            <li>anyhow, once I finish tapping my eyelids and generally have what feels to be no product left, I will do a quick tap on my forehead (right between my eyebrows in the TZone) and it actually helps to keep that area on the matte side...</li>
            <li>To be honest, the tube can go bad if not used  3x a week or more.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only review I have ever done because I just know there are others out there that were like me.</li>
            <li>WOW...</li>
            <li>so the rest of my face is au natural....</li>
            <li>its near colorless so</li>
            <li>it comes out looking like a white lotion vs the usual tinted appearance that most primers have...</li>
            <li>and it really does keep my makeup on ALL DAY LONG.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m light to medium tones, but such a small amount is required (pin head for both eyes) that it probably blends with all but the darkest of skins.  </li>
            <li>I actually put a bit of foundation on my lids before I use the primer...to be clear</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone longer actually and it does the job seamlessly.</li>
            <li>I put a small dab on my right hand middle finger</li>

            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of eye shadows but with this primer applied first, no more itchy eyes!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how long my eyelids stay &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and look matte...</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s why even the teensiest bit of product left on your fingers (even if you can&#x27;t see it) is quite helpful for other areas as well</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit.</li>
            <li> A little pricey but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> For as long as I can remember my makeup would sweat off of my eyes after just a few hours.</li>
            <li> I thought I had tried everything but decided to give this a try based on other reviews.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, and has a slight tint when it comes out of the tube but applies transparent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of brands over the years from L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s DeCrease and NYX&#x27;s High Definition Eye Shadow Base to Elf&#x27;s Eyelid Primer.</li>
            <li> you could also use as base cover for your trouble spots.</li>
            <li> I use it as a base for shimmery eyeliner along my lower lash line.  </li>
            <li> we have terrible humid summers in St Louis.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> seems to do the job, I use it on my eyelids and just under my eyes when doing smoky eye and it seems to reasonably hold the powder in place and give it a smoother look.</li>
            <li> I am sensitive to a lot of eye shadows but with this primer applied first, no more itchy eyes!! It&#x27;s a miracle product for me and I will continue using it. Just a little dab works great and the tube lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Helps my eye shadow stay on all day.</li>
            <li> The best i have ever use, just need a tiny bit, seriously very small amount, I don&#x27;t get creasing even on my lower lashes. This tube will last me forever.</li>
            <li> I used to only use Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion but that stopped working. After I switched to this I can now easily wear eye shadow for 12-14 hours. It&#x27;s non-greasy, and has a slight tint when it comes out of the tube but applies transparent. The tiny amount needed for each eye makes it so the one tube will last me months. Great product if you have sensitive eyes or if what you have just isn&#x27;t working for you. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m light to medium tones, but such a small amount is required (pin head for both eyes) that it probably blends with all but the darkest of skins.  Makes applying and keeping eye makeup on a breeze.  No crustiness or discomfort, easy to apply, keeps eyeliner and shadows in place.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best product I have purchased to stop shadow from creasing during the day.  I could not be happier.  Well worth the money!</li>
            <li> I have oily eyelids. This is the only product that works for me to keep my shadow from creasing. A little pricey but lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only review I have ever done because I just know there are others out there that were like me. For as long as I can remember my makeup would sweat off of my eyes after just a few hours. I thought I had tried everything but decided to give this a try based on other reviews. Love love love it. Easy to put on and it really does keep my makeup on ALL DAY LONG. My search is over and I will be sticking with Tarte for good.</li>
            <li> Really works to keep eye shadow from sticking in creases of lid.</li>
            <li> Really like this product and have bought refills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found my HG in an Eye Primer! I&#x27;ve tried a number of brands over the years from L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s DeCrease and NYX&#x27;s High Definition Eye Shadow Base to Elf&#x27;s Eyelid Primer. Of the three mentioned, NYX was the best BUT it still wasn&#x27;t the be all, end all for me...so I kept looking...I saw a gal on You Tube talking about a number of eye primers so I thought I&#x27;d see what she had to say...enter the 360 Creaseless 12 Hour Eye Primer from Tarte...WOW...I can&#x27;t believe how long my eyelids stay &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; and look matte...it&#x27;s incredible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually my eyelids would look like they needed to be dabbed with a Clean and Clear Oil Absorbing Sheet about 3-4 hours into my makeup application and now after using this brand it&#x27;s amazing how good my eyes look and feel for a good number of hours...actually I find that the Tarte 360 Creaseless 12 Hour Eye Primer lasts longer than 12 hours it touts! Even if it&#x27;s warm outside, it still holds up nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The primer itself looks a bit different than what most of us are used to seeing...it comes out looking like a white lotion vs the usual tinted appearance that most primers have...the best part is you need VERY LITTLE...I put a small dab on my right hand middle finger and then I take my left middle finger and dab them together so I have and equal amount of product on both fingers and then I close my eyes and gently tap, tap, tap on my eyelids (very lightly)...I actually put a bit of foundation on my lids before I use the primer...to be clear, I&#x27;ve worn this eye primer over my foundation as well as under it and I have had the same results either way...it&#x27;s just a matter of preference as to which I grab first to apply...I only use foundation on my forehead and eyelids because that&#x27;s where I tend to be a bit oily so the rest of my face is au natural....anyhow, once I finish tapping my eyelids and generally have what feels to be no product left, I will do a quick tap on my forehead (right between my eyebrows in the TZone) and it actually helps to keep that area on the matte side...there appears to be a minute amount left on my fingers because I tap and don&#x27;t rub my eyelids so that&#x27;s why even the teensiest bit of product left on your fingers (even if you can&#x27;t see it) is quite helpful for other areas as well...then I finish off with a quick press of a translucent powder to set everything...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought the Tarte eye primer from eBay in a sample sized tube just so I could try it without sinking money into a product I might not like...I&#x27;m glad I tried this primer and since then I purchased the full size product here on Amazon...this is one product I wouldn&#x27;t want to be without!</li>
            <li> Does what it says.  12 hr creaseless primer. I&#x27;ve gone longer actually and it does the job seamlessly. You only need a little bit. It spreads very easily. Doesn&#x27;t soak in as fast so watch your shadow application timeframe. To be honest, the tube can go bad if not used  3x a week or more. I went over a year before I needed a new one. Don&#x27;t care, this is my go to foreverrrrr</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a long time. it never fails. I used another product that has since gone away. we have terrible humid summers in St Louis. this as a primer for eye makeup makes what you put on last hours in steamy weather. that or menopause symptoms!! lol but true. you could also use as base cover for your trouble spots. if your trying to hide a blemish or face spot like freckle or birth mark, etc. its near colorless so whatever you put over this retains its own color.</li>
            <li> I use to use Urban Decay but this has no parabens.  Goes on smooth eye shadow applies easily.  Just love it!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  I use it as a base for shimmery eyeliner along my lower lash line.  It  stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Loved it.  I&#x27;ve been using another brand for several years. Glad I found this one.  I love the hint of pearl color and my eyeshadow stays set all day.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye primer because I&#x27;m getting older and this seems to smooth out you lids and does keep your shadow looking nice most of the day.</li>
            <li> This was just adding an extra step for me.  May work for you tho.</li>
