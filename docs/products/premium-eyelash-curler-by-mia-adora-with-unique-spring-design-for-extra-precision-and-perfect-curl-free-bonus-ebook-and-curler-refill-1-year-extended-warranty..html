            <li>sturdy eyelash curler with mild pinching.....</li>
            <li>I am lucky to have had the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li>I thought it did a good job of making my naturally long eyelashes pop.</li>
            <li>This curler is really good and curls the lashes without tugging at them and the curl stays all day long.</li>
            <li>I  love to shop and try new things.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied this complimentary product for review and I am very grateful to have a chance to provide my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li>The handles are gripped for better control and the padding is super soft to curl the lashes.</li>
            <li>Granted, this new curler is lighter in weight and more professional looking for sure.</li>
            <li>so when I was given the opportunity to try this out and give my opinion on it, I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>The springs seem to be able to hold up nicely so far from what I can see.</li>
            <li>Of course, when I told him I could amp it up if he took me somewhere nice, he balked and went back out to his man cave, but I digress...</li>
            <li>I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li>So, when I was offered a complimentary pair of eyelash curlers by Mia Adora, I jumped on the opportunity.</li>
            <li>Let me start by first saying, I simply am in love with my new eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>I only gave this product a 4 star because it stated that it was to come with an extra pad in which it did not , other wise I found this to be a good quality eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>You could either clean up with alcohol or you can clean the curler up and then put a new pad it.</li>
            <li>Here is where I really got excited.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for just the right mascara to give my eyelashes length and volume for years with no luck.</li>
            <li>Since I was going out and was already about to apply makeup, these  came right on time.  </li>
            <li>just right.  </li>
            <li>The curve is just right so that it doesn&#x27;t pinch the sides of your lid.  </li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to be able to get a complimentary Mia Adora eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>received this at little or at no cost to me to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I have done!!</li>
            <li>Receiving this curler from Mia Adora brought back my good memories with my old curler.</li>
            <li>She like the spring action which makes it easy to handle</li>
            <li>I have used them a few times and the more I use them the more I like them.</li>
            <li>I received a chance to review the Eyelash Curler by Mia Adora - Premium Quality with Unique Spring Design for Extra Precision &amp; Perfect Curl - Use with Natural, False Eyelashes or 3D Fiber Lash Mascara - Free BONUS ebook &amp; Curler Refill - 1 Year Extended Warranty!</li>
            <li>I honestly used an eyelash curler last when I was in high school.-</li>
            <li>It also came with extra padding for you that isa huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
            <li>I was pleased when I was given the chance to evaluate during a recent promotion.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no pinching or pulling and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for months now and continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it comes with an extra set of curler refills .</li>
            <li>Perhaps if I curled my lashes on a daily basis, I might appreciate the comfort of this a bit more, than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>at first.</li>
            <li>When you first curl your lashes, this does wonders.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny..</li>
            <li>In addition to the extra parts, I received a instruction guide by email that gave me all the latest tips from how to use the curler to highlighting and filling my brows.</li>
            <li>When I first got my curler</li>
            <li>My first time trying the lash curler when I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li>and I loved the firm grip I had with the curler.</li>
            <li>That is seriously awesome because those things get super dirty when you use the eyelash curler as much as me (basically every day).</li>
            <li>I actually will wear it one night, not wash the fibers off, and reapply the next day, and they look Sooo good.</li>
            <li>I recently ordered this eyelash curler and am absolutely loving it so far.</li>
            <li>and I usually have to put on mascara in order to get a good look.</li>
            <li>The curler came packaged well in easy to open see through packaging.</li>
            <li>If youâ€™re looking for an easy way to learn how to use an eyelash curler to get lash curls, the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler is definitely it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine why not, and I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to use it on</li>
            <li>I have blonde, kind of short eyelashes, and I love the full, black lushness the fibers give me.</li>
            <li>few of the things I like most about this product is that it comes with extra grip pads and 1 replacement pad, equipped with a spring in the handle for easy use, comes with a 1 year warranty and is backed by a 100% product satisfaction guarantee!</li>
            <li>Her eyelashes got a nice curve and even looked a little thicker.</li>
            <li>While this eyelash curler was more comfortable than others I&#x27;ve used due to the rubber inside of the finger grips, I did not notice any significant improvement in the curling of my lashes over any other curler.  </li>
            <li>It makes my eyelashes appear so much fuller.  </li>
            <li>When you place your lashes in the curler, and gently squeeze, there is no pain in the eye area.</li>
            <li>make my stick straight lashes curl and not scrape against the lenses of my glasses like they do if I don&#x27;t curl them.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it has made my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li>I appreciated the PDF with tips and tricks that I received after purchasing.  </li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so I do not use them much</li>
            <li>I love the pink and gold tone colors.</li>
            <li>This is a really preium quality eye lash curler and priced well.  </li>
            <li>They are made really well.</li>
            <li>They ebook is very helpful as well.</li>
            <li>My experience was pain free and my lashes got curled in an instant.</li>
            <li>The rubber on the finger part is a really nice feature and makes it cozy on your fingers when using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It didnt snag my lashes and they curled VERY well.</li>
            <li>I would definitively recommend this to anyone who wants fuller looking lashes.</li>
            <li>It opened nicely and big enough to get my eye lashes in there.</li>
            <li>I have been getting compliments left and right!</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m really liking this!</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, my eye lashes have thinned.</li>
            <li>I wiuld highly recomend this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The spring action really helps to control what I am doing.  </li>
            <li>I really wanted to focus on the curler&#x27;s action and not care about my makeup .</li>
            <li>It took me a few times to get used to using it, but I love it now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never loved them more, than right now using this curler.</li>
            <li>I have super long lashes</li>
            <li>Curling my eyelashes is rather new to me.  </li>
            <li>I also got some new ideas from the booklet.</li>
            <li>The first photo is the one I did not use the Mia Adora eyelash curler and the second photo</li>
            <li>If you noticed in the first pic I have not used the curler therefore my lashes are not curled and laying flat.</li>
            <li>This curler is certainly not cheaply made in any way - the metal is solid, the rubber is soft and stays where it belongs, and like I already mentioned, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>The lash curler comes in this clear packaging that I kinda wish have some form of note card or something with instructions.</li>
            <li>I just recieved these and was expecting just another eyelash curler ( which I needed as my old one broke)</li>
            <li>The soft padding prevents my eyelashes from sticking when released from the lashes.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with these curlers.</li>
            <li>curler is well shaped soft hold .not</li>
            <li>how far I put my thumb in there or it would get stuck.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>This makes my lashes much longer and fuller than regular mascara.  </li>
            <li>This came with a soft cushion that you use to curl your eyelashes with, as well as cushions for your fingers as well.</li>
            <li>I had my young friend Jacie come over and model for the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler.</li>
            <li>not heavy at all...</li>
            <li>I was totally surprised</li>
            <li>It lifts the lashes and curls at the same time, and when I use mascara afterwards it really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li>i am actually surprised at how well it works.</li>
            <li>My precious curler wasn&#x27;t gentle enough on my lashes, but at least my lashes stayed curled.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging, it&#x27;s easy to use, and there is a lot less mess involved with this fiber lash mascara than with other versions of this type of product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The ergonomic design makes it easy to include every lash for curling and does not leave a mark or dent where it rests upon my lids/brow bone, nor does it scratch me from resting in place while I curl my lashes as others I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>The pink and black color scheme is absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect such a relatively inexpensive tool to be the one that made the birds sing, but there ya go.</li>
            <li>Even when you purchase the big named brand ones they really fall short and somehow I either get a eye lash pulled or it pinches.</li>
            <li>loved how big I could get my lashes to look without having to use fake lashes, just by using this lash curler.</li>
            <li>I like that it comes with an extra little pad so that you can have a clean one to change</li>
            <li>I was expecting super dramatic, and I&#x27;m sure if I continued the steps like they suggest, I could really amp it up to get super thick, full, long, false looking eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with this product at a significant discount for review purposes.hes to have a little bit more impact hiding behind my glasses, and this definitely does the trick.  </li>
            <li>You can get a range of length from everyday to stunning full thick long lashes!</li>
            <li>Now, this is the bare minimum coat of the magnifying gel mascara with just one or two passes of the fiber lashes.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple natural look for an on the go</li>
            <li>Also included was (2) more padding replacements for the finger holes as well as another pink pad for the part that curls the lashes, it prevents the curler from cutting off lashes and can be taken off to clean</li>
            <li>I almost expected the results to be SO dramatic that it would be overkill to wear out without going somewhere super fancy and wearing a face full of makeup.  </li>
            <li>I especially like how it has soft plastic lining on the bar where the eyelashes rest, that seems to give my lashes extra &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>little pink cushion is a nice little feminine design touch.</li>
            <li>When I went to crimp them down it was soft not hard.</li>
            <li>I have fairly long eye lashes you could say, but the problem is they don&#x27;t have much of a natural curl to them.</li>
            <li>The spring makes it easier to use than most curlers because I  always remember feeling like I had to press really hard with typical curlers to get the results I wanted</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am lucky to have had the opportunity to review this product.</li>
            <li> I thought it did a good job of making my naturally long eyelashes pop.</li>
            <li> This curler is really good and curls the lashes without tugging at them and the curl stays all day long.</li>
            <li> I  love to shop and try new things.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied this complimentary product for review and I am very grateful to have a chance to provide my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> The handles are gripped for better control and the padding is super soft to curl the lashes.</li>
            <li> Granted, this new curler is lighter in weight and more professional looking for sure.</li>
            <li> so when I was given the opportunity to try this out and give my opinion on it, I figured it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> The springs seem to be able to hold up nicely so far from what I can see.</li>
            <li> Of course, when I told him I could amp it up if he took me somewhere nice, he balked and went back out to his man cave, but I digress...</li>
            <li> I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> So, when I was offered a complimentary pair of eyelash curlers by Mia Adora, I jumped on the opportunity.</li>
            <li> Let me start by first saying, I simply am in love with my new eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I only gave this product a 4 star because it stated that it was to come with an extra pad in which it did not , other wise I found this to be a good quality eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> You could either clean up with alcohol or you can clean the curler up and then put a new pad it.</li>
            <li> Here is where I really got excited.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for just the right mascara to give my eyelashes length and volume for years with no luck.</li>
            <li> Since I was going out and was already about to apply makeup, these  came right on time.  </li>
            <li> just right.  </li>
            <li> The curve is just right so that it doesn&#x27;t pinch the sides of your lid.  </li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to get a complimentary Mia Adora eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> received this at little or at no cost to me to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I have done!!</li>
            <li> Receiving this curler from Mia Adora brought back my good memories with my old curler.</li>
            <li> She like the spring action which makes it easy to handle</li>
            <li> I have used them a few times and the more I use them the more I like them.</li>
            <li> I received a chance to review the Eyelash Curler by Mia Adora - Premium Quality with Unique Spring Design for Extra Precision &amp; Perfect Curl - Use with Natural, False Eyelashes or 3D Fiber Lash Mascara - Free BONUS ebook &amp; Curler Refill - 1 Year Extended Warranty!</li>
            <li> I honestly used an eyelash curler last when I was in high school.-</li>
            <li> It also came with extra padding for you that isa huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I was pleased when I was given the chance to evaluate during a recent promotion.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no pinching or pulling and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for months now and continue to be pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it comes with an extra set of curler refills .</li>
            <li> Perhaps if I curled my lashes on a daily basis, I might appreciate the comfort of this a bit more, than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> at first.</li>
            <li> When you first curl your lashes, this does wonders.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny..</li>
            <li> In addition to the extra parts, I received a instruction guide by email that gave me all the latest tips from how to use the curler to highlighting and filling my brows.</li>
            <li> When I first got my curler</li>
            <li> My first time trying the lash curler when I looked in the mirror</li>
            <li> and I loved the firm grip I had with the curler.</li>
            <li> That is seriously awesome because those things get super dirty when you use the eyelash curler as much as me (basically every day).</li>
            <li> I actually will wear it one night, not wash the fibers off, and reapply the next day, and they look Sooo good.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this eyelash curler and am absolutely loving it so far.</li>
            <li> and I usually have to put on mascara in order to get a good look.</li>
            <li> The curler came packaged well in easy to open see through packaging.</li>
            <li> If youâ€™re looking for an easy way to learn how to use an eyelash curler to get lash curls, the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler is definitely it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why not, and I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to use it on</li>
            <li> I have blonde, kind of short eyelashes, and I love the full, black lushness the fibers give me.</li>
            <li> few of the things I like most about this product is that it comes with extra grip pads and 1 replacement pad, equipped with a spring in the handle for easy use, comes with a 1 year warranty and is backed by a 100% product satisfaction guarantee!</li>
            <li> Her eyelashes got a nice curve and even looked a little thicker.</li>
            <li> While this eyelash curler was more comfortable than others I&#x27;ve used due to the rubber inside of the finger grips, I did not notice any significant improvement in the curling of my lashes over any other curler.  </li>
            <li> It makes my eyelashes appear so much fuller.  </li>
            <li> When you place your lashes in the curler, and gently squeeze, there is no pain in the eye area.</li>
            <li> make my stick straight lashes curl and not scrape against the lenses of my glasses like they do if I don&#x27;t curl them.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it has made my eyelashes look.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the PDF with tips and tricks that I received after purchasing.  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so I do not use them much</li>
            <li> I love the pink and gold tone colors.</li>
            <li> This is a really preium quality eye lash curler and priced well.  </li>
            <li> They are made really well.</li>
            <li> They ebook is very helpful as well.</li>
            <li> My experience was pain free and my lashes got curled in an instant.</li>
            <li> The rubber on the finger part is a really nice feature and makes it cozy on your fingers when using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It didnt snag my lashes and they curled VERY well.</li>
            <li> I would definitively recommend this to anyone who wants fuller looking lashes.</li>
            <li> It opened nicely and big enough to get my eye lashes in there.</li>
            <li> I have been getting compliments left and right!</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m really liking this!</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, my eye lashes have thinned.</li>
            <li> I wiuld highly recomend this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The spring action really helps to control what I am doing.  </li>
            <li> I really wanted to focus on the curler&#x27;s action and not care about my makeup .</li>
            <li> It took me a few times to get used to using it, but I love it now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never loved them more, than right now using this curler.</li>
            <li> I have super long lashes</li>
            <li> Curling my eyelashes is rather new to me.  </li>
            <li> I also got some new ideas from the booklet.</li>
            <li> The first photo is the one I did not use the Mia Adora eyelash curler and the second photo</li>
            <li> If you noticed in the first pic I have not used the curler therefore my lashes are not curled and laying flat.</li>
            <li> This curler is certainly not cheaply made in any way - the metal is solid, the rubber is soft and stays where it belongs, and like I already mentioned, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> The lash curler comes in this clear packaging that I kinda wish have some form of note card or something with instructions.</li>
            <li> I just recieved these and was expecting just another eyelash curler ( which I needed as my old one broke)</li>
            <li> The soft padding prevents my eyelashes from sticking when released from the lashes.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with these curlers.</li>
            <li> curler is well shaped soft hold .not</li>
            <li> how far I put my thumb in there or it would get stuck.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> This makes my lashes much longer and fuller than regular mascara.  </li>
            <li> This came with a soft cushion that you use to curl your eyelashes with, as well as cushions for your fingers as well.</li>
            <li> I had my young friend Jacie come over and model for the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler.</li>
            <li> not heavy at all...</li>
            <li> I was totally surprised</li>
            <li> It lifts the lashes and curls at the same time, and when I use mascara afterwards it really makes my eyes pop.</li>
            <li> i am actually surprised at how well it works.</li>
            <li> My precious curler wasn&#x27;t gentle enough on my lashes, but at least my lashes stayed curled.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging, it&#x27;s easy to use, and there is a lot less mess involved with this fiber lash mascara than with other versions of this type of product that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic design makes it easy to include every lash for curling and does not leave a mark or dent where it rests upon my lids/brow bone, nor does it scratch me from resting in place while I curl my lashes as others I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> The pink and black color scheme is absolutely adorable.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect such a relatively inexpensive tool to be the one that made the birds sing, but there ya go.</li>
            <li> Even when you purchase the big named brand ones they really fall short and somehow I either get a eye lash pulled or it pinches.</li>
            <li> loved how big I could get my lashes to look without having to use fake lashes, just by using this lash curler.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with an extra little pad so that you can have a clean one to change</li>
            <li> I was expecting super dramatic, and I&#x27;m sure if I continued the steps like they suggest, I could really amp it up to get super thick, full, long, false looking eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with this product at a significant discount for review purposes.hes to have a little bit more impact hiding behind my glasses, and this definitely does the trick.  </li>
            <li> You can get a range of length from everyday to stunning full thick long lashes!</li>
            <li> Now, this is the bare minimum coat of the magnifying gel mascara with just one or two passes of the fiber lashes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple natural look for an on the go</li>
            <li> Also included was (2) more padding replacements for the finger holes as well as another pink pad for the part that curls the lashes, it prevents the curler from cutting off lashes and can be taken off to clean</li>
            <li> I almost expected the results to be SO dramatic that it would be overkill to wear out without going somewhere super fancy and wearing a face full of makeup.  </li>
            <li> I especially like how it has soft plastic lining on the bar where the eyelashes rest, that seems to give my lashes extra &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> little pink cushion is a nice little feminine design touch.</li>
            <li> When I went to crimp them down it was soft not hard.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long eye lashes you could say, but the problem is they don&#x27;t have much of a natural curl to them.</li>
            <li> The spring makes it easier to use than most curlers because I  always remember feeling like I had to press really hard with typical curlers to get the results I wanted</li>
            <li> this is a must try for all beauty gurus and it is way less expensive than most curlers out there!</li>
            <li> I have had a hard time finding an extreme amount of use out of this, as it didn&#x27;t add any special amount of curl.</li>
            <li> I just want my lashes to have a little bit more impact hiding behind my glasses, and this definitely does the trick.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like the colors of the curlers, pink and black.  </li>
            <li> But generally speaking that&#x27;s not really want I want.  </li>
            <li> I feel with how they feel in my hand they should last a long time.</li>
            <li> It comes with extra cushions for the handles as well as an extra pink cushion for the curling part ensuring that this curler will last you a long while.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly enough it didn&#x27;t rip out any lashes and it stayed curled all day long!</li>
            <li> The curler comes with two extra pink rubbers and they are going to last for long.</li>
            <li> I do not use false eyelashes , nor do I use the fiber, I use my regular mascara in which the curler works just fine with , it also will curl slightly without anything.</li>
            <li> They have only done it one time so probably just loose eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I know I will have this one for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an eyelash curler in so long</li>
            <li> Plus please excuse the no makeup as well.</li>
            <li> I have this one Sephora curler that I simply threw away because it only got about half of my lashes (and pulled, to boot.)</li>
            <li> One bonus that other companies don&#x27;t provide are an extra pad.</li>
            <li> Open box but other than that the products came with everything it said no instructions on the e book.</li>
            <li> The curler is not huge and have me feeling like everything on it is metal like back when I was younger.</li>
            <li> I was confused at first where to put these grips</li>
            <li> She have always been a little intimidated by them but yet intrigued at the same time.</li>
            <li> I just had to be careful</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s say you get pink eye or eye infection.</li>
            <li> (the pink piece in the photo) as well as a plastic arm to hold the loops</li>
            <li> It is helpful if you slightly open and close the curler a few times.</li>
            <li> Not only did I tare out eyelashes trying to use the curler, I also didn&#x27;t see any affect on my lashes other than destroying them.</li>
            <li> On the other hand I am a self proclaimed beauty product junkie</li>
            <li> and they were&#x27;nt stuck together like other ones I have used.</li>
            <li> No worries about getting your fingers stuck in the finger holes like other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I use eye lash curler occasionally, and usually buy the store brand.</li>
            <li> The one strange thing about it is that throughout the day on occasion my eyelashes seem to stick together, but it&#x27;s not a huge deal.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Forgive the sad state of the rest of my face, but actually it goes top show how subtle the effect (without seriously layering the stuff on) is.  </li>
            <li> You can use the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler with natural lashes, false lashes or 3D Fiberlash Mascara.</li>
            <li> I have used some in the past that I loose eye lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they was just loose ones or what.</li>
            <li> I noticed less mascara clumping after using the curler and applying my mascara as it curled my lashes, keeping them separated vs. them getting stuck together.</li>
            <li> sometimes so typically I can&#x27;t wear mascara when I&#x27;m wearing my glasses</li>
            <li> He said it was subtle, but he could see that my lashes were thicker and there was definitely a difference.  </li>
            <li> I have bee messing with it over a day and a half</li>
            <li> I have really thin eyelashes that are barely visible.</li>
            <li> and they looked long and thick</li>
            <li> If you have small or somewhat deep set eyes and have had a hard time finding a curler that will work for you, I recommend giving this one</li>
            <li> I warmed it up with a hair dryer for a few seconds and curled my eyelashes before putting the mascara on.</li>
            <li> However, after a few minutes, your lashes stop holding.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble curling my eyelashes abut just about 10-15 seconds with the curler and it lasts all day.</li>
            <li> But they have pulled out a few of my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The shipping was seriously, faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it out without any other makeup on (as I normally live my life) and I was disappointed that the results were not FABULOUS OMG LOOK</li>
            <li> Helloooo how can you go wrong and if that isn&#x27;t enough they give you this offer as well !!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used some in the past that hurt because they would tug at my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> so i was not able to use them or test them</li>
            <li> It has silicone padding on the curler which is vital (in my opinion) if you donâ€™t want an awkward crease in your lashes.</li>
            <li> I have always had short thin lashes and they are getting worse as I age.</li>
            <li> I work hard for mine and don&#x27;t want any gone.</li>
            <li> how they work however that was hard when they were broke..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thick eyelashes</li>
            <li> No more extensions for me!</li>
            <li> I never used fake eyelashes because I just thought it was too extreme, and the eyelash extender products just seemed to gunk mine up.</li>
            <li> I have always thought my eyelashes were so dull and boring, but now they look longer and full since using the curler.  </li>
            <li> I expected a very dramatic outcome.  </li>
            <li> you can see, it&#x27;s a subtle change.  </li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as my Tarte curler.  </li>
            <li> I recieved these and they camr broken</li>
            <li> Frustrating!</li>
            <li> When I express my amazement, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used ridonk expensive eyelash curlers from the likes of Tweezerman that still didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> I have weird shaped eyes I suppose, because I can never get lash curlers to get all of my lashes.</li>
            <li> I was waiting to be wowed and unfortunately, I was not.  </li>
            <li> I have tried expensive mascara&#x27;s and all sorts of things.</li>
            <li> I admit that I was a bit skeptical.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to give this brand</li>
            <li> I am always afraid I am going to pinch myself with eyelash curlers</li>
            <li> I was soooo wrong!</li>
            <li> and it was Uncomfortable!</li>
            <li> perfectly!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how it comes with a 1 year warranty and how well it is made.</li>
            <li> It did not pinch my eyelashes while using the curlers which is always a plus to me because I hate pain.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> I tried and tried to use this but it will not hold a curl. I just couldn&#x27;t get it to curl my lashes!  Frustrating!</li>
            <li> I just recieved these and was expecting just another eyelash curler ( which I needed as my old one broke) I am beyond happy with this brand. This is by far the best Eyelash curler I have ever used.  I did 1 eye so I could compair my results and I was blown away. I don&#x27;t have thick eyelashes and I usually have to put on mascara in order to get a good look. This made my eyes look so good I wouldn&#x27;t even need mascara on. It curled them so wonderful and made my eyelashes look so wonderful. I seruosuly lover this eyelash curler:)&lt;br /&gt;I recivet this to test out and in turn I gave my honest and unbiased opinion . I wiuld highly recomend this eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> Receiving this curler from Mia Adora brought back my good memories with my old curler. Granted, this new curler is lighter in weight and more professional looking for sure. It didn&#x27;t leave any creases in my lashes and itâ€™s well crafted to curve around your outer lid to prevent â€˜pinchingâ€™. This curler definitely whipped my lashes into line</li>
            <li> I honestly used an eyelash curler last when I was in high school.- i have been scared of ripping out my thinning lashes and haven&#x27;t used one since. On the other hand I am a self proclaimed beauty product junkie so when I was given the opportunity to try this out and give my opinion on it, I figured it was worth a shot. I warmed it up with a hair dryer for a few seconds and curled my eyelashes before putting the mascara on. It curled quickly and left my lashes perfect for mascara! Amazingly enough it didn&#x27;t rip out any lashes and it stayed curled all day long! Don&#x27;t be afraid to give this brand a look- it is high quality and easy to use!</li>
            <li> This is one of the best eyelash curler that I have ever used.It is really easy to use and you get a free ebook to show you how to use it and get the most out of your eyelash curler. Great Product!!</li>
            <li> I love our Mia Adora eyelash curler. We have had it for a long time now and it works perfectly. I have not hurt myself one time curling my eyelashes and they always come out perfectly!!!&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked at how it comes with a 1 year warranty and how well it is made. My daughter loves it just as well,she uses it all the time,more than I do:) I highly recommend Mia Adora eyelash curler as it is wonderful and I can not say enough about it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I received this at little or at no cost to me to give my honest opinion and that is exactly what I have done!! I hope you enjoy yours just as well as we enjoy ours!</li>
            <li> I was so excited that I was able to try this eyelash curler for free from the company! I have really thin eyelashes that are barely visible. I have been looking for just the right mascara to give my eyelashes length and volume for years with no luck. It turns out I didn&#x27;t need mascara to do that, I needed the right eyelash curler!! This eyelash curler by Mia Adora is simply amazing! It made my eyelashes stand out like nothing has done in the past!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few of the things I like most about this product is that it comes with extra grip pads and 1 replacement pad, equipped with a spring in the handle for easy use, comes with a 1 year warranty and is backed by a 100% product satisfaction guarantee! You have nothing to lose by ordering this product! I am very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I have used many eyelash curlers but this one is the best! First, it works great! It makes my eyelashes appear so much fuller.  My friends even notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;This one is padded so it doesn&#x27;t hurt your fingers to use. It also comes with extra pads so you can replace them when they start wearing. It is also well made and sturdy. I know I will have this one for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;This would make a great gift for any girl. Both my teenage daughters are forever stealing mine.</li>
            <li> This curler is well built and feels good in the hand. I gave it as a gift and my sister loved it and said that it worked well.</li>
            <li> Love these!! It took me a few times to get used to using it, but I love it now. I actually will wear it one night, not wash the fibers off, and reapply the next day, and they look Sooo good. I have blonde, kind of short eyelashes, and I love the full, black lushness the fibers give me.</li>
            <li> This eyeash curler works well and is easy to use.  When you place your lashes in the curler, and gently squeeze, there is no pain in the eye area.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to be able to get a complimentary Mia Adora eyelash curler. I was not paid or compensated for this review. All opinions shared in this review are my own. I got this product last week and have been using it daily ever since and what a difference it makes in my lashes. They appear fuller and longer. The spring loaded design gives me ultimate control when curling my lashes. The ergonomic design makes it easy to include every lash for curling and does not leave a mark or dent where it rests upon my lids/brow bone, nor does it scratch me from resting in place while I curl my lashes as others I have tried in the past. The soft padding prevents my eyelashes from sticking when released from the lashes. It is a bonus to get a replacement pad with the purchase of this product especially if you be using it daily, as I will be from now on. I was impressed my lashes were not crimped from curling with this eyelash curler. I noticed less mascara clumping after using the curler and applying my mascara as it curled my lashes, keeping them separated vs. them getting stuck together. I have included photos of the finished product. The first photo is the one I did not use the Mia Adora eyelash curler and the second photo is the one that I did use it. I added the same amount of mascara layer to each eye for consistency. You can see for yourself what a difference it made! I would recommend the Mia Adora eyelash curler to anyone looking for fuller, longer looking lashes that make your eyes pop! Bonus: It comes with a one year warranty as well, so it&#x27;s a win, win!</li>
            <li> Great product. Curls eyelashes great and leaves them curling for hours. Its Spring loaded and light weight to operate. I was pleased when I was given the chance to evaluate during a recent promotion.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems so far with these curlers. No tugging or pulling of my lashes. I give them an 9 for comfort and ease of use. I would be happy to recommend these to anyone. I bought these at a cheaper price to try out and give my review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good eyelash curler. I have had a hard time finding an extreme amount of use out of this, as it didn&#x27;t add any special amount of curl.</li>
            <li> When I express my amazement, it&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve used ridonk expensive eyelash curlers from the likes of Tweezerman that still didn&#x27;t do the job. I have weird shaped eyes I suppose, because I can never get lash curlers to get all of my lashes. I have this one Sephora curler that I simply threw away because it only got about half of my lashes (and pulled, to boot.) I really didn&#x27;t expect such a relatively inexpensive tool to be the one that made the birds sing, but there ya go. It gets all of my lashes from the shortest to the longest, corner to corner in one squeeze. There&#x27;s no pinching or pulling and it does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do- make my stick straight lashes curl and not scrape against the lenses of my glasses like they do if I don&#x27;t curl them. I&#x27;ve been using this regularly for months now and continue to be pleased with the results. As a bonus, it comes with a replacement silicone pad! If you have small or somewhat deep set eyes and have had a hard time finding a curler that will work for you, I recommend giving this one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Why are all the reviews about fiber lashes when the product being sold is an eye lash curler???</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler is a must must buy ..excellent hold .the curler is well shaped soft hold .not too big ,perfect to do it by urself .i would definetly recommend I loved it and would give a free advice to invest into a good buy .its a baby hold for ur lashes which gives perfect curl smoothly ..</li>
            <li> I have been using this for not quite a week. Perfect for small fingers to use. I am a bigger bone person. Now with that said I was still able to use this. I just had to be careful how far I put my thumb in there or it would get stuck. Please remember I have a huge thumb so this is no fault to the maker. I still got them to work wonderfully. It opened nicely and big enough to get my eye lashes in there. When I went to crimp them down it was soft not hard. When I let go to let some out and to continue to crimp there was no pulling. I have used some in the past that I loose eye lashes. I work hard for mine and don&#x27;t want any gone. The pad on the inside is a nice cushion pad. This crimps your lashes when you have coated them with mascara and use this to crimp them. It stays and it is an nice curl to your lashes. I would suggest to get this. One bonus that other companies don&#x27;t provide are an extra pad. I love this. Let&#x27;s say you get pink eye or eye infection. You could either clean up with alcohol or you can clean the curler up and then put a new pad it. I feel with how they feel in my hand they should last a long time. The springs seem to be able to hold up nicely so far from what I can see. I tested this for quality and am basing my review on my experience!</li>
            <li> I purchased this item using a discounted coupon and I am offering my opinion. Since I was going out and was already about to apply makeup, these  came right on time.  The shipping was seriously, faster than I expected. The lash curler comes in this clear packaging that I kinda wish have some form of note card or something with instructions. I had to come back to my order to figure out what the extra pieces were. It is a basic eye lash curler but Im thinking what if I was someone who had never used one before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that aside, I still used it and never judge a book by it&#x27;s cover. I have these eyelashes that scatters, so control these were going to be the goal. It met my expectations with flying colors. I know I do not have the butterfly lashes, I hope and dream for but this eye lash curler gave me control. It was easier to apply my mascara evenly. Most times I am swiping just to get them all to not look like spider legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall great combo with a great mascara!</li>

            <li> I haven&#x27;t used an eyelash curler in so long and I forgot how well they work and this one works better than I remember.  I have super long lashes and I wear glasses sometimes so typically I can&#x27;t wear mascara when I&#x27;m wearing my glasses or it just gets all over the lenses.  I curled my lashes with these curlers and was able to avoid having mascara everywhere.  The spring makes it easier to use than most curlers because I  always remember feeling like I had to press really hard with typical curlers to get the results I wanted but these did the work for me.&lt;br /&gt;The little pink cushion is a nice little feminine design touch. The curler came packaged well in easy to open see through packaging. They are comfortable to use and my fingers fit in them easily.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice eyelash curler- highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied this complimentary product for review and I am very grateful to have a chance to provide my unbiased and honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I tried this today and it definitely adds volume and length to my lashes. I love the packaging, it&#x27;s easy to use, and there is a lot less mess involved with this fiber lash mascara than with other versions of this type of product that I&#x27;ve tried. I really like the way it has made my eyelashes look. The one strange thing about it is that throughout the day on occasion my eyelashes seem to stick together, but it&#x27;s not a huge deal. So far I&#x27;m really liking this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;M SERIOUSLY IN LOVE WITH THIS EYELASH CURLER! First of all, it&#x27;s extremely cute. The pink and black color scheme is absolutely adorable. Second of all, it works great! It really does a great job of curling my lashes and they seem to stay curled for the rest of the day. So that&#x27;s awesome. And third of all, it comes with a replacement for the grips and the plastic lash curler part. That is seriously awesome because those things get super dirty when you use the eyelash curler as much as me (basically every day). Great product!</li>
            <li> I was waiting to be wowed and unfortunately, I was not.  While this eyelash curler was more comfortable than others I&#x27;ve used due to the rubber inside of the finger grips, I did not notice any significant improvement in the curling of my lashes over any other curler.  This curler is certainly not cheaply made in any way - the metal is solid, the rubber is soft and stays where it belongs, and like I already mentioned, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold.  Perhaps if I curled my lashes on a daily basis, I might appreciate the comfort of this a bit more, than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara, I have to say, I expected a very dramatic outcome.  I almost expected the results to be SO dramatic that it would be overkill to wear out without going somewhere super fancy and wearing a face full of makeup.  I decided to try it out without any other makeup on (as I normally live my life) and I was disappointed that the results were not FABULOUS OMG LOOK AT THOSE FALSIES but were actually more natural and more WOW YOU HAVE NICE LASHES.  Which works better for me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see, it&#x27;s a subtle change.  Now, this is the bare minimum coat of the magnifying gel mascara with just one or two passes of the fiber lashes.  I asked my husband if he could tell the difference between my before photo and how I looked after applying the 3D Fiber Lash Mascara.  He said it was subtle, but he could see that my lashes were thicker and there was definitely a difference.  Of course, when I told him I could amp it up if he took me somewhere nice, he balked and went back out to his man cave, but I digress...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forgive the sad state of the rest of my face, but actually it goes top show how subtle the effect (without seriously layering the stuff on) is.  I was expecting super dramatic, and I&#x27;m sure if I continued the steps like they suggest, I could really amp it up to get super thick, full, long, false looking eyelashes.  But generally speaking that&#x27;s not really want I want.  I just want my lashes to have a little bit more impact hiding behind my glasses, and this definitely does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided with this product at a significant discount for review purposes.hes to have a little bit more impact hiding behind my glasses, and this definitely does the trick.  I was provided with this product at a significant discount for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I appreciated the PDF with tips and tricks that I received after purchasing.  This makes my lashes much longer and fuller than regular mascara.  I used extra coats of the fibers to get to the look I wanted to achieve.  The lash curler is great too!  I loved that it came with a refill  and the spring was great.</li>
            <li> Best customer service ever. Product works great. Had a problem with my eyelashes not staying curled. Did some research on amazon and decided on this one. Glad I did. Does a great job.Company is great also.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Easy to use and effective. Good addition to my makeup bag for on the go. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Open box but other than that the products came with everything it said no instructions on the e book. sturdy eyelash curler with mild pinching.....</li>
            <li> I receiced this gift for my unbias and honest opinion.I put my mascara on my lashes which  are very short and used my eyelash curler and they looked long and thick and they were&#x27;nt stuck together like other ones I have used. would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have tried many curlers and all of them have either pinched my lids and lashes or tore out lashes. This curler is fantastic! It didnt leave a crimp on my lashes and curled them perfectly. The handles are gripped for better control and the padding is super soft to curl the lashes. this is a must try for all beauty gurus and it is way less expensive than most curlers out there! I am happy to recieve this awesome curler to review. It is top notch!</li>
            <li> I am lucky to have had the opportunity to review this product. Below is my unbiased and honest opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not expecting this kind of eyelash curler when I received it in the mail! I&#x27;ve used some in the past that hurt because they would tug at my eyelashes. This came with a soft cushion that you use to curl your eyelashes with, as well as cushions for your fingers as well. I thought it did a good job of making my naturally long eyelashes pop. This is something I hope to use before wearing my mascara every day!</li>
            <li> I love that this curler is so easy to use. The spring opens &amp; closes very easily &amp; feels featherlight on my eyelashes. No worries about getting your fingers stuck in the finger holes like other brands I have tried. This curler comes with 2 extra finger pads &amp; 1 extra eyelash pad. While likely the fault of a 3rd party shipper the eyelash curler was mailed in a paper envelope. The plastic box the eyelash curler was in broke open &amp; all the contents were not in the box but all over the bottom of the envelope. Thankfully everything was there &amp; working. It just wouldn&#x27;t have been giftable had I purchased it for that intention.</li>
            <li> I recieved these and they camr broken so i was not able to use them or test them, these were at a very discounted price in return to give my honest opinion about them and how they work however that was hard when they were broke..</li>
            <li> i love this it works really good for my eye lashrs</li>
            <li> I really liked this eyelash curler at first--gentle on the lashes, won&#x27;t pull out lashes, give good volume.....at first. When you first curl your lashes, this does wonders. However, after a few minutes, your lashes stop holding. My precious curler wasn&#x27;t gentle enough on my lashes, but at least my lashes stayed curled.</li>
            <li> Ok so my wife has never used an eyelash curler before so she was really excited to try it out. She have always been a little intimidated by them but yet intrigued at the same time. She says its very easy to use and it appears to be high quality in appearance compared to others she has seen. She like the spring action which makes it easy to handle and it definitely makes a difference in the look of my lashes. It curls and does not crease the lashes. She said she loves the fact it has a no slip handle and it also comes with refill padding. I am so glad I was given the opportunity to receive a complimentary sample of this eyelash curler by Mia Adora for my wife to try and give an honest and unbiased opinion of it</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try these fiber lashes! It&#x27;s funny.. I won a contest and received Younique fiber lashes in the mail the same day that I received these. I wasn&#x27;t expecting it but, it happened. I have to say with all the hype about Younique I was sure that they would be better-- I was soooo wrong! I wanted to tell you- I have been getting eyelash extensions-- it was getting a bit pricy and it was Uncomfortable! I was happy to see how easy this was to do after alittle practice! I have bee messing with it over a day and a half and I have mastered it! You can get a range of length from everyday to stunning full thick long lashes! The fibers take a minute to get used too but, they look fabulous! I have been getting compliments left and right! Compared to Younique the ease of use and the length I am getting is not even comparable. Don&#x27;t fall for the hype of a well known brand name! People hype it up because they are making commission! Order these! No more extensions for me! Look at my results!!!!</li>
            <li> I had my young friend Jacie come over and model for the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler. I held the curler in my hand and I loved the firm grip I had with the curler. Jacie was able to get all of her lashes in the curler with no problem. Her eyelashes got a nice curve and even looked a little thicker. The curler is a great way to go on days you don&#x27;t want to wear mascara. It&#x27;s a simple natural look for an on the go day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> love this eyelash curler! works amazing! love the color love how easy it is to use ... not heavy at all... and even my bf noticed after i used it! if your looking for a nice eye lash curler its a must buy this is based on my own unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> Awesome Curler.  The packaging was nicely done. These are very light, easy to grip, easy to handle.  I am always afraid I am going to pinch myself with eyelash curlers so I do not use them much but when I was offered to use this for my unbiased opinion, I said ok I will try them.  I was totally surprised, I did not pinch myself and I actually could see a difference in my eye lashes. I cannot go a day without them now.  I would buy these again just because of the ease of use and the visual difference they actually made where others do not.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this eyelash curler and am absolutely loving it so far. After using the $1 ELF eyelash curler for the longest time, I needed one that better fit the shape of my eye and didn&#x27;t leave out any of my shorter lashes. I appreciate that this Mia Adora curler fits comfortable along my lash line and I don&#x27;t have to worry about pinching my eyelid in the process. The best part? My eyelashes stay curled throughout the work day, which makes this purchase all the more worth it. I&#x27;m definitely pleased with this product- I can&#x27;t complain about the price, either!</li>
            <li> Okay, I got this more for my wife to review than I. Not quite the guy product here... and she wouldn&#x27;t let me try it out on her either. I can&#x27;t imagine why not, and I certainly wasn&#x27;t going to use it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She seems to think it is comfortable to use and does a great job grooming the lashes. Great end result and doesn&#x27;t tug. Fits nicely in hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price. I&#x27;ve seen some others than weren&#x27;t available with free shipping for Prime members. Good to see this one is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying this eyelash curler. my eyelashes can sometimes be unruly so being able to test this product out and give me feedback is great. It doesn&#x27;t pinch and it curls my lashes just the way I want them. It&#x27;s also very attractively made. I love the pink and gold tone colors. It fits comfortably in my hand and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT addition to my makeup tools collection! It was provided to me for testing and review purposes.  I immediately tossed my former eyelash curler and put this in its spot.  This is spring loaded, unlike many others.  I especially like how it has soft plastic lining on the bar where the eyelashes rest, that seems to give my lashes extra &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;.  It also comes with replacements for both the loops and the bar (the pink piece in the photo) as well as a plastic arm to hold the loops just right.  If you can jump on the blowout sale while it&#x27;s going on I would definitely grab one! I received this at a discount in exchange for personally testing and providing my honest review of the product.</li>
            <li> This is a really preium quality eye lash curler and priced well.  I was amazed how great my eye lashes looked after using.  Curling my eyelashes is rather new to me.  The silicone pad helps so I don&#x27;t pinch or pull my eyelashes.  It has a non slip grip on the handles.  The spring action really helps to control what I am doing.  It is light weight.  I would highly recommend and was so happy to get this product complimentary  to give my honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Love this curler! I have always had trouble curling my eyelashes abut just about 10-15 seconds with the curler and it lasts all day. I am really happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This review is for the Mia Adora Eye Lashcurler.  I haven&#x27;t used an eye lash curler in years.  As I have gotten older, my eye lashes have thinned. I have always thought my eyelashes were so dull and boring, but now they look longer and full since using the curler.  The curler is very easy to use.  It has rubber rings inside the handles to make it comfortable for your fingers.  The curve is just right so that it doesn&#x27;t pinch the sides of your lid.  It comes with extra cushions for the handles as well as an extra pink cushion for the curling part ensuring that this curler will last you a long while.  If you are looking for an eye lash curler or a way to wake up your eye lashes, this is the eye lash curler for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for me to try out and give my honest opinion. I realize that everyone&#x27;s experience may be different but this review was based on my experience.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to receive a sample of these eyelash curlers. I have used them a few times and the more I use them the more I like them. But they have pulled out a few of my eyelashes. I&#x27;m not sure if they was just loose ones or what. They have only done it one time so probably just loose eyelashes. They are made really well. They do not pinch my eyes which is an added plus. I would recommend these eyelash curlers.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as my Tarte curler.  I would say it&#x27;s on par with the Revlon curler  you can pick up at Walmart</li>
            <li> I use eye lash curler occasionally, and usually buy the store brand. This curler is really good and curls the lashes without tugging at them and the curl stays all day long. I use it before putting on mascara. It is helpful if you slightly open and close the curler a few times. It gives the best and very defined curls to the lashes. They ebook is very helpful as well. Many beauty tips in it. The curler comes with two extra pink rubbers and they are going to last for long. I am glad I was able to get this on discount promotional price.</li>
            <li> I  love to shop and try new things. So, when I was offered a complimentary pair of eyelash curlers by Mia Adora, I jumped on the opportunity. I really like the colors of the curlers, pink and black.  The curler has rubber cushions around the handle which makes your use of the curlers more comfortable.  My hands did not get cramps from using the product because of its easy design.  Lol, they are user friendly and they come with additional accessories for the curler, like extra grips for the handle and padding  for the curler. In addition to the extra parts, I received a instruction guide by email that gave me all the latest tips from how to use the curler to highlighting and filling my brows. In my honest opinion, this is my first time every using an eyelash curler and I can say that I am satisfied with the product. It did not pinch my eyelashes while using the curlers which is always a plus to me because I hate pain. So if you are looking for a nice eyelash curler try the Eyelash Curler by Mia Adora.</li>
            <li> Great eyelash curler... Need your lashes to stand out? This is a great eyelash curler that will curl those eyelashes..</li>
            <li> This eyelash curler was a good product. It has a spring like pad, that helps with the non pulling of the eyelash or making them fall out. I only gave this product a 4 star because it stated that it was to come with an extra pad in which it did not , other wise I found this to be a good quality eyelash curler. I do not use false eyelashes , nor do I use the fiber, I use my regular mascara in which the curler works just fine with , it also will curl slightly without anything.Fair pricing,the eyelash curler came in a plastic holder with nothing written on it ,or any papers showing how to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this product to review for my own and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> I received these curlers for testing purposes. In the pics below you will see me testing out the eyelash curler. If you noticed in the first pic I have not used the curler therefore my lashes are not curled and laying flat. Plus please excuse the no makeup as well. I really wanted to focus on the curler&#x27;s action and not care about my makeup . The curlers are very easy to use and come with 2 bottom grips. I was confused at first where to put these grips but then I saw and learned then took it off and placed it back on the bottom of the eyelash curler to test to see if it works. And it did! This grip allows me to handle the eyelash curlers with ease and allows it not to tug on my lashes. My experience was pain free and my lashes got curled in an instant. I&#x27;m glad that I can make the Mia Dora Eyelash curler part of my collection. These are great and I definitely recommend them.</li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve been using the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler for a while and Iâ€™m impressed with how easy it is to use. It has silicone padding on the curler which is vital (in my opinion) if you donâ€™t want an awkward crease in your lashes. PLUS, it comes with a replacement silicone pad for future use.  The eyelash curler itself is easy to hold onto and the has a non slip handle thatâ€™s padded. There are even replacement pads for the handle although I have seen no need to replace them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler, it came with a free ebook that has tips and tricks for getting amazing eyelashes. You can use the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler with natural lashes, false lashes or 3D Fiberlash Mascara. If youâ€™re looking for an easy way to learn how to use an eyelash curler to get lash curls, the Mia Adora Eyelash Curler is definitely it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was provided this product for my honest review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted those perfect looking eyelashes. I never used fake eyelashes because I just thought it was too extreme, and the eyelash extender products just seemed to gunk mine up. Growing up, I always saw women using the eyelash curlers. I finally tried one when I was a teenager, and was totally turned away. Not only did I tare out eyelashes trying to use the curler, I also didn&#x27;t see any affect on my lashes other than destroying them. That was the last time I used one, until I tested out this eyelash curler. I&#x27;m stunned at how amazing the results were for this. I&#x27;m in awe! It&#x27;s easy to handle. The curler is not huge and have me feeling like everything on it is metal like back when I was younger. I like that it comes with extra grips as well. My lashes look beautiful! I&#x27;ve never loved them more, than right now using this curler. I look like I have thicker, fuller lashes. The best plus of all, is that I didn&#x27;t tear one lash out! This is something I&#x27;d buy for any woman in my life! I think these are a must and will never be without one, ever again!</li>
            <li> Let me start by first saying, I simply am in love with my new eyelash curler. I have fairly long eye lashes you could say, but the problem is they don&#x27;t have much of a natural curl to them. So when I was given the opportunity to to test this curler for my honest and unbiased opinion, I jumped on it. I have tried expensive mascara&#x27;s and all sorts of things. From my experiences, my lashes would just clump together. When I first got my curler I admit that I was a bit skeptical. Not anymore! My first time trying the lash curler when I looked in the mirror I was so excited. My lashes looked even longer and they had a beautiful curl. Here is where I really got excited. After I applied my mascara, there were no clumps. My lashes looked better than ever. The cushioned pads make the curling comfortable. They have a nice grip to hold to do the curling, and they come packaged very nicely. I also got some new ideas from the booklet. I also love that they come with an extended warranty, but from what I see they are made very well. I highly recommend these to any lady that needs  or desires beautiful curled lashes.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:f0bdb709a903a4abe88c726c9dd11008]]Easy to use, fingers fit in the holes - holes come with padding to provide comfort when squeezing to curl my lashes. Also included was (2) more padding replacements for the finger holes as well as another pink pad for the part that curls the lashes, it prevents the curler from cutting off lashes and can be taken off to clean any mascara build-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I loved how big I could get my lashes to look without having to use fake lashes, just by using this lash curler. It lifts the lashes and curls at the same time, and when I use mascara afterwards it really makes my eyes pop. The lash curler is easy to use with one hand and I get a smooth squeeze with no snags every time. I like the results I obtained when I used this curler. I was provided a sample for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice eyelash curler. I like that it comes with an extra little pad so that you can have a clean one to change out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well constructed and is quite easy to use.  The rubber on the finger part is a really nice feature and makes it cozy on your fingers when using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**. Received for review purposes.</li>
            <li> I received this today. It is very nice and comfortable. I have used different eye lash curlers over the years.Even when you purchase the big named brand ones they really fall short and somehow I either get a eye lash pulled or it pinches. That is a big ouch!  This worked great. It didnt snag my lashes and they curled VERY well.And guess what no pinch. That is a huge benefit.  It also came with extra padding for you that isa huge plus!&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I have always had short thin lashes and they are getting worse as I age. When I was offered this product for my unbiased opinion I thought why not? i am actually surprised at how well it works. I have never used one, I didnt think they worked.  I would definitively recommend this to anyone who wants fuller looking lashes.</li>
