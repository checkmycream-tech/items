            <li>I think that most people will be pleased with this item.</li>
            <li>Works better than advertised.</li>
            <li>I found it better to just keep it plugged in at all times for maximum lighting.</li>
            <li>I love this mirror.  </li>
            <li>My husband loves this, so glad I got it.</li>
            <li>For most people this will not be an issue.</li>
            <li>Product received in December - used the light feature probably 5 times at most.  </li>
            <li>The light was great when brand new, now it&#x27;s basically nonexistent.</li>
            <li>Strong light and love</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my wife so that she&#x27;d be able to use it in a bathroom where no outlet is accessible.</li>
            <li>The advertising indicated that it would be very bright and as I have poor lighting in my bathroom, I was hoping it would make a great difference.</li>
            <li>The magnification is fine.</li>
            <li>The mirror while of very good quality,  simply had a magnification power way too powerful for my needs.</li>
            <li>The second mirror isn&#x27;t cordless and a great light.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t utilize the cordless feature often because the light gradually dimmed (from battery use) over time.</li>
            <li>The light has already quit working.  </li>
            <li>I was happy with the size and mirror reflection, but the on/off switch was wobbly out of the box, downward pressure had to be applied to get it to work, and the switch broke off on my third try.  </li>
            <li>Love the fact that you can plug it in or use batteries which makes it useful for travel.</li>
            <li>Very nice gift and my wife likes it immensely!!!!</li>
            <li>Nice and large mirror with nice soft lighting around the mirror.  </li>
            <li>The first mirror arrived cracked and Amazon quickly replaced it.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a mirror to aid in applying eye makeup more evenly and for general eyebrow tweezing, etc.</li>
            <li>I had ordered this previously and loved it so much, I ordered it for our weekend place!  </li>
            <li>Lesson learned, buy a practice like this in person unless you know exactly what you are getting.</li>
            <li>My whole family loves this mirror!  </li>
            <li>The light is not too bright, not too dull!  </li>
            <li>I also thought that the light made my skin look yellow.</li>
            <li>I EXPECTED so much more for a $125 mirror.  </li>
            <li>Also, for anyone who&#x27;s interested, the manufacturer states that under normal usage conditions, a set of batteries should last</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s dim in fact.</li>
            <li>I love the cordless mirror, but the light is terrible already..hard to tell whether the light is on or off.  </li>
            <li>This mirror stopped working after barely two months and</li>
            <li>The 10x magnification side is too much, not very useful.</li>

            <li> Not a pretty mirror like the 8X mirror, and does not  have an adjustable light that goes from house-office-evening-dayligh nor does it have the extra plug-in on the base like on the 8X.  </li>
            <li> It is quite tall...that would be my only complaint.  </li>

            <li> now because it is 7 days past the return date I can&#x27;t return it.  </li>
            <li> at least 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just sorry it doesn&#x27;t have the other features as well.</li>
            <li> But the lighting is not nearly as bright as I had hoped.</li>

            <li> Not a pretty mirror like the 8X mirror, and does not  have an adjustable light that goes from house-office-evening-dayligh nor does it have the extra plug-in on the base like on the 8X.  It does magnify well and that was what I needed.  Just sorry it doesn&#x27;t have the other features as well.</li>
            <li> Very nice gift and my wife likes it immensely!!!! Lightning fast shipping as always and a great place to shop!!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my wife so that she&#x27;d be able to use it in a bathroom where no outlet is accessible. She says that it provides plenty of light, the magnification is perfect for applying makeup and the quality is superb. It&#x27;s also nice that the mirror can be used with either the included AC power cord or batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strangest thing about this mirror is that nowhere on the box does it state what type of batteries to use. It&#x27;s not until you open the carton that you find out that the mirror/light takes 4 \\&quot;C\\&quot; batteries. Also, for anyone who&#x27;s interested, the manufacturer states that under normal usage conditions, a set of batteries should last at least 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that this appears to be a well made product, it produces plenty of light, and has the perfect amount of magnification. I think that most people will be pleased with this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my senior mother. The first mirror arrived cracked and Amazon quickly replaced it. The second mirror isn&#x27;t cordless and a great light. It&#x27;s dim in fact. It should be heavy to be stationary. I&#x27;ve owned several and this is the poorest version I&#x27;ve purchased. I&#x27;m in a different state and can&#x27;t handle the repeated returns for my mother or this one would go back as well. Lesson learned, buy a practice like this in person unless you know exactly what you are getting.</li>
            <li> Works better than advertised. Very nice looking unit. Handy.........</li>
            <li> This mirror has been heaven sent! I previously ordered another brand and it completely broke after less than a month! Took a chance on this one and LOVE it! I don&#x27;t utilize the cordless feature often because the light gradually dimmed (from battery use) over time. I found it better to just keep it plugged in at all times for maximum lighting. Very well lit, love the swivel, and magnification is PERFECT for any makeup junkie!</li>
            <li> It is nice and lightweight.  I like the cordless feature.</li>
            <li> Product received in December - used the light feature probably 5 times at most.  Already the lights don&#x27;t work - changed all the batteries and even plugged it in and NOTHING - of course now it can&#x27;t be returned</li>
            <li> I love the cordless mirror, but the light is terrible already..hard to tell whether the light is on or off.  The light was great when brand new, now it&#x27;s basically nonexistent.</li>
            <li> I love this mirror.  You can plug it in or go cordless.  The light is not too bright, not too dull!  The 10x magnification side really helps you see every little thing!  My whole family loves this mirror!  I am very happy with this mirror!</li>
            <li> Fab mirror no cord. Bought smaller one for travel also awesome!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this mirror and used it for one month before the light failed.  I&#x27;m returning it.  I also thought that the light made my skin look yellow.</li>
            <li> Bought the mirror in June.  The light has already quit working.  Very disappointed in the product.</li>
            <li> Great looking mirror, LED lights are bright, and I like the choice of batteries or the outlet plug. The 10x magnification side is too much, not very useful.</li>
            <li> Great lightweight mirror. Love the subtleness of the light, it&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> I had ordered this previously and loved it so much, I ordered it for our weekend place!  Great product! Protective packaging.</li>
            <li> The magnification is fine. But the lighting is not nearly as bright as I had hoped. The advertising indicated that it would be very bright and as I have poor lighting in my bathroom, I was hoping it would make a great difference.</li>
            <li> Mirror is great.. comes with a cord or you can use batteries.  It is quite tall...that would be my only complaint.  Otherwise it is great, the magnification is just what one needs to see everything.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this, so glad I got it.</li>
            <li> I will start off for giving my reason to rate this mirror with only 3 stars. The mirror while of very good quality,  simply had a magnification power way too powerful for my needs. If you have extremely poor eyesight, this mirror may be just waht you need. I was looking for a mirror to aid in applying eye makeup more evenly and for general eyebrow tweezing, etc. I returned this 10X mirror and purchased one with 5X magnification and that seems  perfect.</li>
            <li> I was happy with the size and mirror reflection, but the on/off switch was wobbly out of the box, downward pressure had to be applied to get it to work, and the switch broke off on my third try.  Obviously returning it.</li>
            <li> Bright.  Works well.  Sturdy and the finish is nice.</li>
            <li> This was a very nice gift for a friend no cord. All battery.</li>
            <li> This mirror stopped working after barely two months and now because it is 7 days past the return date I can&#x27;t return it.  I EXPECTED so much more for a $125 mirror.  I will be contacting customer service about this.</li>
            <li> oh my.....quite a close-up! but I am concerned over which direction to switch mirrors in order to avoid damage to wiring.....does it make a difference? Well built, big !</li>
            <li> Nice and large mirror with nice soft lighting around the mirror.  Good quality and I am very satisfied that it was worth the purchase price.</li>
            <li> Everything is great about the mirror, except the base is too tall for my wife.  She sits in a low chair and so the mirror was too tall for her liking. For most people this will not be an issue.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful mirror.  10 times maginified is just what I needed to see my face closer.  Love the fact that you can plug it in or use batteries which makes it useful for travel.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  The magnified side is great for detailed brow-grooming, applying eye makeup and the like.  Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great product love it.</li>
            <li> Exceptional quality. Tall which makes it easier for stand up makeup application. Easy to see eyebrow hairs for plucking! Great all around and looks lovely</li>
            <li> Love this mirror!! Strong light and love that it&#x27;s cordless!</li>
