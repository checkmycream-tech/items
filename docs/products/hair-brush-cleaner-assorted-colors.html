    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great idea.  </li>
            <li>If cleaning the brush is an issue, then this is a great tool for it.</li>
            <li>These were stocking stuffers for my daughter and granddaughter, both of whom loved them.  </li>
            <li>Good idea, though</li>
            <li>Arrived early and works great!</li>
            <li>I noticed my hairbrushes seem to collect dust really easily</li>
            <li>Cheap looking.  </li>
            <li>Very useful</li>
            <li>It used to take ten minutes to get a decent job, now it takes two to get it just about perfect.  </li>
            <li>took about 6 days to get but sooo worth the wait!</li>
            <li>Cool item.  </li>
            <li>The item appears to be well made and was delivered quickly.  </li>
            <li>I cannot believe how easy &amp; fast it was to clean my brush...go</li>
            <li>it wasnt worth 2 cents if it had 0 stars</li>
            <li>I bought it as a stocking stuffer but it wasn&#x27;t worth the money at all.</li>
            <li>This broke within seconds the first time I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>It will cost me more to ship it back.  </li>
            <li>The brush cleaner really digs into the hairbrush pulling the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; from the hairbrush out.  </li>
            <li>and the whole thing fell apart</li>
            <li>Simple to use, cleans really wellm, my brush hasn&#x27;t been this clean since I bought the darn thing.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, I actually came across this at my local dollar store and decided to give it a try because no matter what I do my hairbrushes are never as clean as I would like them to be.</li>
            <li>Great disappointment in the size.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money, I used it to clean one hair brush and the wires came completely out.</li>

            <li> Item is much smaller than I expected.  </li>
            <li> Not perfect, but so /sooooo/ much easier than trying to pick out the bits of hair by hand.</li>
            <li> Very small, should only be priced at $2</li>
            <li> Expected one that was at least hand size</li>
            <li> The handle is too small.  </li>
            <li> I used to do this by hand, and the difference in how difficult it is is hard to overstate.  </li>
            <li> THIS IS A REALLY BAD PRODUCT .  </li>
            <li> Worthless!</li>

            <li> This broke within seconds the first time I tried to use it. What a bummer!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this on Amazon, I actually came across this at my local dollar store and decided to give it a try because no matter what I do my hairbrushes are never as clean as I would like them to be. I noticed my hairbrushes seem to collect dust really easily and no matter what I did I could never get rid of it. This cleaner takes it out no problem along with all of the hair!! I&#x27;m going to go buy another two or three of these in case I ever lose this one.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, but so /sooooo/ much easier than trying to pick out the bits of hair by hand.</li>
            <li> This tiny tool actually worked wonders for me. Simple to use, cleans really wellm, my brush hasn&#x27;t been this clean since I bought the darn thing.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, I used it to clean one hair brush and the wires came completely out. Worthless!</li>

            <li> Great idea.  Very useful</li>
            <li> Arrived early and works great!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A REALLY BAD PRODUCT .  THE MINUTE I TOOK IT OUT IT FELL APART.</li>
            <li> I used once and it fell apart.  It will cost me more to ship it back.  Don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> Item is much smaller than I expected.  Product looks like it will do what it is intended to do.  The item appears to be well made and was delivered quickly.  This item is a present so I can not say how well it works.</li>
            <li> These were stocking stuffers for my daughter and granddaughter, both of whom loved them.  The brush cleaner really digs into the hairbrush pulling the &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; from the hairbrush out.  Cool item.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> Cheap looking.  The handle is too small.  Good idea, though</li>
            <li> Great disappointment in the size. Expected one that was at least hand size this is only about 2&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> This was a total joke! The minute in a ride and I check it out of the package it was one second and the whole thing fell apart it wasnt worth 2 cents if it had 0 stars I would give it 0 stars</li>
            <li> took about 6 days to get but sooo worth the wait! I cannot believe how easy &amp; fast it was to clean my brush...go</li>
            <li> You only get one - the picture makes it look like you get three.  I bought it as a stocking stuffer but it wasn&#x27;t worth the money at all.</li>
            <li> I used to do this by hand, and the difference in how difficult it is is hard to overstate.  It used to take ten minutes to get a decent job, now it takes two to get it just about perfect.  If cleaning the brush is an issue, then this is a great tool for it.</li>
