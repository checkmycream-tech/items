            <li>I use it and it makes me awesome.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely impressed with this product, the people at Dr. Bronner&#x27;s have gained a life-long customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s excellent as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it has worked for some people, but definetly a NO for us!!!</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant</li>
            <li>Very good product.</li>
            <li>This has tea tree oil which is very good for your scalp because it has anti-bacterial properties and it does reduce the incidence of dandruff...</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are very very good.  </li>
            <li>so it feels good to offer it to my family, and it has a wonderful (though acquired taste)</li>
            <li>Very satisfied!</li>
            <li>I had always liked that but not after seeing how wonderful my hair looks now.</li>
            <li>I just purchased this product a couple days ago after hearing all the great things about castile soaps.</li>
            <li>has me really happy with my skin.</li>
            <li>Great Item-Great Seller</li>
            <li>This is great soap for me.</li>
            <li>I THINK IT IS GREAT</li>
            <li>After a month my skin feels great</li>
            <li>Great for those with a sulfate allergy, too, as it contains no sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Tee tree oil is a great antiseptic and cleanser but can be VERY hazardous to your health if, for any reason, it is taken into your mouth.</li>
            <li>for that reason, I would recommend a very nice creamy conditioner to use or using a creamy shampoo for your hair while you put castile soap on your scalp.  </li>
            <li>For me the best way to dispense it is in a FOAMING SOAP DISPENSER, mix 1:4 ratio, more water than product.</li>
            <li>People have said that it doesn&#x27;t lather good</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good organic shampoo</li>
            <li>And i think it&#x27;s also good as a body soap</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m still in the search for a good organic shampoo.</li>
            <li>Its a good product.</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair feels like I&#x27;ve used a conditioner after a good thorough rinse.  </li>
            <li>, I however have not tried it in my hair because I use a good brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint castile soap, so I gave this a shot.</li>
            <li>As opposed to some cheap (I SMELL GOOD)And walking out of the shower as BUGGY as we went in....AND YOUR DELIVERY TIME WAS AWESOME</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>Its also works good to as a shampoo.</li>
            <li>Good Soap and Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Good stuff.</li>
            <li>then it probably isn&#x27;t good for you at all...  </li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and item was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is more than a soap!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>This is a switch we made - we both love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>but this soap is amazing</li>
            <li>So amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought the tee tree oil version and it was happy that it smelled like the genuine article.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I wanted to start making my own household cleaner; many of the recipes (that got good reviews) called for castile soap &amp; tea tree oil</li>
            <li>But the smell kind of reminds me of my grandmother&#x27;s cleaning closet.  </li>
            <li>For hair you need a conditiner with it though because it&#x27;s kind of drying.</li>
            <li>However, this works nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;- Nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Really nice hand soap.</li>
            <li>For $10 you get a really nice body wash that, if you don&#x27;t like it, you can use on your dishes.</li>
            <li>I will say though, don&#x27;t get the rose</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel clean, smells great...</li>
            <li>i just put a couple drops on my shower sponge and it lathers up great :) the tea tree smell is kinda strong</li>
            <li>The smell of the Tea Tree flavor is very strong and to me it smells like a musty basement.  </li>
            <li>It is amazing and it helped with my acne :)</li>
            <li>Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is better than any product I have used on my own or on any of my clients.  </li>
            <li>My hair has a perfect natural shine to it.</li>
            <li>Also - as far as skin care, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil soap for years, because it&#x27;s the best soap I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, this product works great!</li>
            <li>I bought it for him to help with dandruff, which it gets good reviews for being effective at, and it hasn&#x27;t done such a great job.</li>
            <li>but I believe that a cheaper conditioner, like Suave, may work better for this type of cleansing since it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li>My hair had more volume than it ever had before.</li>
            <li>but my husband likes this scent better plus better for your skin.</li>
            <li>I really love this Castile Soap.</li>
            <li>It washes away dirt better than any brand name pharmacy hand wash.</li>
            <li>also love the smell.</li>
            <li>That was a pretty successful experiment, but I decided I&#x27;d look around and try out something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love to wash my hands with this after a day of work.</li>
            <li>Personally, I love the smell and have purchased more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with.</li>
            <li>Has interesting &amp;#34;stories&amp;#34; printed on the bottle too.</li>
            <li>I wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just so glad that i no longer itch from my dandruff</li>
            <li>I love Dr Bronners and this was no exception.</li>
            <li>I also like that it&#x27;s safe for my family; no chemicals or ingredients</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t pronounce!! :)</li>
            <li>I love that product.  </li>
            <li>I love this one as well.  </li>
            <li>looks so much better.</li>
            <li>however I think its best to buy it at the Vitamin Shoppe or Target because i recently ordered some</li>
            <li>surely that is one of the uses.</li>
            <li>Now my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Fantastic soap!</li>
            <li>Love how concentrated this soap is.  </li>
            <li>this magic soap cured it in about a week.</li>
            <li>My husband says it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li>and I personally LOVE the smell of tea tree.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li>just because you can - it was ok</li>
            <li>so many are walking around with skin parasites and have NOT A CLUE.</li>
            <li>Like the many ways you can use it &amp; the fact that is has no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this soap on my face.</li>
            <li>Besides that I love it.</li>
            <li>I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but for some reason the smell of the Tea Tree is a bit offensive to my senses.</li>
            <li>Better than all of the greasy creams from the dermatologist!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hoped the smell would be a more fragrant tea tree.  </li>
            <li>OK smell but not what I had</li>
            <li>There is an interesting article about Dr. Bronner here:</li>
            <li>I would use some with a loofa, and I&#x27;d have to add more 2-3 a shower session.  </li>
            <li>I was going through way more of this</li>
            <li>and most organic shampoos dont work for an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>With just two drops of this stuff I&#x27;m able to rub it into a foamy mousse to apply to my scalp.  </li>
            <li>More than I was looking for</li>
            <li>to more eco-friendly soaps.  </li>
            <li>The soap is magic.</li>
            <li>You can use it on your face and hair and body, but I mostly use it because its magical.</li>
            <li>my favorite soap.</li>
            <li>My scalp has never felt better.  </li>
            <li>otherwise as a bodywash ok.</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li>it smells great, lasts forever and keeps me super clean.  </li>
            <li>It feels better, &amp; is just so refreshing &amp; clean when I use this!</li>
            <li>, i use it to clean my make up brushes and my hair brush, and it leaves them nice and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>after washing with this i have a nice clean scalp &amp; i can feel it.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and happy :)</li>
            <li>I followed up with Joico conditioner, however I&#x27;m sure whichever conditioner you may use will be fine</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it was cleaning just fine, but I have oily skin and need the &amp;#34;reassurance&amp;#34; soap lather provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Folks say you can brush your teeth with it, but I&#x27;ve never gone that far, lol.</li>
            <li>Also, it smells great and is all natural.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and my pimples dry up really quick!</li>
            <li>I use this daily and love how great my skin feels and smells.</li>
            <li>I love using it to clean my hardwood floors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very mildly tingly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit strong when you&#x27;re applying it, but it rinses away quite thoroughly.</li>
            <li>be diluted - this stuff is strong and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m ordering more right now!</li>
            <li>The bottle it self makes for an amusing read because most of what is on there in terms of \\&quot;quotes\\&quot; is utter gibberish while others kind of sort of(ish) make sense.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, great de-greasser but not the miracle cure for baked-on gunk that other buyers said it was.</li>
            <li>Also helps maintain acne free skin.</li>
            <li>My hair felt cleaner than it has ever felt but it was still silky smooth.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when a light bulb clicked on.</li>
            <li>Great for facial cleansing and house cleaning as well!!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a very herbal menthol kind of smell which I find pleasing.)</li>
            <li>This soap leaves you feeling oil free.</li>
            <li>It really is a great product with low environmental impact.</li>
            <li>I use the peppermint one as its widely available in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Interested</li>
            <li>Been using the peppermint brand which is great, was at fairway today and it was on sale for ten dollars, I purchased the tea tree oil and looking forward to use it.</li>
            <li>It is the best anti- seborrheic dermatitis shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, with the possible exception of daily use of prescription-strength ketoconazole 2% shampoo (it works better than the 1% Nizoral AD).  </li>
            <li>I am so excited that I have found Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap.</li>
            <li>This Tea Tree soap has a pretty potent scent.</li>
            <li>But seriously, this soap is easily one of the best products I have ever (EVER) used.  </li>
            <li>This soap, like it&#x27;s peppermint cousin, leaves me feeling clean and</li>
            <li>everything I clean turns out extremely clean, even my husband is a convert.</li>
            <li>for his bath time &amp; to clean his toys.</li>
            <li>you enjoy extraordinarily scented soaps, then this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li>I use it ,to clean almost anything.</li>
            <li>Your hair never has the squeaky clean feel/sound and when your done your hair feels like it may not be clean.  </li>
            <li>the reason i purchased this was because i read some review on pintrest that it works to clean pans.</li>
            <li>We TRULY DESIRE TO GET CLEAN WHEN BATHING.</li>
            <li>It sits in the shower unused next to its more popular siblings, Eucalyptus and Citrus.</li>
            <li>I never felt clean using this because it doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this a shampoo (which depending on water hardness, or hair type it can leave your hair a bit too squeaky clean), body wash.</li>
            <li>and I love that it&#x27;s organic and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Worked wonders, much faster &amp; better than the prescription steroids they prescribed.</li>
            <li>; i haven&#x27;t personally tried it, but nobody in the world has given it a good review, here or otherwise.</li>
            <li>The very first wash I had with it felt so incredibly clean.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin, either-a nice balance!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, it&#x27;s liquid tea tree soap, smells like tea tree oil and works to kill germs and other loathsome bugs...</li>
            <li>Smelled like tea tree without being overwhelming and I will be back to purchase more scents.</li>
            <li>My hair felt nice after using it and my curls seemed more loose and easier to manage and very soft :)</li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t really liked the smell, but after a couple of bath I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I really like this soap, and it will certainly be a staple in my house for a long time, given the incredible sinus clearing added bonus.  </li>
            <li>read all the other amazing reviews!</li>
            <li>A month later I am still odor free!!  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would, which is fine, but what I really didn&#x27;t like is that it made everything it touched turn orange and rusty.</li>
            <li>My hair looks and is very clean without any dry static, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all</li>
            <li>if i try to smile.</li>
            <li>So far i love how this soap feels on my skin</li>
            <li>, my cheeks are more smooth now and my chin too, so it definitely hasnt worsened my acne</li>
            <li>It just proves that all natural is better.</li>
            <li>I smell like fresh cut lumber getting out of the shower, and it lingers for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I have been on the hunt for more natural cleansers/shampoo etc.   </li>
            <li>My complexion is so clear, I don&#x27;t even wear foundation any more.</li>
            <li>used to very much enjoy the smell of tea tree oil, but this was so overwhelming that I could only use it as laundry detergent.</li>
            <li>It makes you feel super clean, but I felt like it went really fast.  </li>
            <li>I rarely write product reviews but I am compelled to after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Soap.  </li>
            <li>I got it on my nice stovetop griddle, and the thing now looks like I left it out in the rain for 3 years.</li>
            <li>I bought the 16oz bottle and it is worth your money.</li>
            <li>the castile soap left my skin soft, bright, clean and even in color.</li>
            <li>Used it to clean deep fryer and it worked magic on the fish grease in that</li>
            <li>I use it for my face too, and it is sooooo fresh after, and really feels clean.</li>
            <li>I really like the clean and fresh feeling</li>
            <li>, it goes away right after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It is moisturizing and not drying at all and really keeps his scalp and hair clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t take much at all to clean anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really like this soap for a body wash, I feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li>i really felt clean and invigorated.just leaves an awsome feeling.</li>
            <li>Smells great, not sure if it</li>
            <li>Good for half the body, and the loofah will generate suds.</li>
            <li>After you dry off though it has a nice woodsy scent.</li>
            <li>Overall its a very cost effective soap.</li>
            <li>This soap works very very very well with my hair.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use very much to get a lot of suds.</li>
            <li>The guy who first created this stuff</li>
            <li>This is my first time going Organic</li>
            <li>However, the product arrived one day late; and I was not too happy with that.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil in the product is a natural antiseptic which I&#x27;ve always used to treat light acne.</li>
            <li>I have pretty severe hormonal acne on my face</li>
            <li>It seems like I have to use a lot of it in the shower, even though for the most part I stand out of the water while I am washing myself, it has to be applied to the loufa a 2nd time.  </li>
            <li>love this as a facial scrub and also as a shampoo (body wash as well).  </li>
            <li>and I actually look forward to a refreshing shower.  </li>
            <li>lathers well, rinses well, and the tea tree oil really seems to calm my skin.</li>
            <li>The anti-microbial,anti-fungal &amp; anti-bacterial aspect of the soap is really evident.  </li>
            <li>suds very well and without all the chemicals in store cleansers!</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, using it daily keeps most of that stuff at bay.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I top it off with regular dual soap to help cut off some of the smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very excited to use it in different cleaning capacities!</li>
            <li>A few drops is what you need because it&#x27;s very strong and lathers well, the bottle lasts me a few months and is a great feeling after showering.</li>
            <li>The results:  my hair feels thicker, looks more lustrous (in a silky not slick way), it&#x27;s less tangled, and has an interesting texture.  </li>
            <li>Instead, I got this amazing soap that left my skin feeling baby soft and you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the job done either!</li>
            <li>I have finally started using this for cleaning and it works great for scrubbing out the sinks and the shower.</li>
            <li>I used it as a body wash as well, and my skin everywhere is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just thrilled to have finally found a solution to this years old problem.  </li>
            <li>but when I tried to clean off the baked-on stains on my old aluminum cookie sheets it didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleanses deep, and extremely coarse hair is best to be washed sparingly in order to preserve natural oils.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this soap did not give me any irritation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally pure</li>
            <li>a large bottle lasts for months because you can dilute them with water.</li>
            <li>Nizoral made my scalp really even more dry because of its KETO property.    </li>
            <li>The main thing is that it really does work!  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy this soap, and I actually mix this with the peppermint version (love the sensation) in a single bottle.</li>
            <li>I used another dab of conditioner and rinsed very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t dilute it, just used it straight.  </li>
            <li>After I wash my hands with antibacterial soap, I wash my hands with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, and I see how much stuff still comes off.</li>
            <li>I also found that it gets used up much faster than the liquid.</li>
            <li>It worked really well until my coconut oil got funky, after about a year.</li>
            <li>You can also use it on your face because it works very well</li>
            <li>And even then it made my whole basement smell of tea tree (the clothes didn&#x27;t smell like tea tree after drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very liquid, so make sure you are careful or else too much comes out.</li>
            <li>I bought this (16oz Tea Tree) for $9.99, and found the 32oz to be $10 at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>Too fast for the money</li>
            <li>This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather.  </li>
            <li>Castile soap as a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve really become fond of the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>it really kills odors and keeps them out.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve used this soap in the past and remembered it as a natural and mild, but effective soap.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect too much of a lather either, but a lather isn&#x27;t necessary to clean your locks.</li>
            <li>Along with this I get 8+ hours of sleep a night, plenty of regular exercise, and a clean diet with no processed foods.</li>
            <li>The soap does feel a bit drying on the skin initially, but it doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean like it does with sulphate soaps.  </li>
            <li>Her entire back from her neck to ankles turned bright red.</li>
            <li>I use sweet almond oil to moisturize my body and face so that mixed with using this soap</li>
            <li>but I found it to be more drying than the liquid soap, probably because it is more difficult to not accidentally use too much in bar form.</li>
            <li>So if you can take a little time out of your day to make sure you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
            <li>The all natural aspect of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s was the original thing that brought me to the product but then doing further research on the benefits of Tea Tree Oil was what really sealed the deal for me.  </li>
            <li>It was also gentle on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li>Just understand that natural products such as this do not have chemicals to make them suds up a huge amount.  </li>
            <li>After letting my hair air dry, I can lightly brush it out with no problems.</li>
            <li>My face has at times experienced the following conditions: oily, dry, oily and dry, acne cysts, whiteheads, blackheads, rosacea, and dermatitis.</li>
            <li>It is completely safe outside the body, though, for skin cleaning and such.</li>
            <li>I wrote \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; because this was the main reason why i bought this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this particular product for everything from shampoo and body wash to washing clothes and dishes.</li>
            <li>I use this particular Castile - Tea Tree product in the shower.  </li>
            <li>JUST HIGH PRICED</li>
            <li>This I highly Recommend.</li>
            <li>highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended</li>
            <li>I will for sure buy this again when i run out which probably wont be for a while since you need vety little amounts of the soap.</li>
            <li>i love how concentrated it is - a little</li>
            <li>However, very slowly over several months I noticed my skin was gradually looking better and better.</li>
            <li>As I was styling my hair, I noticed that the strands that fall out during a normal styling process were thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li>know there are SO many different uses for castile soap, so far I&#x27;ve only made an all-purpose cleaner with it and</li>
            <li>I love this soap and I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li>i think the &#x27;normal&#x27; soaps i was using were contributing to my problem.</li>
            <li>I throw this warning out there because other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s all-in-one soaps are advertised as being adequate toothpaste, but there is considerable research that shows Tee Tree Oil, while being organic and natural, is indeed hurtful towards your body if absorbed orally.</li>
            <li>The new age has no clue what it takes to shower or shampoo...</li>
            <li>I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for the face for anyone that has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It will really clear up what ails ya!  </li>
            <li>These issues have led me to spend hundreds of dollars throughout the years on various washes, creams, lotions, toners, prescription antibiotics and many other things I wish to never spend any time thinking about ever again.  </li>
            <li>Its natural properties strengthen the hair and leave it bouncy and beautiful even at that awkward length.</li>
            <li>In short: my professional opinion is to buy this soap and keep up with trims ;)</li>
            <li>so i mix it with the plain Aveeno body wash that I usually use and it is great.</li>
            <li>It dried smoothly and is noticeably denser, and still silky soft.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that gets very blotchy and red after I wash it and</li>
            <li>i dont expect my acne to clear all the way</li>
            <li>and it helps to keep it clear.   </li>
            <li>It has never irritated my skin and it leaves it looking even and clear.</li>
            <li>When I washed my hair with this soap, it felt really, really strange but don&#x27;t freak out if you use it and your hair feels funny while you&#x27;re in the shower.</li>
            <li>It cleanses deep and really creates a change to the hair.</li>
            <li>but i love that it at least has reduced the bumpiness on my face</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a very health-conscious individual</li>
            <li>I chose the tea tree variety because is supposedly naturally antiseptic/anti-inflammatory and even Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website recommends it for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but still unbearable frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this soap because it was so natural.</li>
            <li>It only takes a couple drops to wash your whole body.</li>
            <li>I should point out that my hair is naturally on the oily side so that might have something to do with my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough.</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Tea Tree oil is supposed to have natural anti-dandruff properties.</li>
            <li>So tea tree is a natural anti-microbial, &amp; microbes are part of the cause of acne.</li>
            <li>I have dealt with body odor the majority of my adult life.  </li>
            <li>that &#x27;funk&#x27; in my groin is completely gone.  </li>
            <li>also this soap is all natural and multipurpose.</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>howver, if one uses it frequent this is the result on face.</li>
            <li>As far as my acne goes, my face looks better already after only a few uses</li>
            <li>Well it works fantastic on my pale sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>For other uses, like cleaning counter tops, I haven&#x27;t really used it because I find the fact that you have to wash it off afterwards to be too much work.</li>
            <li>and I have used a million and a half different types of shampoos, as well as a ton of different kinds of face washes and body washes since I have access to try them all, or most of them anyway.</li>
            <li>After I conditioned, I used it a second time and the results were totally different than the first time.</li>
            <li>only advice would be to check at your local store first.</li>
            <li>Well first it has palm oil and 2nd who the heck writes such junk on a bottle?</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame that not many people are aware of the harsh detergents and silicone used in all shampoos and conditioners (professional products are always better than store bought conditioners, but they still have a lot of chemicals in them that should not be used on the hair).</li>
            <li>I am a 25 year old male and have struggled with very sensitive acne-prone skin since I was 16.</li>
            <li>really does go a long way.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry skin, ring worm or fungus type skin issues, this will really help it.  </li>
            <li>Long story short, I start using this product, and literally in the first week seen results.</li>
            <li>Used it as facial cleanser to clear up my acne!</li>
            <li>For that purpose, it&#x27;s pretty comparable to any other dandruff shampoo he&#x27;s tried.   </li>
            <li>I guess you could use it for general cleaning</li>
            <li>I have long coarse, highlighted hair and an oily scalp (really oily scalp).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lustrous in the way that only a natural soap could give, and I added in no additional products after showering.  </li>
            <li>If your hair is very tangled, which it may be after use, comb with awide tooth comb while the hair is wet.</li>
            <li>The water dries away and my hair is left nearly as frizzy as it would be without anything in it.</li>
            <li>I travel frequently and this is the only soap that I bring with me.  </li>
            <li>I have never experienced this with any product - not even the most luxurious anti-breakage shampoos.  </li>
            <li>Castille Soap&#x27;s main ingredients are water and coconut oil, followed by a bunch of other natural oils I wouldn&#x27;t mind leaving in my hair, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try as a leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li>I will keep buying this as long as I live.</li>
            <li>and I really like it as a body wash, though I can&#x27;t attest to its other uses.</li>
            <li>This one will suds up a little... and it cleans very very well.  </li>
            <li>I am half way through he bottle, and will be switching over to other soap as soon as it arrives in the mail, so this will be used for light household cleaning.   </li>
            <li>Okay, that&#x27;s a bit dramatic.</li>
            <li>but it definitely leaves my skin feeling cleaner than the chemical soaps from major retail stores.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple of insect bits and skin irritation, but after bathing in this soap a few times the bits and scars cleared up a little better than it has in the pass with regular soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ultra concentrated so make sure you use less soap than usual.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the one I&#x27;m using, because when I used a different &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t remember the name, but it&#x27;s in a orange wrapper; my face never dry out.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin or starting a go green life style.</li>
            <li>I have TV( tenia versicolor) and this soap has really helped to tone down the appearance of some of the spots I have on my neck and my back</li>
            <li>As a bath soap, it leaves you feeling squeaky clean (literally a bit rubberized, like tupperware) but not at all dried out like every other soap that has that property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not flat, but it&#x27;s not bouncy and voluminous either.</li>
            <li>I have very oily, thin hair, it is very long right now.</li>
            <li>Tea tree oil has a pungent and distinct smell, and I think most people would agree with that.&lt;br /&gt;All of the other Dr. Bronners&#x27; products I&#x27;ve tried were totally adequate and they didn&#x27;t have a terrible smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>All those other acne products were drying out my skin making it scaly &amp; not even making it clear!</li>
            <li>So basically, I think the reason it felt funny the first time I washed my hair was because the product was deeply cleansing my hair from all of the artificial softeners and chemicals that were in my hair already, and I use exclusively professional products which makes me feel like I was wasting a lot of money and time.</li>

            <li> I use it and it makes me awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely impressed with this product, the people at Dr. Bronner&#x27;s have gained a life-long customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s excellent as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it has worked for some people, but definetly a NO for us!!!</li>
            <li> The scent is very pleasant</li>
            <li> Very good product.</li>
            <li> This has tea tree oil which is very good for your scalp because it has anti-bacterial properties and it does reduce the incidence of dandruff...</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are very very good.  </li>
            <li> so it feels good to offer it to my family, and it has a wonderful (though acquired taste)</li>
            <li> Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> I had always liked that but not after seeing how wonderful my hair looks now.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product a couple days ago after hearing all the great things about castile soaps.</li>
            <li> has me really happy with my skin.</li>
            <li> Great Item-Great Seller</li>
            <li> This is great soap for me.</li>
            <li> I THINK IT IS GREAT</li>
            <li> After a month my skin feels great</li>
            <li> Great for those with a sulfate allergy, too, as it contains no sodium lauryl sulfate.</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> Tee tree oil is a great antiseptic and cleanser but can be VERY hazardous to your health if, for any reason, it is taken into your mouth.</li>
            <li> for that reason, I would recommend a very nice creamy conditioner to use or using a creamy shampoo for your hair while you put castile soap on your scalp.  </li>
            <li> For me the best way to dispense it is in a FOAMING SOAP DISPENSER, mix 1:4 ratio, more water than product.</li>
            <li> People have said that it doesn&#x27;t lather good</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good organic shampoo</li>
            <li> And i think it&#x27;s also good as a body soap</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m still in the search for a good organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> Its a good product.</li>
            <li> In fact, my hair feels like I&#x27;ve used a conditioner after a good thorough rinse.  </li>
            <li> , I however have not tried it in my hair because I use a good brand of shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint castile soap, so I gave this a shot.</li>
            <li> As opposed to some cheap (I SMELL GOOD)And walking out of the shower as BUGGY as we went in....AND YOUR DELIVERY TIME WAS AWESOME</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> Its also works good to as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good Soap and Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Good stuff.</li>
            <li> then it probably isn&#x27;t good for you at all...  </li>
            <li> Shipping was quick and item was in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is more than a soap!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> This is a switch we made - we both love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this cleanser!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> but this soap is amazing</li>
            <li> So amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought the tee tree oil version and it was happy that it smelled like the genuine article.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to start making my own household cleaner; many of the recipes (that got good reviews) called for castile soap &amp; tea tree oil</li>
            <li> But the smell kind of reminds me of my grandmother&#x27;s cleaning closet.  </li>
            <li> For hair you need a conditiner with it though because it&#x27;s kind of drying.</li>
            <li> However, this works nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;- Nice quality.  </li>
            <li> Really nice hand soap.</li>
            <li> For $10 you get a really nice body wash that, if you don&#x27;t like it, you can use on your dishes.</li>
            <li> I will say though, don&#x27;t get the rose</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean, smells great...</li>
            <li> i just put a couple drops on my shower sponge and it lathers up great :) the tea tree smell is kinda strong</li>
            <li> The smell of the Tea Tree flavor is very strong and to me it smells like a musty basement.  </li>
            <li> It is amazing and it helped with my acne :)</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is better than any product I have used on my own or on any of my clients.  </li>
            <li> My hair has a perfect natural shine to it.</li>
            <li> Also - as far as skin care, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil soap for years, because it&#x27;s the best soap I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this product works great!</li>
            <li> I bought it for him to help with dandruff, which it gets good reviews for being effective at, and it hasn&#x27;t done such a great job.</li>
            <li> but I believe that a cheaper conditioner, like Suave, may work better for this type of cleansing since it&#x27;s very light.</li>
            <li> My hair had more volume than it ever had before.</li>
            <li> but my husband likes this scent better plus better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I really love this Castile Soap.</li>
            <li> It washes away dirt better than any brand name pharmacy hand wash.</li>
            <li> also love the smell.</li>
            <li> That was a pretty successful experiment, but I decided I&#x27;d look around and try out something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love to wash my hands with this after a day of work.</li>
            <li> Personally, I love the smell and have purchased more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with.</li>
            <li> Has interesting &amp;#34;stories&amp;#34; printed on the bottle too.</li>
            <li> I wish it smelled better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just so glad that i no longer itch from my dandruff</li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronners and this was no exception.</li>
            <li> I also like that it&#x27;s safe for my family; no chemicals or ingredients</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t pronounce!! :)</li>
            <li> I love that product.  </li>
            <li> I love this one as well.  </li>
            <li> looks so much better.</li>
            <li> however I think its best to buy it at the Vitamin Shoppe or Target because i recently ordered some</li>
            <li> surely that is one of the uses.</li>
            <li> Now my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Fantastic soap!</li>
            <li> Love how concentrated this soap is.  </li>
            <li> this magic soap cured it in about a week.</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> and I personally LOVE the smell of tea tree.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap.  </li>
            <li> just because you can - it was ok</li>
            <li> so many are walking around with skin parasites and have NOT A CLUE.</li>
            <li> Like the many ways you can use it &amp; the fact that is has no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this soap on my face.</li>
            <li> Besides that I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but for some reason the smell of the Tea Tree is a bit offensive to my senses.</li>
            <li> Better than all of the greasy creams from the dermatologist!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hoped the smell would be a more fragrant tea tree.  </li>
            <li> OK smell but not what I had</li>
            <li> There is an interesting article about Dr. Bronner here:</li>
            <li> I would use some with a loofa, and I&#x27;d have to add more 2-3 a shower session.  </li>
            <li> I was going through way more of this</li>
            <li> and most organic shampoos dont work for an oily scalp.</li>
            <li> With just two drops of this stuff I&#x27;m able to rub it into a foamy mousse to apply to my scalp.  </li>
            <li> More than I was looking for</li>
            <li> to more eco-friendly soaps.  </li>
            <li> The soap is magic.</li>
            <li> You can use it on your face and hair and body, but I mostly use it because its magical.</li>
            <li> my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> My scalp has never felt better.  </li>
            <li> otherwise as a bodywash ok.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  </li>
            <li> it smells great, lasts forever and keeps me super clean.  </li>
            <li> It feels better, &amp; is just so refreshing &amp; clean when I use this!</li>
            <li> , i use it to clean my make up brushes and my hair brush, and it leaves them nice and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> after washing with this i have a nice clean scalp &amp; i can feel it.</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and happy :)</li>
            <li> I followed up with Joico conditioner, however I&#x27;m sure whichever conditioner you may use will be fine</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it was cleaning just fine, but I have oily skin and need the &amp;#34;reassurance&amp;#34; soap lather provides.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Folks say you can brush your teeth with it, but I&#x27;ve never gone that far, lol.</li>
            <li> Also, it smells great and is all natural.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and my pimples dry up really quick!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love how great my skin feels and smells.</li>
            <li> I love using it to clean my hardwood floors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very mildly tingly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit strong when you&#x27;re applying it, but it rinses away quite thoroughly.</li>
            <li> be diluted - this stuff is strong and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m ordering more right now!</li>
            <li> The bottle it self makes for an amusing read because most of what is on there in terms of \\&quot;quotes\\&quot; is utter gibberish while others kind of sort of(ish) make sense.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, great de-greasser but not the miracle cure for baked-on gunk that other buyers said it was.</li>
            <li> Also helps maintain acne free skin.</li>
            <li> My hair felt cleaner than it has ever felt but it was still silky smooth.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when a light bulb clicked on.</li>
            <li> Great for facial cleansing and house cleaning as well!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a very herbal menthol kind of smell which I find pleasing.)</li>
            <li> This soap leaves you feeling oil free.</li>
            <li> It really is a great product with low environmental impact.</li>
            <li> I use the peppermint one as its widely available in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Interested</li>
            <li> Been using the peppermint brand which is great, was at fairway today and it was on sale for ten dollars, I purchased the tea tree oil and looking forward to use it.</li>
            <li> It is the best anti- seborrheic dermatitis shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, with the possible exception of daily use of prescription-strength ketoconazole 2% shampoo (it works better than the 1% Nizoral AD).  </li>
            <li> I am so excited that I have found Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap.</li>
            <li> This Tea Tree soap has a pretty potent scent.</li>
            <li> But seriously, this soap is easily one of the best products I have ever (EVER) used.  </li>
            <li> This soap, like it&#x27;s peppermint cousin, leaves me feeling clean and</li>
            <li> everything I clean turns out extremely clean, even my husband is a convert.</li>
            <li> for his bath time &amp; to clean his toys.</li>
            <li> you enjoy extraordinarily scented soaps, then this is the soap for you.</li>
            <li> I use it ,to clean almost anything.</li>
            <li> Your hair never has the squeaky clean feel/sound and when your done your hair feels like it may not be clean.  </li>
            <li> the reason i purchased this was because i read some review on pintrest that it works to clean pans.</li>
            <li> We TRULY DESIRE TO GET CLEAN WHEN BATHING.</li>
            <li> It sits in the shower unused next to its more popular siblings, Eucalyptus and Citrus.</li>
            <li> I never felt clean using this because it doesn&#x27;t lather.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a shampoo (which depending on water hardness, or hair type it can leave your hair a bit too squeaky clean), body wash.</li>
            <li> and I love that it&#x27;s organic and gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Worked wonders, much faster &amp; better than the prescription steroids they prescribed.</li>
            <li> ; i haven&#x27;t personally tried it, but nobody in the world has given it a good review, here or otherwise.</li>
            <li> The very first wash I had with it felt so incredibly clean.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin, either-a nice balance!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it&#x27;s liquid tea tree soap, smells like tea tree oil and works to kill germs and other loathsome bugs...</li>
            <li> Smelled like tea tree without being overwhelming and I will be back to purchase more scents.</li>
            <li> My hair felt nice after using it and my curls seemed more loose and easier to manage and very soft :)</li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really liked the smell, but after a couple of bath I cannot live without it.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, and it will certainly be a staple in my house for a long time, given the incredible sinus clearing added bonus.  </li>
            <li> read all the other amazing reviews!</li>
            <li> A month later I am still odor free!!  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would, which is fine, but what I really didn&#x27;t like is that it made everything it touched turn orange and rusty.</li>
            <li> My hair looks and is very clean without any dry static, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all</li>
            <li> if i try to smile.</li>
            <li> So far i love how this soap feels on my skin</li>
            <li> , my cheeks are more smooth now and my chin too, so it definitely hasnt worsened my acne</li>
            <li> It just proves that all natural is better.</li>
            <li> I smell like fresh cut lumber getting out of the shower, and it lingers for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for more natural cleansers/shampoo etc.   </li>
            <li> My complexion is so clear, I don&#x27;t even wear foundation any more.</li>
            <li> used to very much enjoy the smell of tea tree oil, but this was so overwhelming that I could only use it as laundry detergent.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel super clean, but I felt like it went really fast.  </li>
            <li> I rarely write product reviews but I am compelled to after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Soap.  </li>
            <li> I got it on my nice stovetop griddle, and the thing now looks like I left it out in the rain for 3 years.</li>
            <li> I bought the 16oz bottle and it is worth your money.</li>
            <li> the castile soap left my skin soft, bright, clean and even in color.</li>
            <li> Used it to clean deep fryer and it worked magic on the fish grease in that</li>
            <li> I use it for my face too, and it is sooooo fresh after, and really feels clean.</li>
            <li> I really like the clean and fresh feeling</li>
            <li> , it goes away right after you get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> It is moisturizing and not drying at all and really keeps his scalp and hair clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t take much at all to clean anything.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really like this soap for a body wash, I feel so clean after using it.</li>
            <li> i really felt clean and invigorated.just leaves an awsome feeling.</li>
            <li> Smells great, not sure if it</li>
            <li> Good for half the body, and the loofah will generate suds.</li>
            <li> After you dry off though it has a nice woodsy scent.</li>
            <li> Overall its a very cost effective soap.</li>
            <li> This soap works very very very well with my hair.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use very much to get a lot of suds.</li>
            <li> The guy who first created this stuff</li>
            <li> This is my first time going Organic</li>
            <li> However, the product arrived one day late; and I was not too happy with that.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil in the product is a natural antiseptic which I&#x27;ve always used to treat light acne.</li>
            <li> I have pretty severe hormonal acne on my face</li>
            <li> It seems like I have to use a lot of it in the shower, even though for the most part I stand out of the water while I am washing myself, it has to be applied to the loufa a 2nd time.  </li>
            <li> love this as a facial scrub and also as a shampoo (body wash as well).  </li>
            <li> and I actually look forward to a refreshing shower.  </li>
            <li> lathers well, rinses well, and the tea tree oil really seems to calm my skin.</li>
            <li> The anti-microbial,anti-fungal &amp; anti-bacterial aspect of the soap is really evident.  </li>
            <li> suds very well and without all the chemicals in store cleansers!</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, using it daily keeps most of that stuff at bay.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I top it off with regular dual soap to help cut off some of the smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to use it in different cleaning capacities!</li>
            <li> A few drops is what you need because it&#x27;s very strong and lathers well, the bottle lasts me a few months and is a great feeling after showering.</li>
            <li> The results:  my hair feels thicker, looks more lustrous (in a silky not slick way), it&#x27;s less tangled, and has an interesting texture.  </li>
            <li> Instead, I got this amazing soap that left my skin feeling baby soft and you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the job done either!</li>
            <li> I have finally started using this for cleaning and it works great for scrubbing out the sinks and the shower.</li>
            <li> I used it as a body wash as well, and my skin everywhere is soft and clean.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just thrilled to have finally found a solution to this years old problem.  </li>
            <li> but when I tried to clean off the baked-on stains on my old aluminum cookie sheets it didn&#x27;t really do much.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleanses deep, and extremely coarse hair is best to be washed sparingly in order to preserve natural oils.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this soap did not give me any irritation</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally pure</li>
            <li> a large bottle lasts for months because you can dilute them with water.</li>
            <li> Nizoral made my scalp really even more dry because of its KETO property.    </li>
            <li> The main thing is that it really does work!  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy this soap, and I actually mix this with the peppermint version (love the sensation) in a single bottle.</li>
            <li> I used another dab of conditioner and rinsed very thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t dilute it, just used it straight.  </li>
            <li> After I wash my hands with antibacterial soap, I wash my hands with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, and I see how much stuff still comes off.</li>
            <li> I also found that it gets used up much faster than the liquid.</li>
            <li> It worked really well until my coconut oil got funky, after about a year.</li>
            <li> You can also use it on your face because it works very well</li>
            <li> And even then it made my whole basement smell of tea tree (the clothes didn&#x27;t smell like tea tree after drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very liquid, so make sure you are careful or else too much comes out.</li>
            <li> I bought this (16oz Tea Tree) for $9.99, and found the 32oz to be $10 at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li> Too fast for the money</li>
            <li> This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather.  </li>
            <li> Castile soap as a gentle cleanser.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve really become fond of the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> it really kills odors and keeps them out.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this soap in the past and remembered it as a natural and mild, but effective soap.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect too much of a lather either, but a lather isn&#x27;t necessary to clean your locks.</li>
            <li> Along with this I get 8+ hours of sleep a night, plenty of regular exercise, and a clean diet with no processed foods.</li>
            <li> The soap does feel a bit drying on the skin initially, but it doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean like it does with sulphate soaps.  </li>
            <li> Her entire back from her neck to ankles turned bright red.</li>
            <li> I use sweet almond oil to moisturize my body and face so that mixed with using this soap</li>
            <li> but I found it to be more drying than the liquid soap, probably because it is more difficult to not accidentally use too much in bar form.</li>
            <li> So if you can take a little time out of your day to make sure you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> The all natural aspect of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s was the original thing that brought me to the product but then doing further research on the benefits of Tea Tree Oil was what really sealed the deal for me.  </li>
            <li> It was also gentle on my new tattoo.</li>
            <li> Just understand that natural products such as this do not have chemicals to make them suds up a huge amount.  </li>
            <li> After letting my hair air dry, I can lightly brush it out with no problems.</li>
            <li> My face has at times experienced the following conditions: oily, dry, oily and dry, acne cysts, whiteheads, blackheads, rosacea, and dermatitis.</li>
            <li> It is completely safe outside the body, though, for skin cleaning and such.</li>
            <li> I wrote \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; because this was the main reason why i bought this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this particular product for everything from shampoo and body wash to washing clothes and dishes.</li>
            <li> I use this particular Castile - Tea Tree product in the shower.  </li>
            <li> JUST HIGH PRICED</li>
            <li> This I highly Recommend.</li>
            <li> highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> I will for sure buy this again when i run out which probably wont be for a while since you need vety little amounts of the soap.</li>
            <li> i love how concentrated it is - a little</li>
            <li> However, very slowly over several months I noticed my skin was gradually looking better and better.</li>
            <li> As I was styling my hair, I noticed that the strands that fall out during a normal styling process were thicker and stronger.</li>
            <li> know there are SO many different uses for castile soap, so far I&#x27;ve only made an all-purpose cleaner with it and</li>
            <li> I love this soap and I use it everyday now.</li>
            <li> i think the &#x27;normal&#x27; soaps i was using were contributing to my problem.</li>
            <li> I throw this warning out there because other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s all-in-one soaps are advertised as being adequate toothpaste, but there is considerable research that shows Tee Tree Oil, while being organic and natural, is indeed hurtful towards your body if absorbed orally.</li>
            <li> The new age has no clue what it takes to shower or shampoo...</li>
            <li> I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for the face for anyone that has very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It will really clear up what ails ya!  </li>
            <li> These issues have led me to spend hundreds of dollars throughout the years on various washes, creams, lotions, toners, prescription antibiotics and many other things I wish to never spend any time thinking about ever again.  </li>
            <li> Its natural properties strengthen the hair and leave it bouncy and beautiful even at that awkward length.</li>
            <li> In short: my professional opinion is to buy this soap and keep up with trims ;)</li>
            <li> so i mix it with the plain Aveeno body wash that I usually use and it is great.</li>
            <li> It dried smoothly and is noticeably denser, and still silky soft.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that gets very blotchy and red after I wash it and</li>
            <li> i dont expect my acne to clear all the way</li>
            <li> and it helps to keep it clear.   </li>
            <li> It has never irritated my skin and it leaves it looking even and clear.</li>
            <li> When I washed my hair with this soap, it felt really, really strange but don&#x27;t freak out if you use it and your hair feels funny while you&#x27;re in the shower.</li>
            <li> It cleanses deep and really creates a change to the hair.</li>
            <li> but i love that it at least has reduced the bumpiness on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a very health-conscious individual</li>
            <li> I chose the tea tree variety because is supposedly naturally antiseptic/anti-inflammatory and even Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website recommends it for acne-prone skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but still unbearable frizzy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I ordered this soap because it was so natural.</li>
            <li> It only takes a couple drops to wash your whole body.</li>
            <li> I should point out that my hair is naturally on the oily side so that might have something to do with my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough.</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Tea Tree oil is supposed to have natural anti-dandruff properties.</li>
            <li> So tea tree is a natural anti-microbial, &amp; microbes are part of the cause of acne.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with body odor the majority of my adult life.  </li>
            <li> that &#x27;funk&#x27; in my groin is completely gone.  </li>
            <li> also this soap is all natural and multipurpose.</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> howver, if one uses it frequent this is the result on face.</li>
            <li> As far as my acne goes, my face looks better already after only a few uses</li>
            <li> Well it works fantastic on my pale sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> For other uses, like cleaning counter tops, I haven&#x27;t really used it because I find the fact that you have to wash it off afterwards to be too much work.</li>
            <li> and I have used a million and a half different types of shampoos, as well as a ton of different kinds of face washes and body washes since I have access to try them all, or most of them anyway.</li>
            <li> After I conditioned, I used it a second time and the results were totally different than the first time.</li>
            <li> only advice would be to check at your local store first.</li>
            <li> Well first it has palm oil and 2nd who the heck writes such junk on a bottle?</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a shame that not many people are aware of the harsh detergents and silicone used in all shampoos and conditioners (professional products are always better than store bought conditioners, but they still have a lot of chemicals in them that should not be used on the hair).</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old male and have struggled with very sensitive acne-prone skin since I was 16.</li>
            <li> really does go a long way.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry skin, ring worm or fungus type skin issues, this will really help it.  </li>
            <li> Long story short, I start using this product, and literally in the first week seen results.</li>
            <li> Used it as facial cleanser to clear up my acne!</li>
            <li> For that purpose, it&#x27;s pretty comparable to any other dandruff shampoo he&#x27;s tried.   </li>
            <li> I guess you could use it for general cleaning</li>
            <li> I have long coarse, highlighted hair and an oily scalp (really oily scalp).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lustrous in the way that only a natural soap could give, and I added in no additional products after showering.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is very tangled, which it may be after use, comb with awide tooth comb while the hair is wet.</li>
            <li> The water dries away and my hair is left nearly as frizzy as it would be without anything in it.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and this is the only soap that I bring with me.  </li>
            <li> I have never experienced this with any product - not even the most luxurious anti-breakage shampoos.  </li>
            <li> Castille Soap&#x27;s main ingredients are water and coconut oil, followed by a bunch of other natural oils I wouldn&#x27;t mind leaving in my hair, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try as a leave-in treatment.</li>
            <li> I will keep buying this as long as I live.</li>
            <li> and I really like it as a body wash, though I can&#x27;t attest to its other uses.</li>
            <li> This one will suds up a little... and it cleans very very well.  </li>
            <li> I am half way through he bottle, and will be switching over to other soap as soon as it arrives in the mail, so this will be used for light household cleaning.   </li>
            <li> Okay, that&#x27;s a bit dramatic.</li>
            <li> but it definitely leaves my skin feeling cleaner than the chemical soaps from major retail stores.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of insect bits and skin irritation, but after bathing in this soap a few times the bits and scars cleared up a little better than it has in the pass with regular soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ultra concentrated so make sure you use less soap than usual.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the one I&#x27;m using, because when I used a different &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t remember the name, but it&#x27;s in a orange wrapper; my face never dry out.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin or starting a go green life style.</li>
            <li> I have TV( tenia versicolor) and this soap has really helped to tone down the appearance of some of the spots I have on my neck and my back</li>
            <li> As a bath soap, it leaves you feeling squeaky clean (literally a bit rubberized, like tupperware) but not at all dried out like every other soap that has that property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not flat, but it&#x27;s not bouncy and voluminous either.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, thin hair, it is very long right now.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has a pungent and distinct smell, and I think most people would agree with that.&lt;br /&gt;All of the other Dr. Bronners&#x27; products I&#x27;ve tried were totally adequate and they didn&#x27;t have a terrible smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> All those other acne products were drying out my skin making it scaly &amp; not even making it clear!</li>
            <li> So basically, I think the reason it felt funny the first time I washed my hair was because the product was deeply cleansing my hair from all of the artificial softeners and chemicals that were in my hair already, and I use exclusively professional products which makes me feel like I was wasting a lot of money and time.</li>
            <li> I have normal textured hair, slightly wavy with regular thickness.</li>
            <li> a shampoo, it cleans my scalp, makes my hair soft, and alleviates the occasional dirty-head-itch very well, whereas some shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners make that worse.</li>
            <li> I have tried Dr. Bronners in the past and found it too drying, now thanks to the reviews I know to dilute it and use in a foaming pump to wash my hands with.</li>
            <li> She diagnosed the bumps as flat warts, numbed his head, took skin samples, etc.  </li>
            <li> so the bottle should last a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I long forgot - a feeling back when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;m probably using way too much, as a tiny bit goes a very long way.  </li>
            <li> I also tend to get dry skin on my body after I shower for several hours.</li>
            <li> I do wish it didn&#x27;t make my face feel dry after I wash it, because I almost instantly have to put something, lotion or something on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy and found it left my skin rather dry feeling.</li>
            <li> It washes away quickly, leaving a feeling of cleanliness behind if used in the shower.</li>
            <li> I have long frizzy hair that is to the middle of my back when wet, and it&#x27;s a giant ear-length puff ball when dry and untreated.</li>
            <li> Use it if you&#x27;re curious and don&#x27;t freak out if it feels different!</li>
            <li> those with long hair).</li>
            <li> I have used Tea Tree stuff before but never a natural product, so I was not expecting this.    </li>
            <li> A bit strange.  </li>
            <li> Even after a long day at work I get home and there is no odor.  </li>
            <li> and it was definitely diluted and luckily I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t put it on my skin before testing it.</li>
            <li> It lasts a very long time but it does not dispense well in pumps.</li>
            <li> You should never wash the ends of your hair with any shampoo because it&#x27;s just going to dry it out.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.</li>
            <li> When I dried my hair shortly after showering, I noticed several things:  1)</li>
            <li> My routine was to leave a moderate amount of extra virgin coconut oil in my hair after every shower to weigh my hair down, and make the curls clump together a bit, without it looking greasy or making my head itch as other leave-in hair greases tended to do.</li>
            <li> It sucked every single drop of oil out of my hands though so use with plastic gloves.</li>
            <li> My husband and I recently switched from conventional soaps, etc.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that it smells like pine-sol, So after a bath with it</li>
            <li> Since my husband doesn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with it for other purposes, and even as plain old body wash</li>
            <li> so I was really looking for a product that would work, other than the All Natural Soaps I tried which have Failed me.</li>
            <li> You only need a small amount to lather your entire body.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat large pores and it shrunk them, which I have never experienced before.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While it&#x27;s a bit steep price-wise up front, you need only a little bit of it depending on your use.</li>
            <li> It dosent over dry like a myriad of other soaps/liquids I have tried.</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful what I put on my head</li>
            <li> No real need for yet another 5-star review but the product promotion does not mention using loofah.</li>
            <li> Water and a few essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not fond of the \\&quot;squeaky\\</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> (I have slightly thin, straight hair).</li>
            <li> If a soap product such as this suds up heavily...</li>
            <li> i dilute it half and half with water and use it to wash my face and my naturally coarse and curly hair (i have itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this would work on my 4-year old daughter who suffers from eczema.</li>
            <li> Believe me- a little amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little does go a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> Of course we are in the middle of a nasty winter up here in Michigan, with the lakes almost completely frozen over for the first time in over 30 years and the air has been very dry outside.</li>
            <li> Never brush wet hair!  </li>
            <li> After this bottle I&#x27;m going to experiment and see if I can use some of the other scents without needing tea tree anymore.</li>
            <li> Despite what other reviewers have said, with 10 or 20 drops of the stuff, it lathers and forms suds quite well in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE THIS OR ANY OTHER TEA TREE OIL PRODUCT</li>
            <li> I put only small amount.  </li>
            <li> Not like other shampoo which creates like a \\&quot;bubble\\&quot; effect all though out the process, this one however just lathers as soon as you put it.  </li>
            <li> I have tried other shampoo from Head &amp; Shoulder,</li>
            <li> so she was not willing to try it, she is gradually opening to the idea tho - the soap not the NMA.</li>
            <li> I have used other Castile soaps, but I found this batch to be rather watery.</li>
            <li> Due to its watery nature I would expect it to work well in a foaming soap dispenser as well.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read some state that it will dry out your hair/scalp if you use it as a shampoo - its made with olive oil for Pete&#x27;s sake ! ! !  </li>
            <li> My hair is colored with a demi-permanent hair color which makes the hair super shiny, but almost in an artificial way.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it does not have nearly the same effect on my hair.</li>
            <li> What this does to your hair, you&#x27;ll love it or hate it depending on how you like your hair and probably the nature of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Smells like crap, but I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair feels weighed down, each strand feels like it&#x27;s coated with oil-  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t water mine down.</li>
            <li> I also use it a couple of times a week on my combination skin and it does not leave my face dry or slick.  </li>
            <li> I was looking for an organic non-harsh shampoo to deal with my persistent, extremely dry, flaky scalp which lead to my hair shedding for the past 2 months now.    </li>
            <li> have limp, long, thin, black hair (Asian type).  </li>
            <li> I have seen less breakouts and my skin does not feel stripped.</li>
            <li> I started looking into organic skin care products, but I also wanted to find something that didn&#x27;t have tons of crazy exotic ingredients that might continue irritating my skin.</li>
            <li> YOU HIDDEN DIRT AND PARTICLES</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling so tight that it feels like my face might crack</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to dry something that doesn&#x27;t make my face burn, or itch after washing it.</li>
            <li> Since it is not a mild type of soap, I put on heavy moisturizer to keep my face hydrated.</li>
            <li> AND IN WAALGREENS IT LOOKS A LITTLE THICKER</li>
            <li> , i also use it on my face, and it is a little drying also, but i like it as face soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little drying, but since I&#x27;m using it during the sweaty Houston summer, this is not a concern.</li>
            <li> I just kinda put some in my hand mix w/ a little shower water &amp; lather.</li>
            <li> I used it on my hair and it was a little to harsh.</li>
            <li> so I think that he must of been some kind of insane genius!</li>
            <li> I spend an unnecessary amount of time researching different products and experimenting.</li>
            <li> To moisturize his hair afterwards, I now use coconut oil instead of heavy oils and creams.  </li>
            <li> I shouldn&#x27;t wash it everyday)</li>
            <li> I ended up looking at their website, after several hours of reading the story behind its creation and Dr Bronner&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t smell like tea tree I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to do with the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> But needless to say, I will be using only Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Usually fill it with 1/4th of the tea tree and the rest with the peppermint.</li>
            <li> and I know that tea tree oil has helped in the past.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s become quite expensive and/or more difficult to find.</li>
            <li> We were regular users of this product and will not use again since we discovered it uses olive oil illegally stolen from Israel occupied Palestnian lands in West bank and Gaza.  </li>
            <li> Although somewhat expensive, it goes a long way</li>
            <li> It is too too drying, i can&#x27;t even comb it, it just looks too dry and weird.</li>
            <li> however, the caveat is that it makes your hair tangled up &amp; hard to manage.</li>
            <li> If I choose not to eat disgusting preservatives and additive chemicals, why am I applying similar things directly to my face?</li>
            <li> Some have complained about the smell of the tea-tree oil version.  </li>
            <li> Well, that was all I needed to at least give it a try after seeing what he had to go through in order to be treated at the dermatologist.</li>
            <li> (I know some reviewers have complained about it</li>
            <li> Disappointing to see that after my purchase, but I picked up the 32oz of the Peppermint + Hemp for the same price!</li>
            <li> A must have product, to say the least.</li>
            <li> These are lands stolen from Palestinian owners by Israel, where now Palestinians are forced to work at slave wages to produce these ingredients.  </li>
            <li> but I got it to try as a body wash, which was a failure.  </li>
            <li> i am currently deployed to iraq and was having a bad case of itchy skin from the heat and hard water.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a tea tree oil soap for cutting down on acne.</li>
            <li> and it was driving me half crazy.</li>
            <li> The soap is thin like water.  </li>
            <li> After some time, they became worse and we began to notice bumps and scaly portions on his scalp.  </li>
            <li> Some may get the same results as me and be appalled.  </li>
            <li> I need something for my face, which was getting worse by the day.</li>
            <li> so it was so disappointing that I had such bad skin problems.</li>
            <li> to my failed experiment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use coconut oil in my hair as a sort of leave-in conditioner or treatment.</li>
            <li> I was also hoping it would help with folliculitis, but as that&#x27;s an intermittent problem to begin with, it&#x27;s difficult to say.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of tea tree oil now sends my stomach churning</li>
            <li> I know it sounds weird.  </li>
            <li> We will no longer use products like this, where companies profit off the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands</li>
            <li> I have used it twice in the shower after doing a dirty job, rinsed, then used the hemp almond to cover the smell.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, we have used this to wash his hair every since!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s either helping slightly or, at worst, not making it worse.  </li>
            <li> It was painful to watch.  </li>
            <li> About six months ago my face just looked chemically burned from all the crap I had been slathering on it for years.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews, and a couple of them being about using this soap as a shampoo, i gave it a try, and my hair looks awful!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very uncomfortable!!!  </li>
            <li> and I feel just horrible for putting her through that.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t really liked the smell, but after a couple of bath I cannot live without it. It&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.I use this for a bodywash,shampoo, and face wash in the morning.It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling so tight that it feels like my face might crack if i try to smile.People have said that it doesn&#x27;t lather good but it does for me don&#x27;t know what they were talking about.Also helps maintain acne free skin.I highly recommend this product to anybody with sensitive skin or starting a go green life style.</li>
            <li> The guy who first created this stuff Dr.Bonner what a utter nut job but this soap is amazing so I think that he must of been some kind of insane genius! I have scalp psoriasis so I have to be careful what I put on my head and so I tried this out figuring that it would be okayish. Instead, I got this amazing soap that left my skin feeling baby soft and you don&#x27;t need to use much to get the job done either! Just about a nickel to quarter sized portion is perfect for washing everything! Head to toe! The bottle it self makes for an amusing read because most of what is on there in terms of \\&quot;quotes\\&quot; is utter gibberish while others kind of sort of(ish) make sense.</li>
            <li> This is my first time going Organic and I was nervious. I used to use shampoos and conditioners that had ingredients unkown to me (SLS) and (SLES). I needed a shampoo and body wash that did not contain either ingredient. I bousght this product because it does not contain neither (SLS) and/or (SLES). This soap works very very very well with my hair. I do not even need an after shampoo conditioner. For me, this soap does both. It cleanses both the hair and scalp; and it conditions it. After letting my hair air dry, I can lightly brush it out with no problems. I like using the soap as a body wash, because of acne issues. I have seen less breakouts and my skin does not feel stripped. Very good product. However, the product arrived one day late; and I was not too happy with that. I hope in the future it will arrive on time. Thank you!</li>
            <li> No real need for yet another 5-star review but the product promotion does not mention using loofah. Get a big fat one and pour several drops of Bronners on it. Good for half the body, and the loofah will generate suds. The best vegetarian washing system imaginable.</li>
            <li> It is amazing and it helped with my acne :)</li>
            <li> Okay, that&#x27;s a bit dramatic. But seriously, this soap is easily one of the best products I have ever (EVER) used.  I&#x27;m a cosmetologist and I have used a million and a half different types of shampoos, as well as a ton of different kinds of face washes and body washes since I have access to try them all, or most of them anyway. It&#x27;s a shame that not many people are aware of the harsh detergents and silicone used in all shampoos and conditioners (professional products are always better than store bought conditioners, but they still have a lot of chemicals in them that should not be used on the hair). I have yet to try the conditioner but I&#x27;ll be ordering it soon. Please trust my opinion on this product! I spend an unnecessary amount of time researching different products and experimenting. Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is better than any product I have used on my own or on any of my clients.  When I washed my hair with this soap, it felt really, really strange but don&#x27;t freak out if you use it and your hair feels funny while you&#x27;re in the shower. It&#x27;s totally pure so it isn&#x27;t going to feel a thing like regular shampoo. It&#x27;s actual liquid - like water - so rub it in your hands and massage it on your scalp. You should never wash the ends of your hair with any shampoo because it&#x27;s just going to dry it out. Shampoo should only get the excess oils out of the hair close to the scalp. I followed up with Joico conditioner, however I&#x27;m sure whichever conditioner you may use will be fine but I believe that a cheaper conditioner, like Suave, may work better for this type of cleansing since it&#x27;s very light. After I conditioned, I used it a second time and the results were totally different than the first time. My hair felt cleaner than it has ever felt but it was still silky smooth. I used another dab of conditioner and rinsed very thoroughly. When I dried my hair shortly after showering, I noticed several things:  1) My hair had more volume than it ever had before. I have normal textured hair, slightly wavy with regular thickness. It&#x27;s not flat, but it&#x27;s not bouncy and voluminous either. But it is now! It dried smoothly and is noticeably denser, and still silky soft.  2) My hair has a perfect natural shine to it. My hair is colored with a demi-permanent hair color which makes the hair super shiny, but almost in an artificial way. I had always liked that but not after seeing how wonderful my hair looks now. It&#x27;s lustrous in the way that only a natural soap could give, and I added in no additional products after showering.  3) My hair is noticeably stronger. As I was styling my hair, I noticed that the strands that fall out during a normal styling process were thicker and stronger. I have never experienced this with any product - not even the most luxurious anti-breakage shampoos.  4) It just looks awesome. All around. My hair has never behaved like this before ever.  So basically, I think the reason it felt funny the first time I washed my hair was because the product was deeply cleansing my hair from all of the artificial softeners and chemicals that were in my hair already, and I use exclusively professional products which makes me feel like I was wasting a lot of money and time. If you&#x27;re like me and you&#x27;re in the process of growing your hair, this product is a must. Its natural properties strengthen the hair and leave it bouncy and beautiful even at that awkward length. I would recommend this product to anyone, except perhaps those with very coarse hair. It definitely cleanses deep, and extremely coarse hair is best to be washed sparingly in order to preserve natural oils. However, after using this soap you may not need to wash every day even if you have oily hair. It cleanses deep and really creates a change to the hair. Use it if you&#x27;re curious and don&#x27;t freak out if it feels different! Don&#x27;t expect too much of a lather either, but a lather isn&#x27;t necessary to clean your locks. If your hair is very tangled, which it may be after use, comb with awide tooth comb while the hair is wet. Never brush wet hair!  Also - as far as skin care, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap is perfect. The tea tree oil in the product is a natural antiseptic which I&#x27;ve always used to treat light acne. I have sensitive skin that gets very blotchy and red after I wash it and the castile soap left my skin soft, bright, clean and even in color. I have somewhat large pores and it shrunk them, which I have never experienced before. It even reduced the puffiness I get under my eyes. I used it as a body wash as well, and my skin everywhere is soft and clean.  In short: my professional opinion is to buy this soap and keep up with trims ;)</li>
            <li> I use this as a body wash and face wash.  I also use it in my laundry on occasion.  I would start with the 160 oz size 1st so you can determine if you like Tea Tree or another scent.  I have used the Lavender as well but my husband likes this scent better plus better for your skin.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this product a couple days ago after hearing all the great things about castile soaps. I have pretty severe hormonal acne on my face and i also tend to break out on my chest, shoulders, and back. So far i love how this soap feels on my skin i dilute it half and half with water and use it to wash my face and my naturally coarse and curly hair (i have itchy scalp so i figured i might as well try it on my hair since its tea tree). My hair felt nice after using it and my curls seemed more loose and easier to manage and very soft :) As far as my acne goes, my face looks better already after only a few uses i dont expect my acne to clear all the way but i love that it at least has reduced the bumpiness on my face, my cheeks are more smooth now and my chin too, so it definitely hasnt worsened my acne so im glad.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as my body wash but i dont dilute it for that i just put a couple drops on my shower sponge and it lathers up great :) the tea tree smell is kinda strong but i dont mind it, it goes away right after you get out of the shower. I use sweet almond oil to moisturize my body and face so that mixed with using this soap has me really happy with my skin. I will for sure buy this again when i run out which probably wont be for a while since you need vety little amounts of the soap. Go try it!</li>
            <li> this doesn&#x27;t smell like tea tree I have used in the past. I think it smells like pine sol.I have used it twice in the shower after doing a dirty job, rinsed, then used the hemp almond to cover the smell. Not sure what to do with the rest of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, great de-greasser but not the miracle cure for baked-on gunk that other buyers said it was. Used it to clean deep fryer and it worked magic on the fish grease in that but when I tried to clean off the baked-on stains on my old aluminum cookie sheets it didn&#x27;t really do much. I didn&#x27;t dilute it, just used it straight.  It sucked every single drop of oil out of my hands though so use with plastic gloves. I would probably buy it again.</li>
            <li> Great Item-Great Seller</li>
            <li> I really love this Castile Soap. It washes away dirt better than any brand name pharmacy hand wash. After I wash my hands with antibacterial soap, I wash my hands with Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap, and I see how much stuff still comes off. It just proves that all natural is better. I use it for my face too, and it is sooooo fresh after, and really feels clean. Since it is not a mild type of soap, I put on heavy moisturizer to keep my face hydrated.</li>
            <li> I am a 25 year old male and have struggled with very sensitive acne-prone skin since I was 16. My face has at times experienced the following conditions: oily, dry, oily and dry, acne cysts, whiteheads, blackheads, rosacea, and dermatitis. I also tend to get dry skin on my body after I shower for several hours. These issues have led me to spend hundreds of dollars throughout the years on various washes, creams, lotions, toners, prescription antibiotics and many other things I wish to never spend any time thinking about ever again.  About six months ago my face just looked chemically burned from all the crap I had been slathering on it for years. I&#x27;ve always been a very health-conscious individual so it was so disappointing that I had such bad skin problems. That&#x27;s when a light bulb clicked on. If I choose not to eat disgusting preservatives and additive chemicals, why am I applying similar things directly to my face? I started looking into organic skin care products, but I also wanted to find something that didn&#x27;t have tons of crazy exotic ingredients that might continue irritating my skin. That&#x27;s when I stumbled upon Dr. Bronner&#x27;s and I instantly knew I wanted to try it out. Such a simple ingredient list. Water and a few essential oils.  I chose the tea tree variety because is supposedly naturally antiseptic/anti-inflammatory and even Dr. Bronner&#x27;s website recommends it for acne-prone skin. The very first wash I had with it felt so incredibly clean. Literally as if someone had skimmed only the excess oils and dirt from my skin without the slightest bit extra of moisture removed. No dryness or irritation. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. I was still dubious though if I needed to continue on some sort of \\&quot;skin care regimen\\&quot; to combat my problematic skin as I was still getting breakouts. However, very slowly over several months I noticed my skin was gradually looking better and better. I should note that I also take a multivitamin pack as well as 10 fish oil tablets daily. Fishoil is known to have anti-inflammatory properties for both skin and joints. Along with this I get 8+ hours of sleep a night, plenty of regular exercise, and a clean diet with no processed foods. My skin now looks the best it&#x27;s looked since I was a child.  Oh, and the soap also lasts forever. About three months per bottle for me to wash my entire body, face, and shampoo with it (I have short hair, I&#x27;ve heard this doesn&#x27;t work well for women/those with long hair). After this bottle I&#x27;m going to experiment and see if I can use some of the other scents without needing tea tree anymore. I have tried the peppermint in bar form as well. The scent is very pleasant but I found it to be more drying than the liquid soap, probably because it is more difficult to not accidentally use too much in bar form. I also found that it gets used up much faster than the liquid. Ultimately though I do prefer soap in bar form, so I will give it another shot with a different scent.  But needless to say, I will be using only Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soap for the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This is great soap for me. As a bath soap, it leaves you feeling squeaky clean (literally a bit rubberized, like tupperware) but not at all dried out like every other soap that has that property.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a shampoo, it cleans my scalp, makes my hair soft, and alleviates the occasional dirty-head-itch very well, whereas some shampoo&#x27;s and conditioners make that worse. Despite what other reviewers have said, with 10 or 20 drops of the stuff, it lathers and forms suds quite well in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love the smell. I smell like fresh cut lumber getting out of the shower, and it lingers for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to my failed experiment:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use coconut oil in my hair as a sort of leave-in conditioner or treatment. I have long frizzy hair that is to the middle of my back when wet, and it&#x27;s a giant ear-length puff ball when dry and untreated. My routine was to leave a moderate amount of extra virgin coconut oil in my hair after every shower to weigh my hair down, and make the curls clump together a bit, without it looking greasy or making my head itch as other leave-in hair greases tended to do. It worked really well until my coconut oil got funky, after about a year. That was a pretty successful experiment, but I decided I&#x27;d look around and try out something new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Castille Soap&#x27;s main ingredients are water and coconut oil, followed by a bunch of other natural oils I wouldn&#x27;t mind leaving in my hair, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try as a leave-in treatment. Unfortunately, it does not have nearly the same effect on my hair. The water dries away and my hair is left nearly as frizzy as it would be without anything in it. It&#x27;s soft, but still unbearable frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m going back to coconut oil for my de-frizzing needs for now, but tea tree castile soap will probably be a staple in my hygiene routine for years to come.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for more natural cleansers/shampoo etc.   This product sells itself as the be all and end all of soaps, saying that you can use it for anything.  I guess you could use it for general cleaning but I got it to try as a body wash, which was a failure.  It seems like I have to use a lot of it in the shower, even though for the most part I stand out of the water while I am washing myself, it has to be applied to the loufa a 2nd time.  The soap is thin like water.  The smell of the Tea Tree flavor is very strong and to me it smells like a musty basement.  I have used Tea Tree stuff before but never a natural product, so I was not expecting this.    The bottle is covered in Religious messages, which I was not expecting... A bit strange.  I am half way through he bottle, and will be switching over to other soap as soon as it arrives in the mail, so this will be used for light household cleaning.   I am not giving this a 3 star review because of the scent or religious messages, my rating is based on the use of the product as a body wash only.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this soap, and I actually mix this with the peppermint version (love the sensation) in a single bottle. Usually fill it with 1/4th of the tea tree and the rest with the peppermint. However, this is a warning to everyone: DO NOT USE THIS OR ANY OTHER TEA TREE OIL PRODUCT AS TOOTH PASTE. Tee tree oil is a great antiseptic and cleanser but can be VERY hazardous to your health if, for any reason, it is taken into your mouth. I throw this warning out there because other Dr. Bronner&#x27;s all-in-one soaps are advertised as being adequate toothpaste, but there is considerable research that shows Tee Tree Oil, while being organic and natural, is indeed hurtful towards your body if absorbed orally. It is completely safe outside the body, though, for skin cleaning and such. Just be cautious.</li>
            <li> I THINK IT IS GREAT TAKES ANYTHING OFF OF YOU HIDDEN DIRT AND PARTICLES JUST HIGH PRICED AND IN WAALGREENS IT LOOKS A LITTLE THICKER</li>
            <li> This is regarding the tea tree version.  It is the best anti- seborrheic dermatitis shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used, with the possible exception of daily use of prescription-strength ketoconazole 2% shampoo (it works better than the 1% Nizoral AD).  I was also hoping it would help with folliculitis, but as that&#x27;s an intermittent problem to begin with, it&#x27;s difficult to say.  It&#x27;s either helping slightly or, at worst, not making it worse.  Some have complained about the smell of the tea-tree oil version.  It&#x27;s definitely a medicinal smell, sort of like menthol and eucalyptus.  It&#x27;s a bit strong when you&#x27;re applying it, but it rinses away quite thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I have very oily, thin hair, it is very long right now. I have been looking for a good organic shampoo, that doesn&#x27;t make me break out because i also have acne. After reading the reviews, and a couple of them being about using this soap as a shampoo, i gave it a try, and my hair looks awful! It is too too drying, i can&#x27;t even comb it, it just looks too dry and weird. I will not be using this as a shampoo again, i also use it on my face, and it is a little drying also, but i like it as face soap. And i think it&#x27;s also good as a body soap, i use it to clean my make up brushes and my hair brush, and it leaves them nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still in the search for a good organic shampoo.</li>
            <li> I purchased this on a whim. I had always seen it at my health food store and decided to buy it because my son began to develop what we thought were razor bumps on the back of his neck.  After some time, they became worse and we began to notice bumps and scaly portions on his scalp.  After trying some \\&quot;home remedies\\&quot; , I took him to the dermatologist.  She diagnosed the bumps as flat warts, numbed his head, took skin samples, etc.  It was painful to watch.  I told her that I had some tea tree shampoo that I wanted to try at home that I thought would do the trick.  She said, \\&quot;It won&#x27;t do anything.\\&quot; Well, that was all I needed to at least give it a try after seeing what he had to go through in order to be treated at the dermatologist. I went home and began to wash his scalp every evening with this soap.  Within ONE week, his condition dramatically improved! Needless to say, we have used this to wash his hair every since! It is moisturizing and not drying at all and really keeps his scalp and hair clean. To moisturize his hair afterwards, I now use coconut oil instead of heavy oils and creams.  I also use it a couple of times a week on my combination skin and it does not leave my face dry or slick.  It just feels wonderfully balanced.  I also use this before and after any underarm waxing to prevent irritation.  I love to wash my hands with this after a day of work. Personally, I love the smell and have purchased more.</li>
            <li> I use this soap to wash my face, and I have also used it to wash my hair.  What I like about this soap, is that it also clears my sinuses in the shower, which is an added bonus, as I always have sinus issues during allergy season.  The soap does feel a bit drying on the skin initially, but it doesn&#x27;t feel squeaky clean like it does with sulphate soaps.  I think I&#x27;m probably using way too much, as a tiny bit goes a very long way.  I really like this soap, and it will certainly be a staple in my house for a long time, given the incredible sinus clearing added bonus.  I used to use a neti pot, but I stopped using it because I read about the brain eating amoeba that can be found in our water supply, and it freaked me out.  I don&#x27;t need a neti pot anymore; score!</li>
            <li> this product is awesome. just like all dr. bronners. So amazing. Great for facial cleansing and house cleaning as well!!</li>
            <li> I have tried Dr. Bronners in the past and found it too drying, now thanks to the reviews I know to dilute it and use in a foaming pump to wash my hands with. All I need is 2 - 3 drops for use as a body wash, and this worked perfectly for shaving my legs. I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this for the face for anyone that has very sensitive skin. I have finally started using this for cleaning and it works great for scrubbing out the sinks and the shower. I bought the tee tree oil version and it was happy that it smelled like the genuine article.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really not fond of the \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; feel left on my skin after using this soap.  It&#x27;s very uncomfortable!!!  I purchased it because I am having some skin problems with severe irritation.  I thought the tea tree oil would help.  Perhaps it will, but again, the feel of my skin after I use it isn&#x27;t a feeling I&#x27;m pleased with.</li>
            <li> I have allergies to almost everything. I ordered this soap because it was so natural. It only takes a couple drops to wash your whole body. I used it on my hair and it was a little to harsh. The only reason I only gave it 4 stars is because of the smell. It has a medical smell. Probably the tee tree oil. Has interesting &amp;#34;stories&amp;#34; printed on the bottle too. Its a good product. I wish it smelled better. Cleaning strength is way above anything else you will find. I just don&#x27;t recommend it for hair.</li>
            <li> I wrote \\&quot;shampoo\\&quot; because this was the main reason why i bought this product.  I was looking for an organic non-harsh shampoo to deal with my persistent, extremely dry, flaky scalp which lead to my hair shedding for the past 2 months now.    This has tea tree oil which is very good for your scalp because it has anti-bacterial properties and it does reduce the incidence of dandruff...PLUS this soap contains Organic Olive Oil....    I put only small amount.  Believe me- a little amount goes a long way. Then it lathers for awhile then it stops from doing so.  Not like other shampoo which creates like a \\&quot;bubble\\&quot; effect all though out the process, this one however just lathers as soon as you put it.  By the time you washed it, it feels like you didn&#x27;t apply a shampoo after all kinda feeling.    I can tell you after using this product twice after buying it, i haven&#x27;t had any episodes of scalp itching and my shedding seems to have been under control....    I have tried other shampoo from Head &amp; Shoulder, Nizoral then Jason Dandruff control but nothing helps.  Nizoral made my scalp really even more dry because of its KETO property.    I haven&#x27;t tried this one as soap however.  I&#x27;m just so glad that i no longer itch from my dandruff and my shedding seems to subside.    Do try this one....I am planning on getting the Peppermint flavor soon...</li>
            <li> I love Dr Bronners and this was no exception. Smelled like tea tree without being overwhelming and I will be back to purchase more scents. I also like that it&#x27;s safe for my family; no chemicals or ingredients I can&#x27;t pronounce!! :)</li>
            <li> Now I am torn.  I have been using the peppermint variety of Dr B&#x27;s soap for several months.  I love that product.  On a whim, I added the 16oz bottle of the Tea Tree soap to my last order. I love this one as well.  I have had occasional acne problems for years and I know that tea tree oil has helped in the past.  I&#x27;ll add an update regarding this if I have a flare up. This soap, like it&#x27;s peppermint cousin, leaves me feeling clean and refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this as a facial scrub and also as a shampoo (body wash as well).  I haven&#x27;t seen any drying of my hair that some others have warned about.  In fact, my hair feels like I&#x27;ve used a conditioner after a good thorough rinse.  I should point out that my hair is naturally on the oily side so that might have something to do with my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Dr B for another great product!</li>
            <li> I use this daily and love how great my skin feels and smells. I also use it with my shampoo and it takes all the gunk out. My complexion is so clear, I don&#x27;t even wear foundation any more.</li>
            <li> I am so excited that I have found Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Castile Soap. I got the tea tree scented one in hopes of cleaning some stubborn grease from one of my pans. It worked like a breeze! I now use it when I had wash dishes and I love that it&#x27;s organic and gentle on my skin. I have not tried it as a body wash or shampoo yet, but I think I will get a different scent to try it in the shower!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted to start making my own household cleaner; many of the recipes (that got good reviews) called for castile soap &amp; tea tree oil so I bought Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap with tea tree oil- I have NOT been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it&#x27;s a bit steep price-wise up front, you need only a little bit of it depending on your use. (I made an all-purpose cleaner for about $0.10 per 18 ounces!)- so the bottle should last a long while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are SO many different uses for castile soap, so far I&#x27;ve only made an all-purpose cleaner with it and everything I clean turns out extremely clean, even my husband is a convert. I&#x27;m very excited to use it in different cleaning capacities! I look forward to using it during showers, on my dogs and once baby arrives- for his bath time &amp; to clean his toys.</li>
            <li> I love this soap and I use it everyday now. I have TV( tenia versicolor) and this soap has really helped to tone down the appearance of some of the spots I have on my neck and my back looks so much better. I do no however like the rubbery feel after using it so i mix it with the plain Aveeno body wash that I usually use and it is great. You can also use it on your face because it works very well, I however have not tried it in my hair because I use a good brand of shampoo. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone however I think its best to buy it at the Vitamin Shoppe or Target because i recently ordered some and it was definitely diluted and luckily I was skeptical and didn&#x27;t put it on my skin before testing it. So if you can take a little time out of your day to make sure you&#x27;re getting the real thing.</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected. I don&#x27;t know why anyone would use this stuff for health or beauty. I do not like the smell. It is supposed to have 18 uses but it just list one and a bunch of quotes. I think I might use it to wash my car surely that is one of the uses.</li>
            <li> This cleared up a yeast infection my son had on his chest.  Worked wonders, much faster &amp; better than the prescription steroids they prescribed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t dry out your hands.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it&#x27;s liquid tea tree soap, smells like tea tree oil and works to kill germs and other loathsome bugs...</li>
            <li> Now my favorite soap.</li>
            <li> Tea tree oil has a pungent and distinct smell, and I think most people would agree with that.&lt;br /&gt;All of the other Dr. Bronners&#x27; products I&#x27;ve tried were totally adequate and they didn&#x27;t have a terrible smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to very much enjoy the smell of tea tree oil, but this was so overwhelming that I could only use it as laundry detergent. And even then it made my whole basement smell of tea tree (the clothes didn&#x27;t smell like tea tree after drying).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of tea tree oil now sends my stomach churning and it is because of this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoy extraordinarily scented soaps, then this is the soap for you. If not, head for the hills.</li>
            <li> I travel frequently and this is the only soap that I bring with me.  Does whatever job you need it to do.  I use it on my hair, face, feet, and even use it as a hand soap-you get the idea.</li>
            <li> Thank you! Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I use it ,to clean almost anything. I love using it to clean my hardwood floors.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Desert Essence Tea Tree Oil soap for years, because it&#x27;s the best soap I&#x27;ve found for my sensitive skin. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s become quite expensive and/or more difficult to find. I&#x27;ve always loved Dr. Bronner&#x27;s peppermint castile soap, so I gave this a shot. Fantastic soap!</li>
            <li> wonderful cleansing ability, all-natural so it feels good to offer it to my family, and it has a wonderful (though acquired taste) tea tree scent with all the healing and antiseptic properties tea tree oil has to offer! Very satisfied!</li>
            <li> Love how concentrated this soap is.  But the smell kind of reminds me of my grandmother&#x27;s cleaning closet.  I recommend the stuff, but use sparingly!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that this would work on my 4-year old daughter who suffers from eczema. However, as soon as I applied this soap she started screaming. Screaming like I have never heard!! Her entire back from her neck to ankles turned bright red. I couldn&#x27;t get it off fast enough. It was upsetting for both of us and I feel just horrible for putting her through that. I ended up soaking her in an oatmeal bath and it seemed to help. I&#x27;m glad it has worked for some people, but definetly a NO for us!!!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used this soap in the past and remembered it as a natural and mild, but effective soap. i am currently deployed to iraq and was having a bad case of itchy skin from the heat and hard water. i think the &#x27;normal&#x27; soaps i was using were contributing to my problem. i was ichy all over my body and it was driving me half crazy. this magic soap cured it in about a week. thank goodness for this soap!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ultra concentrated so make sure you use less soap than usual. It&#x27;s very liquid, so make sure you are careful or else too much comes out. Smells great, not sure if it us USDA certified but it definitely leaves my skin feeling cleaner than the chemical soaps from major retail stores. If you have sensitive skin, this product works great!</li>
            <li> My husband says it&#x27;s just okay. I bought it for him to help with dandruff, which it gets good reviews for being effective at, and it hasn&#x27;t done such a great job. For that purpose, it&#x27;s pretty comparable to any other dandruff shampoo he&#x27;s tried.   But this is the soap with 18 uses, isn&#x27;t it? Since my husband doesn&#x27;t like it, I&#x27;ve been experimenting with it for other purposes, and even as plain old body wash I love it! It&#x27;s very mildly tingly and I personally LOVE the smell of tea tree. (I know some reviewers have complained about it but it&#x27;s a very herbal menthol kind of smell which I find pleasing.) I even wash my face with it once in a while and it helps to keep it clear.   For other uses, like cleaning counter tops, I haven&#x27;t really used it because I find the fact that you have to wash it off afterwards to be too much work. I like to just spray and wipe!   But all in all, it&#x27;s very good, versatile soap!</li>
            <li> This is the best body soap I have ever used. This I highly Recommend. This soap leaves you feeling oil free.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap.  I use is in a soap dispenser for hand/face washing, a squirt bottle in the shower for a shampoo and body wash.  I even tried the peppermint formula as a tooth . . . errrr soap(?) just because you can - it was ok but I won&#x27;t be getting rid of my toothpaste.  A little does go a long way so I&#x27;m still experimenting with dilution percentages.  After a month my skin feels great and I actually look forward to a refreshing shower.  I&#x27;ve read some state that it will dry out your hair/scalp if you use it as a shampoo - its made with olive oil for Pete&#x27;s sake ! ! !  It took several days for my scalp and hair to begin adjusting.  Your hair never has the squeaky clean feel/sound and when your done your hair feels like it may not be clean.  My hair looks and is very clean without any dry static, it doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all and it has brought back a hair feeling I long forgot - a feeling back when I was a kid.  I&#x27;m a guy with short hair by the way.  My wife is a nurse and she associates this soap with enemas so she was not willing to try it, she is gradually opening to the idea tho - the soap not the NMA.</li>
            <li> This is more than a soap! I would never want to be without it! I will keep buying this as long as I live.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for 3 weeks now, twice daily. I really like the clean and fresh feeling it lends your skin after use. It&#x27;s a little drying, but since I&#x27;m using it during the sweaty Houston summer, this is not a concern. I&#x27;ve also used it as a shampoo, and it makes it frizz quite a bit (I have slightly thin, straight hair). I&#x27;ll probably stick to using it as soap only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only advice would be to check at your local store first. I bought this (16oz Tea Tree) for $9.99, and found the 32oz to be $10 at Whole Foods. Disappointing to see that after my purchase, but I picked up the 32oz of the Peppermint + Hemp for the same price!</li>
            <li> the reason i purchased this was because i read some review on pintrest that it works to clean pans. Well first it has palm oil and 2nd who the heck writes such junk on a bottle? the thing creeped me out.</li>
            <li> The new age has no clue what it takes to shower or shampoo...so many are walking around with skin parasites and have NOT A CLUE. Thank-you For Being here for me and my Family. We TRULY DESIRE TO GET CLEAN WHEN BATHING. As opposed to some cheap (I SMELL GOOD)And walking out of the shower as BUGGY as we went in....AND YOUR DELIVERY TIME WAS AWESOME</li>
            <li> The best castile soap i have used. Like the many ways you can use it &amp; the fact that is has no harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> It washes away quickly, leaving a feeling of cleanliness behind if used in the shower. I&#x27;ve used this particular product for everything from shampoo and body wash to washing clothes and dishes. Folks say you can brush your teeth with it, but I&#x27;ve never gone that far, lol. It really is a great product with low environmental impact. Great for those with a sulfate allergy, too, as it contains no sodium lauryl sulfate. Good stuff. I like the earthy, tea tree scent best.</li>
            <li> It just came in the mail today and I&#x27;ve used it as a Shampoo and body wash. I love it! For hair you need a conditiner with it though because it&#x27;s kind of drying. My skin is soft and happy :)</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this soap on my face.I have really sensitive skin so it&#x27;s hard to dry something that doesn&#x27;t make my face burn, or itch after washing it. However, this works nicely. I do wish it didn&#x27;t make my face feel dry after I wash it, because I almost instantly have to put something, lotion or something on my face. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the one I&#x27;m using, because when I used a different &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, don&#x27;t remember the name, but it&#x27;s in a orange wrapper; my face never dry out. Besides that I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Dr. Bronner&#x27;s soaps, but for some reason the smell of the Tea Tree is a bit offensive to my senses. It sits in the shower unused next to its more popular siblings, Eucalyptus and Citrus.</li>
            <li> It makes you feel super clean, but I felt like it went really fast.  I used it with a poof.  Too fast for the money</li>
            <li> - This product totally resolved eczema on my elbows.  Better than all of the greasy creams from the dermatologist!&lt;br /&gt;- Nice quality.  A little goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;- Hoped the smell would be a more fragrant tea tree.  OK smell but not what I had hoped.&lt;br /&gt;- Product quality is above my expectations.  I will use this from now on.  Although somewhat expensive, it goes a long way and I&#x27;ll save money by using this vice what I&#x27;ve been buying in the grocery  store.</li>
            <li> I have used other Castile soaps, but I found this batch to be rather watery. This Tea Tree soap has a pretty potent scent. I would describe it as vintage Listerine coming out of the bottle. After you dry off though it has a nice woodsy scent. I&#x27;m a guy and found it left my skin rather dry feeling. Of course we are in the middle of a nasty winter up here in Michigan, with the lakes almost completely frozen over for the first time in over 30 years and the air has been very dry outside. So I will reserve judgment on this soaps drying effects for now.    Its also works good to as a shampoo. Tea Tree oil is supposed to have natural anti-dandruff properties. Due to its watery nature I would expect it to work well in a foaming soap dispenser as well.    There is an interesting article about Dr. Bronner here: [...] , as well as on Wikipedia.    Overall its a very cost effective soap. You don&#x27;t need to use very much to get a lot of suds.</li>
            <li> This soap works well for oily skin and skin prone to acne. That&#x27;s the reason why I bought it. Shipping was quick and item was in perfect condition. Service was excellent</li>
            <li> This soap made me realize how much I like soap lather.  I never felt clean using this because it doesn&#x27;t lather.  I would use some with a loofa, and I&#x27;d have to add more 2-3 a shower session.  I was going through way more of this than I would regular body wash!  I&#x27;m sure it was cleaning just fine, but I have oily skin and need the &amp;#34;reassurance&amp;#34; soap lather provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, if you have OCD like me you may want to avoid this soap.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel clean, smells great...</li>
            <li> Multi-purpose Cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;Great Scent (I purchased Tea Tree).&lt;br /&gt;Must be diluted - this stuff is strong and versatile.&lt;br /&gt;Just read all the other amazing reviews!</li>
            <li> this is a great product! lathers well, rinses well, and the tea tree oil really seems to calm my skin. it doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my skin, either-a nice balance! highly recommend</li>
            <li> I am a regular buyer of this soap. I mix it with honey and lemon and use it as a Facial Cleanser. It works great and it removes the hardest makeup! It has never irritated my skin and it leaves it looking even and clear.</li>
            <li> I have long coarse, highlighted hair and an oily scalp (really oily scalp). So i have to use a different shampoo for my scalp and my hair. I know it sounds weird.  and most organic shampoos dont work for an oily scalp. this line though works wonders.  after washing with this i have a nice clean scalp &amp; i can feel it. however, the caveat is that it makes your hair tangled up &amp; hard to manage. for that reason, I would recommend a very nice creamy conditioner to use or using a creamy shampoo for your hair while you put castile soap on your scalp.  i hope this helps.</li>
            <li> What this does to your hair, you&#x27;ll love it or hate it depending on how you like your hair and probably the nature of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have limp, long, thin, black hair (Asian type).  I chose Tea Tree with hopes of soothing my scalp. With just two drops of this stuff I&#x27;m able to rub it into a foamy mousse to apply to my scalp.  The results:  my hair feels thicker, looks more lustrous (in a silky not slick way), it&#x27;s less tangled, and has an interesting texture.  I LIKE IT.  Some may get the same results as me and be appalled.  My hair feels weighed down, each strand feels like it&#x27;s coated with oil-  Some would say greasy but I say it feels protected.  I haven&#x27;t worked up to using this regularly yet because after a couple days in a row (yeah yeah yeah I shouldn&#x27;t wash it everyday) the build up can make my hair a bit too stringy looking.&lt;br /&gt;** I just have to confess, I don&#x27;t use this as a shampoo anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I also use this as a handsoap.  Great value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a shampoo (which depending on water hardness, or hair type it can leave your hair a bit too squeaky clean), body wash. For me the best way to dispense it is in a FOAMING SOAP DISPENSER, mix 1:4 ratio, more water than product. Then can use it as a shaving FOAM.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use this after knowing doctors and hospitals use regular (non-tea tree) Castile soap as a gentle cleanser. I use the peppermint one as its widely available in stores.&lt;br /&gt;Interested in the 18 in 1 uses it claims, I&#x27;ve attempted to read the bottle with its tiny print. I ended up looking at their website, after several hours of reading the story behind its creation and Dr Bronner&#x27;s life. More than I was looking for but hey there is a documentary on this!</li>
            <li> My husband and I recently switched from conventional soaps, etc. to more eco-friendly soaps.  This is a switch we made - we both love it!  We use it for body wash (and he sometimes uses it instead of shampoo).  I even bought foaming hand soap dispensers to use this in - it&#x27;s great!  i love how concentrated it is - a little really does go a long way.  And I&#x27;ve really become fond of the smell of tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> A must have product, to say the least. I need something for my face, which was getting worse by the day. so I was really looking for a product that would work, other than the All Natural Soaps I tried which have Failed me. Long story short, I start using this product, and literally in the first week seen results. I will repeatedly buy this Product. A must have!</li>
            <li> I wanted to try a tea tree oil soap for cutting down on acne. All those other acne products were drying out my skin making it scaly &amp; not even making it clear! So tea tree is a natural anti-microbial, &amp; microbes are part of the cause of acne. Well it works fantastic on my pale sensitive skin. It feels better, &amp; is just so refreshing &amp; clean when I use this! It dosent over dry like a myriad of other soaps/liquids I have tried. It was also gentle on my new tattoo. Now it says it&#x27;s concentrated but I didn&#x27;t water mine down. I just kinda put some in my hand mix w/ a little shower water &amp; lather.</li>
            <li> Good Soap and Shampoo. Smells like crap, but I love this stuff. It&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t take much at all to clean anything.&lt;br /&gt;I even used it o my dog once. Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this soap did not give me any irritation what-so-ever. You only need a small amount to lather your entire body. I will be purchasing this soap again.</li>
            <li> Been using the peppermint brand which is great, was at fairway today and it was on sale for ten dollars, I purchased the tea tree oil and looking forward to use it. A few drops is what you need because it&#x27;s very strong and lathers well, the bottle lasts me a few months and is a great feeling after showering.</li>
            <li> The soap is magic. I use it and it makes me awesome. Also, it smells great and is all natural. You can use it on your face and hair and body, but I mostly use it because its magical.</li>
            <li> I rarely write product reviews but I am compelled to after using Dr. Bronner&#x27;s Tea Tree Oil Soap.  I have dealt with body odor the majority of my adult life.  I have tried tons of different soaps that would seem to help only temporarily .  I would sometimes take two showers a day and after sweating this &#x27;funk&#x27; smell would start to form in my groin. Frankly it was embarrassing!  A couple of weeks ago I decided to end this so I did research on different soaps.  The all natural aspect of Dr. Bronner&#x27;s was the original thing that brought me to the product but then doing further research on the benefits of Tea Tree Oil was what really sealed the deal for me.  The anti-microbial,anti-fungal &amp; anti-bacterial aspect of the soap is really evident.  I have used it daily for a week and that &#x27;funk&#x27; in my groin is completely gone.  Even after a long day at work I get home and there is no odor.  I&#x27;m completely impressed with this product, the people at Dr. Bronner&#x27;s have gained a life-long customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:  A month later I am still odor free!!  I&#x27;m just thrilled to have finally found a solution to this years old problem.  I also started using Jungleman All-Natural Deodorant which contains Tea Tree Oil and it&#x27;s excellent as well.</li>
            <li> You can do everything with this soap. I&#x27;ve used it for soap, shampoo, toothpaste, and all- purpose cleaner. It lasts a very long time but it does not dispense well in pumps.</li>
            <li> Love this cleanser! I use it as a boy wash...suds very well and without all the chemicals in store cleansers!</li>
            <li> my favorite soap. tea tree oil soap should be a staple in everyone&#x27;s hygiene routine. it really kills odors and keeps them out. also this soap is all natural and multipurpose. you can use it throughout your home. a large bottle lasts for months because you can dilute them with water.</li>
            <li> We were regular users of this product and will not use again since we discovered it uses olive oil illegally stolen from Israel occupied Palestnian lands in West bank and Gaza.  These are lands stolen from Palestinian owners by Israel, where now Palestinians are forced to work at slave wages to produce these ingredients.  We will no longer use products like this, where companies profit off the illegal occupation of Palestinian lands</li>
            <li> Dr. Bronner&#x27;s products are very very good.  I use this particular Castile - Tea Tree product in the shower.  A little goes a long way.  The main thing is that it really does work!  It will really clear up what ails ya!  I use it as a shampoo too!  My scalp has never felt better.  Just understand that natural products such as this do not have chemicals to make them suds up a huge amount.  If a soap product such as this suds up heavily... then it probably isn&#x27;t good for you at all...  This one will suds up a little... and it cleans very very well.  If you have dry skin, ring worm or fungus type skin issues, this will really help it.  Meanwhile, using it daily keeps most of that stuff at bay.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to use for cleaning my cookie sheets. It didn&#x27;t work like I thought it would, which is fine, but what I really didn&#x27;t like is that it made everything it touched turn orange and rusty. I got it on my nice stovetop griddle, and the thing now looks like I left it out in the rain for 3 years. Now I treat this stuff like acid. If it&#x27;s open, I have gloves and won&#x27;t touch anything with it.</li>
            <li> Really nice hand soap. Leaves your skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap for a body wash, I feel so clean after using it. I&#x27;ve had a couple of insect bits and skin irritation, but after bathing in this soap a few times the bits and scars cleared up a little better than it has in the pass with regular soap. Only down side is that it smells like pine-sol, So after a bath with it I top it off with regular dual soap to help cut off some of the smell.</li>
            <li> Used it as facial cleanser to clear up my acne! Works perfectly and my pimples dry up really quick! Highly Recommended</li>
            <li> seemed to irritate me and my husband skin. i have sensitive skin. howver, if one uses it frequent this is the result on face. otherwise as a bodywash ok.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me you&#x27;re reading these reviews to see whether or not you should buy the product. Buy it. I bought the 16oz bottle and it is worth your money. IT LASTS FOREVER. For $10 you get a really nice body wash that, if you don&#x27;t like it, you can use on your dishes. There is no risk here. I bought the Tea Tree and I really like it as a body wash, though I can&#x27;t attest to its other uses. I will say though, don&#x27;t get the rose; i haven&#x27;t personally tried it, but nobody in the world has given it a good review, here or otherwise.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.  it smells great, lasts forever and keeps me super clean.  In fact, I&#x27;m ordering more right now!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap for the tea tree oil and hemp oil.after using product i really felt clean and invigorated.just leaves an awsome feeling.</li>
