            <li>I just think its great</li>
            <li>Good for temporary styles maybe 2 week to a month.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s good quality hair</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it comes in three lengths so it will make a beautiful layered look when woven in.</li>
            <li>and im very pleased on how it turned</li>
            <li>The shipping was amazing  </li>
            <li>the hair came on time it feels amazing</li>
            <li>This Hair Is Really Awsome and beautiful !</li>
            <li>I treated this hair like it was my own</li>
            <li>Was a full head of hair , over all it was a great buy.</li>
            <li>As for the purchase its ok for 50bucks because I spend more than 50bucks at the hair store!</li>
            <li>I would love to do a review for this hair &#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li>but I have had better for this price.</li>
            <li>I love this hair</li>
            <li>Also I wouldn&#x27;t sew this hair in unless the sew in is free!</li>
            <li>Might have to purchase some more hair when I install it.</li>
            <li>i had dyed the ends blonde  &#x27; and the body wave hold really good !</li>
            <li>Basically when you finish buying more hair you will pay for the bundles that you wanted originally anyways.</li>
            <li>So if you want the hair to be the true 12,14,16 inches you may wannna order up in length!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t appear to have been processed and the hair is strong.</li>
            <li>so id recommend using it for a quick weave or wig!</li>
            <li>If ur looking for a quick fix this is the hair to buy!</li>
            <li>but hey 3 bundles for a cheap price</li>
            <li>Thats y its so cheap</li>
            <li>You get what u pay for cheap hair</li>
            <li>Really cheap hair.</li>
            <li>This hair feels soft and has a nice look to it, it came in three bundles as stated however,</li>
            <li>One star taken away for shedding, matting, and not being full at all.</li>
            <li>Good hair just short and</li>
            <li>, the hair is true to length promised, is the color promised and the amount means this is a full head of hair.</li>
            <li>Hair is nice &amp; soft .</li>
            <li>Looks nice when you get feels soft.  </li>
            <li>Also the package arrived quickly and on schedule.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the overall quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great texture of hair , barely any shedding , soft and flowing .</li>
            <li>This hair is a very fair price for hair that is going to last with proper care.</li>
            <li>it has more of the natural texture look which is a plus 4 me.</li>
            <li>One star because it does dye pretty well and one star for retaining it&#x27;s wave after straightening and washing.</li>
            <li>Bottom line, it may be silky smooth and soft when you get it</li>
            <li>human hair is so much better than synthetic hair.</li>
            <li>Delivery was exceptional, however the hair itself seemed to weigh less than the description.</li>
            <li>But wit the wave the 16inch is really 13inchs, The 14 inch is 11inchs, &amp; the 12inch is really 9inchs!</li>
            <li>no shedding no tangling super soft</li>
            <li>and it got nappy real fa st</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast .</li>
            <li>Delivery was very prompt...</li>
            <li>i am experiencing to much tangling and matting.</li>
            <li>The product was decent quantity,and neatly packaged.</li>
            <li>Its really pretty hair just dont wash it more than 2x a month :/  </li>
            <li>It does look a little bit more natural!</li>
            <li>The first thing I did was wash it and gently blow dry</li>
            <li>I can wash this hair, use my hot rollers in it for extra curls, etc.</li>
            <li>As 4 the length it is the actual length if the hair is pulled out straight!</li>
            <li>Only buy this for a quick weave or a short term hairstyle.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really soft</li>
            <li>THAT SURPRISED ME.</li>
            <li>Romance hair company need to go directly to jail, don&#x27;t collect anyone&#x27;s money and never use it&#x27;s get out of jail free card</li>
            <li>The hair is thin on the ends and thicker up top.</li>
            <li>Hair was very thin at the ends but nice hair .</li>
            <li>its just really short and thin at the ends it looks more like 10&amp;#34;inches not &amp;#34;12 &amp;#34;14 &amp;#34;16&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The feel is soft &amp; it does feel like 100% human hair as far as it being unprocessed Indian hair...</li>
            <li>It sheds and tangles and the hair has a lot of short hairs so not nearly as long as you want or think it should be.</li>

            <li> this hair is soooooooooooo bad Michael Jackson couldn&#x27;t even help and Mc Hammer wouldn&#x27;t touch it, I&#x27;ve seen homeless dogs with better quality of hair</li>

            <li> The hair is thick and lush, the color matches through-out</li>
            <li> When I am tired of having longer lush hair, I can remove it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not full,</li>
            <li> The hair quality is not good enough to spend money getting it sewed in</li>
            <li> The look is like average hair store body wave!</li>
            <li> As for me its just average hair!</li>
            <li> This hair is stiff and not full..</li>
            <li> I ever purchased what a waste of money nothing like the picture...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and short in width ..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the usual thick bundle you get when buying bundles probably half to 3/4 of what a bundle consist of and the wefts are a little thinner as well.</li>
            <li> very bad product lenght is short &amp; very nappy</li>
            <li> the ends are thin, and it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> your curlers will stop working and your hands will become numb from trying and it will melt like butter on low heat.</li>
            <li> This hair is not good at all dont buy.</li>
            <li> The hair is no good ..</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I don&#x27;t like is the ends its thin</li>
            <li> Thin ends</li>
            <li> THE QUALITY IS POOR</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but this has to be the worse hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> This hair is the absolute worst hair ever !!!</li>
            <li> the picture false advertise the lengths</li>
            <li> Not Happy at all!</li>
            <li> THE END OF THE HAIR IS VERY THIN AS WELL.</li>
            <li> very thin no volume at all</li>
            <li> It sheds like crazy.</li>
            <li> Horrible !</li>
            <li> AWFUL.</li>
            <li> Terrible !</li>
            <li> That hair was absolutely horrible couldnt curl it or flatiron it.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> This Hair Is Really Awsome and beautiful ! I would love to do a review for this hair &#x27;&#x27; it&#x27;s really soft i had dyed the ends blonde  &#x27; and the body wave hold really good ! The only bad thing I don&#x27;t like is the ends its thin but hey 3 bundles for a cheap price that&#x27;s still good !</li>
            <li> This hair feels soft and has a nice look to it, it came in three bundles as stated however, it&#x27;s not the usual thick bundle you get when buying bundles probably half to 3/4 of what a bundle consist of and the wefts are a little thinner as well. Basically when you finish buying more hair you will pay for the bundles that you wanted originally anyways.</li>
            <li> Horrible ! I need a refund ! Thin ends and it does not last</li>
            <li> One star because it does dye pretty well and one star for retaining it&#x27;s wave after straightening and washing. One star taken away for shedding, matting, and not being full at all. I treated this hair like it was my own and it&#x27;s practically trash. It&#x27;d be perfect to make a ponytail with but that&#x27;s it! Maybe if I bought 3 orders (9 total), didn&#x27;t dye It or straighten it, it would work. Bottom line, it may be silky smooth and soft when you get it but it&#x27;s not full, the ends are thin, and it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I RECEIVED WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN 8, 10 AND 12 INCH. ALSO, I RECEIVED TWO DIFFERENT COLORS, A BROWNISH NATURAL COLOR AND TWO BUNDLES WERE BLACK. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE. THE QUALITY IS POOR BUT IT WAS THE LENGTH THAT SURPRISED ME. THE END OF THE HAIR IS VERY THIN AS WELL. AWFUL. WOULD NEVER PURCHASE AGAIN.</li>
            <li> Good hair just short and the picture false advertise the lengths my 12 inch looks Luke a 10 inch</li>
            <li> I was offered a promotional coupon to try this product in exchange for my unbiased opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the hair today. I am impressed with the quality of it. The hair is thick and lush, the color matches through-out the batch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sewing looks sturdy and I did not notice shedding when I brushed it. The wave adds to the beauty of it. This hair is a very fair price for hair that is going to last with proper care. I love the fact that it comes in three lengths so it will make a beautiful layered look when woven in. The first thing I did was wash it and gently blow dry it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Real human hair is so much better than synthetic hair. I can wash this hair, use my hot rollers in it for extra curls, etc. When I am tired of having longer lush hair, I can remove it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros, the hair is true to length promised, is the color promised and the amount means this is a full head of hair. It doesn&#x27;t appear to have been processed and the hair is strong. I am very pleased with the overall quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons- I am not finding any but I will update it if it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time but this has to be the worse hair I ever purchased what a waste of money nothing like the picture... very thin no volume at all and it doesn&#x27;t seem like the correct length probably because of the volume...Don&#x27;t Buy!</li>
            <li> This hair shouldn&#x27;t have no stars but you have to give 1 to make a review. The shipping was amazing  but the hair isn&#x27;t real, dry as hell, don&#x27;t think about curling it cause all hope is gone and your curlers will stop working and your hands will become numb from trying and it will melt like butter on low heat. Romance hair company need to go directly to jail, don&#x27;t collect anyone&#x27;s money and never use it&#x27;s get out of jail free card this hair is soooooooooooo bad Michael Jackson couldn&#x27;t even help and Mc Hammer wouldn&#x27;t touch it, I&#x27;ve seen homeless dogs with better quality of hair then this run, run, run and run and please don&#x27;t buy now nor in the future.</li>
            <li> Not Happy at all! This hair is stiff and not full..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thin and so short don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> The product was decent quantity,and neatly packaged. Also the package arrived quickly and on schedule.</li>
            <li> Terrible ! I don&#x27;t like this hair at all. I just received my package this morning. It is not how it looks in the pictures. Wasn&#x27;t the lengths that the seller said it would be. Also, it is not the 1b that I ordered. It has blond strands in it. Would not purchase hair from this seller again. I would not recommend this hair to anyone.</li>
            <li> The hair sucked I couldnt bleach or dye it and it got nappy real fa st</li>
            <li> Hair is nice &amp; soft . Shipping was fast . Hair was very thin at the ends but nice hair .</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for but I have had better for this price. Good for temporary styles maybe 2 week to a month.  Therefore not 100% virgin hair.</li>
            <li> the hair came on time it feels amazing ......I installed the hair after I washed it and im very pleased on how it turned out.&lt;br /&gt;its has a great texture, great feel its flowing I just think its great</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s good quality hair its just really short and thin at the ends it looks more like 10&amp;#34;inches not &amp;#34;12 &amp;#34;14 &amp;#34;16&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Great texture of hair , barely any shedding , soft and flowing . Was a full head of hair , over all it was a great buy.</li>
            <li> Its really pretty hair just dont wash it more than 2x a month :/  the ends get dry and split not the same after</li>
            <li> I love this hair no shedding no tangling super soft I will be ordering more......!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very good product. Excellent quality. Will purchase again. Meets expectation. What are you waiting on? Go ahead and purchase. It feels like human hair...</li>
            <li> I just received my hair! Delivery was very prompt... I haven&#x27;t installed the hair yet but rating it just on look, feel, &amp; length... The look is like average hair store body wave! It does look a little bit more natural! Its not shiny it has more of the natural texture look which is a plus 4 me. The feel is soft &amp; it does feel like 100% human hair as far as it being unprocessed Indian hair... Well you&#x27;d have to be the judge of that! As for me its just average hair! As 4 the length it is the actual length if the hair is pulled out straight! But wit the wave the 16inch is really 13inchs, The 14 inch is 11inchs, &amp; the 12inch is really 9inchs! So if you want the hair to be the true 12,14,16 inches you may wannna order up in length! As for the purchase its ok for 50bucks because I spend more than 50bucks at the hair store! Also I wouldn&#x27;t sew this hair in unless the sew in is free! The hair quality is not good enough to spend money getting it sewed in so id recommend using it for a quick weave or wig! Also the hair is fuller up top &amp; really thin towards the ends! Overall its a descent buy for 50bucks but nothing to scream &amp; shout about! If ur looking for a quick fix this is the hair to buy! I hope this was helpful for someone... I will post another reveiw after I wash &amp; install the hair</li>
            <li> very bad product lenght is short &amp; very nappy</li>
            <li> That hair was absolutely horrible couldnt curl it or flatiron it.</li>
            <li> This hair is not good at all dont buy. They selling foolishness i am experiencing to much tangling and matting. Thats y its so cheap</li>
            <li> Delivery was exceptional, however the hair itself seemed to weigh less than the description. Might have to purchase some more hair when I install it. We&#x27;ll see what happens. There were also some blonde hairs in the bundles.</li>
            <li> The hair is no good .. It&#x27;s thin and short in width ..</li>
            <li> This hair is the absolute worst hair ever !!! It sheds like crazy. The hair is thin on the ends and thicker up top. Looks nice when you get feels soft.  But once installed doesn&#x27;t look like anything.  The waves are gone. Just the worst.  You get what u pay for cheap hair</li>
            <li> Hair looks nothing like it does in the picture. Bought two orders of the hair didn&#x27;t hold at all each day shed a lot. Took out of hair after two weeks.</li>
            <li> Really cheap hair. Only buy this for a quick weave or a short term hairstyle. It sheds and tangles and the hair has a lot of short hairs so not nearly as long as you want or think it should be.</li>
