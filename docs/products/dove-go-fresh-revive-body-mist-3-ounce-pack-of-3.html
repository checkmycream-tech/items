            <li>I used to be able to get it easily</li>

            <li>Fast delivery, came as 3-pack which is good because I use it a lot.</li>
            <li>After calling Dove &#x27;s 800 number and finding out this is no longer made, I quickly came to Amazon and found what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like pink lemonade, which is pleasant and light.  </li>
            <li>Dove Body mists are light, not overpowering.</li>
            <li>fantastic smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is no longer available in stores and came in a 3 pack online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great body spray to wear to the gym or to wear on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>soon also fast shipping thank you!!!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure they diluted it with water.</li>
            <li>however I don&#x27;t know if this was the original smell.</li>
            <li>and you smell showered clean all day.  </li>
            <li>refreshing, clean and very feminine</li>
            <li>Anything that keeps my hunny coming back to me to bury his nose in my neck because I smell so good gets thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d describe the smell as rounded, wholesome and sweet.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t feel the need to spend money on perfume anymore, though I do still love J&#x27;adore.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the old one but is still a good scent</li>
            <li>This is a light, sweet fragrance and the only kind I like.  </li>
            <li>Smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>As described, delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>Okay guys I really love Dove&#x27;s spray and it is like the only body spray I use.</li>
            <li>I keep one in my purse for a quick spritz whenever I need to freshen up.  </li>
            <li>but I actually got it 3 days later which made me very happy.</li>
            <li>Overpriced and overly powerful smell that fades quickly.</li>
            <li>It smell expensive and awesome, but is also super cheap.</li>
            <li>It still smells fresh and fruity like I remember.</li>
            <li>so I should probably by a lifetime&#x27;s worth, just in case.</li>
            <li>But it is a nice freshen upper while working at my job.</li>
            <li>I can spray away and only get a nice fresh clean soft scent.</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful and I use this everyday for several years already.</li>
            <li>I received this in about three days, so it came very fast.</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying this particular scent, after using the plum and sakura scent and loving it for the last couple years.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible this will not be as strong as you remember unless you use a lot of it, in which case it could be used up pretty quickly</li>
            <li>/&gt;-small bottle can fit nearly anywhere&lt;</li>
            <li>Dove&#x27;s Body Mist has consistently been complemented on.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t last all day and didn&#x27;t smell authentic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, fruity, and clean which is hard for most fragrances to accomplish.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately</li>
            <li>Highly recommand this to anyone!</li>
            <li>Really appreciate you providing a place to purchase the product.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Since Dove is not making it anymore they are probably trying to make more money off of it by adding a bunch of water to the last few they have and putting it into more bottles.</li>
            <li>I purchase this for a family member who lives overseas and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>I found that this doesn&#x27;t smell like much until a while after I spray it on.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, but lasts a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I spray this before hitting the gym &amp; when I don&#x27;t want to wear a deodorant due to the ingredients found in most deodorants.</li>
            <li>I was sad to see this go off of store shelves because I loved it so much, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon for so cheap.</li>
            <li>We all love the scent,and after spraying,at actually lasts pretty long</li>
            <li>buy this particular product at Wal-mart</li>
            <li>Love this product, it should go back on the market in your local stores.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the purchase even though I do think it was a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>I live in Hawaii and no one here sells it.</li>
            <li>However, I couldn&#x27;t find them at the stores where I live.</li>
            <li>Had a stronger smell than I expected for a body mist, but not bad at all.  </li>
            <li>Like all women I take extraordinary measures to smell beyond fantastic all day long everyday 7 days a week.</li>
            <li>I am allergic to most body sprays &amp; perfumes but this is one of the very few which do not give me a headache or make me nauseous.</li>
            <li>Not at all heavy or strong.</li>
            <li>Probably fine for everyday use.</li>
            <li>a tiny amount goes so fast</li>
            <li>The sensitive skin one.</li>
            <li>The scent is mild &amp; quite long lasting.</li>
            <li>small 3 ounce size has it&#x27;s benefits I suppose, it could fit in your purse if you need to take it with you</li>
            <li>I can barely smell the pomegranate/lemon sent in it, compared to when I&#x27;ve gotten it before.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last for even 1 complete hour.</li>

            <li> small 3 ounce size has it&#x27;s benefits I suppose, it could fit in your purse if you need to take it with you</li>
            <li> I can barely smell the pomegranate/lemon sent in it, compared to when I&#x27;ve gotten it before.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last for even 1 complete hour.</li>
            <li> but it seems to last long enough for me</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very balanced and rounded out smell that I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s important and nostalgic to me.</li>
            <li> Perfume or cologne can be too heavy in the summer and early fall months.  </li>
            <li> Walking by the closet is an excuse to refresh myself with a spritz just because.  </li>
            <li> It is getting harder and harder to find it - unbelievable, if they really discontinue this series!</li>
            <li> /&gt;-lasts a long time on your skin</li>
            <li> Might try some other aromas next time!</li>
            <li> so it tends to get a little pricey after a while for such a miniscule</li>
            <li> I got this because there was a Dove soap called Rosewood and Shea butter and it was a pink colored soap.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to carry anywhere I go.</li>
            <li> Then, you sprit a few times with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too heavy like a perfume would be.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone but its hard to find in stores .most</li>
            <li> I have had lotions and sprays that co workers are not thrilled with.&lt;br</li>
            <li> however I think they are cheating us, well at least from the pack I bought on here.</li>
            <li> I order shampoos that cannot be bought in the us, I use expensive creams and soaps</li>
            <li> Sorry, Dove, because I still use the bar soap.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Had a stronger smell than I expected for a body mist, but not bad at all.  Might try some other aromas next time!</li>
            <li> As described, delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> Why did Dove stop making this?!!!  It&#x27;s very nice and refreshing for spring/summer months.</li>
            <li> Overpriced and overly powerful smell that fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Purchased this item for my daughter. She loves the Dove Body Mist sprays.</li>
            <li> this is the best smelling stuff ever!!!!!!! Every time I wear it people tell me how good I smell! The only thing is I had to pay for shipping. I live in Hawaii and no one here sells it.</li>
            <li> I love scented, spritzing waters.  Perfume or cologne can be too heavy in the summer and early fall months.  If I wear either, I swear I become a bug magnet!  Dove Body mists are light, not overpowering. One is kept in the bathroom, bedroom and even the hall closet. Walking by the closet is an excuse to refresh myself with a spritz just because.  Love doing that.  Will order again and recommend to anyone who comments on how lovely my &amp;#34;perfume&amp;#34; is.</li>
            <li> Smells fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite body mist of all time, itÂ´s the best available! The scent is wonderful and I use this everyday for several years already. I canÂ´t believe that this product seems to get discontinued in the local stores. It is getting harder and harder to find it - unbelievable, if they really discontinue this series! I am glad to find this product at Amazon, and will order it here from now on! Highly recommand this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Like all women I take extraordinary measures to smell beyond fantastic all day long everyday 7 days a week. I order shampoos that cannot be bought in the us, I use expensive creams and soaps and I use Dove as my &#x27;after shower spritzer&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy this particular product at Wal-mart and I pay about 4 dollars a 3 ounce bottle, I go through this stuff like it&#x27;s nothing so it tends to get a little pricey after a while for such a miniscule amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hop out of the shower where I apply a generous amount of Bath and body works pom shea butter to myself followed by an equally generous spritzing all over my body with this Dove stuff and I smell so good I could eat myself up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The small 3 ounce size has it&#x27;s benefits I suppose, it could fit in your purse if you need to take it with you but it seems to last long enough for me I don&#x27;t ever need to take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-small bottle can fit nearly anywhere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-super fantastic smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-lasts a long time on your skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-such a tiny amount goes so fast and it does get expensive when you go through so many bottles&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to people, it just smells too good. Anything that keeps my hunny coming back to me to bury his nose in my neck because I smell so good gets thumbs up from me.</li>
            <li> I work in an office.  I have had lotions and sprays that co workers are not thrilled with.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is over powering.  Dove&#x27;s Body Mist has consistently been complemented on.</li>
            <li> I already had this item so I knew what it was and smelled like. I was happy with the purchase even though I do think it was a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell exactly like the old one but is still a good scent</li>
            <li> Thanks! Was worried I would have to find something different bc I couldn&#x27;t find this in stores anymore! Made my day!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this body mist. However, I couldn&#x27;t find them at the stores where I live. Fast delivery, came as 3-pack which is good because I use it a lot.</li>
            <li> Love it and will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> My Wife Loves the product!  She has used it for years and Walmart stopped carrying it in the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We Really appreciate you providing a place to purchase the product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to everyone but its hard to find in stores .most have discontinued it .that makes me sad because I love it.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love it wish they were still being sold in stores everytime I find something I like they somehow discontinue it.</li>
            <li> Love the fragrance - wish this was sold at the market like it used to be for convenience.</li>
            <li> Best scent EVER! I use the deodorant, body wash and spray all the time.</li>
            <li> Love this Dove body spray!</li>
            <li> love the way that this smells. I gave two as gifts and kept one for myself. We all love the scent,and after spraying,at actually lasts pretty long</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. It is no longer available in stores and came in a 3 pack online. Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a light, sweet fragrance and the only kind I like.  I used to be able to get it easily but now I can&#x27;t seem to find it.  Glad to be able to purchase it here.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Perfect for a body spray. I order in bulk.</li>
            <li> loved the smell and size &#x3D; perfect for travel and purse - loved it and will order it!!!  thank u</li>
            <li> Okay guys I really love Dove&#x27;s spray and it is like the only body spray I use. I am very sad to see them not producing them anymore. Now it seems they are just selling what they have left over....however I think they are cheating us, well at least from the pack I bought on here. Do not buy this pack I am pretty sure they diluted it with water. I can barely smell the pomegranate/lemon sent in it, compared to when I&#x27;ve gotten it before. Since Dove is not making it anymore they are probably trying to make more money off of it by adding a bunch of water to the last few they have and putting it into more bottles. Dove c&#x27;mon on don&#x27;t swindle us....that is dishonest:/</li>
            <li> I purchase this for a family member who lives overseas and she absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells great doesn&#x27;t stain. I spray this before hitting the gym &amp; when I don&#x27;t want to wear a deodorant due to the ingredients found in most deodorants.</li>
            <li> I love this smell. It&#x27;s important and nostalgic to me. It smell expensive and awesome, but is also super cheap. I&#x27;m really glad they still sell this online  because I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore.</li>
            <li> Love this product, glad I am able to find it online.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying this particular scent, after using the plum and sakura scent and loving it for the last couple years.  I&#x27;m glad I found these online, since they&#x27;re no longer sold in stores, but I admit I was underwhelmed.  It&#x27;s possible this will not be as strong as you remember unless you use a lot of it, in which case it could be used up pretty quickly (good thing it&#x27;s a pack of three).  I found that this doesn&#x27;t smell like much until a while after I spray it on.  It smells kind of like pink lemonade, which is pleasant and light.  Probably fine for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the product and price. Fast delivery</li>
            <li> I got this because there was a Dove soap called Rosewood and Shea butter and it was a pink colored soap.  It was lovely, so I tried this.  It smells nice, but lasts a few minutes.  Oh well, I guess I got what I paid for.  I feel Dove is just trying to flood the market with products.  No thought goes in for quality.  Just my opinion.  Would not purchase again.  Sorry, Dove, because I still use the bar soap.  The sensitive skin one.</li>
            <li> Best stuff ever.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I was sad to see this go off of store shelves because I loved it so much, but I was very pleasantly surprised to find it on Amazon for so cheap. I received this in about three days, so it came very fast. It still smells fresh and fruity like I remember. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase. It&#x27;s a great body spray to wear to the gym or to wear on a regular basis. I also use it as an air freshener or I sometimes spray my comforter with it so I can snuggle into my bed and smell it. Great find!</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance but it doesn&#x27;t last for even 1 complete hour. I have to reapply it again and again and 1 bottle does not last for even 1 week!! I guess they mix water in it.. Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I so love this spray! The perfect scent, fruity without being sickly sweet . This has a matching scented deodorant that is terrific also.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores lately so was glad to find it online. I fear they&#x27;ve stopped producing it so trying to stockpile!  :)</li>
            <li> Love this product, it should go back on the market in your local stores.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite scent. I&#x27;m always worried it will be discontinued so I should probably by a lifetime&#x27;s worth, just in case. It&#x27;s light, fruity, and clean which is hard for most fragrances to accomplish.</li>
            <li> This makes me smell like a plastic baby doll. But it is a nice freshen upper while working at my job.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but Amazon! It&#x27;s a light, refreshing scent for every mood. Small enough to carry anywhere I go. Love it!</li>
            <li> Having seen it, I tried it because the price was so good.  And I was actually impressed.  I&#x27;d describe the smell as rounded, wholesome and sweet. And it lingers.  It&#x27;s a very balanced and rounded out smell that I&#x27;m not sure could actually, \\&quot;lose\\&quot; either way.  What I like about it is that it smells just like the soap that you used in the shower.  Then, you sprit a few times with this and you smell showered clean all day.  I really like it.  I think it&#x27;s a \\&quot;comforting smell.\\&quot;  Which reminds me, I&#x27;ve recently run out so I think I&#x27;ll re stock! :)</li>
            <li> My favorite go to scent...refreshing, clean and very feminine this is my every day go to work, do anything spray</li>
            <li> It was a great value, received two packs of five.  I keep one in my purse for a quick spritz whenever I need to freshen up.  It&#x27;s not too heavy like a perfume would be.  It&#x27;s very light and refreshing</li>
            <li> I think the price was good for 3 however I don&#x27;t know if this was the original smell. It didn&#x27;t last all day and didn&#x27;t smell authentic</li>
            <li> when I ordered it the estimated delivery date was 2 weeks later but I actually got it 3 days later which made me very happy. Everything was in tact and all the bottles were there. It&#x27;s just the best body mist with the best smell</li>
            <li> love it and will be ordering some more of it soon also fast shipping thank you!!!</li>
            <li> Love it!! Best body spray</li>
            <li> Two raging thumbs up!</li>
            <li> After calling Dove &#x27;s 800 number and finding out this is no longer made, I quickly came to Amazon and found what I was looking for!</li>
            <li> Love love love Dove Body Mist. I am allergic to most body sprays &amp; perfumes but this is one of the very few which do not give me a headache or make me nauseous. The scent is mild &amp; quite long lasting.</li>
            <li> Not at all heavy or strong. I can spray away and only get a nice fresh clean soft scent. I have a bottle at work and one at home. This is great stuff and is my favorite fragrance of the Dove Mist line. I really don&#x27;t feel the need to spend money on perfume anymore, though I do still love J&#x27;adore.</li>
            <li> I love using this spray.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great deal. Thank you</li>
            <li> Love it can&#x27;t find any were else.</li>
