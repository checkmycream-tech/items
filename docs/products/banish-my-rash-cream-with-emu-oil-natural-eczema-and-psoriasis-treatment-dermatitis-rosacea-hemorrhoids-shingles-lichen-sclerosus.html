            <li> My skin is no longer red &amp; is back to normal...</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s been a little less than a week, and Emu Bliss is really helping me.  </li>
            <li> All was well for a really long time, but I recently had a flare-up in my 30s.  </li>
            <li> then I forgot about it until a few days ago and to my suriprise  the arm was normal</li>
            <li> My palms are actually beginning to look normal, and I am itching less and less.  </li>
            <li> They have been extremely dry, flaky and itchy causing the skin to crack, hurt and bleed.</li>
            <li> I have suffered for years with dry, itching, stinging, burning skin in my scalp, neck, feet and shoulders.</li>
            <li> and figured I had nothing to loose</li>
            <li> I still have about half the jar left.</li>
            <li> She has very dry itchy skin and will not use skin cream.  </li>
            <li> I randomly stumbled upon Emu Bliss online, and decided the reviews were positive enough for me to try out a bit of a pricier product.  </li>
            <li> The negative is that I have eczema like patches that flare up into rashes frequently, and the cream did not help with that.</li>
            <li> I tried a few standard over-the-counter remedies, but nothing seemed to truly work.  </li>
            <li> but is not strong enough at the moment.</li>
            <li> He never wants to be out and have to say its a miracle product!</li>
            <li> A small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> No more cracked and severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have had this cream for over a month now and still have about a half of the jar.</li>
            <li> -  have been using once or twice a day - anxious to try their other products.</li>
            <li> I have been prescribed steroid creams over and over and then some other prescription creams/ointments with possible scary side effects.</li>
            <li> The worst spot is not gone, but extremely improved and getting better each week.</li>
            <li> I still had a tad of itchiness after use but not as much as usual.</li>
            <li> No more discomfort.</li>
            <li> I have hardly had an &amp;#34;itch attack&amp;#34; since (when I just have to sit and breathe so as not to claw my skin).</li>
            <li> In the last few days, it has become painful and was waking me at night.</li>
            <li> Overall I was disappointed as I was specifically wanting a cream to help with eczema.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s tired of trying pills and trying creams.</li>
            <li> My baby&#x27;s skin got a lot worse.</li>
            <li> This rash relief cream cleared up a diaper rash in less than 24 hours after a Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s brand failed us (and made it worse!!).</li>
            <li> Needless to say it is unsightly.</li>
            <li> I dealt with terrible eczema on my palms for a few years as a child.  </li>
            <li> Very expensive test.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for a horribly itchy, and blistering rash he gets if he accidentally ingests wheat.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how miserable</li>

            <li> This felt nice on my skin and absorbed nicely. I still had a tad of itchiness after use but not as much as usual.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughters eczema and while it feels like a nice moisturizer it did nothing to relieve the itch and dryness of her eczema. Overall I was disappointed as I was specifically wanting a cream to help with eczema.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. Low fragrance and high effect. Blends in easy and is not just fluffy water. Not snake oil; don&#x27;t expect miracles but provides relief from cracks and chapped skin and allows healing. And doesn&#x27;t sting at all like some ointments and balms can.</li>
            <li> This c r am is amazing. I&#x27;ve had a rash for months that comes and goes. No joke after 1 use of this cream it&#x27;s like it was never there. Thanks so much. I love your product!</li>
            <li> It made my daughter&#x27;s skin itch as soon as she put it on her hand. She had to wash it off immediately. Not for her. She has nummular dermatitis and this was supposed to work for her. Very expensive test.</li>
            <li> AMAZING stuff. My boyfriend has suffered for years with an undiagnosed skin condition...he&#x27;s been told its so many different things and he&#x27;s tired of trying pills and trying creams. Finally found something organic and he said it&#x27;s helped so much with the itching. Will definitely buy again when he runs out!</li>
            <li> my right arm had itched since last may. I used emubliss on the itch for about two weeks. then I forgot about it until a few days ago and to my suriprise  the arm was normal no itch and the skin had returned to its normal texture.</li>
            <li> i really like it. it works very well.</li>
            <li> Great product with quality ingredients I can feel safe with. This rash relief cream cleared up a diaper rash in less than 24 hours after a Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s brand failed us (and made it worse!!). I am very happy with the product. The amount you receive for the price is more than reasonable. I will be a return customer. Thank you!!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for a horribly itchy, and blistering rash he gets if he accidentally ingests wheat. Nothing ever worked before, and now he has relief. He never wants to be out and have to say its a miracle product!</li>
            <li> It does not work at all. My baby&#x27;s skin got a lot worse.</li>
            <li> Started using this cream and only after applying it for 3 days the rash started clearing up, it worked great!</li>
            <li> This product is really incredible. I developed severe eczema out of the clear blue about 7 years ago(mainly on my feet). They have been extremely dry, flaky and itchy causing the skin to crack, hurt and bleed. Needless to say it is unsightly. I have been prescribed steroid creams over and over and then some other prescription creams/ointments with possible scary side effects. I am a registered nurse and had concerns about these products. I went online and researched and read reviews and figured I had nothing to loose so I ordered this about a month ago. What An Incredible Difference! I still have some red spots (who cares), but skin has healed and looks 100% better. No more cracked and severely dry skin. No more discomfort. The worst spot is not gone, but extremely improved and getting better each week. I am thrilled beyond belief and enjoying my sandals this summer(I live in Florida) and it is sandal weather a good part of the year here. Hands down this is the best thing ever! I will definitely be ordering again and again. I have had this cream for over a month now and still have about a half of the jar. I started out using 3 times a day and after about a week went to twice a day. I still have about half the jar left. The price is a little high (but worth the results). It would definitely be nice if they would offer a 4 - 5 ounce jar at a better price. I did get free shipping and that helps. If you are suffering from eczema don&#x27;t delay order this. Give it time to work you will start to see great improvement.</li>
            <li> It was amazinf how quickly the redness and itching disappeared</li>
            <li> The scent of the cream is an extremely strong floral scent.</li>
            <li> I have a severe case of Lichen Sclerosis and this seems to help sometimes but is not strong enough at the moment. I will be keeping it and after I heal more I will use it. Smells great, soothes the itching but I don&#x27;t see and skin improvement. Been using for 2 months.</li>
            <li> Awesome product that is actually healthy for you!</li>
            <li> It was okay but it only received itching for a short time. I was hoping for longer relief especially at night.</li>
            <li> Thank you so very much for inventing this cream... After applying this cream, it was an instant relief from the \\&quot;itching skin\\&quot; around my ankle bone... I have real deep varicose veins, I ended up with 6 ulcers - 3 on each side of my ankle, my ankles were very red, itchy &amp; very swollen..  It hurt to walk..  This Emu cream was a God Send...  Thank you so very much.  I finally found a cream that takes away my itching &amp; it is AWESOME!  It was like a rash.. My skin is no longer red &amp; is back to normal... I love the idea of this being &#x27;&#x27;ALL NATURAL&#x27;&#x27;.      I LOVE THIS PRODUCT...  Thanks again...</li>
            <li> This is my very true honest opinion,natural products i always the best!!! It really banishes my  severe skin allergies (rashes).I love this product but it&#x27;s too pricey for me.$10 less will be much better .</li>
            <li> I dealt with terrible eczema on my palms for a few years as a child.  All was well for a really long time, but I recently had a flare-up in my 30s.

My palms are actually beginning to look normal, and I am itching less and less.  I am extremely impressed with Emu Bliss and hope it continues to work like a charm!</li>
            <li> Nice smelling, nice feeling cream on your skin. That&#x27;s the plus side. The negative is that I have eczema like patches that flare up into rashes frequently, and the cream did not help with that.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product! I have suffered for years with dry, itching, stinging, burning skin in my scalp, neck, feet and shoulders. In the last few days, it has become painful and was waking me at night. I ordered Banish My Rash on 2nd day delivery and used it right away. That&#x27;s how miserable I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was soothing on contact and, when I went to sleep that night, I slept better than I have in ages. I have hardly had an &amp;#34;itch attack&amp;#34; since (when I just have to sit and breathe so as not to claw my skin). I haven&#x27;t had to take any antihistamines or ibuprofen for pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also,.it has a nice smell. I run it on my legs after shaving and it has a nice sheen without being too sticky. I am really sensitive to smells and yucky feeling.products. This stuff is so soothing and nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this ointment!! The price is a major bargain for the effectiveness. You will be so relieved and glad you bought it!!</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters skin.  She has very dry itchy skin and will not use skin cream.  But she uses this and seems to calm the inching down.</li>
            <li> Very rich and healing cream that actually DID banish my rash with only a few applications!  A small amount goes a long way!</li>
            <li> Had skin irritations on my arm - have tried all different kinds of creams and lotions - finally made a dermatology apt but was 6 months out- tried this cream that i happened to find on line  and it is wonderful !  Nice light scent and has quieted the irritations -  have been using once or twice a day - anxious to try their other products.</li>
