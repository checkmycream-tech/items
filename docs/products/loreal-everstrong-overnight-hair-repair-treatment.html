            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>Was I in for a NICE surprise!  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d give the shampoo and conditioner a try, and they were ok, but not the best.  </li>
            <li>you did have a good experience with this hair repairing treatment, that&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Still loving it!</li>
            <li>The product had a pleasant coconut fragrance which is one of my favorites.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this based solely on the good reviews.</li>
            <li>This EverStrong give superior protection, strength, and conditioning support for relaxed hair.    </li>
            <li>It smells great, goes on nice and</li>
            <li>so it seemed like as good a time as any to try any end treatments I wanted.</li>
            <li>It made my head itch almost from the moment I put it on, again, I would&#x27;ve dealt with this, if it had done something good for my hair.</li>
            <li>I figured it should work, since they all had very healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li>put in 3 pumps and absorbed in my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>i bought it over the pc, and i love it, would not even thing of trying something else, and it is great on colored hair also.</li>
            <li>whatever I&#x27;m VERY pleased the smell fades.</li>
            <li>After giving it a try, i honestly feel it is not as good as it seems to be.</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>

            <li>It smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how amazing this product...</li>
            <li>The results have been spectacular.  </li>
            <li>God bless u all and have a nice day.</li>
            <li>I am thrilled I can get it online.</li>
            <li>The product has a nice smell.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and am glad I went against my skepticism because this was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Good for hair thats been colored, processed, sundamaged or even healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It lasts quite a while since it does not take much to be effective either.</li>
            <li>bought this because of  good company and so many reviews(good ones)</li>
            <li>It is also nice that it is an overnight treatment bc</li>
            <li>I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I have always loved L&#x27;oreal because of how well my hair responds to it, and so when I tried this to see if it would help me grow my hair faster for my wedding, it was a fantastic idea!</li>
            <li>Its perfect for dry scalp and it works great.</li>
            <li>and therefore we were delighted that Amazon makes it so easy.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair throughout the day because it feels so amazing.</li>
            <li>And since it was Sulfate free and smelled SO good, I just couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li>the price was great, so if you have damaged hair it might be worth a try for you to give it a try.</li>
            <li>my hair is mega shiny soft and smells great!</li>
            <li>I like touching my own hair during the day.</li>
            <li>Amazing how you can put a lot on your hair, go to bed, and wake without anything on your pillow, but your hair softer and in better condition.</li>
            <li>My hair is VERY FINE and&lt;br /&gt;color treated.</li>
            <li>I did about 5-6 pumps and was super impressed that it just soaks right in.</li>
            <li>The smell is super pleasant.</li>
            <li>In conjunction with my other styling products, this gave me a gorgeous mane I could be proud of!</li>
            <li>It does an incredible job of making your hair feel very soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>It is fantastic and for some reason I can&#x27;t find it at Target or Wal-Mart, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon still carries it!</li>
            <li>usage!and sulfate free makes it all better!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Also it took 10 or more pumps not 2 for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li>I applied three pumps of this lotion and combed it through my hair, mostly working on the ends rather than the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and pray L&#x27;Oreal will not take it off the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost out though, so as soon as I can I&#x27;m going to have to go get some more.</li>
            <li>We both love the product and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li>I will say that you&#x27;ll probably need more than the recommended 1-2 pumps.  </li>
            <li>I did not need to use more than 2 pumps.</li>
            <li>Which is more what I was after.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use it until it is gone, but I won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Better than the EverStrong shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>I love that I can run this through my hair</li>
            <li>However many pumps you need, rub your palms together and press / work through hair.</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use it in the morning and evening after washing my hair.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for 2 weeks now and its gradually making my hair better.</li>
            <li>Its a lot cheaper than the salon products I have bought before and works a lot better.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel SO much better after just one use.</li>
            <li>:) I&#x27;m glad I have it, but I don&#x27;t use it every night either-</li>
            <li>It does take a but of time, do not expect this to magically fix you hair over night.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of the product, it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and</li>
            <li>Love this product, one of the best deep conditioners and repair products.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>I have wavy/straight hair that has many fried split ends.</li>
            <li>When I used this product overnight I noticed it made my hair more greasy, and when I used a lot</li>
            <li>It works okay as a styling product though.</li>
            <li>I love love love this product.</li>
            <li>I was glad to see I can still find it.  </li>
            <li>I consider this the \\&quot;better than nothing\\&quot; overnight treatment.</li>
            <li>Pantene Pro-V Overnight Miracle is better.</li>
            <li>Will probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products in my life and this is one that did nothing for my hair, literally.</li>
            <li>This helps to keep my ends healthy so that my hair can stay long!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I do LOVE so many of the L;oreal products, from their hair products to their day and night cremes, their make up you name it.</li>
            <li>Hair is, in fact, the most reliable indicator of whether a person is healthy.</li>
            <li>bottom line is that none of the 5 products are magical</li>
            <li>This is my favorite conditioning treatment of all time.</li>
            <li>This product lives up to it&#x27;s claim and more, My hair is relaxed.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.   </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>After one night my ends are noticeably more moisturized.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping it continues to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Especially now that the weather is getting colder my hair seems to get a lot more dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this product does help a bit.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased that I decided to subscribe to get one can of treatment every month from Amazon.com.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, so I don&#x27;t catch my comb on hairs and rip any more out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You do need to use more of this product than is suggested.  </li>
            <li>and I use more than 2 pumps.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I color my hair every 6 weeks, a blond foil, so I need to do all I can to keep the ends healthy.</li>
            <li>On a whim, I bought this product and was suprised and impressed by the texture of my hair the next morning.</li>
            <li>i love also the smell.</li>
            <li>I just wish there was more of it in the bottle.</li>
            <li>The highlights and color have made my flyaway hair even more so.</li>
            <li>My hair looks so much better, and it is well conditioned.</li>
            <li>love all the loreal salon products.</li>
            <li>And i have tried most of loreal drugstore ones.</li>
            <li>I love the subscribe and save products.  </li>
            <li>If used on a regular basis, I could see it being great!</li>
            <li>you made me a happy camper,thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;shirley evans</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks better.  </li>
            <li>I think I just found my staple moisturizer :).</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I want to say it took probably 10 pumps just to get it though most of my hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for others and</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I would think that L&#x27;Oreal could produce much better products to use on your hair at home.</li>
            <li>It did not feel stronger, shinier, softer, or more moisturized.</li>
            <li>so I have been pleased to put up a supply for &#x27;hair emergencies.&#x27;</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>but I thought it would do a better job.</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m kicking myself for not buying more than one, bc</li>
            <li>I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li>but now it looks healthy and thicker.</li>
            <li>Not super amazing but a very good effect for the money!</li>
            <li>To me, the scent was mild, at best, but pleasant, and by the time I went to bed (less than five minutes after applying the treatment), I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li>This is a SIGNIFICANT difference!  </li>
            <li>Provides for a more even and easy distribution that way.</li>
            <li>The odor is pleasant and not appalling..</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m natural, I use it to fortify my hair after it&#x27;s been pressed out and it still does a great job.</li>
            <li>Which is cool!</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff and because it was offered with free shipping I think it was a good deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>It damages so easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the product was easy.</li>
            <li>it worked into my hair easily.</li>
            <li>I have spent $$$$$ on the best products available.</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s thinner it absorbs into hair easily</li>
            <li>It does have a fairly strong coconut scent.</li>
            <li>I noticed the smell isn&#x27;t as strong....</li>
            <li>My hair looked lovely and healthy, and I enjoy some fun product and pampering time, but I have a life that doesn&#x27;t revolve around my hair too.  </li>
            <li>At first i thought this was like a foam kind of treatment but</li>
            <li>It meant a noticeable difference in flyaways, and my fine hair still felt styled hours after I was done drying it.  </li>
            <li>and i use it almost every night since then ,and every morning i love how my hair look so healthy.;)</li>
            <li>In the morning, after brushing, the smell is almost gone (fortunately for me) and my hair does feel pretty nice</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and colored and this product helps ..</li>
            <li>I was experiencing (a tremendous amount!)  </li>
            <li>I have incredibly fine, processed hair, so breakage and split-ends and frizziness are a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li>I even saw results after using it the very first time!    </li>
            <li>so its important that I take care of it.</li>
            <li>This really does make your hair look nice.  </li>
            <li>is a great treatment to use if you like to wear second day hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Below is a detailed review of each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>(3.8 stars) ($0.54/ounce) - If the shampoo does most of the moisturizing \\&quot;work,\\&quot; then the conditioner seems kind of like the sealant to lock it in and protect it all day, and to make your hair more \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; This conditioner does that job well enough</li>
            <li>The ends look smooth and my hair is not shedding.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s the difference between glops and smooth</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy to report that I am back to\\&quot;average\\&quot; hair loss</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I think it is a fantastic idea (the overnight part).</li>
            <li>from one use, my hair feel incredibly smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>but when you wake up your hair is soft and has a good smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the L&#x27;oreal professional sulfate free line for my shampoo and conditioner and it&#x27;s a good combo of quality and price.</li>
            <li>After reading all of the great reviews, I read the low star ones too, but thought there many more raving high star reviews.</li>
            <li>so after 6 months my hair was beautiful, it was soft,and shinny, and no more split ends, i was so happy with it, and seeing i live in canada,we don&#x27;t get it here, so</li>
            <li>My hair has become strong, but also very silky looking and feeling, shiny, and healthy.  </li>
            <li>I could literally tell the difference in moisture absorbed by weight!  </li>
            <li>My hair is noticeably shinier, healthier, and more manageable after using this product consistently.</li>
            <li>but I find if you rub it through your hands first, you get more even</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s best to put the product into your hands and rub them together first before working it into your hair.</li>
            <li>so excited...</li>
            <li>My hair was always shiny, but it also had a significant number of split ends that made my hair look frizzy and</li>
            <li>I was SO excited to use this.</li>
            <li>I love this product so much that I bought a bottle for my Mom to use and enjoy as well.</li>
            <li>I like this product,works great for dry and highlighted hair...</li>
            <li>Very Dry Naturally Curly hair doesn&#x27;t get better with length or age, but I am managing to get a nice length by using this as an in between treatment on a day I didn&#x27;t do the full shampoo, condition, and leave in moisturizer routine to keep the ends in good repair.</li>
            <li>Given the price and the smell, and that there are other products that do just as good or better, I won&#x27;t be getting this again.</li>
            <li>Although it has not helped my split ends, it has made my hair look very shiny and munch more manageable in the mornings.</li>
            <li>After years of taking advantage of the Amazon reviews I am inspired to write one because I love this product that much.  </li>
            <li>I also use more than recommended because I like to really cover the ends on my hair and also the bottom layer.</li>
            <li>Kind of soft but with stuff in it.</li>
            <li>So, I bought the full size product.  </li>
            <li>Like I said, it seems like a good product, I just couldn&#x27;t see a big difference.</li>
            <li>UPDATE- my mom just mentioned this again to me and says that she can really tell the difference in how healthy her hair is when she uses it.</li>
            <li>They have really good products, but this one, I actually threw it away, and I NEVER throw anything away.</li>
            <li>That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the texture very creamy</li>
            <li>smell as others said was true..</li>
            <li>2 pumps work well for me, and wake-up to full, conditioned hair.</li>
            <li>It really makes my hair healthy.</li>
            <li>heavy,smells nice, finally I can brush my hair so easily.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tangles easily, so this products really reduces the tangles and makes it look much healthier.</li>
            <li>Green\\&quot;...sort of plant-like or, like mild, sweet, pipe tobacco and coconut....</li>
            <li>Awesome affordable product,it works for my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>It was well packaged and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>When reading the ingredient list, I noticed that the fifth ingredient in this is alcohol, which promotes quick drying.  </li>
            <li>I had to use A LOT of it because of how quickly it soaks up.</li>
            <li>That night I slept with a sleep cap on, because I&#x27;m like a super restless sleeper</li>
            <li>- It works noticeably better than my old shampoo (Aussie Smooth).</li>
            <li>Even if I thought it smelled horrid, I would mix in a drop of my favorite essential oil, and gladly keep using this product.  </li>
            <li>Dries quickly too.</li>
            <li>Tried many, many products and keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li>After hair is soft, smooth, full and with out fly aways but not flat.</li>
            <li>Am hoping for good long term results with continued use.</li>
            <li>The product tends to glob and concentrate in certain sections, which does not allow for easy or even treatment of the effected areas.</li>
            <li>I use much less styling product, if any, and get great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because hydrated hair is pretty much what healthy hair</li>
            <li>I noticed a difference after my first use!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>it smells nice, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on the pillow, and with regular use, my hair looks shinier.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but no significant change.  </li>
            <li>It takes a few weeks but the results are great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would recommend this for anyone with dried out hair or even frizzy since the moisture is great for it.</li>
            <li>I hope it&#x27;s worth putting up with the smell all day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li>I recommend it if you want healthy silky moisturized soft hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this stuff every night, mostly because I forget, but when I do my hair always feels really soft when I wake up.</li>
            <li>While 2 \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; are perfect for the overnight treatment (which definitely goes in the hair, never the pillow), I got curious about using the Overnight Treatment as a leave-in during the day.</li>
            <li>My ends felt so soft and healthy after one night that I changed my mind about needing to go for a haircut.  </li>
            <li>My ends are also always very brittle, and now they are nice and soft.</li>
            <li>It still works the same, my hair feels so silky and smells nice after applying and leaving in overnight.</li>
            <li>I say its worth it.</li>
            <li>I have tried this product for several nights and I honestly have not seen anything I like.</li>
            <li>The treatment made my hair smell nice, but it still felt similar to steel wool toward the tips.</li>
            <li>every kind of hair product has bothered me (physically) headaches sore throats sinus pain etc</li>
            <li>the price is worth trying.</li>
            <li>The smell is fresh.</li>
            <li>I had used a sample and really liked it a while back.</li>
            <li>It gets absorbed into my hair with no residue.</li>
            <li>i mean this treatment really work, this save my hair from a haircut :D</li>
            <li>so I ended up using four pumps because the first two just seemed to get sucked into my hair that quick.  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me to go to work every day with the leave-in treatment on my hair (which you can&#x27;t really smell after it dies anyway), and it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair wet or oily.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for myself and loved the smell of it (and the results) that I gave it to my mom for Christmas along with some other things.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice a significant difference after using this product.</li>
            <li>It washes right out.</li>
            <li>The reviewers of Amazon have always steered me in the right direction.  </li>
            <li>I use this right before wrapping at night.</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm, my hair shined right up, grew faster then ever and smelled fantastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoy your new hair!</li>
            <li>It has a very soft smell and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I kinda bought this on a whim after reading how good reviews were on this product (not to mention the other product I bought first sucked).</li>
            <li>hair is not dry anymore and seems to have more strength and weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put it on in the early evening so the scent isn&#x27;t strong when I go to bed</li>
            <li>honestly, unless you just can&#x27;t wait to get home, wash your hair and let it sit and air dry how often are you going to do this or how often are you going to want to do this.  </li>
            <li>Very very noticeable results.  </li>
            <li>It ran out like very fast also .</li>
            <li>I really had high hopes for this product, it did not meet my expectations by any means!!!</li>
            <li>But it may work much more noticeably on someone whose hair isn&#x27;t already soft, since softening seems to be its main function.</li>
            <li>notice the difference after first use.</li>
            <li>It really moisturizes your hair along with helping it grow faster!</li>
            <li>and I think I still only needed about 4 pumps to feel satisfied.</li>
            <li>night, I tried this product for the first time, and, after washing my hair this morning, I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is chemically lightened and this made it much darker !</li>
            <li>After the first use i could feel the change.</li>
            <li>This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner, except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y.</li>
            <li>This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner, except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y.</li>
            <li>I saw results within the first use.</li>
            <li>Actually, I like it better than Mizani&#x27;s buttercream hairdress to liven my hair between shampoos.</li>
            <li>Second day in and while my hair hasn&#x27;t improved since yesterday it is just as lovely.</li>
            <li>I was willing to try this product for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>couldn&#x27;t believe the noticeable results that I saw immediately, even after my first treatment.  </li>
            <li>looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product regularly now and my hair could not look better.  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this, my side bangs were bleached.</li>
            <li>So much healthier!</li>
            <li>When I had long(er) hair, I absolutely relied on this product!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>When I run low on the bottle I have now, I&#x27;m gonna buy two more from here c:</li>
            <li>This one is a first for me-</li>
            <li>I admit I purchased this product to try out and didn&#x27;t have super high expectations despite the reviews.  </li>
            <li>First, Loreal EverStrong Overnight made a stunning difference in completely eliminating \\&quot;morning frizz\\&quot; (familiar to anyone who perms their hair) and smoothed and softened the curl through the day so much that everyone in the salon wanted to feel my hair the next time I got it trimmed!</li>
            <li>hair looked great on my wedding day, and this little thing is *as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li>This is a nice deep condition which seems so far to protect the hair cuticle from heat damage.</li>
            <li>I am giving it two stars only because i loved its smell and the initial smoothness it gave.</li>
            <li>So far I love it hair is soft and shiny...</li>
            <li>I have really long hair, so I LOVE overnight products.</li>
            <li>/&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change at first.  </li>
            <li>If you have long hair, you will probably need more than 2 pumps.</li>
            <li>I have to confess I was a bit skeptical at first, and didn&#x27;t really like how it felt when I first applied the product to my hair, but what a pleasant surprise when I woke up!</li>
            <li>Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing.</li>
            <li>I did notice some shine towards the top of my head, but all my end hairs were still as dry as a broom.</li>
            <li>I use this product mostly on my bangs since they tend to dry out quicker, and I wanted them to grow out because they were NOT growing out</li>
            <li>Maybe my hair is resistant to being super soft and shiny?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this, and would recommend it to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li>I had to use more than 2 pumps for my shortish hair at first,now that my hair is not as dry 2 works</li>
            <li>Also, I notice a pleasant LIGHT scent, and no glops or random placement</li>
            <li>But I like this one better than the Pantene; the Pantene is a little bit more wet while this one is lighter and that works better for my hair which is fine - it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down the way the Pantene does.</li>
            <li>I am SO pleased with this product and will use it for a very long time!</li>
            <li>It really has been a life saver for my hair.</li>
            <li>Go on youtube and watch the video of the woman who wraps her hair overnight to keep it straight.  </li>
            <li>Product works really well for me</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t really have any split ends.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t smell it that much.</li>
            <li>I really do like this product.  </li>
            <li>and it really protects from chlorine damage.  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>BUT I don&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li>and i really need a product for my split ends...</li>
            <li>This has really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair so much body.</li>
            <li>I use this as leave-in conditioner (very curly hair).</li>
            <li>I read the reviews on this product and everyone seemed to say it worked really well.</li>
            <li>but I expected it was better</li>
            <li>i dont have that much hair and my hair</li>
            <li>is straight.</li>
            <li>I found it really helped on the night after II washed my hair.</li>
            <li>I stand by Loreal products as a whole.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>This has really improved the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li>And I really noticed the difference after motorcycling -</li>
            <li>It really improves the hair.</li>
            <li>I shower at night, so I put it in my hair wet, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have stopped it from working it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see what it did too much .</li>
            <li>Nothing seemed to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair felt so much softer, and it looked like</li>
            <li>It is much easier to style (I have</li>
            <li>I also like the fact that it really does work.  </li>
            <li>The consistency is too wet should be more like a cream .</li>
            <li>this product works really well.</li>
            <li>would recommend this to those looking for a great pre-shampoo treatment for thick natural hair.</li>
            <li>You can actually see and feel your hair&#x27;s improvement after the first use, and it only gets better with continued use.</li>
            <li>Seems to do a decent Job at conditioning, the smell is very perfume-y, one that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that is colored and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>Not sure it really improves anything, but it does make your hair feel nice while it&#x27;s in use.</li>
            <li>I have fairly long hair,it&#x27;s fine textured</li>
            <li>tell you all of this because I can achieve the exact same results with this less-than-$10 product right here</li>
            <li>Healthy hair is also the result of things like drinking water and eating right and avoiding excessive sun or heat.</li>
            <li>So if your sensitive to strong lasting smells, don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li>I thought I was imagining it and that it wasn&#x27;t possible to see results so quickly, but my familiy also commented about how much nicer my hair</li>
            <li>I will probably buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I felt like I was beginning to lose more hair than average.  </li>
            <li>The cream spreads a little better in the wet hair, and I feel that the results are as good as treating on dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Based on other good reviews, I had high hopes for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Treatment, but my actual usage of it has far surpassed those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It makes it less frizzy, for sure</li>
            <li>Smooth hair (even those dry ends), and</li>
            <li>It is mildly hydrating, but &amp;#34;everstrong&amp;#34; is a bit hyperbolic for the effect the product actually has on my hair.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t add any added strength that I could discern and it doesn&#x27;t particularly hydrate well either.</li>
            <li>This one is decent -</li>
            <li>but I have noticed a mild to moderate improvement in shine, darkness, and thickness.</li>
            <li>So rather than recommending a particular product, I recommend that you do some trials and see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is entirely possible that someone with a different hair type would get better results with this.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I will use this seller, again and highly recommend this seller.  </li>
            <li>highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li>But I wouldn&#x27;t set my hopes too high.</li>
            <li>As a frequent online shopper here, that should tell you something right there -- out of all of the items I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, this is the first one I&#x27;ve felt strongly enough about to take the time to review.</li>
            <li>Just put a little in before bed and something about your body heat overnight and the conditioner works magic.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t help that my hair is naturally coarse and that I live in a very HOT sunny state.</li>
            <li>So far I really like how this product is making my hair.  </li>
            <li>So far it has not helped that much and the detangling with this product after the fact still takes a ton of time.</li>
            <li>It is not thick at all.</li>
            <li>It only take about a dime&#x27;s worth for each application.  </li>
            <li>Just went to sleep like normal and woke up to hair that looks and feels</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try out a few more miracle masks for hair before I settle.  </li>
            <li>hair is highlighted, overall pretty much straight , but I have a lot of hair and volumne, this product did nothing to it.</li>
            <li>It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li>It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li>but not being a big fan of fresh leaves and</li>
            <li>My hair always looks healthier afterwards and it does not dull the blond at all.</li>
            <li>I use [[ASIN:B005HIH7YM L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, 8.3 Fluid Ounce]], which I love, (as shown by my review) but it leaves my ends a bit dry.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband to lay right next to me when this is in my hair.</li>
            <li>My hands felt nice and soft too and were not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li>It does seem to seal some of those broken ends, but I think for best results you&#x27;d have to do this a few times a week</li>
            <li>You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state.</li>
            <li>I tried different products to keep from cutting my hair and this one worked the best for me.</li>
            <li>Only recently have I been really committed to keeping my hair healthy; I want to try growing my hair out really long!  </li>
            <li>I tried this product last night for the first time and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li>after just one use, I noticed far fewer split ends in my hair!</li>
            <li>At first I bought it thinking it was a condiitioner that you rinsed out the next morning, but you just leave it in.</li>
            <li>usually use more pumps-</li>
            <li>My hair seems to be exactly the same in the morning.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it has improved my hair, but it sure hasn&#x27;t hurt it.  </li>
            <li>I began using it because I roll my hair almost daily with hot rollers.</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>I have dry, baby fine hair that is currently color treated.</li>
            <li>I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming.</li>
            <li>my entire head had enough product (people with long hair would probably need more).</li>
            <li>Before I hit that magic sweet spot (usually the day right before I need to wash my hair again, of course), the only way my hair can look and feel smooth and sleek is if I&#x27;ve just had it done at the hairdresser&#x27;s and all sorts of expensive product has been used on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>, I could use way too much of this product (like 4 or 5 pumps) because the creamy gel doesn&#x27;t really seem to spread well on dry hair, even if it is just the ends.  </li>
            <li>I was going through a process of taking my hair from super red to blonde and my hair was just dying!</li>
            <li>I have long, fine hair that tends to get dry.  </li>
            <li>I have used it for about a week now, and my hair is SOOO soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair DID NOT feel oily or greasy at all which really surprised me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my hair because it&#x27;s so soft, and I swear it feels a lot stronger and thicker now.  </li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t really LOOK any different.</li>
            <li>I noticed how soft, silky and shiny it makes my hair.  </li>
            <li>It gives me a piece-y shine and soft hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use three pumps and it dries almost instantly, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;ll make my hair feel soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>but once you brush through it, it&#x27;s soft and so silky.</li>
            <li>and it s so gentle on the hair!perfect for daily</li>
            <li>&amp; I couldn&#x27;t really tell a big difference.</li>
            <li>wow could it be because of this treatment?</li>
            <li>When you wake up, your hair is soft and healthy-looking.</li>
            <li>Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp.</li>
            <li>I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah.</li>

            <li>they were so soft after using this!)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>In the months before I transitioned to natural hair, I had lots of breakage but when I used this I could style my hair and see maybe 2-3 strands come out in the comb.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it ever since (2 years) and it keeps my hair wonderfully soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My hair was so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>The solution does not stain pillows but does leave my hair soft and healthier than before.  </li>
            <li>I usually only use it at night when I ready my hair for bedtime, but now I use it whenever I style it and whatnot.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to comb out my tangles for 20 minutes anymore in the mornings and my hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li>I like how it smells and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>wow....</li>
            <li>After I wash it out the next day, my hair is much softer, has fewer tangles, and seems like there are fewer split ends.</li>
            <li>- I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, I never had any breakage, which was good, but it confused the hell out of me.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this I put it in my hair after the day was done, so no washing the hair and letting it air dry before bed, I just put it in.  </li>
            <li>At first I put it on as directed (to hair while dry)</li>
            <li>I got a good amount of the damage trimmed off, and then just kept it in a ponytail all the time since it was still pretty bad.    </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and very healthy, without making it feel over greasy and giving it a weird texture like some leave in hair products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried various high end products from the salon, and have to say the Loreal out-performs all of them.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference, but the ends were definitely less crunchy the next day.</li>
            <li>I liked that the product is not greasy and one pump went a long way allowing the product to last me longer than other more expensive hair care products.</li>
            <li>Hard to find something different to say regarding most purchases.  </li>
            <li>L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Hair Repair treatment caught my eye in the grocery store while I was looking for some new shampoo and a deep conditioner, and I figured I&#x27;d try it out.</li>
            <li>I have split shaggy ends &amp; really hoping this product would work, I put actually 3 pumps on my hair (It only says your supposed to do 2)</li>
            <li>If not, try the Nexxus Pro-mend, although more expensive - it really does work.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this because my hair got SUPER dried out from coloring my hair.  </li>
            <li>if I do two pumps (which is more than enough for my bra strap length, thick hair) and then rub my hands together before distributing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it only got that because you couldn&#x27;t leave no stars, but I give it no stars so far!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and have noticed a major improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>Like no other.</li>
            <li>I had major heat damage.</li>
            <li>The first time I put this stuff on, I had to use several pumps just for my bleached bangs - they were so dry, and this was soaked up in seconds.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough it doesn&#x27;t weigh my ends down but nourishing enough that it keeps the flyaways from ruling my hairstyle every day.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair because of my thyroid issues and along with the fact that I probably straighten it too much, and this product does wonders.</li>
            <li>No need to hit it with a flat iron, spray with oil sheen, or apply any products to impart a lively look.   </li>
            <li>Thisconditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.</li>
            <li>those chemicals may pose.conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.</li>
            <li>So far only 1 star and</li>
            <li>Even checked the net for stores &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be carrying it--but none of the ones near me had it.</li>
            <li>Hair is, of course, at the front line of that battle, so I interrogated some professional hair people and did some Internet browsing and learned that hair care is only partly a matter of what products you use.</li>
            <li>It has a somewhat wet, get-like, feel, but don&#x27;t be alarmed, it absolutely does not revert the hair.</li>
            <li>Another thing I learned while researching hair is that we are all unique little flowers with very different filaments on our noggins that respond differently to different things.</li>
            <li>then spent a decent (if not ridiculous) amount of time browsing Amazon&#x27;s hydrating hair products and reading the reviews, and then I experimented with 5 different, relatively inexpensive</li>
            <li>have very thick hair, to the point where I would be rich if I could figure out how to make wigs out of all of the hair that comes off of my head during a normal haircut/thinning session.</li>
            <li>It has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair.</li>
            <li>And I usually only wash it a couple of times a week because it takes just that long for moisture and the natural oils to soak back into my hair to the point where it looks halfway decent.</li>
            <li>after the first week and a half my hair became silkier and easier to manage as well as stronger, it helps prevent and reduce split ends, but it won&#x27;t make existing split ends go away.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as some other reviewers did-</li>
            <li>My hair is very thick and curly and I love how it revives it every night since I only wash my hair every three or four days.</li>
            <li>Every night that I use this I go to bed with dull dry hair and wake up the next day with shiny smooth hair!</li>
            <li>I bleached my hair back and forth between dyed brown and my natural blonde a couple of times in the span of two months.</li>
            <li>I use frequent deep conditioners, leave-in treatments and try to use heat-stylers as infrequently as possible.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair, which is at the moment a few inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to grow out your hair, you want to get as few cuts as possible, right?  </li>
            <li>(barely at all - as in no hot tools, no blow drier or irons of any sort, with sporadic hair coloring to hide the gray hairs I&#x27;ve had since high school) and the amount of breakage, hair loss, etc.</li>
            <li>Two pumps is always enough for my ends, and I generally keep away from my roots since I use the cleansing conditioner and don&#x27;t want to get them greased up.</li>
            <li>Also, if I had to complain, using even a tiny bit too much of this can make my hair feel EXTREMELY brittle.</li>
            <li>I use about a pump and a half and run it mainly on my ends and the rest through the length of my hair and my hair is instantly moisturized and soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Your hair will become damp as if it is wet and that concerned me at first, but in the morning my hair was completely dry!</li>
            <li>Due to its stellar functionality &amp; superior absorption, I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed.</li>
            <li>So, when I apply this product it relaxes my hair, and the waves look really cool - no more poof!</li>
            <li>I comb my hair in place and let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy/curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li>When you put the product in your hair, it seems wet for just a few minutes and then quickly &amp;#34;soaks in&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>When I put this repair solution into my hair at night before I lay down to sleep (wait for it to dry first)</li>
            <li>reference, I have fine, thin hair that is color treated.</li>
            <li>I did use more than the recommended 2 pumps, but, as mentioned, my hair&#x27;s very thick and, usually, very dry...</li>
            <li>2 pumps is maybe a little much for me</li>
            <li>In the beginning I needed to use more than what was recommended (I used 2 pumps just for my ends alone) because my hair was just that bad, but after using it for a while, I don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>

            <li> It made my head itch almost from the moment I put it on, again, I would&#x27;ve dealt with this, if it had done something good for my hair.</li>
            <li> I figured it should work, since they all had very healthy looking hair.</li>
            <li> put in 3 pumps and absorbed in my hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> i bought it over the pc, and i love it, would not even thing of trying something else, and it is great on colored hair also.</li>
            <li> whatever I&#x27;m VERY pleased the smell fades.</li>
            <li> After giving it a try, i honestly feel it is not as good as it seems to be.</li>

            <li> I am thrilled I can get it online.</li>
            <li> The product has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and am glad I went against my skepticism because this was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Good for hair thats been colored, processed, sundamaged or even healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It lasts quite a while since it does not take much to be effective either.</li>
            <li> bought this because of  good company and so many reviews(good ones)</li>
            <li> It is also nice that it is an overnight treatment bc</li>
            <li> I liked it.  </li>
            <li> I have always loved L&#x27;oreal because of how well my hair responds to it, and so when I tried this to see if it would help me grow my hair faster for my wedding, it was a fantastic idea!</li>
            <li> Its perfect for dry scalp and it works great.</li>
            <li> and therefore we were delighted that Amazon makes it so easy.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair throughout the day because it feels so amazing.</li>
            <li> And since it was Sulfate free and smelled SO good, I just couldn&#x27;t pass it up.</li>
            <li> the price was great, so if you have damaged hair it might be worth a try for you to give it a try.</li>
            <li> my hair is mega shiny soft and smells great!</li>
            <li> I like touching my own hair during the day.</li>
            <li> Amazing how you can put a lot on your hair, go to bed, and wake without anything on your pillow, but your hair softer and in better condition.</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY FINE and&lt;br /&gt;color treated.</li>
            <li> I did about 5-6 pumps and was super impressed that it just soaks right in.</li>
            <li> The smell is super pleasant.</li>
            <li> In conjunction with my other styling products, this gave me a gorgeous mane I could be proud of!</li>
            <li> It does an incredible job of making your hair feel very soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic and for some reason I can&#x27;t find it at Target or Wal-Mart, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon still carries it!</li>
            <li> usage!and sulfate free makes it all better!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> Also it took 10 or more pumps not 2 for my medium length hair.</li>
            <li> I applied three pumps of this lotion and combed it through my hair, mostly working on the ends rather than the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and pray L&#x27;Oreal will not take it off the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost out though, so as soon as I can I&#x27;m going to have to go get some more.</li>
            <li> We both love the product and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> I will say that you&#x27;ll probably need more than the recommended 1-2 pumps.  </li>
            <li> I did not need to use more than 2 pumps.</li>
            <li> Which is more what I was after.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use it until it is gone, but I won&#x27;t buy any more.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Better than the EverStrong shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> I love that I can run this through my hair</li>
            <li> However many pumps you need, rub your palms together and press / work through hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it in the morning and evening after washing my hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks now and its gradually making my hair better.</li>
            <li> Its a lot cheaper than the salon products I have bought before and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel SO much better after just one use.</li>
            <li> :) I&#x27;m glad I have it, but I don&#x27;t use it every night either-</li>
            <li> It does take a but of time, do not expect this to magically fix you hair over night.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the product, it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and</li>
            <li> Love this product, one of the best deep conditioners and repair products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> I have wavy/straight hair that has many fried split ends.</li>
            <li> When I used this product overnight I noticed it made my hair more greasy, and when I used a lot</li>
            <li> It works okay as a styling product though.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product.</li>
            <li> I was glad to see I can still find it.  </li>
            <li> I consider this the \\&quot;better than nothing\\&quot; overnight treatment.</li>
            <li> Pantene Pro-V Overnight Miracle is better.</li>
            <li> Will probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products in my life and this is one that did nothing for my hair, literally.</li>
            <li> This helps to keep my ends healthy so that my hair can stay long!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I do LOVE so many of the L;oreal products, from their hair products to their day and night cremes, their make up you name it.</li>
            <li> Hair is, in fact, the most reliable indicator of whether a person is healthy.</li>
            <li> bottom line is that none of the 5 products are magical</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioning treatment of all time.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s claim and more, My hair is relaxed.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.   </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> After one night my ends are noticeably more moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping it continues to work it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Especially now that the weather is getting colder my hair seems to get a lot more dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this product does help a bit.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased that I decided to subscribe to get one can of treatment every month from Amazon.com.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , so I don&#x27;t catch my comb on hairs and rip any more out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You do need to use more of this product than is suggested.  </li>
            <li> and I use more than 2 pumps.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I color my hair every 6 weeks, a blond foil, so I need to do all I can to keep the ends healthy.</li>
            <li> On a whim, I bought this product and was suprised and impressed by the texture of my hair the next morning.</li>
            <li> i love also the smell.</li>
            <li> I just wish there was more of it in the bottle.</li>
            <li> The highlights and color have made my flyaway hair even more so.</li>
            <li> My hair looks so much better, and it is well conditioned.</li>
            <li> love all the loreal salon products.</li>
            <li> And i have tried most of loreal drugstore ones.</li>
            <li> I love the subscribe and save products.  </li>
            <li> If used on a regular basis, I could see it being great!</li>
            <li> you made me a happy camper,thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;shirley evans</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks better.  </li>
            <li> I think I just found my staple moisturizer :).</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I want to say it took probably 10 pumps just to get it though most of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it works for others and</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> I would think that L&#x27;Oreal could produce much better products to use on your hair at home.</li>
            <li> It did not feel stronger, shinier, softer, or more moisturized.</li>
            <li> so I have been pleased to put up a supply for &#x27;hair emergencies.&#x27;</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> but I thought it would do a better job.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m kicking myself for not buying more than one, bc</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product.</li>
            <li> but now it looks healthy and thicker.</li>
            <li> Not super amazing but a very good effect for the money!</li>
            <li> To me, the scent was mild, at best, but pleasant, and by the time I went to bed (less than five minutes after applying the treatment), I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all.</li>
            <li> This is a SIGNIFICANT difference!  </li>
            <li> Provides for a more even and easy distribution that way.</li>
            <li> The odor is pleasant and not appalling..</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m natural, I use it to fortify my hair after it&#x27;s been pressed out and it still does a great job.</li>
            <li> Which is cool!</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and because it was offered with free shipping I think it was a good deal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It damages so easily.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the product was easy.</li>
            <li> it worked into my hair easily.</li>
            <li> I have spent $$$$$ on the best products available.</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s thinner it absorbs into hair easily</li>
            <li> It does have a fairly strong coconut scent.</li>
            <li> I noticed the smell isn&#x27;t as strong....</li>
            <li> My hair looked lovely and healthy, and I enjoy some fun product and pampering time, but I have a life that doesn&#x27;t revolve around my hair too.  </li>
            <li> At first i thought this was like a foam kind of treatment but</li>
            <li> It meant a noticeable difference in flyaways, and my fine hair still felt styled hours after I was done drying it.  </li>
            <li> and i use it almost every night since then ,and every morning i love how my hair look so healthy.;)</li>
            <li> In the morning, after brushing, the smell is almost gone (fortunately for me) and my hair does feel pretty nice</li>
            <li> My hair is fine and colored and this product helps ..</li>
            <li> I was experiencing (a tremendous amount!)  </li>
            <li> I have incredibly fine, processed hair, so breakage and split-ends and frizziness are a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li> I even saw results after using it the very first time!    </li>
            <li> so its important that I take care of it.</li>
            <li> This really does make your hair look nice.  </li>
            <li> is a great treatment to use if you like to wear second day hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Below is a detailed review of each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> (3.8 stars) ($0.54/ounce) - If the shampoo does most of the moisturizing \\&quot;work,\\&quot; then the conditioner seems kind of like the sealant to lock it in and protect it all day, and to make your hair more \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; This conditioner does that job well enough</li>
            <li> The ends look smooth and my hair is not shedding.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s the difference between glops and smooth</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy to report that I am back to\\&quot;average\\&quot; hair loss</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I think it is a fantastic idea (the overnight part).</li>
            <li> from one use, my hair feel incredibly smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> but when you wake up your hair is soft and has a good smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the L&#x27;oreal professional sulfate free line for my shampoo and conditioner and it&#x27;s a good combo of quality and price.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the great reviews, I read the low star ones too, but thought there many more raving high star reviews.</li>
            <li> so after 6 months my hair was beautiful, it was soft,and shinny, and no more split ends, i was so happy with it, and seeing i live in canada,we don&#x27;t get it here, so</li>
            <li> My hair has become strong, but also very silky looking and feeling, shiny, and healthy.  </li>
            <li> I could literally tell the difference in moisture absorbed by weight!  </li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably shinier, healthier, and more manageable after using this product consistently.</li>
            <li> but I find if you rub it through your hands first, you get more even</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s best to put the product into your hands and rub them together first before working it into your hair.</li>
            <li> so excited...</li>
            <li> My hair was always shiny, but it also had a significant number of split ends that made my hair look frizzy and</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to use this.</li>
            <li> I love this product so much that I bought a bottle for my Mom to use and enjoy as well.</li>
            <li> I like this product,works great for dry and highlighted hair...</li>
            <li> Very Dry Naturally Curly hair doesn&#x27;t get better with length or age, but I am managing to get a nice length by using this as an in between treatment on a day I didn&#x27;t do the full shampoo, condition, and leave in moisturizer routine to keep the ends in good repair.</li>
            <li> Given the price and the smell, and that there are other products that do just as good or better, I won&#x27;t be getting this again.</li>
            <li> Although it has not helped my split ends, it has made my hair look very shiny and munch more manageable in the mornings.</li>
            <li> After years of taking advantage of the Amazon reviews I am inspired to write one because I love this product that much.  </li>
            <li> I also use more than recommended because I like to really cover the ends on my hair and also the bottom layer.</li>
            <li> Kind of soft but with stuff in it.</li>
            <li> So, I bought the full size product.  </li>
            <li> Like I said, it seems like a good product, I just couldn&#x27;t see a big difference.</li>
            <li> UPDATE- my mom just mentioned this again to me and says that she can really tell the difference in how healthy her hair is when she uses it.</li>
            <li> They have really good products, but this one, I actually threw it away, and I NEVER throw anything away.</li>
            <li> That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the texture very creamy</li>
            <li> smell as others said was true..</li>
            <li> 2 pumps work well for me, and wake-up to full, conditioned hair.</li>
            <li> It really makes my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> heavy,smells nice, finally I can brush my hair so easily.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tangles easily, so this products really reduces the tangles and makes it look much healthier.</li>
            <li> Green\\&quot;...sort of plant-like or, like mild, sweet, pipe tobacco and coconut....</li>
            <li> Awesome affordable product,it works for my thin fine hair.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t greasy and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> It was well packaged and shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> When reading the ingredient list, I noticed that the fifth ingredient in this is alcohol, which promotes quick drying.  </li>
            <li> I had to use A LOT of it because of how quickly it soaks up.</li>
            <li> That night I slept with a sleep cap on, because I&#x27;m like a super restless sleeper</li>
            <li> - It works noticeably better than my old shampoo (Aussie Smooth).</li>
            <li> Even if I thought it smelled horrid, I would mix in a drop of my favorite essential oil, and gladly keep using this product.  </li>
            <li> Dries quickly too.</li>
            <li> Tried many, many products and keep coming back to this one.  </li>
            <li> After hair is soft, smooth, full and with out fly aways but not flat.</li>
            <li> Am hoping for good long term results with continued use.</li>
            <li> The product tends to glob and concentrate in certain sections, which does not allow for easy or even treatment of the effected areas.</li>
            <li> I use much less styling product, if any, and get great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because hydrated hair is pretty much what healthy hair</li>
            <li> I noticed a difference after my first use!</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> it smells nice, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on the pillow, and with regular use, my hair looks shinier.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but no significant change.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few weeks but the results are great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone with dried out hair or even frizzy since the moisture is great for it.</li>
            <li> I hope it&#x27;s worth putting up with the smell all day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
            <li> I recommend it if you want healthy silky moisturized soft hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this stuff every night, mostly because I forget, but when I do my hair always feels really soft when I wake up.</li>
            <li> While 2 \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; are perfect for the overnight treatment (which definitely goes in the hair, never the pillow), I got curious about using the Overnight Treatment as a leave-in during the day.</li>
            <li> My ends felt so soft and healthy after one night that I changed my mind about needing to go for a haircut.  </li>
            <li> My ends are also always very brittle, and now they are nice and soft.</li>
            <li> It still works the same, my hair feels so silky and smells nice after applying and leaving in overnight.</li>
            <li> I say its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried this product for several nights and I honestly have not seen anything I like.</li>
            <li> The treatment made my hair smell nice, but it still felt similar to steel wool toward the tips.</li>
            <li> every kind of hair product has bothered me (physically) headaches sore throats sinus pain etc</li>
            <li> the price is worth trying.</li>
            <li> The smell is fresh.</li>
            <li> I had used a sample and really liked it a while back.</li>
            <li> It gets absorbed into my hair with no residue.</li>
            <li> i mean this treatment really work, this save my hair from a haircut :D</li>
            <li> so I ended up using four pumps because the first two just seemed to get sucked into my hair that quick.  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me to go to work every day with the leave-in treatment on my hair (which you can&#x27;t really smell after it dies anyway), and it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair wet or oily.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and loved the smell of it (and the results) that I gave it to my mom for Christmas along with some other things.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice a significant difference after using this product.</li>
            <li> It washes right out.</li>
            <li> The reviewers of Amazon have always steered me in the right direction.  </li>
            <li> I use this right before wrapping at night.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, my hair shined right up, grew faster then ever and smelled fantastic.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoy your new hair!</li>
            <li> It has a very soft smell and is really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I kinda bought this on a whim after reading how good reviews were on this product (not to mention the other product I bought first sucked).</li>
            <li> hair is not dry anymore and seems to have more strength and weight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll put it on in the early evening so the scent isn&#x27;t strong when I go to bed</li>
            <li> honestly, unless you just can&#x27;t wait to get home, wash your hair and let it sit and air dry how often are you going to do this or how often are you going to want to do this.  </li>
            <li> Very very noticeable results.  </li>
            <li> It ran out like very fast also .</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product, it did not meet my expectations by any means!!!</li>
            <li> But it may work much more noticeably on someone whose hair isn&#x27;t already soft, since softening seems to be its main function.</li>
            <li> notice the difference after first use.</li>
            <li> It really moisturizes your hair along with helping it grow faster!</li>
            <li> and I think I still only needed about 4 pumps to feel satisfied.</li>
            <li> night, I tried this product for the first time, and, after washing my hair this morning, I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is chemically lightened and this made it much darker !</li>
            <li> After the first use i could feel the change.</li>
            <li> This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner, except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y.</li>
            <li> This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner, except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y.</li>
            <li> I saw results within the first use.</li>
            <li> Actually, I like it better than Mizani&#x27;s buttercream hairdress to liven my hair between shampoos.</li>
            <li> Second day in and while my hair hasn&#x27;t improved since yesterday it is just as lovely.</li>
            <li> I was willing to try this product for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t believe the noticeable results that I saw immediately, even after my first treatment.  </li>
            <li> looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product regularly now and my hair could not look better.  </li>
            <li> When I first started using this, my side bangs were bleached.</li>
            <li> So much healthier!</li>
            <li> When I had long(er) hair, I absolutely relied on this product!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> When I run low on the bottle I have now, I&#x27;m gonna buy two more from here c:</li>
            <li> This one is a first for me-</li>
            <li> I admit I purchased this product to try out and didn&#x27;t have super high expectations despite the reviews.  </li>
            <li> First, Loreal EverStrong Overnight made a stunning difference in completely eliminating \\&quot;morning frizz\\&quot; (familiar to anyone who perms their hair) and smoothed and softened the curl through the day so much that everyone in the salon wanted to feel my hair the next time I got it trimmed!</li>
            <li> hair looked great on my wedding day, and this little thing is *as far as I am concerned</li>
            <li> This is a nice deep condition which seems so far to protect the hair cuticle from heat damage.</li>
            <li> I am giving it two stars only because i loved its smell and the initial smoothness it gave.</li>
            <li> So far I love it hair is soft and shiny...</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, so I LOVE overnight products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change at first.  </li>
            <li> If you have long hair, you will probably need more than 2 pumps.</li>
            <li> I have to confess I was a bit skeptical at first, and didn&#x27;t really like how it felt when I first applied the product to my hair, but what a pleasant surprise when I woke up!</li>
            <li> Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing.</li>
            <li> I did notice some shine towards the top of my head, but all my end hairs were still as dry as a broom.</li>
            <li> I use this product mostly on my bangs since they tend to dry out quicker, and I wanted them to grow out because they were NOT growing out</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is resistant to being super soft and shiny?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this, and would recommend it to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I had to use more than 2 pumps for my shortish hair at first,now that my hair is not as dry 2 works</li>
            <li> Also, I notice a pleasant LIGHT scent, and no glops or random placement</li>
            <li> But I like this one better than the Pantene; the Pantene is a little bit more wet while this one is lighter and that works better for my hair which is fine - it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down the way the Pantene does.</li>
            <li> I am SO pleased with this product and will use it for a very long time!</li>
            <li> It really has been a life saver for my hair.</li>
            <li> Go on youtube and watch the video of the woman who wraps her hair overnight to keep it straight.  </li>
            <li> Product works really well for me</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t really have any split ends.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t smell it that much.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product.  </li>
            <li> and it really protects from chlorine damage.  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> BUT I don&#x27;t have much hair.</li>
            <li> and i really need a product for my split ends...</li>
            <li> This has really transformed my hair.</li>
            <li> It gives my hair so much body.</li>
            <li> I use this as leave-in conditioner (very curly hair).</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and everyone seemed to say it worked really well.</li>
            <li> but I expected it was better</li>
            <li> i dont have that much hair and my hair</li>
            <li> is straight.</li>
            <li> I found it really helped on the night after II washed my hair.</li>
            <li> I stand by Loreal products as a whole.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> This has really improved the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> And I really noticed the difference after motorcycling -</li>
            <li> It really improves the hair.</li>
            <li> I shower at night, so I put it in my hair wet, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have stopped it from working it&#x27;s magic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see what it did too much .</li>
            <li> Nothing seemed to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair felt so much softer, and it looked like</li>
            <li> It is much easier to style (I have</li>
            <li> I also like the fact that it really does work.  </li>
            <li> The consistency is too wet should be more like a cream .</li>
            <li> this product works really well.</li>
            <li> would recommend this to those looking for a great pre-shampoo treatment for thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> You can actually see and feel your hair&#x27;s improvement after the first use, and it only gets better with continued use.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a decent Job at conditioning, the smell is very perfume-y, one that I don&#x27;t like.  </li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that is colored and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> Not sure it really improves anything, but it does make your hair feel nice while it&#x27;s in use.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long hair,it&#x27;s fine textured</li>
            <li> tell you all of this because I can achieve the exact same results with this less-than-$10 product right here</li>
            <li> Healthy hair is also the result of things like drinking water and eating right and avoiding excessive sun or heat.</li>
            <li> So if your sensitive to strong lasting smells, don&#x27;t buy this!</li>
            <li> I thought I was imagining it and that it wasn&#x27;t possible to see results so quickly, but my familiy also commented about how much nicer my hair</li>
            <li> I will probably buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I felt like I was beginning to lose more hair than average.  </li>
            <li> The cream spreads a little better in the wet hair, and I feel that the results are as good as treating on dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Based on other good reviews, I had high hopes for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Treatment, but my actual usage of it has far surpassed those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It makes it less frizzy, for sure</li>
            <li> Smooth hair (even those dry ends), and</li>
            <li> It is mildly hydrating, but &amp;#34;everstrong&amp;#34; is a bit hyperbolic for the effect the product actually has on my hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t add any added strength that I could discern and it doesn&#x27;t particularly hydrate well either.</li>
            <li> This one is decent -</li>
            <li> but I have noticed a mild to moderate improvement in shine, darkness, and thickness.</li>
            <li> So rather than recommending a particular product, I recommend that you do some trials and see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is entirely possible that someone with a different hair type would get better results with this.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will use this seller, again and highly recommend this seller.  </li>
            <li> highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend the product.</li>
            <li> But I wouldn&#x27;t set my hopes too high.</li>
            <li> As a frequent online shopper here, that should tell you something right there -- out of all of the items I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, this is the first one I&#x27;ve felt strongly enough about to take the time to review.</li>
            <li> Just put a little in before bed and something about your body heat overnight and the conditioner works magic.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t help that my hair is naturally coarse and that I live in a very HOT sunny state.</li>
            <li> So far I really like how this product is making my hair.  </li>
            <li> So far it has not helped that much and the detangling with this product after the fact still takes a ton of time.</li>
            <li> It is not thick at all.</li>
            <li> It only take about a dime&#x27;s worth for each application.  </li>
            <li> Just went to sleep like normal and woke up to hair that looks and feels</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to try out a few more miracle masks for hair before I settle.  </li>
            <li> hair is highlighted, overall pretty much straight , but I have a lot of hair and volumne, this product did nothing to it.</li>
            <li> It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li> It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y</li>
            <li> but not being a big fan of fresh leaves and</li>
            <li> My hair always looks healthier afterwards and it does not dull the blond at all.</li>
            <li> I use [[ASIN:B005HIH7YM L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, 8.3 Fluid Ounce]], which I love, (as shown by my review) but it leaves my ends a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband to lay right next to me when this is in my hair.</li>
            <li> My hands felt nice and soft too and were not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> It does seem to seal some of those broken ends, but I think for best results you&#x27;d have to do this a few times a week</li>
            <li> You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state.</li>
            <li> I tried different products to keep from cutting my hair and this one worked the best for me.</li>
            <li> Only recently have I been really committed to keeping my hair healthy; I want to try growing my hair out really long!  </li>
            <li> I tried this product last night for the first time and all I can say is WOW!  </li>
            <li> after just one use, I noticed far fewer split ends in my hair!</li>
            <li> At first I bought it thinking it was a condiitioner that you rinsed out the next morning, but you just leave it in.</li>
            <li> usually use more pumps-</li>
            <li> My hair seems to be exactly the same in the morning.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has improved my hair, but it sure hasn&#x27;t hurt it.  </li>
            <li> I began using it because I roll my hair almost daily with hot rollers.</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> I have dry, baby fine hair that is currently color treated.</li>
            <li> I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming.</li>
            <li> my entire head had enough product (people with long hair would probably need more).</li>
            <li> Before I hit that magic sweet spot (usually the day right before I need to wash my hair again, of course), the only way my hair can look and feel smooth and sleek is if I&#x27;ve just had it done at the hairdresser&#x27;s and all sorts of expensive product has been used on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> , I could use way too much of this product (like 4 or 5 pumps) because the creamy gel doesn&#x27;t really seem to spread well on dry hair, even if it is just the ends.  </li>
            <li> I was going through a process of taking my hair from super red to blonde and my hair was just dying!</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that tends to get dry.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for about a week now, and my hair is SOOO soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair DID NOT feel oily or greasy at all which really surprised me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my hair because it&#x27;s so soft, and I swear it feels a lot stronger and thicker now.  </li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t really LOOK any different.</li>
            <li> I noticed how soft, silky and shiny it makes my hair.  </li>
            <li> It gives me a piece-y shine and soft hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use three pumps and it dries almost instantly, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;ll make my hair feel soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> but once you brush through it, it&#x27;s soft and so silky.</li>
            <li> and it s so gentle on the hair!perfect for daily</li>
            <li> &amp; I couldn&#x27;t really tell a big difference.</li>
            <li> wow could it be because of this treatment?</li>
            <li> When you wake up, your hair is soft and healthy-looking.</li>
            <li> Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp.</li>
            <li> I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah.</li>

            <li> they were so soft after using this!)&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> In the months before I transitioned to natural hair, I had lots of breakage but when I used this I could style my hair and see maybe 2-3 strands come out in the comb.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it ever since (2 years) and it keeps my hair wonderfully soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> The solution does not stain pillows but does leave my hair soft and healthier than before.  </li>
            <li> I usually only use it at night when I ready my hair for bedtime, but now I use it whenever I style it and whatnot.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to comb out my tangles for 20 minutes anymore in the mornings and my hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
            <li> I like how it smells and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> wow....</li>
            <li> After I wash it out the next day, my hair is much softer, has fewer tangles, and seems like there are fewer split ends.</li>
            <li> - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical.</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, I never had any breakage, which was good, but it confused the hell out of me.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I put it in my hair after the day was done, so no washing the hair and letting it air dry before bed, I just put it in.  </li>
            <li> At first I put it on as directed (to hair while dry)</li>
            <li> I got a good amount of the damage trimmed off, and then just kept it in a ponytail all the time since it was still pretty bad.    </li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling soft and very healthy, without making it feel over greasy and giving it a weird texture like some leave in hair products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various high end products from the salon, and have to say the Loreal out-performs all of them.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference, but the ends were definitely less crunchy the next day.</li>
            <li> I liked that the product is not greasy and one pump went a long way allowing the product to last me longer than other more expensive hair care products.</li>
            <li> Hard to find something different to say regarding most purchases.  </li>
            <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Hair Repair treatment caught my eye in the grocery store while I was looking for some new shampoo and a deep conditioner, and I figured I&#x27;d try it out.</li>
            <li> I have split shaggy ends &amp; really hoping this product would work, I put actually 3 pumps on my hair (It only says your supposed to do 2)</li>
            <li> If not, try the Nexxus Pro-mend, although more expensive - it really does work.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this because my hair got SUPER dried out from coloring my hair.  </li>
            <li> if I do two pumps (which is more than enough for my bra strap length, thick hair) and then rub my hands together before distributing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it only got that because you couldn&#x27;t leave no stars, but I give it no stars so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and have noticed a major improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> Like no other.</li>
            <li> I had major heat damage.</li>
            <li> The first time I put this stuff on, I had to use several pumps just for my bleached bangs - they were so dry, and this was soaked up in seconds.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough it doesn&#x27;t weigh my ends down but nourishing enough that it keeps the flyaways from ruling my hairstyle every day.</li>
            <li> I have very dry hair because of my thyroid issues and along with the fact that I probably straighten it too much, and this product does wonders.</li>
            <li> No need to hit it with a flat iron, spray with oil sheen, or apply any products to impart a lively look.   </li>
            <li> Thisconditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.</li>
            <li> those chemicals may pose.conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.</li>
            <li> So far only 1 star and</li>
            <li> Even checked the net for stores &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be carrying it--but none of the ones near me had it.</li>
            <li> Hair is, of course, at the front line of that battle, so I interrogated some professional hair people and did some Internet browsing and learned that hair care is only partly a matter of what products you use.</li>
            <li> It has a somewhat wet, get-like, feel, but don&#x27;t be alarmed, it absolutely does not revert the hair.</li>
            <li> Another thing I learned while researching hair is that we are all unique little flowers with very different filaments on our noggins that respond differently to different things.</li>
            <li> then spent a decent (if not ridiculous) amount of time browsing Amazon&#x27;s hydrating hair products and reading the reviews, and then I experimented with 5 different, relatively inexpensive</li>
            <li> have very thick hair, to the point where I would be rich if I could figure out how to make wigs out of all of the hair that comes off of my head during a normal haircut/thinning session.</li>
            <li> It has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair.</li>
            <li> And I usually only wash it a couple of times a week because it takes just that long for moisture and the natural oils to soak back into my hair to the point where it looks halfway decent.</li>
            <li> after the first week and a half my hair became silkier and easier to manage as well as stronger, it helps prevent and reduce split ends, but it won&#x27;t make existing split ends go away.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as some other reviewers did-</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and curly and I love how it revives it every night since I only wash my hair every three or four days.</li>
            <li> Every night that I use this I go to bed with dull dry hair and wake up the next day with shiny smooth hair!</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair back and forth between dyed brown and my natural blonde a couple of times in the span of two months.</li>
            <li> I use frequent deep conditioners, leave-in treatments and try to use heat-stylers as infrequently as possible.  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, which is at the moment a few inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to grow out your hair, you want to get as few cuts as possible, right?  </li>
            <li> (barely at all - as in no hot tools, no blow drier or irons of any sort, with sporadic hair coloring to hide the gray hairs I&#x27;ve had since high school) and the amount of breakage, hair loss, etc.</li>
            <li> Two pumps is always enough for my ends, and I generally keep away from my roots since I use the cleansing conditioner and don&#x27;t want to get them greased up.</li>
            <li> Also, if I had to complain, using even a tiny bit too much of this can make my hair feel EXTREMELY brittle.</li>
            <li> I use about a pump and a half and run it mainly on my ends and the rest through the length of my hair and my hair is instantly moisturized and soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Your hair will become damp as if it is wet and that concerned me at first, but in the morning my hair was completely dry!</li>
            <li> Due to its stellar functionality &amp; superior absorption, I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed.</li>
            <li> So, when I apply this product it relaxes my hair, and the waves look really cool - no more poof!</li>
            <li> I comb my hair in place and let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly, dry hair.</li>
            <li> When you put the product in your hair, it seems wet for just a few minutes and then quickly &amp;#34;soaks in&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> When I put this repair solution into my hair at night before I lay down to sleep (wait for it to dry first)</li>
            <li> reference, I have fine, thin hair that is color treated.</li>
            <li> I did use more than the recommended 2 pumps, but, as mentioned, my hair&#x27;s very thick and, usually, very dry...</li>
            <li> 2 pumps is maybe a little much for me</li>
            <li> In the beginning I needed to use more than what was recommended (I used 2 pumps just for my ends alone) because my hair was just that bad, but after using it for a while, I don&#x27;t need to use as much.</li>
            <li> As the product dried down, it left my hair looking kind of dull, and feeling very weighed down,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that my hair during those months was surprisingly less nappy and gross than I expected, and it&#x27;s maybe even true that the artificial chemicals we put on our scalps have some serious, unwelcome consequences, but all I can say is that I much prefer how my hair looks and feels after it&#x27;s been shampooed, to the point that I&#x27;m willing to take whatever risks</li>

            <li> I have long, fine hair that was once very thick.</li>
            <li> It is soft, and I don&#x27;t use any products other than shampoo and hair color every so often.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this for a few years now and my hair is so much softer when I use it constantly and for long periods of time.</li>
            <li> You put a little dry shampoo at your roots and some of this on your ends at night, the products soak in while you sleep, and when  you wake up your hair is ready to style and go.</li>
            <li> I put the product in my hair a few hours before bed, but it was totally absorbed in minutes- a little bit of a \\&quot;gunked up\\&quot; feeling while the product was actually on, but not oily.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used regular and deep conditioners after color, but never got any relief from those dry</li>
            <li> My hair is long enough that I can tuck it under my arms, and I use between 6-8 pumps.  </li>
            <li> For my granddaughter, we put it on her long hair before her daily swimming</li>
            <li> No matter, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> My hair is so messed up from flat iron that i doubt anything would work</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair, and it gets seriously dry, dry to the point where I can barely run my fingers through my ends without breaking hair off.</li>
            <li> Have fine hair and it would look sad if not styled daily.</li>
            <li> Because I was bleaching dark hair light, I had to do so once a week leading to serious breakage and brittleness.</li>
            <li> which may not be a bad thing for the more sensitive folks.</li>
            <li> I have short, layered hair, which gets dry after coloring.  </li>
            <li> So the next evening, I washed my hair, let it air dry and then put the overnight cream in.  </li>
            <li> i started using this a week ago, i had highlight on my hair and it was starting to feel dry from the bleaching of my hair</li>
            <li> It was so dry and fragile.</li>
            <li> NOTHING works on my coarse dry hair like this one.</li>
            <li> well my hair is pretty thick and dry</li>
            <li> the next morning it was very dry on my ends not soft at all .</li>
            <li> If I dry my hair and don&#x27;t use a flat iron or curling iron on it, it poofs out like a frizzy lion&#x27;s mane.</li>
            <li> my hair is long and Im gonna keep growing it</li>
            <li> I have long and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;d never found a product I was passionate about.  </li>
            <li> I have thick wavy African American hair that I wear natural.  </li>
            <li> I have used about half the amount of hairspray daily since starting the overnight treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have been using various products since she was little (like no more tangles, etc) and they do not seem to do much except help with the detangling process which still takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe i can actually run my fingers STRAIGHT thru my hair with no catching knots!</li>
            <li> It does completely soak in, though my hair is a little wet feeling for awhile.</li>
            <li> I ended up with all of those little flyaways that come from hair breaking into smaller and smaller pieces.</li>
            <li> Other leave in conditioners have always either left my hair feeling greasy or crunchy, but this one truly absorbs into the hair.</li>
            <li> hair is incredibly dry.</li>
            <li> When it was dry it felt like plastic and frizzed out everywhere.</li>
            <li> Its an overnight treatment, so I apply it on dry hair before bedtime.  </li>
            <li> When my hair is dry or flyaway - I put it on my hair at night.  </li>
            <li> This product works for my hair that is always on the dry side.</li>
            <li> My hair is really dry and damaged, so I don&#x27;t know if it could have helped anyway.</li>
            <li> I use it after I blow dry my hair in the morning.</li>
            <li> (let it dry before&lt;</li>
            <li> When my hair is dry</li>
            <li> It made the biggest single difference of any product I have used in years besides my \\&quot;It&#x27;s A 10-miracle leave in product\\&quot; which I use to mitigate heat damage while styling my hair.  </li>
            <li> I knew it wouldn&#x27;t give me new hair like the women in the commercials, but I was hoping for a little less of a fly-away look.</li>
            <li> The improvement from using 1 \\&quot;pump\\&quot; right after washing and combing through as a leave-in is just as dramatic.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find where I live</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, but it is almost impossible to find.</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about how a product this intense wouldn&#x27;t feel oily, but it really doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> You can put it on dry or wet hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times, so am not seeing long-term results yet, but I do agree with previous reviewers in that it does soak into the hair</li>
            <li> Given what I&#x27;ve seen from the different products, I will probably settle into a routine of using a small amount of the Frieda shampoo and conditioner daily, and then using an overnight treatment maybe once a month (but probably not this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very long, very thick hair that is naturally very wavy.</li>
            <li> I really like the L&#x27;Oreal Overnight Hair Repair for my hair which is very thick and dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is processed and was very dry</li>
            <li> I have very dry, brittle hair and had lots of breakage.</li>
            <li> I had very dry cotton candy like hair</li>
            <li> and I do notice a little extra strength from just one use.  </li>
            <li> I have very long, extremely processed hair</li>
            <li> This is the same for dry hair - dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your hair unpleasant, so if you do choose to treat your hair at night it shouldn&#x27;t bother you at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was a bit brittle and dry due to dying my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry on the ends due to relaxing.</li>
            <li> I began searching for hair repair and revistalizing treatments because I was growing concerned about my age (young - late 20&#x27;s), how I treat my hair</li>
            <li> My hair was would flop like wet noodles when it was damp</li>
            <li> After a few uses, they were gone entirely.</li>
            <li> , I put in on after I shampoo my hair while it is still wet.  </li>
            <li> Not much happening.  </li>
            <li> That night I washed my hair before bed, and put the conditioner in wet hair.  </li>
            <li> With this shampoo, my hair stays wet after a shower about 40% longer</li>
            <li> Still putting it in my hair while wet, though.</li>
            <li> But after second use it dried up my hair like hay.</li>
            <li> I apply it on the ends of my hair when it&#x27;s wet.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected .</li>
            <li> I noticed absolutely NO improvement.</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair and this product made my hair even worse.</li>
            <li> so I only push it down until I have about a dime size which is about half a pump.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, color-treated hair and the frizz was uncontrollable in the humid summer weather!  </li>
            <li> found the treatment had left a very slight gummy feel.</li>
            <li> It was much like getting a Redken color gloss treatment, how it thickens the weak ends without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I use to flat iron my hair everyday.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a week, and I have still to find that my hair is any less dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair ends up being very soft and fluffy, but hard to style, as it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape.</li>
            <li> No thanks!</li>
            <li> I tried it the first night expecting that it would be greasy, leave residue on my pillow, make me uncomfortable while I slept and then disappoint me in the morning.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve also been trying the EverStrong shampoos, which also make a difference; but the Loreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment has smoothed, softened and eliminated dryness with other shampoos, as well.)</li>
            <li> Not better, just different.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for several years and recently found it difficult to locate locally</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product when I first read about it</li>
            <li> The smell changes as soon as it comes into contact with my skin, and thats happened to me with one other product.</li>
            <li> This is sadly the first product where I have to say, for me, and my daughters hair</li>
            <li> but I only use a little bit of it because it makes my hair a little too helmet-y for my liking.</li>
            <li> but so do the other conditioners.</li>
            <li> but so do the other conditioners.</li>
            <li> I shampoo (every other day).</li>
            <li> When I wake up in morning my hairs stick to each other.</li>
            <li> , I usually apply it every other night, until my entire head is covered, then i let it soak in before lying down for bed.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and figured I&#x27;d write a review on this for anyone else out there looking to soften dry damaged</li>
            <li> Also i apply it to my hair when its towel dried instead of when its dry.</li>
            <li> Not only do I lose less hair, but also my hair doesn&#x27;t get even a small tangle in it</li>
            <li> My ends were still bad &amp; my hair was exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I have long hair (it goes past my armpits about 4in)</li>
            <li> - It&#x27;s naturally dark brown/black</li>
            <li> I am African-American with thick, kinky hair that can never get enough moisture.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair going down my back some</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or contribute to any build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten it down to my chin now and realized that the ends are a bit frazzled and fried</li>
            <li> However, I still gave it three stars because it makes my hair shiny without weighing it down.  </li>
            <li> Well, Loreal hasn&#x27;t let me down yet</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure I can commit to washing my hair letting it dry and then putting in the product.</li>
            <li> This is intended to be an overnight treatment, so usually your hair is dry when treated.  </li>
            <li> It has a scent that is a little too much like a household cleaning product, but it&#x27;s a faint smell and goes away after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally my hair is shedding less.     </li>
            <li> After using this product I find that I have less split ends</li>
            <li> Also, a lot less breakage.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about a month and a half since I started using it, and since then I&#x27;ve chopped my hair off to something like a pixie cut, but I still use this stuff because I still have a bit of damage on my sides where my hair is longer.</li>
            <li> bottle is half gone.</li>
            <li> I have less breakage and my hair is hydrated in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I have taken to treating my hair in the mornings after the shower and I use significantly less product (2 or 3 pumps).  </li>
            <li> have relatively thick long dark hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on my pillows or on my hair bands.</li>
            <li> but once it reaches just below the shoulders its starts to look a mess.</li>
            <li> My daughter (her mother) has thick, curly, long hair and loves the conditioning effect.  </li>
            <li> but if you have dry, dull hair</li>
            <li> I usually use it every other night to keep from having to buy it so often.</li>
            <li> add a little at night.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this might add a little weight and shine to my hair.</li>
            <li> It may go in your hair feeling a little greasy</li>
            <li> It may feel a little frizzy when just washed</li>
            <li> In the morning I rinsed my hair and meh, a little improvement, but I still wasn&#x27;t sold.  </li>
            <li> I usually apply 4 pumps to my hair every other night.  </li>
            <li> After a shower, when I comb my wet hair, I can hardly even feel it because there is so little resistance against the comb.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or feel greasy at all!</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and [with washing weekly] one bottle of this will last me about 3 months.</li>
            <li> WHile this may work as a deep conditioner, I won&#x27;t ever know because it smells like horrible cheap perfume.</li>
            <li> Yuck, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> add a few months of growing between cuts.  </li>
            <li> Green &amp; comforting.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Naturally blonde and thin.</li>
            <li> Used it a few times and then gave it to my friend</li>
            <li> The three of them together are like a triple threat to dried out hair.</li>
            <li> This Product does nothing, simply waste of money .I</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or heavy feel.</li>
            <li> I was a tad worried about putting something so heavy on my hair after not using any product besides a conditioning cleanser</li>
            <li> If I run out and forget to buy some for a few weeks, there is a noticeable difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> A few times I ran out, and boy, was the difference noticeable.</li>
            <li> The product build up made them look limp and</li>
            <li> I think mayo works just as well if not better for less $$$.</li>
            <li> The night i applied this product, my hair felt very smooth and silky but in the morning it weighed down my hair real bad.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything beyond what the other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything beyond what the other conditioners do.</li>
            <li> There is one by Kerastase that is similar, but this one is way less expensive.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely shocked that a hair product that I purchased in a grocery store was able to outperform my expensive, high-end salon hair products.</li>
            <li> In other words, my hair becomes a weird combination of wet and airy.</li>
            <li> :S</li>
            <li> How wrong I was, by the end of the month it was making my hair clump together, and I could actually feel and hear it stretching and snapping off when I ran my fingers through my hair.</li>
            <li> I am anxious to see how she views my hair at that time.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and used the small amount a couple of times.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I would say don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Then I usually tie my hair into a bun or something and go to sleep.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that makes a difference</li>
            <li> When you wake up, you can rinse it out in the shower, or you can style as usual.</li>
            <li> Also, it has an initially-strong scent that faintly lingers in my hair all day, even when I only use a dime-sized amount.</li>

            <li> with how sensitive I am i was afraid I&#x27;d wake with a rip roaring headache</li>
            <li> (as i usually do after trying diff products) I wanted to be up and awake</li>
            <li> My hair is just past my shoulders</li>
            <li> I usually use Nexxus Pro-mend Overnight Treatment Creme, but since Target was out of stock one week I decided to go with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why L&#x27;Oreal Paris removed this product from store shelves, but I am thankful that I can still get this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I also tried the Pantene version which is a little less expensive than this one.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always had a really hard time with split ends...</li>
            <li> As for the smell, I hardly noticed one.</li>
            <li> This is hard to find in the stores (my experience), so I stock up when ordering.</li>
            <li> It felt dirty next day.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would make the problem go away or at least make it manageable.  </li>
            <li> Compared to Pro-mend, this stuff sucks.  </li>
            <li> It is a joke...for me at least.</li>
            <li> It sucks.</li>
            <li> but I was too late.</li>
            <li> My hair got even worse after using a shampoo and conditioner a few of my relatives recommended me.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my granddaughter because her hair (which is thick) seems to snarl and mat from sleeping.  </li>
            <li> have waist length extremely thick wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean I recommend (or don&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> and it retains a subtle moisture all day.</li>
            <li> The 1-2 pumps is RIDICULOUS</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive (once you add shipping costs) for a loreal leave in conditioner product</li>
            <li> its like a cream it does not smell bad, no white residue and no messing up my pillow at all.</li>
            <li> I have really weak and damaged hair.</li>

            <li> I tend to get them only a little while after a haircut, which is very annoying.</li>

            <li> I had a bad hair dye incident a few months ago which resulted in lots of split ends and breakage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed and will not purchase again, wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Obviously my hair was in horrible condition.    </li>
            <li> So, even though I was skeptical, I decided to give this a try just for kicks and giggles.</li>
            <li> After applied its not greasy, oily or uncomfortable to sleep in, in fact it does not seem like you are sleeping with beauty product in your hair at all.</li>
            <li> I was using a nexxus treatment before but it was getting expensive.</li>
            <li> And I learned that when it comes to hair products, I should look for ones that say \\&quot;hydrating.\\&quot; (This as opposed to \\&quot;moisturizing,\\&quot; which merely gives the appearance of hydration.)</li>
            <li> I am unlikely to get it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this stuff just one night and the next morning was a dramatic difference!!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s expensive in stores ($6-7)</li>
            <li> i started using l\\&quot;oreal about 6 months ago, as my hair was terrible ,it was dry and breaking off at the ends.</li>
            <li> (if you don&#x27;t get too crazy with application) so it&#x27;s not a pillowcase killer.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have to keep cutting and cutting my hair?  </li>
            <li> i purchased l\\&quot;oreal hair repair, when i was in the states, as i was getting desperate, i picked up a can and thought ,</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell or add crazy texture.</li>
            <li> I have a VERY difficult time working this through my hair to get an even application on split ends and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I was very skeptical about it.</li>
            <li> but then I found out how bad sulfates were when they started making me break out</li>
            <li> and I decided that this would be a bad thing if I had product in my hair.  </li>
            <li> For some reason, it smells bad once i smear it in my hands, its like my body doesn&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> For some reason the drugstore ones have always disappointed me.</li>
            <li> Hated what it did to my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very bad history when it comes to hair.</li>
            <li> It smells horrible to me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think the smell was horrible, if it had worked, I wouldn&#x27;t have care what it smelled like, but I did notice the shaving creamish smell that some people mentioned.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing.  I had purchased this because my hair got SUPER dried out from coloring my hair.  I have used it for about a week now, and my hair is SOOO soft.  Its finally getting back to what it was before i did all this damage.  I put it on a night, and it doesn&#x27;t get on my pillow or leave marks.  It really has been a life saver for my hair.</li>
            <li> Conditions great&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy&lt;br /&gt;No residue on pillow&lt;br /&gt;Can skip regular conditioner in shower &amp; us this afterwards &amp; great results</li>
            <li> This works as advertised and is affordable. I don&#x27;t mind the smell at all, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my husband to lay right next to me when this is in my hair. I will probably buy it as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that was once very thick. Due to improper hair care, and bad hair habits I tend to \\&quot;shed\\&quot; a lot. I purchased this product hoping it would help with the split ends I have because of over use with heated styling tools. Although it has not helped my split ends, it has made my hair look very shiny and munch more manageable in the mornings. Additionally my hair is shedding less.     I have a VERY difficult time working this through my hair to get an even application on split ends and damaged hair. The product tends to glob and concentrate in certain sections, which does not allow for easy or even treatment of the effected areas.</li>
            <li> After years of taking advantage of the Amazon reviews I am inspired to write one because I love this product that much.  Very very noticeable results.  My hair feels smoother and thicker.  Go on youtube and watch the video of the woman who wraps her hair overnight to keep it straight.  I use this product in unison with the instructions in that video and I do not have to do my hair in the morning. My hair is wavy and takes forever to blow out and straighten.  By using this system, I wake up run a brush through my hair and it is perfect for work where I have to be on camera.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I recieved this today. It smells horrible to me. It smells like manly shaving cream or something. Since there is no way I could sleep while wearing it, I went ahead and put it on my hair today. I hope it&#x27;s worth putting up with the smell all day. Even if it does great on my hair, I will not buy it again because of the smell. It would have to make my hair the best it&#x27;s ever been to even consider it again. So if your sensitive to strong lasting smells, don&#x27;t buy this! Also it took 10 or more pumps not 2 for my medium length hair. I will post the results later. So far only 1 star and it only got that because you couldn&#x27;t leave no stars, but I give it no stars so far!</li>
            <li> WHile this may work as a deep conditioner, I won&#x27;t ever know because it smells like horrible cheap perfume. Having that wafting around my face all night? No thanks! I couldn&#x27;t stand it for an hour it gave me a headache, had to wash it out. Yuck, what a waste of money.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and figured I&#x27;d write a review on this for anyone else out there looking to soften dry damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is incredibly dry. It doesn&#x27;t help that my hair is naturally coarse and that I live in a very HOT sunny state. So I got this and used it every night before bed. I applied three pumps of this lotion and combed it through my hair, mostly working on the ends rather than the scalp.  Your hair will become damp as if it is wet and that concerned me at first, but in the morning my hair was completely dry! Which is cool! Didn&#x27;t leave any sticky residue or clump my hair together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my hair didn&#x27;t feel conditioned at all. I did notice some shine towards the top of my head, but all my end hairs were still as dry as a broom. It doesn&#x27;t help with split ends or conditioning of the rest of my hair. But then again thats just my hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this conditioner 3 stars because it worked in some ways but not in the way I was hoping.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a decent Job at conditioning, the smell is very perfume-y, one that I don&#x27;t like.  Given the price and the smell, and that there are other products that do just as good or better, I won&#x27;t be getting this again. It&#x27;s not the worst, but it&#x27;s not the best.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little expensive (once you add shipping costs) for a loreal leave in conditioner product but if you have dry, dull hair it&#x27;s worth it.  Just put a little in before bed and something about your body heat overnight and the conditioner works magic.  Every night that I use this I go to bed with dull dry hair and wake up the next day with shiny smooth hair!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and pray L&#x27;Oreal will not take it off the market. It has completely transformed my dry, brittle hair into soft, silky, moisturized hair. When I comb my hair, I do not experience any breakage. I can&#x27;t stop touching my hair throughout the day because it feels so amazing. I am absolutely shocked that a hair product that I purchased in a grocery store was able to outperform my expensive, high-end salon hair products. I actually stopped using my $25 bottle of designer hair conditioner in favor of this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased and started using this approximately 3 weeks ago.  I apply it every night before going to bed.  The results have been spectacular.  I had a bad hair dye incident a few months ago which resulted in lots of split ends and breakage.  After using this product I find that I have less split ends and my hair is a lot smoother.  Also, a lot less breakage.  Although this is somewhat pricey for its size, I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I didnt see any difference in my hair. It felt dirty next day. So i havent use it anymore. Arrive on time.</li>
            <li> I admit I purchased this product to try out and didn&#x27;t have super high expectations despite the reviews.  I tried it the first night expecting that it would be greasy, leave residue on my pillow, make me uncomfortable while I slept and then disappoint me in the morning.  Boy! Was I in for a NICE surprise!  My hair is processed and was very dry so I ended up using four pumps because the first two just seemed to get sucked into my hair that quick.  My hair DID NOT feel oily or greasy at all which really surprised me.  The product had a pleasant coconut fragrance which is one of my favorites.  I slept like a baby and there was no residue on my pillow.  The next day my hair felt so silky.  It made the biggest single difference of any product I have used in years besides my \\&quot;It&#x27;s A 10-miracle leave in product\\&quot; which I use to mitigate heat damage while styling my hair.  I think L&#x27;Oreal has another really BIG WINNER with their EverStrong Overnight Treatment.  An added benefit: I didn&#x27;t rinse my hands after applying the overnight product.  Instead, I rubbed it in like a hand lotion and went to bed.  My hands felt nice and soft too and were not the least bit greasy.</li>
            <li> I was using Dove but then I found out how bad sulfates were when they started making me break out :S i stopped using it. This makes my hair healthier and stronger my hair is long and Im gonna keep growing it so its important that I take care of it. This gets the job done especially being that I have curly hair I recommend it if you want healthy silky moisturized soft hair. God bless u all and have a nice day.</li>
            <li> I bleached my hair back and forth between dyed brown and my natural blonde a couple of times in the span of two months. Obviously my hair was in horrible condition.    My hair was would flop like wet noodles when it was damp and I could squeeze out water from a couple strands and it would look murky, like there was still conditioner in it, even though I knew I had gotten it all out. When it was dry it felt like plastic and frizzed out everywhere. Oddly enough, I never had any breakage, which was good, but it confused the hell out of me. I got a good amount of the damage trimmed off, and then just kept it in a ponytail all the time since it was still pretty bad.    My hair got even worse after using a shampoo and conditioner a few of my relatives recommended me. Mane and Tail. I figured it should work, since they all had very healthy looking hair. How wrong I was, by the end of the month it was making my hair clump together, and I could actually feel and hear it stretching and snapping off when I ran my fingers through my hair. I tossed out the Mane and Tail immediately.    L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Hair Repair treatment caught my eye in the grocery store while I was looking for some new shampoo and a deep conditioner, and I figured I&#x27;d try it out. And since it was Sulfate free and smelled SO good, I just couldn&#x27;t pass it up. I bought it along with a couple Redken products that I use bi-weekly and Organix Teetrea Mint shampoo and conditioner. I don&#x27;t use this stuff every night, mostly because I forget, but when I do my hair always feels really soft when I wake up. It&#x27;s been about a month and a half since I started using it, and since then I&#x27;ve chopped my hair off to something like a pixie cut, but I still use this stuff because I still have a bit of damage on my sides where my hair is longer. I&#x27;m almost out though, so as soon as I can I&#x27;m going to have to go get some more. I think I&#x27;m going to have to keep a bottle or two of this stuff around this house just in case.</li>
            <li> I would like to add my name to those who hope Loreal will NEVER stop making this amazing product! First, Loreal EverStrong Overnight made a stunning difference in completely eliminating \\&quot;morning frizz\\&quot; (familiar to anyone who perms their hair) and smoothed and softened the curl through the day so much that everyone in the salon wanted to feel my hair the next time I got it trimmed! While 2 \\&quot;pumps\\&quot; are perfect for the overnight treatment (which definitely goes in the hair, never the pillow), I got curious about using the Overnight Treatment as a leave-in during the day. The improvement from using 1 \\&quot;pump\\&quot; right after washing and combing through as a leave-in is just as dramatic. (I&#x27;ve also been trying the EverStrong shampoos, which also make a difference; but the Loreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment has smoothed, softened and eliminated dryness with other shampoos, as well.) Please, please, Loreal - keep this product on the market, and I hope you will even offer a larger size!</li>
            <li> This is awesome product. Can never find it in stores, but my hair lady loves when I use this on my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> So far I really like how this product is making my hair.  It is applied before you go to bed.  I have used about half the amount of hairspray daily since starting the overnight treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not dry anymore and seems to have more strength and weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I go back to my beautician next month.  I am anxious to see how she views my hair at that time.</li>
            <li> I started using this product to make my hair look healthier on the days that I did not plan to style it. It does an incredible job of making your hair feel very soft and shiney. I even saw results after using it the very first time!    I usually use it every other night to keep from having to buy it so often. I also use more than recommended because I like to really cover the ends on my hair and also the bottom layer. I love this product so much that I bought a bottle for my Mom to use and enjoy as well. We both love the product and will continue to buy more.</li>
            <li> Product works really well for me, I usually apply it every other night, until my entire head is covered, then i let it soak in before lying down for bed. after the first week and a half my hair became silkier and easier to manage as well as stronger, it helps prevent and reduce split ends, but it won&#x27;t make existing split ends go away.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, color-treated hair and the frizz was uncontrollable in the humid summer weather!  I tried this product last night for the first time and all I can say is WOW!  I can&#x27;t keep my hands off my hair because it&#x27;s so soft, and I swear it feels a lot stronger and thicker now.  I&#x27;ve tried various high end products from the salon, and have to say the Loreal out-performs all of them.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff and because it was offered with free shipping I think it was a good deal.  I have been using it for about 3 nights and a notice that my tinted, wavy hair might not be straighter, as I was hoping, it is a lot softer. I will buy this again and rec. it to others.</li>
            <li> This product does nothing for my hair. I have split shaggy ends &amp; really hoping this product would work, I put actually 3 pumps on my hair (It only says your supposed to do 2) I put one pump all on my ends &amp; the rest all over my hair.. I put A LOT on my ends.. I woke up the next morning and nothing happened! My ends were still bad &amp; my hair was exactly the same. It really annoyed me. I wouldnt buy this product if I were you..</li>
            <li> I have long, fine hair that tends to get dry.  Only recently have I been really committed to keeping my hair healthy; I want to try growing my hair out really long!  I use frequent deep conditioners, leave-in treatments and try to use heat-stylers as infrequently as possible.  Not gonna lie, this product got my attention because of Evangeline Lily (I&#x27;m a big Lostie!)  I thought I&#x27;d give the shampoo and conditioner a try, and they were ok, but not the best.  THIS, however!  If you are trying to give your hair a big boost of moisture and health, do yourself a favor and give the overnight treatment a try.  Here were the best things I noticed about it:  1. My ends felt so soft and healthy after one night that I changed my mind about needing to go for a haircut.  If you&#x27;re trying to grow out your hair, you want to get as few cuts as possible, right?  Here you go- add a few months of growing between cuts.  2. My hair actually felt heavier, even after washing and drying the next day.  I could literally tell the difference in moisture absorbed by weight!  It meant a noticeable difference in flyaways, and my fine hair still felt styled hours after I was done drying it.  3. I was very skeptical about how a product this intense wouldn&#x27;t feel oily, but it really doesn&#x27;t.  I put the product in my hair a few hours before bed, but it was totally absorbed in minutes- a little bit of a \\&quot;gunked up\\&quot; feeling while the product was actually on, but not oily.  I just put my hair in a braid to keep it out of the way, and to not feel &#x27;unbathed.&#x27;    I will say that you&#x27;ll probably need more than the recommended 1-2 pumps.  My hair is long enough that I can tuck it under my arms, and I use between 6-8 pumps.  Otherwise, nothing but good to say about this awesome product!  Enjoy your new hair!</li>
            <li> what could be easier.  add a little at night.  wake up to restoration galore!  notice the difference after first use.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair, which is at the moment a few inches past my shoulders. It is soft, and I don&#x27;t use any products other than shampoo and hair color every so often. So I don&#x27;t really have any split ends. But it has never been shiny or sleek like the people in Pantene commercials. It is instead flyaway and always looks like it needs brushed. I was hoping this might add a little weight and shine to my hair. I did not need to use more than 2 pumps. Each pump is a lot of stuff though so I only push it down until I have about a dime size which is about half a pump. And I work it through my hair in quarter sections. It does completely soak in, though my hair is a little wet feeling for awhile. But I use it a couple hours before I actually go to bed. It does have a fairly strong coconut scent. But if I wash my hands and keep my hair out of my face when I go to bed I don&#x27;t smell it that much. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on the pillow. This product does make my hair feel different. Not better, just different. Kind of soft but with stuff in it. But it also makes it look greasy sooner than it started to look greasy without the treatment. And it doesn&#x27;t really LOOK any different. Which is more what I was after. I will continue to use it until it is gone, but I won&#x27;t buy any more. But it may work much more noticeably on someone whose hair isn&#x27;t already soft, since softening seems to be its main function. I have noticed, however, that if I use it the night before I don&#x27;t need to use detangler if I wash it the following morning. I may have just misunderstood the intended use for this. I knew it wouldn&#x27;t give me new hair like the women in the commercials, but I was hoping for a little less of a fly-away look.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product and used the small amount a couple of times.  I noticed how soft, silky and shiny it makes my hair.  So, I bought the full size product.  It only take about a dime&#x27;s worth for each application.  It smells like coconut milk.  Its an overnight treatment, so I apply it on dry hair before bedtime.  There is no residue and it is non-greasy.  I give this product a two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It smells amazing. Green &amp; comforting. Better than the EverStrong shampoos and conditioners. The smell also lasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It works. My hair is noticeably shinier, healthier, and more manageable after using this product consistently. It feels thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. It isn&#x27;t greasy and it absorbs quickly. It doesn&#x27;t leave a mess on my pillows or on my hair bands. No gunk, no residue, anywhere, ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. It washes right out. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or contribute to any build up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. It works great as a styling product. I love that I can run this through my hair and it doesn&#x27;t have a bad smell or add crazy texture. It gives me a piece-y shine and soft hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. It&#x27;s easy to use. However many pumps you need, rub your palms together and press / work through hair. It comes out in globs but I find if you rub it through your hands first, you get more even coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product. Due to its stellar functionality &amp; superior absorption, I cannot imagine anyone being disappointed.</li>
            <li> I really do like this product.  When my hair is dry or flyaway - I put it on my hair at night.  The odor is pleasant and not appalling.. the next day my hair is shiny and silky.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I was very skeptical about it. I didn&#x27;t believe that anything could actually repair split ends. I have long hair (it goes past my armpits about 4in) and I&#x27;ve always had a really hard time with split ends... I tend to get them only a little while after a haircut, which is very annoying. So, even though I was skeptical, I decided to give this a try just for kicks and giggles. Well, I was amazed at what it did to my hair... after just one use, I noticed far fewer split ends in my hair! After a few uses, they were gone entirely. My ends are also always very brittle, and now they are nice and soft. In the beginning I needed to use more than what was recommended (I used 2 pumps just for my ends alone) because my hair was just that bad, but after using it for a while, I don&#x27;t need to use as much. I would definitely recommend this product... if you have problems with split ends and brittle hair, BUY IT! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> We have been using this product for several years and recently found it difficult to locate locally and therefore we were delighted that Amazon makes it so easy.  Several of us in the household use it.  You can put it on dry or wet hair.  For my granddaughter, we put it on her long hair before her daily swimming and it really protects from chlorine damage.  My daughter (her mother) has thick, curly, long hair and loves the conditioning effect.  I have &amp;#34;old ladies&#x27; hair&amp;#34; and it helps me too!  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I wish I could have found this sooner! I have very dry hair because of my thyroid issues and along with the fact that I probably straighten it too much, and this product does wonders. It really moisturizes your hair along with helping it grow faster! I use this product mostly on my bangs since they tend to dry out quicker, and I wanted them to grow out because they were NOT growing out and I was beginning to get worried. I noticed a difference in my hair growth and moisture in my hair after a month of using this product. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the product I received.  It was well packaged and shipped quickly.  It was just what I wanted and I am very happy.  I will use this seller, again and highly recommend this seller.  thanks.</li>
            <li> I really had high hopes for this product, it did not meet my expectations by any means!!! I definitely will not be ordering this again.</li>
            <li> i just got this product ..well my hair is pretty thick and dry i would say it didnot work for my hair .not goanna buy this anymore .</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use it in the morning and evening after washing my hair. It leaves my hair feeling soft and very healthy, without making it feel over greasy and giving it a weird texture like some leave in hair products. I have very fine hair that tangles easily, so this products really reduces the tangles and makes it look much healthier.</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is resistant to being super soft and shiny?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is half gone. I use it everyday. My hair hasn&#x27;t changed a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I use the accompanying shampoo and conditioner as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that will look at reviews to help me decide between two products that I&#x27;m unsure about.  The reviewers of Amazon have always steered me in the right direction.  I&#x27;m a bit suspicious of this product&#x27;s rating though.  I&#x27;ve been using the product every day for a week and have not noticed any difference, at all.  When you put the product in your hair, it seems wet for just a few minutes and then quickly &amp;#34;soaks in&amp;#34;.  When reading the ingredient list, I noticed that the fifth ingredient in this is alcohol, which promotes quick drying.  It&#x27;s not actually soaking in, the alcohol is drying the cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you did have a good experience with this hair repairing treatment, that&#x27;s great.  I&#x27;m now going to start looking for another treatment.</li>
            <li> I like this product,works great for dry and highlighted hair...highly recommended&lt;br /&gt;Not heavy,smells nice, finally I can brush my hair so easily.</li>
            <li> I have really weak and damaged hair. Naturally blonde and thin. It damages so easily. I am trying my best to grow my hair out but once it reaches just below the shoulders its starts to look a mess. I bought this based on the great reviews and it is working. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and its gradually making my hair better. It has a very soft smell and is really easy to use. 2 pumps is maybe a little much for me BUT I don&#x27;t have much hair. I will definitely buy this again. Its a lot cheaper than the salon products I have bought before and works a lot better.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy African American hair that I wear natural.  I use two pumps for the front to mid-crown and two pumps from the crown to the ends.  It works for me.  I have less breakage and my hair is hydrated in the morning.  This makes it manageable each day.  I don&#x27;t want to be without it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! At first I bought it thinking it was a condiitioner that you rinsed out the next morning, but you just leave it in. My hair is very thick and curly and I love how it revives it every night since I only wash my hair every three or four days. I use three pumps and it dries almost instantly, would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I am growing out what was once 1/2\\&quot; of hair - my hair is kinky/wavy/straight/curly so it takes a beating with my iron and hair dryer. I&#x27;ve gotten it down to my chin now and realized that the ends are a bit frazzled and fried and I&#x27;d give this a shot. I had to use A LOT of it because of how quickly it soaks up. The recommended 1-2 pumps did not cut it by any means. I did about 5-6 pumps and was super impressed that it just soaks right in. It left no residue on my pillow over night and was not greasy at all. The smell is super pleasant. I didn&#x27;t notice a HUGE difference, but the ends were definitely less crunchy the next day. Not super amazing but a very good effect for the money!</li>
            <li> I have never reviewed a product on Amazon before. As a frequent online shopper here, that should tell you something right there -- out of all of the items I&#x27;ve purchased over the years, this is the first one I&#x27;ve felt strongly enough about to take the time to review. But this product definitely deserves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair, to the point where I would be rich if I could figure out how to make wigs out of all of the hair that comes off of my head during a normal haircut/thinning session. And I usually only wash it a couple of times a week because it takes just that long for moisture and the natural oils to soak back into my hair to the point where it looks halfway decent. Before I hit that magic sweet spot (usually the day right before I need to wash my hair again, of course), the only way my hair can look and feel smooth and sleek is if I&#x27;ve just had it done at the hairdresser&#x27;s and all sorts of expensive product has been used on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tell you all of this because I can achieve the exact same results with this less-than-$10 product right here (I paid $5.97 + tax for mine at a local store). Based on other good reviews, I had high hopes for L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Treatment, but my actual usage of it has far surpassed those.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some on my hair before bed -- just as my hair was from the day, no washing or drying or anything else ahead of time. I did use more than the recommended 2 pumps, but, as mentioned, my hair&#x27;s very thick and, usually, very dry... and I think I still only needed about 4 pumps to feel satisfied. As other reviewers have mentioned, it&#x27;s best to put the product into your hands and rub them together first before working it into your hair. Provides for a more even and easy distribution that way. As for the smell, I hardly noticed one. To me, the scent was mild, at best, but pleasant, and by the time I went to bed (less than five minutes after applying the treatment), I couldn&#x27;t smell it at all. There was no residueleft on my pillow, no \\&quot;producty\\&quot; feel in my hair, nothing that makes using this a chore. I did nothing extra to my hair besides the use of this product -- no wrapping, no braiding it or pulling it back, no washing it out in the morning, nothing. Just went to sleep like normal and woke up to hair that looks and feels like I just came from the salon. After only one night! I can&#x27;t wait to see what continued use of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Overnight Treatment will do for my hair.</li>
            <li> I look at reviews and i buy this overnight treatment,i know i don&#x27;t cut my hair from almost a year and i really need a product for my split ends... so i try this,i need like 4-5 pumps and surprise in the morning my split ends are gone i mean this treatment really work, this save my hair from a haircut :D and i use it almost every night since then ,and every morning i love how my hair look so healthy.;)</li>
            <li> This product works for my hair that is always on the dry side. I wash it daily because I exercise daily. When I put this repair solution into my hair at night before I lay down to sleep (wait for it to dry first) it&#x27;ll make my hair feel soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have very dry, brittle hair and had lots of breakage. This has really transformed my hair. It makes it less frizzy, for sure and my hair seems stronger and easier to style when I use it. This is hard to find in the stores (my experience), so I stock up when ordering. All of these Everstrong products by L&#x27;Oreal are the awesome!</li>
            <li> This product works so well for me.  I don&#x27;t use it just at night, I put in on after I shampoo my hair while it is still wet.  I comb my hair in place and let it dry naturally.  It gives my hair so much body. It is a great product.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair was this shiny after only one night of use! I love this!</li>
            <li> It is mildly hydrating, but &amp;#34;everstrong&amp;#34; is a bit hyperbolic for the effect the product actually has on my hair.  It doesn&#x27;t add any added strength that I could discern and it doesn&#x27;t particularly hydrate well either.</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for years and for some reason my local store stopped carrying it. I am thrilled I can get it online. It makes my hair feel SO much better after just one use.</li>
            <li> i tried it for several days and ive notice no change to my hair still the same.. its just like a leave on conditioner. however i purchase again for my daughter..</li>
            <li> Purchased on the advice of a friend. ICK. Hated what it did to my hair. YUCK. Used it a few times and then gave it to my friend</li>
            <li> I liked that the product is not greasy and one pump went a long way allowing the product to last me longer than other more expensive hair care products. I did not necessarily use this at night. I used it sometimes in the morning or immediately after washing my hair to seal the ends and prevent them from splitting.</li>
            <li> Very Dry Naturally Curly hair doesn&#x27;t get better with length or age, but I am managing to get a nice length by using this as an in between treatment on a day I didn&#x27;t do the full shampoo, condition, and leave in moisturizer routine to keep the ends in good repair. I&#x27;ll put it on in the early evening so the scent isn&#x27;t strong when I go to bed and then after it is worked through I twist it up into a clip for a while to avoid rubbing it off on chair backs etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times, so am not seeing long-term results yet, but I do agree with previous reviewers in that it does soak into the hair (if you don&#x27;t get too crazy with application) so it&#x27;s not a pillowcase killer.  Am hoping for good long term results with continued use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell as much as some other reviewers did- I&#x27;d have rather it had no smell or a different one. But, I do like how my hair feels the morning after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually use more pumps- I have thick hair going down my back some and I probably use about 4, maybe 5 pumps. Then I usually tie my hair into a bun or something and go to sleep. In the morning, after brushing, the smell is almost gone (fortunately for me) and my hair does feel pretty nice :) I&#x27;m glad I have it, but I don&#x27;t use it every night either- maybe only a couple times a week.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of this product when I first read about it but I had dyed my hair to the point of it being fried. So I decided to give it a try and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. It does take a but of time, do not expect this to magically fix you hair over night. It takes a few weeks but the results are great. The product has a nice smell. It may go in your hair feeling a little greasy but when you wake up your hair is soft and has a good smell. I&#x27;ve been buying this for a few years now and my hair is so much softer when I use it constantly and for long periods of time. I would also recommend the shampoo and conditioner that go with this product. The three of them together are like a triple threat to dried out hair. It may feel a little frizzy when just washed but once you brush through it, it&#x27;s soft and so silky. I really love this product and am glad I went against my skepticism because this was a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone with dried out hair or even frizzy since the moisture is great for it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find something different to say regarding most purchases.  They either are as described and great-or you will let everyone know not to purchase-this one is great!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Brings back softness and shine.  Besides for using overnight as recommended, I will use sparingly as a leave in conditioner occasionally</li>
            <li> I use this as leave-in conditioner (very curly hair). It is fantastic and for some reason I can&#x27;t find it at Target or Wal-Mart, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon still carries it!</li>
            <li> It smells awesome and it s so gentle on the hair!perfect for daily usage!and sulfate free makes it all better!</li>
            <li> I have short, layered hair, which gets dry after coloring.  I&#x27;ve used regular and deep conditioners after color, but never got any relief from those dry ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night, I tried this product for the first time, and, after washing my hair this morning, I&#x27;m impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the product was easy. 2 pumps, and my entire head had enough product (people with long hair would probably need more). As the product dried down, it left my hair looking kind of dull, and feeling very weighed down, BUT, I just ran my hands through my hair several times, and the dullness and weight were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was a fragrance that faded before I hit the pillow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t notice any shine this morning, UNTIL I shampooed and let my hair air dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow! Smooth hair (even those dry ends), and a nice shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I tried this, and would recommend it to anyone with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this product and everyone seemed to say it worked really well. I used it for a couple of weeks at night &amp; I couldn&#x27;t really tell a big difference. My hair is really dry and damaged, so I don&#x27;t know if it could have helped anyway. I like the smell of the product, it wasn&#x27;t overwhelming and it worked into my hair easily. Like I said, it seems like a good product, I just couldn&#x27;t see a big difference.</li>
            <li> Love this product, one of the best deep conditioners and repair products. Good for hair thats been colored, processed, sundamaged or even healthy hair. After applied its not greasy, oily or uncomfortable to sleep in, in fact it does not seem like you are sleeping with beauty product in your hair at all. After hair is soft, smooth, full and with out fly aways but not flat. The effect lasts for days so you only need to use it once or twice a week. It lasts quite a while since it does not take much to be effective either. gGreat for regular use in the summer to help with humidity protection.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I expected it was better</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I have long and curly hair. This stuff helps deal with my split ends without having to go and get a trim. I noticed a difference after my first use!</li>
            <li> They must have changed the formula since I bought this several years ago I noticed the smell isn&#x27;t as strong....which may not be a bad thing for the more sensitive folks. It still works the same, my hair feels so silky and smells nice after applying and leaving in overnight. I do not rinse it out either.</li>
            <li> this over night treatment worked on my hair. My hair was a bit brittle and dry due to dying my hair. This product brings back your shine and replenishes its naturals oils.. I say its worth it.</li>
            <li> I get softer hair in the morning each time I use this. Recommened</li>
            <li> I used this just once, overnight as directed. My hair is chemically lightened and this made it much darker !</li>
            <li> The first time I used this I put it in my hair after the day was done, so no washing the hair and letting it air dry before bed, I just put it in.  I also over applied the product because well after a day of being out and about your hair is drier and soaks in product like nobody&#x27;s business.  That night I slept with a sleep cap on, because I&#x27;m like a super restless sleeper and I wake up with a rat&#x27;s nest and I decided that this would be a bad thing if I had product in my hair.  That morning I rinsed out my hair and blah.  Not much happening.  So that morning I washed and deep conditioned with my regular product John Frieda Replenish.  That night I washed my hair before bed, and put the conditioner in wet hair.  I still put on the sleep cap.  In the morning I rinsed my hair and meh, a little improvement, but I still wasn&#x27;t sold.  So the next evening, I washed my hair, let it air dry and then put the overnight cream in.  I rinsed the cream in the morning and voila, now we&#x27;re talking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But honestly, unless you just can&#x27;t wait to get home, wash your hair and let it sit and air dry how often are you going to do this or how often are you going to want to do this.  My hair looked lovely and healthy, and I enjoy some fun product and pampering time, but I have a life that doesn&#x27;t revolve around my hair too.  I&#x27;m going to try out a few more miracle masks for hair before I settle.  This really does make your hair look nice.  It does seem to seal some of those broken ends, but I think for best results you&#x27;d have to do this a few times a week and I can&#x27;t even commit to television programs so I&#x27;m not sure I can commit to washing my hair letting it dry and then putting in the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and loved the smell of it (and the results) that I gave it to my mom for Christmas along with some other things. UPDATE- my mom just mentioned this again to me and says that she can really tell the difference in how healthy her hair is when she uses it. I am still using it myself. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> i started using this a week ago, i had highlight on my hair and it was starting to feel dry from the bleaching of my hair so i started looking for a treatment. After the first use i could feel the change. At first i thought this was like a foam kind of treatment but its like a cream it does not smell bad, no white residue and no messing up my pillow at all. I ussually apply it after i shower and leave it through the night. I use 2 puffs i dont have that much hair and my hair is straight. I was using a nexxus treatment before but it was getting expensive. So i totally recommend this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 3/12/14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so this weekend i went to get my hair cut and my stylist commented that my hair feels stronger/thiker. I was like wow could it be because of this treatment? Because she would always tell me my hair was thin and stuff like that. So all i can think of if that it is because of the treatment. Also i apply it to my hair when its towel dried instead of when its dry. Not sure if that makes a difference but thats how ive been doing it!</li>
            <li> I have wavy/straight hair that has many fried split ends. When I used this product overnight I noticed it made my hair more greasy, and when I used a lot I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all. I have tried this product for several nights and I honestly have not seen anything I like. My hair seems to be exactly the same in the morning. It works okay as a styling product though. I use it when I curl  my hair but still, I wish I used my money for something else.</li>
            <li> I love love love this product. I have very long, very thick hair that is naturally very wavy. I use it after I blow dry my hair in the morning. If I dry my hair and don&#x27;t use a flat iron or curling iron on it, it poofs out like a frizzy lion&#x27;s mane. I don&#x27;t like to spend the time in the mornings straightening or curling my hair and I like the waves, just not the poofyness. So, when I apply this product it relaxes my hair, and the waves look really cool - no more poof! AND it does NOT make my hair oily or stringy. I LOVE IT! In fact, I carry it with me so I can apply it later in the day if I need to. It&#x27;s like hand lotion for my hair.</li>
            <li> I really like the L&#x27;Oreal Overnight Hair Repair for my hair which is very thick and dry.  I used to buy it at Ultra but they no longer carry it.  I was glad to see I can still find it.  I found it really helped on the night after II washed my hair.</li>
            <li> I have really long hair, so I LOVE overnight products. This one is decent - it smells nice, soaks in quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave residue on the pillow, and with regular use, my hair looks shinier. That&#x27;s about it. No noticeable difference in strength, vitality, etc. Also, if I had to complain, using even a tiny bit too much of this can make my hair feel EXTREMELY brittle. I consider this the \\&quot;better than nothing\\&quot; overnight treatment. Pantene Pro-V Overnight Miracle is better.</li>
            <li> I really love this stuff, but it is almost impossible to find. Even checked the net for stores &amp;#34;supposed&amp;#34; to be carrying it--but none of the ones near me had it. Will probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products in my life and this is one that did nothing for my hair, literally. For some reason, it smells bad once i smear it in my hands, its like my body doesn&#x27;t like it. The smell changes as soon as it comes into contact with my skin, and thats happened to me with one other product. I have no idea what it is, or what it means. Maybe its the combination of my shampoo and conditioner. I stand by Loreal products as a whole. They have really good products, but this one, I actually threw it away, and I NEVER throw anything away.</li>
            <li> This is a great leave-in treatment. I have long, fine hair that is colored and prone to breakage. I read about this treatment and others like it. There is one by Kerastase that is similar, but this one is way less expensive. I&#x27;ve been using the L&#x27;oreal professional sulfate free line for my shampoo and conditioner and it&#x27;s a good combo of quality and price. I also tried the Pantene version which is a little less expensive than this one. But I like this one better than the Pantene; the Pantene is a little bit more wet while this one is lighter and that works better for my hair which is fine - it doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down the way the Pantene does. If you have thicker hair you might want to try that one to compare.&lt;br /&gt;For my hair, I use one pump, rub it between my hands, divide my hair in two and put the product on each side, focusing on the ends and if there is any product left over, my hairline. I do this at night, usually last in my nighttime routine, after I&#x27;ve put on my moisturizer. You can think of it like moisturizer for your hair before you go to bed. When you wake up, you can rinse it out in the shower, or you can style as usual. Overnight, your hair soaks it up. It doesn&#x27;t get on your pillow at all. When you wake up, your hair is soft and healthy-looking. This helps to keep my ends healthy so that my hair can stay long!&lt;br /&gt;This is a great treatment to use if you like to wear second day hair. You put a little dry shampoo at your roots and some of this on your ends at night, the products soak in while you sleep, and when  you wake up your hair is ready to style and go.</li>
            <li> I do LOVE so many of the L;oreal products, from their hair products to their day and night cremes, their make up you name it. This is sadly the first product where I have to say, for me, and my daughters hair it did not work.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is highlighted, overall pretty much straight , but I have a lot of hair and volumne, this product did nothing to it. My daughters has relaxed coarse hair same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend L;oreals Ever Sleek leave in conditioner instead , wonderful product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;yet the price was great, so if you have damaged hair it might be worth a try for you to give it a try.</li>
            <li> My hair was dry on the ends due to relaxing. I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks and have noticed a major improvement in my hair. My hair is softer and Shinier. I highly recommend this and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. Its inexpensive and makes my hair feel wonderful. I put it on before bed one every couple weeks, put my hair in a bun and wash it out in the morning. It gives it that extra bit of moisture that I was going for!</li>
            <li> I was a classic too-manly-for-hair-care male until I recently resolved (out of either vanity or self-respect, or maybe both) to start attending more carefully to my health/appearance/grooming. Hair is, of course, at the front line of that battle, so I interrogated some professional hair people and did some Internet browsing and learned that hair care is only partly a matter of what products you use. Healthy hair is also the result of things like drinking water and eating right and avoiding excessive sun or heat. Hair is, in fact, the most reliable indicator of whether a person is healthy. (See the Wikipedia page on \\&quot;hair care,\\&quot; for starters.) And I learned that when it comes to hair products, I should look for ones that say \\&quot;hydrating.\\&quot; (This as opposed to \\&quot;moisturizing,\\&quot; which merely gives the appearance of hydration.) That&#x27;s because hydrated hair is pretty much what healthy hair *is.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then spent a decent (if not ridiculous) amount of time browsing Amazon&#x27;s hydrating hair products and reading the reviews, and then I experimented with 5 different, relatively inexpensive products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that none of the 5 products are magical but I have noticed a mild to moderate improvement in shine, darkness, and thickness. (If you have recommendations for a near-magical product, I&#x27;m counting on you to let me know.) Given what I&#x27;ve seen from the different products, I will probably settle into a routine of using a small amount of the Frieda shampoo and conditioner daily, and then using an overnight treatment maybe once a month (but probably not this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That doesn&#x27;t mean I recommend (or don&#x27;t) any of these products for you. Another thing I learned while researching hair is that we are all unique little flowers with very different filaments on our noggins that respond differently to different things. So rather than recommending a particular product, I recommend that you do some trials and see what works for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Below is a detailed review of each product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* L&#x27;Oreal EverStrong Overnight Treatment (My rating: 2.5 stars) (Current price: $1.76/ounce) - I have only used it a few times but haven&#x27;t noticed anything magical. You apply it to dry hair at night, work it through the ends, and then sleep with your hair in a mildly goopy state. I didn&#x27;t check carefully, but I would be surprised if your hair doesn&#x27;t leave a mark on your pillowcase.  And it takes a lot of goop, even for a guy with reasonably short hair like me. Maybe it would be worth it if it gave my hair a brilliant luster or thickness, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much at all, at least not above what the shampoo and conditioner are already doing. I am unlikely to get it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B0034F7F2E John Frieda Frizz-Ease Shampoo]] (4.3 stars) ($0.60/ounce) - It works noticeably better than my old shampoo (Aussie Smooth). With this shampoo, my hair stays wet after a shower about 40% longer and it retains a subtle moisture all day. After a shower, when I comb my wet hair, I can hardly even feel it because there is so little resistance against the comb. In other words, my hair becomes a weird combination of wet and airy. The shampoo seems to work best when I leave it in for a minute or two before rinsing. I only need to use about a nickel-sized amount (I have medium-to-shaggy hair). It has a scent that is a little too much like a household cleaning product, but it&#x27;s a faint smell and goes away after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B0034F3VW2 John Frieda Frizz-Ease Conditioner]] (3.8 stars) ($0.54/ounce) - If the shampoo does most of the moisturizing \\&quot;work,\\&quot; then the conditioner seems kind of like the sealant to lock it in and protect it all day, and to make your hair more \\&quot;manageable.\\&quot; This conditioner does that job well enough but I only use a little bit of it because it makes my hair a little too helmet-y for my liking. Maybe you like that from a conditioner--I don&#x27;t. I prefer that my hair move in the breeze. Thisconditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair. As for the scent, I would describe it as \\&quot;neutral.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B002PBACLY L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong Conditioner]] (3.2 stars) ($0.66/ounce) - This seems to have the same effect as the Frieda conditioner, except that it makes my hair even slightly more helmet-y. Also, it has an initially-strong scent that faintly lingers in my hair all day, even when I only use a dime-sized amount. It&#x27;s a smell that I would describe as endurable but not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* [[ASIN:B000UPOBRI Paul Mitchell leave-in conditioner]] (3.0 stars) ($1.03/ounce) - My second-biggest complaint with this product is that it is sort of annoying to apply - after the shower, you have to dab a few blotches of it onto your damp hair and then brush it through. My biggest complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything beyond what the other conditioners do. It works well enough and makes my hair nice and dark and helmet-y but so do the other conditioners. Plus, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s doing much to make my hair healthier because you only apply it to the end of the hair and not to the scalp. That means it also requires a good amount of the blue gel to work it through all of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - Many of these same products are probably available at your local Wal-Mart (or whatever), and probably for a 10-25% lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.P.S. - A couple years ago, I experimented with using no hair products at all... for months. I had read some caveman-y theories about how hair products damage our hair because they crowd out the natural moisturizing chemicals and blah blah. All I can say is that it didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s true that my hair during those months was surprisingly less nappy and gross than I expected, and it&#x27;s maybe even true that the artificial chemicals we put on our scalps have some serious, unwelcome consequences, but all I can say is that I much prefer how my hair looks and feels after it&#x27;s been shampooed, to the point that I&#x27;m willing to take whatever risks those chemicals may pose.conditioner would probably have a more desirable effect for people with long (at least shoulder-length) hair.

            <li> Wow! I love this product!</li>
            <li> This has really improved the texture of my hair. I am still using cream rinse on my hair occasionally.I had very dry cotton candy like hair and this has returned the shine and bounce to my hair.I had to use more than 2 pumps for my shortish hair at first,now that my hair is not as dry 2 works fine.i will continue to buy this product for that extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking it would make my hair stronger as implied by its name.  It did not. However, I still gave it three stars because it makes my hair shiny without weighing it down.  It also smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product 3-5 times a week (only from the ends to about half-way up).  I have very long, extremely processed hair - It&#x27;s naturally dark brown/black and I lighten it to strawberry blonde.  I started using this product three weeks ago and I didn&#x27;t notice much of a change at first.  The treatment made my hair smell nice, but it still felt similar to steel wool toward the tips. Today I noticed my hair is softer and shinier, with practically no split ends.  It took time, but it surpassed my expectations and I will definitely continue using it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioning treatment of all time. I leave it in overnight. When I wash my hair the next morning, my hair feels like silk. Used to buy it at CVS, but they no longer stock it.</li>
            <li> This Product does nothing, simply waste of money .I bought this because of  good company and so many reviews(good ones) but it does nothing. DONT BUY .</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! I saw results within the first use. I have to confess I was a bit skeptical at first, and didn&#x27;t really like how it felt when I first applied the product to my hair, but what a pleasant surprise when I woke up! And I really noticed the difference after motorcycling - I use my hair in a low pony tail because of the helmet, and it&#x27;s still a nightmare, my hair gets all tangled up - after using this product, combing my hair after motorcycling is a breeze. Definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I feel like buying cases of this in case it EVER gets discontinued!! all my 57 yrs of life..every kind of hair product has bothered me (physically) headaches sore throats sinus pain etc etc...I was always jealous of everyone that could use diff products and their hair look great..SMELL great etc...WELL I FINALLY FOUND IT!! Im so excited...&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use at night (hey your hair doesn&#x27;t know its night time or day time if your sleeping or awake lol) with how sensitive I am i was afraid I&#x27;d wake with a rip roaring headache (as i usually do after trying diff products) I wanted to be up and awake so that...if..it did start..to bother me..I could hurry and it wash off...&lt;br /&gt;I love the texture very creamy (my hands felt like i conditioned them they were so soft after using this!)&lt;br /&gt;The smell as others said was true..you do..get..a HINT of aftershave smell...but after its on your hair it smells great and no aftershave smell....&lt;br /&gt;I couldnt believe 24 hrs passed...no headache--sore throat--sniffles etc etc..now its 40 hrs later and NOTHING YIPPEE lol..and I can&#x27;t believe i can actually run my fingers STRAIGHT thru my hair with no catching knots! my hair is mega shiny soft and smells great! Im so happy I listened to the GOOD reviews and bought this! I always tend to go with the negatives...&lt;br /&gt;I 100% recommend this to everyone!!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a week, and I have still to find that my hair is any less dry.  It smells great, but no significant change.  I think mayo works just as well if not better for less $$$.</li>
            <li> This product lives up to it&#x27;s claim and more, My hair is relaxed. I use this right before wrapping at night. My hair has become strong, but also very silky looking and feeling, shiny, and healthy.  The ends look smooth and my hair is not shedding. My hair has gotten thicker, too.  That&#x27;s probably because it&#x27;s not shedding. I like touching my own hair during the day. I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.   You can actually see and feel your hair&#x27;s improvement after the first use, and it only gets better with continued use. It&#x27;s not oily or sticky.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue or heavy feel. It works nothing like those hair polishers, that sit on the surface of the hair and leaves a coating. It has a somewhat wet, get-like, feel, but don&#x27;t be alarmed, it absolutely does not revert the hair. My hair is short. I only use one pump.  You don&#x27;t need to pile it on.  The next morning, I can just comb my hair and go. No need to hit it with a flat iron, spray with oil sheen, or apply any products to impart a lively look.   I love this stuff. Actually, I like it better than Mizani&#x27;s buttercream hairdress to liven my hair between shampoos. For me, that&#x27;s saying a lot.  It&#x27;s 1/4 the price of Mizani, too.  I purchased this based solely on the good reviews. Thank you all. Hair products always make claims, but this one delivers, beyond my expectations. This EverStrong give superior protection, strength, and conditioning support for relaxed hair.    I like the fragrance. As my fellow reviewer stated, \\&quot;it smells Green\\&quot;...sort of plant-like or, like mild, sweet, pipe tobacco and coconut....something grown in nature. No matter, the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last long. Even if I thought it smelled horrid, I would mix in a drop of my favorite essential oil, and gladly keep using this product.  It is the best leave in conditioner I have ever used. It really improves the hair.</li>
            <li> This product is a miracle worker! I am African-American with thick, kinky hair that can never get enough moisture. When I was relaxed, this was my holy grail product. In the months before I transitioned to natural hair, I had lots of breakage but when I used this I could style my hair and see maybe 2-3 strands come out in the comb. The difference was truly overnight. Now that I&#x27;m natural, I use it to fortify my hair after it&#x27;s been pressed out and it still does a great job. This will be a lifetime staple product in my regimen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it has improved my hair, but it sure hasn&#x27;t hurt it.  It smells great, goes on nice and when I wake up in the morning my hair doesn&#x27;t look greasy. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I use [[ASIN:B005HIH7YM L&#x27;Oreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner, 8.3 Fluid Ounce]], which I love, (as shown by my review) but it leaves my ends a bit dry. I know this is probably user error, but I like my system and am working on growing my hair out so it seemed like as good a time as any to try any end treatments I wanted. Well, Loreal hasn&#x27;t let me down yet so I decided to go with this gem here. I shower at night, so I put it in my hair wet, but that doesn&#x27;t seem to have stopped it from working it&#x27;s magic. After one night my ends are noticeably more moisturized. I was a tad worried about putting something so heavy on my hair after not using any product besides a conditioning cleanser but it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or feel greasy at all! I&#x27;m hoping it continues to work it&#x27;s magic. Also, I notice a pleasant LIGHT scent, and no glops or random placement if I do two pumps (which is more than enough for my bra strap length, thick hair) and then rub my hands together before distributing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still loving it! Second day in and while my hair hasn&#x27;t improved since yesterday it is just as lovely. Still putting it in my hair while wet, though. Maybe that&#x27;s the difference between glops and smooth application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 3/7/13&lt;br /&gt;I use this every night before I go to sleep. It&#x27;s light enough it doesn&#x27;t weigh my ends down but nourishing enough that it keeps the flyaways from ruling my hairstyle every day. Two pumps is always enough for my ends, and I generally keep away from my roots since I use the cleansing conditioner and don&#x27;t want to get them greased up.</li>
            <li> But after second use it dried up my hair like hay. I&#x27;m disappointed and will not purchase again, wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I was willing to try this product for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Especially now that the weather is getting colder my hair seems to get a lot more dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel this product does help a bit.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this after seeing a brief TV ad.&lt;br /&gt;  At first I put it on as directed (to hair while dry) When I woke up in the morning&lt;br /&gt;I found the treatment had left a very slight gummy feel. My hair is VERY FINE and&lt;br /&gt;color treated. Based on that I decided to put the treatment on my hair while damp. (let it dry before&lt;br /&gt;bedtime) Then the next morning I have to say my hair was healthier, softer and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;  I am so pleased that I decided to subscribe to get one can of treatment every month from Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;  If you try it I think you will like it too!</li>
            <li> It works alright I guess . I didn&#x27;t really see what it did too much . It ran out like very fast also .</li>
            <li> I use this as a pre-poo treatment overnight in tandem with coconut oil. It works great! I find that it softens my 4c hair before applying the oil to my hair. My hair is very thick and [with washing weekly] one bottle of this will last me about 3 months. I find that after my washes my hair comes out a lot softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to those looking for a great pre-shampoo treatment for thick natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use this on my hair once a week and have totally noticed a difference. It smells amazing and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair looking greasy.</li>
            <li> I never believed that you could \\&quot;repair\\&quot; split ends.  In my mind, the only cure for split ends was a haircut!  But how do I keep my hair stronger so I don&#x27;t have to keep cutting and cutting my hair?  I began searching for hair repair and revistalizing treatments because I was growing concerned about my age (young - late 20&#x27;s), how I treat my hair (barely at all - as in no hot tools, no blow drier or irons of any sort, with sporadic hair coloring to hide the gray hairs I&#x27;ve had since high school) and the amount of breakage, hair loss, etc. I was experiencing (a tremendous amount!)  I felt like I was beginning to lose more hair than average.  During and after showers or combing, I would be left with a giant hairball of my hair EVERY DAY.  My hair was always shiny, but it also had a significant number of split ends that made my hair look frizzy and uneven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried almost everything: [[ASIN:B008Q8XL2W Pantene Pro-V Beautiful Lengths Strengthening Shampoo 25.4 Fl Oz (packaging may vary)]] and [[ASIN:B003UI3M3G Pantene Pro-VÂ® Restore Beautiful Lengths Breakage Defense Conditioner 8.5 Fl Oz (Pack of 3)]], [[ASIN:B00201009I Suave Professionals Shampoo, Damage Care, For Weak or Damaged Hair, 12.6 Oz.]] and [[ASIN:B001P24SOQ Suave Professionals Damage Care Conditioner 12.6 fl oz (373 ml)]], [[ASIN:B00F52WZO2 L&#x27;Oreal Total Repair 5 Restoring Shampoo 12.6 fl oz, Restoring Conditioner 12.6 fl oz and Damage-Erasing Balm 8.5 fl oz (Set of 3)]], and more!  Nothing seemed to really work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe the noticeable results that I saw immediately, even after my first treatment.  My hair felt so much softer, and it looked like my split ends had LITERALLY VANISHED.  I thought I was imagining it and that it wasn&#x27;t possible to see results so quickly, but my familiy also commented about how much nicer my hair looked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product regularly now and my hair could not look better.  I am extremely happy to report that I am back to\\&quot;average\\&quot; hair loss - I lose literally only about 3-4 stands of hair a day between shower and combing now.  This is a SIGNIFICANT difference!  Not only do I lose less hair, but also my hair doesn&#x27;t get even a small tangle in it EVER anymore, so I don&#x27;t catch my comb on hairs and rip any more out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to use more of this product than is suggested.  They recommend about 2 pumps.  My hair is just past my shoulders and I use more than 2 pumps.  This is intended to be an overnight treatment, so usually your hair is dry when treated.  When my hair is dry and I treat it, I could use way too much of this product (like 4 or 5 pumps) because the creamy gel doesn&#x27;t really seem to spread well on dry hair, even if it is just the ends.  I have taken to treating my hair in the mornings after the shower and I use significantly less product (2 or 3 pumps).  The cream spreads a little better in the wet hair, and I feel that the results are as good as treating on dry hair.  The smell is pleasant, so it doesn&#x27;t bother me to go to work every day with the leave-in treatment on my hair (which you can&#x27;t really smell after it dies anyway), and it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t make my hair wet or oily.  This is the same for dry hair - dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t make your hair unpleasant, so if you do choose to treat your hair at night it shouldn&#x27;t bother you at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a week of treatment, there was not a split end in sight in my hair.  I am a regular user of this product now.  This is the healthiest and strongest my hair has ever been or looked.  I am SO pleased with this product and will use it for a very long time!</li>
            <li> love it this product! i bought 3 bottles already!</li>
            <li> This product works great. Have been using for several months now. I began using it because I roll my hair almost daily with hot rollers. Have fine hair and it would look sad if not styled daily. This is a nice deep condition which seems so far to protect the hair cuticle from heat damage.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my granddaughter because her hair (which is thick) seems to snarl and mat from sleeping.  We have been using various products since she was little (like no more tangles, etc) and they do not seem to do much except help with the detangling process which still takes a long time.  I thought this product would make the problem go away or at least make it manageable.  So far it has not helped that much and the detangling with this product after the fact still takes a ton of time.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have relatively thick long dark hair. When I first started using this, my side bangs were bleached. Because I was bleaching dark hair light, I had to do so once a week leading to serious breakage and brittleness. I ended up with all of those little flyaways that come from hair breaking into smaller and smaller pieces. The first time I put this stuff on, I had to use several pumps just for my bleached bangs - they were so dry, and this was soaked up in seconds. I&#x27;ve used it ever since (2 years) and it keeps my hair wonderfully soft and shiny. I no longer bleach, so my hair looks great. If I run out and forget to buy some for a few weeks, there is a noticeable difference in the texture of my hair.</li>
            <li> I am a hair product snob. I have spent $$$$$ on the best products available. I color my hair every 6 weeks, a blond foil, so I need to do all I can to keep the ends healthy. On a whim, I bought this product and was suprised and impressed by the texture of my hair the next morning. It was much like getting a Redken color gloss treatment, how it thickens the weak ends without weighing it down. I use this once a week at night on the ends of my hair, shampooing it out the next day. My hair always looks healthier afterwards and it does not dull the blond at all. Highly recommend the product. It is also nice that it is an overnight treatment bc you aren&#x27;t wasting your morning time with a deep conditioner or masque for the 10 minutes those require.</li>
            <li> This stuff is seriously amazing!!! I was going through a process of taking my hair from super red to blonde and my hair was just dying! It was so dry and fragile. I used this stuff just one night and the next morning was a dramatic difference!!!!! So much healthier!</li>
            <li> Awesome affordable product,it works for my thin fine hair. i love also the smell. Doesn&#x27;t feel sticky. BUY IT!!! :D</li>
            <li> I liked it.  The application is simple.  I could see evidence of a smoothing of the cuticle.  I just wish there was more of it in the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have dry, baby fine hair that is currently color treated. The highlights and color have made my flyaway hair even more so. I find I have to deep condition everytime I shampoo (every other day). My hair ends up being very soft and fluffy, but hard to style, as it doesn&#x27;t hold its shape. This product is great! My hair looks so much better, and it is well conditioned. It is much easier to style (I have a chin length layered bob), and doesn&#x27;t get greasy from this product (I have an oily scalp). I use it every night...2 pumps work well for me, and wake-up to full, conditioned hair. When I shampoo, my hair feels silky after the shampoo, and I don&#x27;t have to deep condition everytime...just regular conditioner. I use much less styling product, if any, and get great results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...I just ran out of this product, and went to 5 stores to find it. When I finally located it, I bought all 3 that were left in the store. I can&#x27;t do without it.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product. Like no other. I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it. NOTHING works on my coarse dry hair like this one. A few times I ran out, and boy, was the difference noticeable. Now I&#x27;m on a subscription on Amazon. Phew.</li>
            <li> Great product.  I was impressed.  My hair was so soft and manageable.  It felt and looked great.  I think it is a fantastic idea (the overnight part).</li>
            <li> I have a very bad history when it comes to hair. After a lot of researching and reading reviews on Amazon, i stumbled upon this product. After giving it a try, i honestly feel it is not as good as it seems to be. I have very thick and wavy Indian Hair. The night i applied this product, my hair felt very smooth and silky but in the morning it weighed down my hair real bad. The product build up made them look limp and matty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all the loreal salon products. And i have tried most of loreal drugstore ones. For some reason the drugstore ones have always disappointed me. I am giving it two stars only because i loved its smell and the initial smoothness it gave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product at the local drug store.  The price on Amazon is great.  I love the subscribe and save products.  I also like the fact that it really does work.  I use it every night before I go to bed.  It soaks it and doesn&#x27;t make your hair greasy or anything.  I have had three different people try it and they say that they can notice a difference after just one use.</li>
            <li> I have used this several times and do not see a result.  Save your money and don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
            <li> Not sure it really improves anything, but it does make your hair feel nice while it&#x27;s in use. Dries quickly too.</li>
            <li> I used it last night with no greasiness. put in 3 pumps and absorbed in my hair perfectly. It will only get yucky if you overdo it. My hair seemed thicker and fuller after washing the next morning.</li>
            <li> from one use, my hair feel incredibly smooth and silky. I have thin hair and I do notice a little extra strength from just one use.  If used on a regular basis, I could see it being great!</li>
            <li> When I had long(er) hair, I absolutely relied on this product! Other leave in conditioners have always either left my hair feeling greasy or crunchy, but this one truly absorbs into the hair. I used it at night and there was no residue on the pillow. I have incredibly fine, processed hair, so breakage and split-ends and frizziness are a huge issue for me. In conjunction with my other styling products, this gave me a gorgeous mane I could be proud of!</li>
            <li> I usually use Nexxus Pro-mend Overnight Treatment Creme, but since Target was out of stock one week I decided to go with this stuff.  Compared to Pro-mend, this stuff sucks.  I only used it once and I had to wash my hair twice just and it was still greasy and oily.  I will say, though, that it did feel like it repaired my split ends but Pro-mend still works better.&lt;br /&gt;I eventually gave the rest of the unused bottle to my sister in law and she now swears by it.  If you&#x27;re on the fence, buy this one as it is the cheaper of the two and if you like it and it doesnt leave your hair oily, then you&#x27;ve found the one.  If not, try the Nexxus Pro-mend, although more expensive - it really does work.</li>
            <li> I have always loved L&#x27;oreal because of how well my hair responds to it, and so when I tried this to see if it would help me grow my hair faster for my wedding, it was a fantastic idea! Worked like a charm, my hair shined right up, grew faster then ever and smelled fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;My hair looked great on my wedding day, and this little thing is *as far as I am concerned* the reason why.</li>
            <li> It is a joke...for me at least. Maybe different hair different type but the price is worth trying. It just did not work for me</li>
            <li> i started using l\\&quot;oreal about 6 months ago, as my hair was terrible ,it was dry and breaking off at the ends. would not grow so i purchased l\\&quot;oreal hair repair, when i was in the states, as i was getting desperate, i picked up a can and thought ,well i may as well try this,i tryied everything else. so after 6 months my hair was beautiful, it was soft,and shinny, and no more split ends, i was so happy with it, and seeing i live in canada,we don&#x27;t get it here, so i bought it over the pc, and i love it, would not even thing of trying something else, and it is great on colored hair also. great stuff l\\&quot;oreal you made me a happy camper,thank you very much.&lt;br /&gt;shirley evans</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it will do.  My hair feels and looks better.  My hair is fine and colored and this product helps ..</li>
            <li> I use as directed and I also use it during the day. I apply it on the ends of my hair when it&#x27;s wet. It works great for me.</li>
            <li> This product provides a &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; for my hair overnight.  The solution does not stain pillows but does leave my hair soft and healthier than before.  Not sure why L&#x27;Oreal Paris removed this product from store shelves, but I am thankful that I can still get this product through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Not what I expected . The couple of times I used it the next morning it was very dry on my ends not soft at all . The consistency is too wet should be more like a cream .</li>
            <li> I kinda bought this on a whim after reading how good reviews were on this product (not to mention the other product I bought first sucked). I have relaxed hair, and it gets seriously dry, dry to the point where I can barely run my fingers through my ends without breaking hair off. I use about a pump and a half and run it mainly on my ends and the rest through the length of my hair and my hair is instantly moisturized and soft and silky. I usually only use it at night when I ready my hair for bedtime, but now I use it whenever I style it and whatnot. The cream is thin but it doesn&#x27;t slosh over your hands like water. It is not thick at all. Since it&#x27;s thinner it absorbs into hair easily and it&#x27;s not greasy (it&#x27;s easy to use too much lol). Anyways it&#x27;s a great moisturizer and keeps my hair moisturized for days just from one use. The smell is fresh. but not being a big fan of fresh leaves and whatever I&#x27;m VERY pleased the smell fades. I think I just found my staple moisturizer :). It&#x27;s expensive in stores ($6-7) so I&#x27;d recommend you buy it here on Amazon. When I run low on the bottle I have now, I&#x27;m gonna buy two more from here c:</li>
            <li> I have never done a product review...I guess I&#x27;d never found a product I was passionate about.  This one is a first for me- I LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;I have waist length extremely thick wavy hair.  I needed something to help with my tangles and breakage.  I thought I would give this a try and now after 4 weeks of using nightly my hair is in the best shape it&#x27;s ever been in!  I don&#x27;t have to comb out my tangles for 20 minutes anymore in the mornings and my hair is soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Before using this product I would have to use lots of serums and gels to keep my hair from frizzing but now I can just wash and go.  When I run out of my current shampoo and conditioner I will give the rest of this product line a try.</li>
            <li> I was SO excited to use this. After reading all of the great reviews, I read the low star ones too, but thought there many more raving high star reviews. It sucks. I didn&#x27;t rate it 1 star because it didn&#x27;t damage or make my hair worse, but it did nothing to improve it. The 1-2 pumps is RIDICULOUS I have fairly long hair,it&#x27;s fine textured but I have ALOT or it. I want to say it took probably 10 pumps just to get it though most of my hair. 2 pumps would maybe work for a pixie cut. I didn&#x27;t think the smell was horrible, if it had worked, I wouldn&#x27;t have care what it smelled like, but I did notice the shaving creamish smell that some people mentioned. I do want to say if you have Psoriasis on your head, you may not want to use this. It did cause a breakout for me. It made my head itch almost from the moment I put it on, again, I would&#x27;ve dealt with this, if it had done something good for my hair. In all, this was a big flop. I noticed absolutely NO improvement. I&#x27;m glad it works for others and as it&#x27;s cheap I would say, give it a shot. But I wouldn&#x27;t set my hopes too high.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. It helps prevent hair breakage. I recommend this buying this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years now and I&#x27;m super happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice a significant difference after using this product. I would think that L&#x27;Oreal could produce much better products to use on your hair at home.</li>
            <li> Tried many, many products and keep coming back to this one.  Have seen my hair turn around overnight!  Highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> I had used a sample and really liked it a while back. I don&#x27;t know what the difference was, but I did not like how my hair would feel the next day after I washed it. It just felt kind of grimy and dirty. It did not feel stronger, shinier, softer, or more moisturized. I like a lot of the products in this line, but I won&#x27;t be buying this one again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, I have fine, thin hair that is color treated. A lot of hair products do not work with my hair; i.e., making it feel dirty and weighed down. It is entirely possible that someone with a different hair type would get better results with this.</li>
            <li> This is the only hair repair product I have found that actually works, and provides almost immediate results.  It is hard to find where I live so I have been pleased to put up a supply for &#x27;hair emergencies.&#x27;</li>
            <li> Amazing how you can put a lot on your hair, go to bed, and wake without anything on your pillow, but your hair softer and in better condition.</li>
            <li> I like how it smells and leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> I found it at Dollar Tree... wow.... I can&#x27;t believe it So far I love it hair is soft and shiny...No sulfates YAY! Same size too ..wow!</li>
            <li> I have very damaged hair and this product made my hair even worse. I wanted to return but I was too late. When I wake up in morning my hairs stick to each other. Nothing can be worse than that.</li>
            <li> Used to buy this at Wally World until they stopped carrying it.  It really makes my hair healthy.</li>
            <li> My hair is so messed up from flat iron that i doubt anything would work but this does nothing to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It smells okay but I thought it would do a better job.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased L&#x27;Oreal Everstrong at my local Dollar Tree for 1.00. Now I&#x27;m kicking myself for not buying more than one, bc this product works really well. I use to flat iron my hair everyday. I had major heat damage. I tried different products to keep from cutting my hair and this one worked the best for me. I usually apply 4 pumps to my hair every other night.  I think the directions say to apply 2 pumps every night. If you have long hair, you will probably need more than 2 pumps.</li>
            <li> Its perfect for dry scalp and it works great.</li>
            <li> After using the product after 10 minutes, you could feel/see how this product worked on my hair!!! That&#x27;s how amazing this product... I am in love with this product. Loreal should not change the ingredients... I have thin and damaged highlighted hair but now it looks healthy and thicker. What an amazing product!!!</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy/curly, dry hair. I use about 6-8 pumps of this on my hair the night before I&#x27;m going to wash it. It gets absorbed into my hair with no residue. After I wash it out the next day, my hair is much softer, has fewer tangles, and seems like there are fewer split ends. I use this product about once a fortnight.</li>
