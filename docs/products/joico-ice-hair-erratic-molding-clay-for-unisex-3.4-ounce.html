            <li>Good holding hair product!</li>
            <li>It maintains great hold and goes in clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a great hair product.  </li>
            <li>Nobody ever accused me of having great hair, but I did get some compliments on my hair style when using Joico Clay.</li>
            <li>Great product, medium hold and matte finish.  </li>
            <li>Great hold and pliable all day.</li>
            <li>Great for curly look.</li>
            <li>Two stars for excellent Amazon prime service, and for the fact that the product does do mostly what it claims to do, just with side effects that made it unusable for me.</li>
            <li>Strong hold, great smell!</li>
            <li>I got it on markdown from Amazon and have been very happy with the flexible but strong hold.</li>
            <li>Smells good, is not greasy, and keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li>Good on his word</li>
            <li>My hair looks great, feels great, and smells great thanks to this.</li>
            <li>I love this product!  </li>
            <li>I used Spiker for about two years, and I liked that hold.  </li>
            <li>best stuff on earth for short sexy hair!</li>
            <li>Gives some more volume, great hold and tad bit of shine, but never too much!  </li>
            <li>and I have tried many.</li>
            <li>Love the product.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re paying more for when you buy Erratic.</li>
            <li>Love this styling clay.</li>
            <li>Washes off well unlike many that you need to wash your hair many times to get the greasiness and stickiness out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years, and I can&#x27;t find any better substitute for it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>you will love how it molds your hair.</li>
            <li>Some products are too shiny, too much hold, too much clumping etc, but I find this stuff is perfect.</li>
            <li>But its okay, your worth it!</li>
            <li>It does not look greasy or oily and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li>but if you use it along with a strong holding spray, works perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hair will remain smooth after application&lt;</li>
            <li>Then brush it lightly.</li>
            <li>This clay is very strong, so you don&#x27;t need to use much.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried, &amp; my boyfriend loves the Joico spiker, so I&#x27;m definitely going to try more Joico products :-)</li>
            <li>I was looking for this product and it was so expensive, with this seller I was able to get two with an excellent price!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li>It gives you a strong hold with a nice, dry look.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight and fine</li>
            <li>With this you just need a little dab and you get a great hold.  </li>
            <li>Gives hair great volume, when you push your hair with the dried spiker, it just stays however you push it, and it looks thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>good but not much sticky.</li>
            <li>I have thin hair and this product definately gives you some more volume and great staying power.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li>my hair is super straight, i need to keep it kind of short around the ears</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s such a great add-on to my daily schedule.</li>
            <li>It styles my hair really well and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky!  </li>
            <li>I was so elated to be able to find it at Amazon after checking in all the local stores.</li>
            <li>I can take a nap with this product and when I wake up my hair is still pretty close to where I started in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Can do pretty much anything style-wise with your hair!</li>
            <li>I use a comb to spread it through my hair first.</li>
            <li>My hair stylist uses a blend of the clay and the Joico &amp;#34;glue,&amp;#34; and I finally have some texture and volume to my very fine, straight, very voluminous hair.</li>
            <li>and I use about 1-2 pea-sized drops for my whole head.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t not have much holding power</li>
            <li>I really like this hair product.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have as much holding power as ICE spiker if your hair is longer than 2 or 3 inches and trying to get volume.</li>
            <li>, so I always liked how the Spiker looked after it fully dried</li>
            <li>The other thing I love about this hair product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy like so many other products.</li>
            <li>It REALLY works; even in high humidity, this product keeps hair under control.</li>
            <li>if you have used any Joico products before, you know that they have consistently high quality and are reliable.  </li>
            <li>The recipient is a lot better here because it does not get dry for the entire period of use.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years and now order it online because I can&#x27;t find it where I live.  </li>
            <li>Does not look gelled at any point, and gives that same high volume, messy hair look as Spiker at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, maybe higher priced than other clays with similar performance, but</li>
            <li>And it takes hours to fully dry, even if applied to only lightly damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Look // A refined, natural appearance.  </li>
            <li>Availability // Won&#x27;t find this in most salons (at least in Oklahoma).  </li>
            <li>This worked well for my short hair and would recommend it, but one tiny issue is that it may run out fast if it is shared.</li>
            <li>You can also, after short dry time, break up and seperate the hair a little more for added volume.</li>
            <li>the bottle is small but it&#x27;s so strong that one bottle will probably last a year.  </li>
            <li>It is the only product that works wonders for my fine thin hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I have very choppy short hair and this stuff really does it for me!</li>
            <li> Although I have thick hair that can take a beating, this stuff is very strong and hard to wash out, and made my hair feel damaged and dry.  </li>
            <li> My hair is about 2 inches long</li>
            <li> Application // Goes in dry without a fuss</li>
            <li> problem I had with Spiker was that, immediately after applying, it makes you&#x27;re hair look gelled, and you have to let it dry before you can touch your hair again.  </li>
            <li> My stylist in Atlanta used this after cutting my hair, and you won&#x27;t be able to find it in any ulta or any other hair products store.  </li>
            <li> Only need a little dab each day.</li>
            <li> This small tube lasts forever as you&#x27;ll only need a tiny amount each time, and its good all the way to the bottom (doesn&#x27;t get nasty as its almost all out of the tube).</li>
            <li> Not too firm but firm enough to hold your hair into place and allows you to style your hair</li>
            <li> You need to dry your hair a little with mousse or whatever and when the hair is damp apply a little of this and work it thru your hair and continue drying.</li>
            <li> A worlds difference if you previously used a spiking product or hair glue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it on dry hair as it is a little thick</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A little dab will do you\\</li>
            <li> prefer the messy hair look anyways</li>
            <li> but I use this everyday and it lasts for months.</li>
            <li> You can buy it in a few salons, but at a premium price.  </li>
            <li> so it sticks out, this is the first product to keep it down without looking like crap, this stiff is almost invisible unlike other product</li>
            <li> I use pantene \\&quot;thin to thick\\&quot; shampoo, blow dry, apply erratic and sculpt.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair and have tried all types of gels.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and this product gives it volume without  a sticky effect like from gels.</li>
            <li> Sucks to pay $15 :(  </li>
            <li> It gives you this matte/dry hair look, and not the ugly shiny/oily look for the hair.</li>
            <li> Everything else is crap compared to this....</li>
    </ol>

            <li> my hair is super straight, i need to keep it kind of short around the ears so it sticks out, this is the first product to keep it down without looking like crap, this stiff is almost invisible unlike other product</li>
            <li> It is the only product that works wonders for my fine thin hair and I have tried many.</li>
            <li> Strong hold, great smell! Love the product. I use this practically every day and it&#x27;s such a great add-on to my daily schedule. My hair looks great, feels great, and smells great thanks to this.</li>
            <li> It REALLY works; even in high humidity, this product keeps hair under control. It does not look greasy or oily and brushes out easily.</li>
            <li> Best hair product that I&#x27;ve ever used. I have thin hair and have tried all types of gels. With a pea size amount of gel, my hair stays in place all day. My hair looks fuller too.</li>
            <li> I used Spiker for about two years, and I liked that hold.  If you haven&#x27;t used either product, start with Spiker, you&#x27;ll probably like it.&lt;br /&gt;The problem I had with Spiker was that, immediately after applying, it makes you&#x27;re hair look gelled, and you have to let it dry before you can touch your hair again.  And it takes hours to fully dry, even if applied to only lightly damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the messy hair look anyways, so I always liked how the Spiker looked after it fully dried and I could touch my hair and pull on it, as I do when I&#x27;m thinking and working.  Gives hair great volume, when you push your hair with the dried spiker, it just stays however you push it, and it looks thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that final stage of the Spiker look is what you want, then buy Erratic.  This clay is very strong, so you don&#x27;t need to use much.  My hair is about 2 inches long and I use about 1-2 pea-sized drops for my whole head.  the bottle is small but it&#x27;s so strong that one bottle will probably last a year.  Does not look gelled at any point, and gives that same high volume, messy hair look as Spiker at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, great product, maybe higher priced than other clays with similar performance, but if you have used any Joico products before, you know that they have consistently high quality and are reliable.  That&#x27;s what you&#x27;re paying more for when you buy Erratic.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  It styles my hair really well and isn&#x27;t greasy or sticky!  I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have used just about every product out there for spiking my short hair. This is the only one that will give me the results I want and keep my hair spikey all day. The other thing I love about this hair product is that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair look greasy like so many other products. I was so elated to be able to find it at Amazon after checking in all the local stores. I will be buying this again. 3.4 oz may not sound like much but I use this everyday and it lasts for months. Only need a little dab each day.</li>
            <li> good but not much sticky.</li>
            <li> Received as and when promised</li>
            <li> Love this styling clay.</li>
            <li> Holds your styling well and can be reshaped. Washes off well unlike many that you need to wash your hair many times to get the greasiness and stickiness out. If you tried it once, you will know this one is the best you would ever use.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair product.  Switched to this from American Crew products after trying at my local barbershop.  Smells good, is not greasy, and keeps hair in place.</li>
            <li> I got it on markdown from Amazon and have been very happy with the flexible but strong hold. I have very choppy short hair and this stuff really does it for me!</li>
            <li> I was looking for this product and it was so expensive, with this seller I was able to get two with an excellent price!</li>

It gives you this matte/dry hair look, and not the ugly shiny/oily look for the hair. It doesn&#x27;t not have much holding power but if you use it along with a strong holding spray, works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product, give it a try.</li>
            <li> Very good quality hair gel.  Not too firm but firm enough to hold your hair into place and allows you to style your hair</li>
            <li> Best hair product out there for all hair lengths. It gives you a strong hold with a nice, dry look.</li>
            <li> Good holding hair product!</li>
            <li> best stuff on earth for short sexy hair!</li>
            <li> While this product did show texture with a matte appearance, which is what I was looking for, I found it too rought and drying on my hair.  Although I have thick hair that can take a beating, this stuff is very strong and hard to wash out, and made my hair feel damaged and dry.  Although my biggest problem was that it was flaking.  It was constantly showing dandruff-looking flakes when I would try to brush and style using it.  Two stars for excellent Amazon prime service, and for the fact that the product does do mostly what it claims to do, just with side effects that made it unusable for me.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Works as advertised. Very fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and delivered quickly.</li>
            <li> It took a while. But what can you say about ups. Good on his word</li>
            <li> Nobody ever accused me of having great hair, but I did get some compliments on my hair style when using Joico Clay. My hair stylist uses a blend of the clay and the Joico &amp;#34;glue,&amp;#34; and I finally have some texture and volume to my very fine, straight, very voluminous hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin and this product gives it volume without  a sticky effect like from gels. I also used OSIS from Schwarzkopf which is a similar product. The recipient is a lot better here because it does not get dry for the entire period of use.  One tube is enough for almost 1 year.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about 2-3 years. I have thin hair and this product definately gives you some more volume and great staying power. Some products are too shiny, too much hold, too much clumping etc, but I find this stuff is perfect. I use pantene \\&quot;thin to thick\\&quot; shampoo, blow dry, apply erratic and sculpt. Then I apply some volumizing hair spray as the final touch. Gives some more volume, great hold and tad bit of shine, but never too much!  I can take a nap with this product and when I wake up my hair is still pretty close to where I started in the morning.  You can also, after short dry time, break up and seperate the hair a little more for added volume. If you&#x27;ve tried everything else and still are unsatisfied.......give ERRATIC A SHOT!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I couldn&#x27;t find the erratic in all the salons and in every hair supply stores in the valley. Everything else is crap compared to this....it works wonders.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and now order it online because I can&#x27;t find it where I live.  Great product, medium hold and matte finish.  Even my friends have bought it after they tried some of mine.</li>
            <li> My stylist in Atlanta used this after cutting my hair, and you won&#x27;t be able to find it in any ulta or any other hair products store.  You can buy it in a few salons, but at a premium price.  This small tube lasts forever as you&#x27;ll only need a tiny amount each time, and its good all the way to the bottom (doesn&#x27;t get nasty as its almost all out of the tube). Great value too!  Doesn&#x27;t leave your hair looking shiny and spiky either, it styles without looking like you&#x27;ve got a ton of gel in your hair.  Can do pretty much anything style-wise with your hair!</li>
            <li> Best product on the market. Works like nothing else. Great hold and pliable all day.</li>
            <li> I really like this hair product. My hair is straight and fine it gives it a lift.  I use it on dry hair as it is a little thick I use a comb to spread it through my hair first. Then brush it lightly.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have as much holding power as ICE spiker if your hair is longer than 2 or 3 inches and trying to get volume. The application is drier than ICE as well. I tend to use both for texture and hold, without the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; or oily look.</li>
            <li> Greasy and took a while longer than Prime to come.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried, &amp; my boyfriend loves the Joico spiker, so I&#x27;m definitely going to try more Joico products :-)</li>
            <li> With this you just need a little dab and you get a great hold.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This worked well for my short hair and would recommend it, but one tiny issue is that it may run out fast if it is shared.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;A little dab will do you\\&quot; This is the best mudd for drying your hair. you will love how it molds your hair.You need to dry your hair a little with mousse or whatever and when the hair is damp apply a little of this and work it thru your hair and continue drying. Great for curly look. I just love it!!!</li>
