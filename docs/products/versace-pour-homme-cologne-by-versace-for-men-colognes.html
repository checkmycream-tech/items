            <li> The item came late. This was supposed to be a Birthday present and did not need it after certain date. They were not cooperative and also their price was one of the highest. I would never deal with this store anymore and would let other  people know.</li>
            <li> This was bought as a gift for a younger male friend and was very well received. The scent is nice: Classic and very masculine without being over-bearing. It smells great and the price was much better for the 1.7 oz than other places (currently $58 for that size from Sephora). I smelled it and wanted to keep it for myself!</li>
            <li> Long lasting scent, and I have been complimented every time I wear it. It&#x27;s probably more for evening use, but anytime is fine, year-round as well. The best buy I&#x27;ve had in awhile.</li>
            <li> Smells great and the bottle looks good.  I bought this as a gift and they loved it.  Most of the time i smell them with it on.</li>
            <li> Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;One of my new favorites</li>
            <li> Smells so good. A clean soapy smell. My fav cologne for men:)</li>
            <li> The product is as expected&lt;br /&gt;This item is OK, I like it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to everybody&lt;br /&gt;This product is good quality</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought Vesace Pour Homme direcly from the Versace store and still have a little left so I am able to compare side by side to my order from Amazon.  There is no difference in quality. It is exactly the same because it is genuine. I am very pleased with my purchase and can confirm that the scent lasts all day. The ultimate test to it being the genuine fragrance and it&#x27;s longevity is a significant other, to which it definitely passes.</li>
            <li> PRODUCT HAD NO SCENT OR FRAGRANCE! I gave the cologne as a gift, the person I gave it to said it had no fragrance and gave it back to return. Imagine the embarrassment! When I smelled it I agreed \\&quot;NO SCENT/FRAGRANCE\\&quot;! I returned the product according to the terms and conditions of the seller and my claim was denied because \\&quot;Product must be in 100% sell-able condition, unused and unopened\\&quot;! How in the heck would you know it had no scent/fragrance if it was NOT opened! Really SAMS ONLINE! Come on! Horrible Return Policy! That term deems it impossible to return most items and all gift items!  I guess that is their goal....</li>
            <li> I love this clean and attractive scent. Get&#x27;s lots of compliments. It&#x27;s my mans favorite scent. It&#x27;s a keeper. :)</li>
            <li> Smells great, love it</li>
            <li> I was pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> I saw this in a department store for almost twice the price! Got a chance to smell it there  then ordered it on amazon smells great! Husband likes it too not too strong of a scent not over powering just right!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance on my husband. It&#x27;s not overbearing. The price was not outrageous. I bought him a sampled size first, he liked it, so I bought this larger size.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this cologne and my husband does, too (it was a gift for him).  Fresh smelling, not overwhelmingly sweet like some men&#x27;s colognes out there these days.  A good, all-around scent for daytime or evening.</li>
            <li> Husband adores this scent, and gets copious compliments when he wears it. It has gotten to the point it&#x27;s about the only thing he wears now - so, I bought him two bottles for Christmas, and a relative bought him another. He&#x27;s set for a while.</li>
            <li> Can never go wrong with this Versace scent..good price too much cheaper than sephora</li>
