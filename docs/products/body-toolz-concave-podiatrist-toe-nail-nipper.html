            <li>, I&#x27;m very happy and they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Nice weight, good quality.</li>
            <li>I have owned body Toolz straight cutters (8098) and was very happy with them  and as a result I decided to buy the concave version assuming they would be as good.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t go 5 stars, because I have seen more precise tools, but this appeared to be the best value.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>It does quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>if you do your own pedicures.</li>
            <li>Nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li>reasonably effective nail trimmers</li>
            <li>Handy toe nail cutter.</li>
            <li>Honestly scared to use them.</li>
            <li>and I cut both my toe nails and my wifes very easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would have been nice if the handles were coated with something for easy gripping, but as a whole&lt;br /&gt;they are good.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job compared to my old toe nail clipper.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my toenails are gnarly and gross because of some kind of foot fungus, and they work great!</li>
            <li>I am well pleased.</li>
            <li>Okay, I must say that I ordered these</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this item.</li>
            <li>and more.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I even tried it upside down--no better, of course.  </li>
            <li>Just love how even fungus infected toenails are able to be cut with this Nipper, and it prevents ingrown nails.</li>
            <li>This tool will work better if used after a shower or foot soak to soften nails.....</li>
            <li>looks like amazon sent me the 8098 model which is better....</li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>/&gt;Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Much better than sissors or a nail clipper.</li>
            <li>it works a lot better than just picking at your toenails,  </li>
            <li>it works quite cleanly, much better that</li>
            <li>I was not expecting the good quality and smooth, clean, efficient design of this tool.</li>
            <li>Overall they have a feel of good quality and have good weight to them</li>
            <li>This position is more comfortable and gives more strength.</li>
            <li>Overall good product, good price</li>
            <li>As good as it is , though , I still have to use my &#x27;moto-tool&#x27; for certain problems .</li>
            <li>Good quality stainless steel products.  </li>
            <li>This is the perfect solution to prodding and picking with other tools to aleviate the pain.</li>
            <li>This clipper could easily cut through your skin, so you do not want to use it if you are diabetic.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>; I couldn&#x27;t use this easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle.</li>
            <li>They are easy to use</li>
            <li>The clippers do not retrace easily and stick quite often.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have a strong grip.</li>
            <li>This tool is strong and stands up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li>This baby cuts well, easily and accurately.</li>
            <li>Someone commented that the leverage leaves something to be desired, but I find them fine.  </li>
            <li>They let me get under the nail and the head tappers off to a fine point for precision work.</li>
            <li>It still works just fine, but I would like it to be sharper.</li>
            <li>overall, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li>The tip is precise but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit it under the toe nail to find a way to clip the nail.  </li>
            <li>The cut is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>These clippers have a great angle and are sharp and strong.  </li>
            <li>not what I want when I have a toenail I need cleanly clipped.....</li>
            <li>Looks like they didn&#x27;t even bother to clean the parts before assembly.</li>
            <li>Hence the tool is blunt and does not cut cleanly.  </li>
            <li>They cut cleanly without snagging the nail</li>
            <li>These clippers would probably do well for more normal toenails, but without being too detailed, my nails are tougher.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make full contact when trimming.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to find they were very well made.  </li>
            <li>Now this one is exceptional and uses some of the same footage but it doesn not have the desert rave scenes and others that is under ANOTHER Timescapes title.  </li>
            <li>More leverage than you get with normal clippers.    </li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Nice clean cuts making my really tough toe nails yield easily to a more fitting</li>
            <li>retractable feature is simple and effective.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s well worth the price.....</li>
            <li>Go gently, and soak the nails first to make it really easy.  </li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s the right word for a foot doctor.</li>
            <li>The long handles are much more comfortable and put the curve of the handles at the heel of my hand.</li>
            <li>good for cow nail.  </li>
            <li>Cuts very straight.</li>
            <li>It is large and powerful.</li>
            <li>As an aside this is the first item I have purchased that had no label on it including where it was made.</li>
            <li>and they would not cut or even trim my toe nail; my regular toe nail clippers cut way better.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it for anything.</li>
            <li>This is a quality tool, it&#x27;s well made, and clearly in a differnt league than any of the cheap stuff you will find in the band-aid isle at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li>I am an inventor, I have to have top quality in my design for proper working</li>
            <li>I am not pleased and would not advise anyone to get it as I got a different one and it works PERFECTLY!!!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>;- )</li>
            <li>It has a nice look and it is sharp.  </li>
            <li>Buying a second one as my mother used it, loved it, hence she&#x27;s getting a present.</li>
            <li>OK, the price is right and shipping is not much if anything.</li>
            <li>The spring action makes them very easy to use - easier than conventional style, and they cut clean.</li>
            <li>I had hoped to get cutters strong enough for my toenails.  </li>
            <li>the large size is also helpful.</li>
            <li>These clippers are great, I bought them to use on my mom whose toe nails had gotten very thick.  </li>
            <li>My thanks to the makers.</li>
            <li>Before buying, it looked like the blade was straight in line with the handles, like wire cutters.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOE NAIL CLIPPER!</li>
            <li>These things don&#x27;t really cut so much as they tear.</li>
            <li>This nipper appears to be very well made.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Very well made.</li>
            <li>Really like these clippers.</li>
            <li>They are very pointed and are almost lethal, but they can get into the sides of your toe nails and remove the causes of ingrown toenails with ease.  </li>
            <li>I was really hoping to have a precision instrument and this is anything but.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>These nippers work really well.  </li>
            <li>Amazon was very helpful in getting a refund for which I am thankful.</li>
            <li>Very well designed for the price .</li>
            <li>If Medicare continues to cover me and I find a podiatrist willing to take me on in my new city, I will leave foot care up to a doctor instead of myself.  </li>
            <li>These nail cutters are good and sharp the only problem I find is that you can&#x27;t lock them.  </li>
            <li>I would need a sharp one to be able to use it.</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly and springs open by itself.</li>
            <li>It takes an enormous amount of force to close these so that the blades connect and make a clean cut.</li>
            <li>I eventually threw them away, because they were no more effective or easier to use than the clippers that I used before, and because I was worried about injuring myself, or having a pet or family member accidentally come into contact with them and get cut.</li>
            <li>Several squeezes may be needed in order to make a full cut.</li>
            <li>After saturating the joint with white lithium spray, repeatedly operating, and wiping up all the crud that came out, the nippers actually worked very smoothly.</li>
            <li>Good for those with arthritis who have trouble holding traditional toenail clippers.</li>
            <li>There is a slight learning curve to using these clippers, after using the conventional style, but they work great.  </li>
            <li>which is better for tight spots ,IMO.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li>They are able to get into tight spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this nipper.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>They do what they are supposed to do, but don&#x27;t expect a highly refined product.</li>
            <li>They are high quality and sturdy.  </li>
            <li>They cut nice with sharp blades, but the handles are a bit short.</li>
            <li>had they had a little longer handle for more torque,  </li>
            <li>Yet the tip of the blades was kind of bulky which made it hard to get into the sides of the nails and</li>
            <li>I was able to get between the nail and nail bed easily and they clipped my extra thick nails with no trouble at all!  </li>
            <li>Also there was a rough edge on the \\&quot;nipper\\&quot; that needs to be filed smooth.</li>
            <li>Attempted to reprofile the edge with a bench grind, but it appears you would need something like a 2.5 inch wheel (if such a thing exists) rather than a 6 inch wheel to get the right curvature.</li>
            <li>but it is a machined pressed fitting and not easily done at home</li>
            <li>These toenail cippers are great.&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li>I lost it and decided to buy a new one</li>
            <li>Now that I received this new on</li>
            <li>The product is very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The stainless steel is finished nicely, and the sharp cutting edge is a nice curved shape to help with accessing all of the toenail.</li>
            <li>These toenail clippers work great, are sharp and do not require a lot of force to clip my thick toenails.</li>
            <li>The only thing negative is that I cannot cut as good as the technician in my old podiatrist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li>They are pretty big though...</li>
            <li>Comes with a little case that makes it easy to store and find.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong little tool.</li>
            <li>They are good and sharp and were wide enough to go over the nail</li>
            <li>I ordered this hoping for the best, the bottom line is the very tip of the clippers close tightly, but the rest of the clipper tends to tear rather than clip, I can see daylight thru the blades without my glasses when the clippers are held in the cutting position....</li>
            <li>I am left handed and find most clippers and scissors hard to use, but this one works fine with minimal contortions of my body.</li>
            <li>good item; a little longer in the handles would be helpful for those of us who have trouble with this task.</li>
            <li>I would buy another brand and not waste my money again on this one...</li>
            <li>The offset angle of the cutter head and the way the cutter head knife edge tapers from only one side shows that much thought went into the design of this tool .&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more heavy duty, and will probably last forever.  </li>
            <li>the cutter face is level (same plane) with the handle, the back side is re-leaved at a 45 degree angle for clearance and does NO cutting whatsoever.</li>
            <li>These are good to cut about anything but the angle of the nippers is wrong.  </li>
            <li>I mean THICK toenails,  The clippers worked pretty good,  </li>
            <li>I also thought my weak, old, arthritic hands would not be able to turn at an angle to cut.</li>
            <li>The middle brace pieces occasionally can need some fiddling with, but not too much.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not sharp</li>
            <li>I ordered this product to trim a very thick nail that was damaged many decades ago.</li>
            <li>Great for getting ingrown toe nails and all those small places that are tough to get.  </li>
            <li>I think there may be some just as good for a buck or two cheaper, but if you can&#x27;t see it and hold it before you buy it (like at a sally&#x27;s) then why risk saving a buck or two and be unhappy.  </li>
            <li>This toenail clipper is well constructed, sharp, and works well with large fingernails.</li>
            <li>Heavy, dosent cut right</li>
            <li>When you use it, be gentle when inserting under the lifted nail, as the front points of the blades are really sharp.</li>
            <li>You can squeeze as hard as you can, and there is no cutting action to the blade.</li>
            <li>I would recommend buying these clippers,and they are useful and sturdy!Especially for hard nails,it&#x27;s definitely a professional nipper.thankyou.</li>
            <li>The very tip is also quite sharp, and while I was lucky enough not to poke my feet or toes with it, I did manage to jab my fingers a few times, once gouging my thumb deeply enough to make it bleed.</li>
            <li>PODIATRIST TOE NAIL CLIPPER IS VERY WELL MADE &amp; VERY  SHARP.</li>

            <li> They are easy to use</li>
            <li> The clippers do not retrace easily and stick quite often.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have a strong grip.</li>
            <li> This tool is strong and stands up to it&#x27;s claim.</li>
            <li> This baby cuts well, easily and accurately.</li>
            <li> Someone commented that the leverage leaves something to be desired, but I find them fine.  </li>
            <li> They let me get under the nail and the head tappers off to a fine point for precision work.</li>
            <li> It still works just fine, but I would like it to be sharper.</li>
            <li> overall, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> The tip is precise but that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t fit it under the toe nail to find a way to clip the nail.  </li>
            <li> The cut is clean and smooth.</li>
            <li> These clippers have a great angle and are sharp and strong.  </li>
            <li> not what I want when I have a toenail I need cleanly clipped.....</li>
            <li> Looks like they didn&#x27;t even bother to clean the parts before assembly.</li>
            <li> Hence the tool is blunt and does not cut cleanly.  </li>
            <li> They cut cleanly without snagging the nail</li>
            <li> These clippers would probably do well for more normal toenails, but without being too detailed, my nails are tougher.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make full contact when trimming.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to find they were very well made.  </li>
            <li> Now this one is exceptional and uses some of the same footage but it doesn not have the desert rave scenes and others that is under ANOTHER Timescapes title.  </li>
            <li> More leverage than you get with normal clippers.    </li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> Nice clean cuts making my really tough toe nails yield easily to a more fitting</li>
            <li> retractable feature is simple and effective.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s well worth the price.....</li>
            <li> Go gently, and soak the nails first to make it really easy.  </li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s the right word for a foot doctor.</li>
            <li> The long handles are much more comfortable and put the curve of the handles at the heel of my hand.</li>
            <li> good for cow nail.  </li>
            <li> Cuts very straight.</li>
            <li> It is large and powerful.</li>
            <li> As an aside this is the first item I have purchased that had no label on it including where it was made.</li>
            <li> and they would not cut or even trim my toe nail; my regular toe nail clippers cut way better.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it for anything.</li>
            <li> This is a quality tool, it&#x27;s well made, and clearly in a differnt league than any of the cheap stuff you will find in the band-aid isle at the grocery store.  </li>
            <li> I am an inventor, I have to have top quality in my design for proper working</li>
            <li> I am not pleased and would not advise anyone to get it as I got a different one and it works PERFECTLY!!!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> ;- )</li>
            <li> It has a nice look and it is sharp.  </li>
            <li> Buying a second one as my mother used it, loved it, hence she&#x27;s getting a present.</li>
            <li> OK, the price is right and shipping is not much if anything.</li>
            <li> The spring action makes them very easy to use - easier than conventional style, and they cut clean.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to get cutters strong enough for my toenails.  </li>
            <li> the large size is also helpful.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great, I bought them to use on my mom whose toe nails had gotten very thick.  </li>
            <li> My thanks to the makers.</li>
            <li> Before buying, it looked like the blade was straight in line with the handles, like wire cutters.  </li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOE NAIL CLIPPER!</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t really cut so much as they tear.</li>
            <li> This nipper appears to be very well made.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Very well made.</li>
            <li> Really like these clippers.</li>
            <li> They are very pointed and are almost lethal, but they can get into the sides of your toe nails and remove the causes of ingrown toenails with ease.  </li>
            <li> I was really hoping to have a precision instrument and this is anything but.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> These nippers work really well.  </li>
            <li> Amazon was very helpful in getting a refund for which I am thankful.</li>
            <li> Very well designed for the price .</li>
            <li> If Medicare continues to cover me and I find a podiatrist willing to take me on in my new city, I will leave foot care up to a doctor instead of myself.  </li>
            <li> These nail cutters are good and sharp the only problem I find is that you can&#x27;t lock them.  </li>
            <li> I would need a sharp one to be able to use it.</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly and springs open by itself.</li>
            <li> It takes an enormous amount of force to close these so that the blades connect and make a clean cut.</li>
            <li> I eventually threw them away, because they were no more effective or easier to use than the clippers that I used before, and because I was worried about injuring myself, or having a pet or family member accidentally come into contact with them and get cut.</li>
            <li> Several squeezes may be needed in order to make a full cut.</li>
            <li> After saturating the joint with white lithium spray, repeatedly operating, and wiping up all the crud that came out, the nippers actually worked very smoothly.</li>
            <li> Good for those with arthritis who have trouble holding traditional toenail clippers.</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve to using these clippers, after using the conventional style, but they work great.  </li>
            <li> which is better for tight spots ,IMO.&lt;br /&gt;  </li>
            <li> They are able to get into tight spaces.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this nipper.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do, but don&#x27;t expect a highly refined product.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and sturdy.  </li>
            <li> They cut nice with sharp blades, but the handles are a bit short.</li>
            <li> had they had a little longer handle for more torque,  </li>
            <li> Yet the tip of the blades was kind of bulky which made it hard to get into the sides of the nails and</li>
            <li> I was able to get between the nail and nail bed easily and they clipped my extra thick nails with no trouble at all!  </li>
            <li> Also there was a rough edge on the \\&quot;nipper\\&quot; that needs to be filed smooth.</li>
            <li> Attempted to reprofile the edge with a bench grind, but it appears you would need something like a 2.5 inch wheel (if such a thing exists) rather than a 6 inch wheel to get the right curvature.</li>
            <li> but it is a machined pressed fitting and not easily done at home</li>
            <li> These toenail cippers are great.&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp and accurate.</li>
            <li> I lost it and decided to buy a new one</li>
            <li> Now that I received this new on</li>
            <li> The product is very sharp and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The stainless steel is finished nicely, and the sharp cutting edge is a nice curved shape to help with accessing all of the toenail.</li>
            <li> These toenail clippers work great, are sharp and do not require a lot of force to clip my thick toenails.</li>
            <li> The only thing negative is that I cannot cut as good as the technician in my old podiatrist&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> They are pretty big though...</li>
            <li> Comes with a little case that makes it easy to store and find.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strong little tool.</li>
            <li> They are good and sharp and were wide enough to go over the nail</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping for the best, the bottom line is the very tip of the clippers close tightly, but the rest of the clipper tends to tear rather than clip, I can see daylight thru the blades without my glasses when the clippers are held in the cutting position....</li>
            <li> I am left handed and find most clippers and scissors hard to use, but this one works fine with minimal contortions of my body.</li>
            <li> good item; a little longer in the handles would be helpful for those of us who have trouble with this task.</li>
            <li> I would buy another brand and not waste my money again on this one...</li>
            <li> The offset angle of the cutter head and the way the cutter head knife edge tapers from only one side shows that much thought went into the design of this tool .&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more heavy duty, and will probably last forever.  </li>
            <li> the cutter face is level (same plane) with the handle, the back side is re-leaved at a 45 degree angle for clearance and does NO cutting whatsoever.</li>
            <li> These are good to cut about anything but the angle of the nippers is wrong.  </li>
            <li> I mean THICK toenails,  The clippers worked pretty good,  </li>
            <li> I also thought my weak, old, arthritic hands would not be able to turn at an angle to cut.</li>
            <li> The middle brace pieces occasionally can need some fiddling with, but not too much.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not sharp</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to trim a very thick nail that was damaged many decades ago.</li>
            <li> Great for getting ingrown toe nails and all those small places that are tough to get.  </li>
            <li> I think there may be some just as good for a buck or two cheaper, but if you can&#x27;t see it and hold it before you buy it (like at a sally&#x27;s) then why risk saving a buck or two and be unhappy.  </li>
            <li> This toenail clipper is well constructed, sharp, and works well with large fingernails.</li>
            <li> Heavy, dosent cut right</li>
            <li> When you use it, be gentle when inserting under the lifted nail, as the front points of the blades are really sharp.</li>
            <li> You can squeeze as hard as you can, and there is no cutting action to the blade.</li>
            <li> I would recommend buying these clippers,and they are useful and sturdy!Especially for hard nails,it&#x27;s definitely a professional nipper.thankyou.</li>
            <li> The very tip is also quite sharp, and while I was lucky enough not to poke my feet or toes with it, I did manage to jab my fingers a few times, once gouging my thumb deeply enough to make it bleed.</li>
            <li> PODIATRIST TOE NAIL CLIPPER IS VERY WELL MADE &amp; VERY  SHARP.</li>
            <li> I have never had such dull cutters in my life, just got them and tried to cut my toe nails, it tore up my first nail I tried to cut and cut into my toe until it bled.</li>
            <li> No more infections for me, this toe nail nipper is sharp, easy to use and does the job it is supposed to do extremely well.</li>
            <li> I suffer from ingrown toe nails and am not nearly diligent enough in keeping them trimmed.</li>
            <li> I expect the clipper to last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the first pair of toe nail clippers that could tackle my thick caveman looking toe nails.</li>
            <li> They are sharp enough to cut through tough nails and are comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> Cutting surface much too small, It would be better if the blade was curved like a regular toe</li>
            <li> Though marked the same as previous one purchased,  much duller, bulkier, less manoeuverable, than previous.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I wished was for a claspt to keep them closed, when resting open, sparp and pointy parts are exposed that might cause injury.</li>
            <li> I have a couple of epic nails that normal clippers could not get under OR around, as they are very very thick.  </li>
            <li> These jaws open wide and get under nails well.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s not at sharp as I would like it to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of solid stainless steel construction, very sharp, I have extremely thick nails and these cut them like butter.</li>
            <li> Such an improvement over the conventional 2 dollar ones we all have.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend however, keeping it out of the reach of children because of the obvious reasons (extreme sharpness) and children are so curious.</li>
            <li> It feels solid and the blade is very sharp.</li>
            <li> So when I need a little help getting under the nail it was always a struggle with traditional clipper or scissors.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as well as expected.  </li>
            <li> Have to be careful about putting my hands in where I have these, so as not to cut or stick a finger.</li>
            <li> Solid, heavy duty clippers.</li>
            <li> It cut right through my hard, thick nails</li>
            <li> They are so sharp you must be careful when using.</li>
            <li> It also is not all that sharp.</li>
            <li> I will try and grind the faces myself to get a sharp edge</li>
            <li> This tool is very sharp and  you have to be careful not to cut yourself with the tapered point.</li>
            <li> THAT WORK BETTER,  NOT THRILLED WITH CUTTING ABILITY</li>
            <li> Very flimsy construction - the flexors come apart constantly and the blades are awkwardly angled.</li>
            <li> Bought it for some toenails that were starting to ingrow, and it has slowly helped correct that.</li>
            <li> Very sharp</li>
            <li> They are very sharp.  </li>
            <li> Use it very carefully do you don&#x27;t accidentally cut ourself!</li>
            <li> I would buy this again as you can&#x27;t beat it for less than $9.00 .&lt;br</li>
            <li> All said , this is the sharpest tool I have used for getting into tight spots.....</li>
            <li> The handles could be a little longer</li>
            <li> This nipper is too thick to cut well, it is dull and is not made properly.    </li>
            <li> This pair of clippers was much smaller than expected making it difficult to use on toenails.</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money look for another brand</li>
            <li> I loaded a few pix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> , heavy, well made.</li>
            <li> SAME AS OTHER REVIEWS, THIS PRODUCT IS VERY HARD TO USE IF YOU HAVE ANY REMOTELY THICK NAIL.</li>
            <li> When cutting it is more like bluntly cutting than using the sharpness of the edges to cut so it leaves a gnarled</li>
            <li> It is also a little small and hard to use.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m well past the return window.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping this is just one clipper that was defective and just happened to get past quality control.</li>
            <li> Granted, I have small hands, but I don&#x27;t think that was the issue.</li>
            <li> because it was too big, I had to hold it at a weird angle.</li>
            <li> It will cut some heavy duty thick toe nails with no problems.</li>
            <li> or maybe I just have small feet</li>
            <li> So, if ordinary clippers are used, my toes bleed like stuck pigs.  </li>
            <li> This is very strange plus the pair I had did have a little damage to the end but not the cutting part...</li>
            <li> However, they were still incredibly dull, having a 90 degree edge rather a 45 degree edge like my nail clippers.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to cut the nail with it.</li>
            <li> lasted three nail clippings and then were too dull to work.</li>
            <li> I recall some reviewers said it was hard to handle or close.</li>
            <li> DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY FOR CLIPPING HARD TOENAILS .......</li>
            <li> The tool has such a wide angle that I think it is difficult to make an edge from the cutting faces.  </li>
            <li> This sucker rocks.</li>
            <li> If you have unusually thick toe</li>
            <li> I have thick,  </li>
            <li> No problem for a thick ingrown nail with this tool.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my thick nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is one serious clipper.</li>
            <li> cutting surface long; I know quality and poor design.</li>
            <li> but I found that the blades are very dull and would not cut my nails.</li>
            <li> I have very thick toenails</li>
            <li> A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING . .</li>
            <li> I was scared that I would drop them and impale my foot, or worse.</li>
            <li> Poor job.</li>
            <li> and I started to get tired of going to the Doctor all the time to get my nails clipped.</li>
            <li> Poor Design nail clipper&lt;br /&gt;Poor</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with it.  </li>
            <li> I found them quite awkward to use, even though I don&#x27;t have particularly small hands--</li>
            <li> The point of these clippers is sharp, but does not cut unless the base of the blade is also around the nail.</li>
            <li> The trimmer cutting edges seem very dull.</li>
            <li> I returned it because the cutting edges do not mate and the angle of to cutters is very clumsy.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just the nipper edge is wrong..</li>
            <li> they were difficult to grip.</li>
            <li> The photo does not show this, so I was concerned when I opened the package--thought I ordered the wrong thing.</li>
            <li> End result was a useless piece of junk lying at the bottom of the trash can.</li>
            <li> totally useless.</li>
            <li> Very poor design.  </li>
            <li> very poor design.</li>
            <li> One time they even twisted as I was trying to cut a nail, resulting in a painful lifting of the edge of the nail from the nail bed.</li>
            <li> But, I even tried cutting a piece of paper and it would NOT cut paper.  </li>
            <li> Does not have cutting power.</li>
            <li> I found this toe nail nipper impossible to use.  </li>
            <li> People who bad reviewed it must not know how to handle nippers.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m giving this one a bad review</li>
            <li> Disappointed!</li>
            <li> i was very disappointed with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact it crushes the toe nail until is breaks under pressure which leaves a horrible finish to the toe nail and the need for a lot of pressure.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It works good and it is well designed.  It has a nice look and it is sharp.  The handles could be a little longer</li>
            <li> I was not expecting the good quality and smooth, clean, efficient design of this tool. This baby cuts well, easily and accurately. I am well pleased. My thanks to the makers.</li>
            <li> The product is very sharp and easy to use.  I had only used it three or four times and it fell apart at the hinge.  I tried putting it back together but it is a machined pressed fitting and not easily done at home and I&#x27;m well past the return window.  I&#x27;ll be looking for another brand of this product.</li>
            <li> To put it simply, these toenail clippers do not work; they don&#x27;t clip. The blades don&#x27;t even come together properly. I&#x27;m going to try to return them. Wish me luck!</li>
            <li> This pair of clippers was much smaller than expected making it difficult to use on toenails. It also is not all that sharp. As an aside this is the first item I have purchased that had no label on it including where it was made.</li>
            <li> Such an improvement over the conventional 2 dollar ones we all have.  Before buying, it looked like the blade was straight in line with the handles, like wire cutters.  But, the blade is actually at a 45 degree angle or so compared to the handle.  It does quite nicely.  I have a couple of epic nails that normal clippers could not get under OR around, as they are very very thick.  These jaws open wide and get under nails well.  Someone commented that the leverage leaves something to be desired, but I find them fine.  More leverage than you get with normal clippers.    Anyway - I think they are great!</li>
            <li> These are good to cut about anything but the angle of the nippers is wrong.  When cutting it is more like bluntly cutting than using the sharpness of the edges to cut so it leaves a gnarled up end to the cut material.  Overall they have a feel of good quality and have good weight to them it&#x27;s just the nipper edge is wrong..</li>
            <li> Amazing product. People who bad reviewed it must not know how to handle nippers. It&#x27;s made of solid stainless steel construction, very sharp, I have extremely thick nails and these cut them like butter. Buying a second one as my mother used it, loved it, hence she&#x27;s getting a present.</li>
            <li> These clippers are great, I bought them to use on my mom whose toe nails had gotten very thick.  These clippers have a great angle and are sharp and strong.  Go gently, and soak the nails first to make it really easy.  I have no complaints, I&#x27;m very happy and they are well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my toenails are gnarly and gross because of some kind of foot fungus, and they work great! Now all my toes are trimmed and semi-clean looking, great buy</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t blame them.  Maybe I mis-read the description.  The blades just didn&#x27;t seem to reach the places I needed them to go.</li>
            <li> This is the first pair of toe nail clippers that could tackle my thick caveman looking toe nails. They are so sharp you must be careful when using. If you have unusually thick toe nails-- this is the one for you.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on reviews, I must have gotten a bum one. This nipper is too thick to cut well, it is dull and is not made properly.    Dont waste your money look for another brand</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to trim a very thick nail that was damaged many decades ago. My best efforts to cut the nail didn&#x27;t work. The trimmer cutting edges seem very dull. I would need a sharp one to be able to use it. I&#x27;m hoping this is just one clipper that was defective and just happened to get past quality control. Maybe some day I&#x27;ll try to sharpen it somehow.</li>
            <li> This is just what the doctor ordered (figuratively speaking). I get a lot of ingrown toenails. This is the perfect solution to prodding and picking with other tools to aleviate the pain. No more infections for me, this toe nail nipper is sharp, easy to use and does the job it is supposed to do extremely well. A well made product. I would recommend however, keeping it out of the reach of children because of the obvious reasons (extreme sharpness) and children are so curious. Shipping and packaging are as always, on time and well done.</li>
            <li> good item; a little longer in the handles would be helpful for those of us who have trouble with this task. overall, happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased these clippers in the hopes that they would make it easier to trim my toenails. I found them quite awkward to use, even though I don&#x27;t have particularly small hands-- they were difficult to grip. One time they even twisted as I was trying to cut a nail, resulting in a painful lifting of the edge of the nail from the nail bed. The very tip is also quite sharp, and while I was lucky enough not to poke my feet or toes with it, I did manage to jab my fingers a few times, once gouging my thumb deeply enough to make it bleed. I was scared that I would drop them and impale my foot, or worse. I was also a bit concerned about storing them, because they always seemed to shift in the drawer in which I kept them, which was one of the causes of the finger jabs. I eventually threw them away, because they were no more effective or easier to use than the clippers that I used before, and because I was worried about injuring myself, or having a pet or family member accidentally come into contact with them and get cut.</li>
            <li> Okay, I must say that I ordered these and they would not cut or even trim my toe nail; my regular toe nail clippers cut way better.  Maybe I got a pair that were duds.  But, I even tried cutting a piece of paper and it would NOT cut paper.  This is very strange plus the pair I had did have a little damage to the end but not the cutting part...I returned for money back.</li>
            <li> I ordered this hoping for the best, the bottom line is the very tip of the clippers close tightly, but the rest of the clipper tends to tear rather than clip, I can see daylight thru the blades without my glasses when the clippers are held in the cutting position....not what I want when I have a toenail I need cleanly clipped..... I would buy another brand and not waste my money again on this one...</li>
            <li> THE BODY TOOLZ CONCAVE PODIATRIST TOE NAIL CLIPPER IS VERY WELL MADE &amp; VERY  SHARP. IT CUTS THE HARDEST NAILS WITH EASE.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TOE NAIL CLIPPER!</li>
            <li> This clipper could easily cut through your skin, so you do not want to use it if you are diabetic. It cuts cleanly and springs open by itself. I am happy using it.</li>
            <li> These things don&#x27;t really cut so much as they tear. It takes an enormous amount of force to close these so that the blades connect and make a clean cut. Several squeezes may be needed in order to make a full cut. Not at all the quality you need to perform simple trimmings and pedicures. I went to return it and they issued a refund and told me to keep the clipper anyway. It went into the trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t make full contact when trimming. AKA useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice: spend the extra cash and get something from revlon.</li>
            <li> The angle of the blade on this nipper is almost horizontal to the handles. The photo does not show this, so I was concerned when I opened the package--thought I ordered the wrong thing. I also thought my weak, old, arthritic hands would not be able to turn at an angle to cut. However, this angle turned out to be a very good feature for me. The angle makes it easier for my hands to hold, position and squeeze. The long handles are much more comfortable and put the curve of the handles at the heel of my hand. This position is more comfortable and gives more strength. This nipper appears to be very well made. It feels solid and the blade is very sharp. A double spring lasts longer and makes the clipper easier to use. You won&#x27;t find any clippers of this quality in a pharmacy. I highly recommend this nipper.</li>
            <li> I have never had such dull cutters in my life, just got them and tried to cut my toe nails, it tore up my first nail I tried to cut and cut into my toe until it bled. Don;t buy this junk.</li>
            <li> Very well made. High quality. Easy to use. When you use it, be gentle when inserting under the lifted nail, as the front points of the blades are really sharp.</li>
            <li> Nice clean cuts making my really tough toe nails yield easily to a more fitting appearance.&lt;br /&gt;The retractable feature is simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Very poor design.  I returned it because the cutting edges do not mate and the angle of to cutters is very clumsy.  Poor job.</li>
            <li> Good quality, good price.</li>
            <li> I spoke to my Podiatrist also and he said that his clippers were $100. When I saw this and I started to get tired of going to the Doctor all the time to get my nails clipped. They are made well and I feel that I got a very good deal.</li>
            <li> Very well made. The cut is clean and smooth. But, the handles are so short it takes a lot of pressure to cut through a nail.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item. I suffer from ingrown toe nails and am not nearly diligent enough in keeping them trimmed. So when I need a little help getting under the nail it was always a struggle with traditional clipper or scissors. Then along came these babies. I&#x27;ve used them twice already and they work like a charm. They let me get under the nail and the head tappers off to a fine point for precision work. A great product all around.</li>
            <li> 2 stars; I couldn&#x27;t use this easily. Granted, I have small hands, but I don&#x27;t think that was the issue. I have a strong grip. Yet the tip of the blades was kind of bulky which made it hard to get into the sides of the nails and because it was too big, I had to hold it at a weird angle. Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use it for anything. I returned it.</li>
            <li> Though marked the same as previous one purchased,  much duller, bulkier, less manoeuverable, than previous.  Disappointed!</li>
            <li> These toenail clippers work great, are sharp and do not require a lot of force to clip my thick toenails. Only thing I wished was for a claspt to keep them closed, when resting open, sparp and pointy parts are exposed that might cause injury.</li>
            <li> The stainless steel is finished nicely, and the sharp cutting edge is a nice curved shape to help with accessing all of the toenail. Very happy with the quality and usefullness.</li>
            <li> The clipper simply will not cut a toe nail.  You can squeeze as hard as you can, and there is no cutting action to the blade.</li>
            <li> They do what they are supposed to do, but don&#x27;t expect a highly refined product. They do look like they were made in a 3rd world country and they probably were. They do work though.</li>
            <li> SAME AS OTHER REVIEWS, THIS PRODUCT IS VERY HARD TO USE IF YOU HAVE ANY REMOTELY THICK NAIL. HAVE PURCHASED OTHE CLIPPERS THAT WORK BETTER,  NOT THRILLED WITH CUTTING ABILITY</li>
            <li> This is a quality tool, it&#x27;s well made, and clearly in a differnt league than any of the cheap stuff you will find in the band-aid isle at the grocery store.  It&#x27;s much more heavy duty, and will probably last forever.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it&#x27;s not at sharp as I would like it to be. It still works just fine, but I would like it to be sharper. It will cut some heavy duty thick toe nails with no problems.</li>
            <li> Really like these clippers. Easy to handle.</li>
            <li> good for cow nail.  Heavy, dosent cut right</li>
            <li> Poor Design nail clipper&lt;br /&gt;Poor design. Cutting surface much too small, It would be better if the blade was curved like a regular toe and it was just over 1&amp;#34; cutting surface long; I know quality and poor design. I am an inventor, I have to have top quality in my design for proper working</li>
            <li> My husband loves these clippers, best we have ever found</li>
            <li> Although these nippers appear to be made of quality steel, that&#x27;s where the quality ends. Looks like they didn&#x27;t even bother to clean the parts before assembly. After saturating the joint with white lithium spray, repeatedly operating, and wiping up all the crud that came out, the nippers actually worked very smoothly. However, they were still incredibly dull, having a 90 degree edge rather a 45 degree edge like my nail clippers. Attempted to reprofile the edge with a bench grind, but it appears you would need something like a 2.5 inch wheel (if such a thing exists) rather than a 6 inch wheel to get the right curvature. End result was a useless piece of junk lying at the bottom of the trash can. Save your money.</li>
            <li> I was told by my podiatrist that clippers like his cost $100. and more.  I saw these and thought maybe they would work.  I was pleased to find they were very well made.  They are very pointed and are almost lethal, but they can get into the sides of your toe nails and remove the causes of ingrown toenails with ease.  They are easy to use and I cut both my toe nails and my wifes very easily.</li>
            <li> Does not cut as well as expected.  The handles are too short to give proper leverage.  My hand got sore trying to cut.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping to have a precision instrument and this is anything but. There is a micro gap between the blade edges that leaves part of the nail hanging. The tip is precise but that&#x27;s it. The clippers do not retrace easily and stick quite often. I am not pleased and would not advise anyone to get it as I got a different one and it works PERFECTLY!!!</li>
            <li> I had one of these before and it worked great. I lost it and decided to buy a new one so I ordered another. Now that I received this new on it&#x27;s not sharp it&#x27;s hard to cut the nail with it. So I&#x27;m giving this one a bad review</li>
            <li> Nice weight, good quality. Larger than I thought they&#x27;d be, but that&#x27;s my fault for not paying close enough attention to dimensions listed. I&#x27;m very happy with these, very worth the price.</li>
            <li> I had seen Timescapes at the friends and ordered Timescapes through AMAZON and was stunned when It was a different Timescapes than the one I wanted.  Now this one is exceptional and uses some of the same footage but it doesn not have the desert rave scenes and others that is under ANOTHER Timescapes title.  I love this but it is not the one I wanted.  Still this is magnificient.</li>
            <li> Necessary tool if you do your own pedicures. Very sharp</li>
            <li> I just received this item an I&#x27;m not happy with it.  I have owned body Toolz straight cutters (8098) and was very happy with them  and as a result I decided to buy the concave version assuming they would be as good.  Not so!  The tool has such a wide angle that I think it is difficult to make an edge from the cutting faces.  Hence the tool is blunt and does not cut cleanly.  As a matter of fact it crushes the toe nail until is breaks under pressure which leaves a horrible finish to the toe nail and the need for a lot of pressure.  I will try and grind the faces myself to get a sharp edge but I shouldn&#x27;t have to do that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product, especially for the price.  It is well-made and looks good.  I expect the clipper to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I received this product as promised,  I used them as soon as I received them.  I have thick,  I mean THICK toenails,  The clippers worked pretty good,  I rated them a 4,  had they had a little longer handle for more torque,  I would have rated them a 5.  I used all the strength I had to cut my nails and then had to bend them back and forth to cut the larger nail.. They are good and sharp and were wide enough to go over the nail but the handle was just too short.  They are a keeper though.  Thanks</li>
            <li> lasted three nail clippings and then were too dull to work. very poor design. i was very disappointed with the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I found this toe nail nipper impossible to use.  I couldn&#x27;t fit it under the toe nail to find a way to clip the nail.  I even tried it upside down--no better, of course.  Also there was a rough edge on the \\&quot;nipper\\&quot; that needs to be filed smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used the clipper twice now. I recall some reviewers said it was hard to handle or close. I am left handed and find most clippers and scissors hard to use, but this one works fine with minimal contortions of my body. It cut right through my hard, thick nails and I did not cut my toes in the process.  OK, the price is right and shipping is not much if anything. The only thing negative is that I cannot cut as good as the technician in my old podiatrist&#x27;s office. If Medicare continues to cover me and I find a podiatrist willing to take me on in my new city, I will leave foot care up to a doctor instead of myself.  If you do not want to go to a podiatrist, by all means use these clippers.</li>
            <li> Just love how even fungus infected toenails are able to be cut with this Nipper, and it prevents ingrown nails.</li>
            <li> I bought this from amazon to help with an ingrown toe nail(big toe). the cutter jaw is not concave as per description on amazon. the cutter face is level (same plane) with the handle, the back side is re-leaved at a 45 degree angle for clearance and does NO cutting whatsoever. which is better for tight spots ,IMO.&lt;br /&gt;  This tool is very sharp and  you have to be careful not to cut yourself with the tapered point. that is why I gave it four stars. No problem for a thick ingrown nail with this tool. This tool will work better if used after a shower or foot soak to soften nails.....All said , this is the sharpest tool I have used for getting into tight spots..... I would buy this again as you can&#x27;t beat it for less than $9.00 .&lt;br /&gt;  Saved me a trip to the podiatrist so it&#x27;s well worth the price.....I loaded a few pix&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit....looks like amazon sent me the 8098 model which is better....love it</li>
            <li> These nippers work really well.  They are sharp enough to cut through tough nails and are comfortable to use.  I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Works great. Nice and sturdy. Cuts very straight. Bought it for some toenails that were starting to ingrow, and it has slowly helped correct that.</li>
            <li> This clipper works acceptably on fingernails, but almost requires two hands to cut through toenails, if at all.  Get the Seki Edge clipper.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job compared to my old toe nail clipper.</li>
            <li> These nail cutters are good and sharp the only problem I find is that you can&#x27;t lock them.  Have to be careful about putting my hands in where I have these, so as not to cut or stick a finger.</li>
            <li> I did not like these at all. wouldn&#x27;t cut</li>
            <li> Good for those with arthritis who have trouble holding traditional toenail clippers. the large size is also helpful. The middle brace pieces occasionally can need some fiddling with, but not too much. Overall good product, good price</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Good quality stainless steel products.  Toolz worked as advertised and as anticipated. Arrived promptly and a good price.</li>
            <li> I had hoped to get cutters strong enough for my toenails.  These clippers would probably do well for more normal toenails, but without being too detailed, my nails are tougher.  These clippers just sort of chew on them.  I gave them to my husband, who has lighter nails.</li>
            <li> These toenail cippers are great.&lt;br /&gt;They are sharp and accurate. They are able to get into tight spaces.&lt;br /&gt;It would have been nice if the handles were coated with something for easy gripping, but as a whole&lt;br /&gt;they are good.</li>
            <li> This nail nipper looks like it would be great but I found that the blades are very dull and would not cut my nails. It is also a little small and hard to use. Amazon was very helpful in getting a refund for which I am thankful.</li>
            <li> The point of these clippers is sharp, but does not cut unless the base of the blade is also around the nail.</li>
            <li> reasonably effective nail trimmers</li>
            <li> This sucker rocks. It is large and powerful. This is one serious clipper. Just what I needed for my thick nails.&lt;br /&gt;Totally satisfied. Saved me a trip to the Podiatrist. I think that&#x27;s the right word for a foot doctor. ;- )</li>
            <li> DONT WAIST YOUR MONEY FOR CLIPPING HARD TOENAILS ....... IT WONT EVEN CUT THEM AS IT SAYS IT WILL .......</li>
            <li> This toenail clipper is well constructed, sharp, and works well with large fingernails. But for toenails you need to use massive force which is a problem. I’ll not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Very well designed for the price . Addresses nail issues that the &#x27;Walmart&amp;#34; variety can&#x27;t touch . The offset angle of the cutter head and the way the cutter head knife edge tapers from only one side shows that much thought went into the design of this tool .&lt;br /&gt;  As good as it is , though , I still have to use my &#x27;moto-tool&#x27; for certain problems .</li>
            <li> Very flimsy construction - the flexors come apart constantly and the blades are awkwardly angled.</li>
            <li> There is a slight learning curve to using these clippers, after using the conventional style, but they work great.  The spring action makes them very easy to use - easier than conventional style, and they cut clean.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality, heavy, well made. They are pretty big though...or maybe I just have small feet</li>
            <li> This tool is strong and stands up to it&#x27;s claim.It&#x27;s a strong little tool. I would recommend buying these clippers,and they are useful and sturdy!Especially for hard nails,it&#x27;s definitely a professional nipper.thankyou. Arrived on time grat buyer and great product!Would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Does not have cutting power. totally useless.</li>
            <li> NOT FOR MY NAILS!  A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING . . .BUT THAT&#x27;S LIFE!</li>
            <li> Handy toe nail cutter. Much better than sissors or a nail clipper. I recommend it for your toes. It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are high quality and sturdy.  They are very sharp.  Would  order again.  They cut cleanly without snagging the nail</li>
            <li> Use it very carefully do you don&#x27;t accidentally cut ourself!</li>
            <li> A helpful tool, but you might want to reconsider if you have arthritus in your hands.</li>
            <li> Great for getting ingrown toe nails and all those small places that are tough to get.  Comes with a little case that makes it easy to store and find.</li>
            <li> this is a massive tool. Looks like it belongs in the tool kit in the garage instead of my bathroom. Honestly scared to use them.</li>
            <li> Great tool.  Use it periodically and never disappoints.  Only flaw is the tension mechanism in the middle can slip and will need to be realigned/attached from time to time.</li>
            <li> I have very thick toenails and I have a condition (congenital) that makes them grow out in tubes.  And the nail bed grows with them.  So, if ordinary clippers are used, my toes bleed like stuck pigs.  This is exacerbated by the fact that I have diabetes.  These clippers are WONDERFUL!!  I was able to get between the nail and nail bed easily and they clipped my extra thick nails with no trouble at all!  Thank you, thank you, thank you - and NO bleeding!</li>
            <li> it works a lot better than just picking at your toenails,  it works quite cleanly, much better that the giant nail clipper style.  I think there may be some just as good for a buck or two cheaper, but if you can&#x27;t see it and hold it before you buy it (like at a sally&#x27;s) then why risk saving a buck or two and be unhappy.  I didn&#x27;t go 5 stars, because I have seen more precise tools, but this appeared to be the best value.</li>
            <li> Great add on by. Cuts finger and toe nails with ease. I believe they are equivalent to the ones used by my podiatrist.</li>
            <li> Solid, heavy duty clippers. Got these for my spouse&#x27;s hoof like toe nails. They cut nice with sharp blades, but the handles are a bit short.</li>
