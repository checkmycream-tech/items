            <li>Great Fragrance for the price</li>
            <li>, the watermelon note is very nice.</li>
            <li>smells really good.</li>
            <li>Smells really good.</li>
            <li>Excellent alternative from the original.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied indeed.</li>
            <li>But, if I needed to, shoot, one whiff of this, I&#x27;d start catching again!!!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and smells good!</li>
            <li>A good clean scent with a hint of something I cant out my finger on.</li>
            <li>I have gotten some many compliments from all the oil&#x27;s I have purchased from this buyer.</li>
            <li>but it is perfect amount of lasting power.</li>
            <li>But I still love it.</li>
            <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
            <li>even more than PR 1 Million already.</li>
            <li>EXTREMELY fast delivery, great communication &amp; customer service.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments while wearing.</li>
            <li>and I must admit that it really really smells good.</li>
            <li>I previously bought the Paco Rabanne 1 Million oil from this seller, and was very impressed.</li>
            <li>That out of the way, if your buying this as a cheap alternative to the creed product, no one will mistake this for creed IM</li>
            <li>, i own the real thing</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t smelled the original, so I can&#x27;t say if it smells similar, but it has a very nice opening.</li>
            <li>I thought it was going to be too strong to take since I am pregnant</li>
            <li>I have never smelled the original Creed Imperial</li>
            <li>like I going to put it on RIGHT NOW!</li>
            <li>it sure does lasts the whole day on me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m actually considering buying this in bulk, its that good.</li>
            <li>Much love from New York City!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny</li>
            <li>Buying the original spray by Creed costs an arm and a leg and leaves the less affluent out of the picture.</li>
            <li>EXACTLY like a jolly rancher, cant tell the difference.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It came in the mail today and from the first whiff, I like it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m definitely 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>thanks!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Get lots of compliments with this one and will definitely be back when I need more.</li>
            <li>Thanks Serina job well done!</li>
            <li>Thanks Serina!</li>
            <li>It smells exactly like creed imperial.</li>
            <li>This roll-on imitation smells fantastic and stays strong for hours.</li>
            <li>Very very close to the real thing.....</li>
            <li>Everything was very well wrapped &amp; exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and i bought this as a test to see how close a clone could be to the real deal, and i can tell you....</li>
            <li>its nothing even close to the real thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m officially partial to oil fragrances over my preferred cologne sprays like Victoria&#x27;s Secret Very Sexy Platinum, Burberry Original, Dolce &amp; Gabana Light Blue and many more, due to the longevity of the fragrance and a price that can&#x27;t be matched (thanks to Serina&#x27;s Bowtiq).</li>
            <li>I marvel at how you have absolutely captured this scent in an oil.</li>
            <li>Serina clearly knows what she&#x27;s doing and deserves your business.</li>
            <li>I got compliments all day from just about everyone who walked near me.</li>

            <li> Its missing 3 big things that make IM a god amongst other fragrances and thats, longevity, the freshness, and that signature salt note that makes a borderline feminine fragrance masculine.</li>

            <li> My wife woke from her sleep just to compliment the smell, and I couldn&#x27;t believe it since she&#x27;s such a heavy sleeper.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the Green Irish Tweed and Aventus imitations as well</li>
            <li> The fragrance is long lasting and stays on for at least 6-8 hours.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t smell it on me all day like other oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely amped about the Creed Imperial based on the reviews.</li>
            <li> This is a oil base very generous size for the price.</li>
            <li> I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

            <li> The best oil I have ever purchased online and off the street from a vendor. I have gotten some many compliments from all the oil&#x27;s I have purchased from this buyer.</li>
            <li> Heres the scoop on this product, It does one thing well, the watermelon note is very nice. That out of the way, if your buying this as a cheap alternative to the creed product, no one will mistake this for creed IM, i own the real thing and i bought this as a test to see how close a clone could be to the real deal, and i can tell you.... its nothing even close to the real thing. Its missing 3 big things that make IM a god amongst other fragrances and thats, longevity, the freshness, and that signature salt note that makes a borderline feminine fragrance masculine. Without the salt note you simply smell like a watermelon jolly rancher, im not even kidding, went out to buy a bag just to see if my nose was playing tricks on me.... EXACTLY like a jolly rancher, cant tell the difference. All things considered, as a woman you can pull this off, as a man........ NO... just NO</li>
            <li> Just arrived as a &amp;#34;just because&amp;#34; gift for my husband. Fast delivery and smells good! I thought it was going to be too strong to take since I am pregnant but it is perfect amount of lasting power. A good clean scent with a hint of something I cant out my finger on. I have never smelled the original Creed Imperial so I cant make a comparison. Either way for the price, I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> Smells great! I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just me but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last long. I didn&#x27;t smell it on me all day like other oils. But I still love it.</li>
            <li> Very very close to the real thing.....it sure does lasts the whole day on me.Will buy again for sure. ;-)</li>

            <li> Great smell that lasts about 6 to 8 hours</li>
            <li> Great scent,reasonably priced. thanks!</li>
            <li> smells really good. last me about a month. I put it on everyday and the smell last a while at least 4 hours even longer most of the time.</li>
            <li> Excellent alternative from the original. This is a oil base very generous size for the price. The fragrance is long lasting and stays on for at least 6-8 hours. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Serina, Serina, Serina, you go, girl! Creed Imperial is ON POINT! Man, this smells, this smells like, like I going to put it on RIGHT NOW! I marvel at how you have absolutely captured this scent in an oil. I generally do not use the phrase, \\&quot;There are other fish in the sea\\&quot; because I have already hooked my catch. But, if I needed to, shoot, one whiff of this, I&#x27;d start catching again!!!!!\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a regular customer from this vendor and I don&#x27;t see buying scented oil anywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get lots of compliments with this one and will definitely be back when I need more. I&#x27;m actually considering buying this in bulk, its that good.</li>

They are long lastly &amp; spot on with the originals! I will definitely be a repeat customer &amp; if you&#x27;re on the fence about making a purchase from Serina&#x27;s Bow Tiq I promise you won&#x27;t be disappointed. Thanks Serina! Much love from New York City!</li>
