            <li> The enclosed informative instructions contain some useful practical tips for hemorrhoids such as cutting back on caffeine, salt, fat and sugar and adding more fiber to the diet.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on good reviews, only to be left disappointed.</li>
            <li> Took a long time to get to me but came from overseas.</li>
            <li> It costs less to purchase and have shipped from UK for this product equivalent you can purchase in major chain drug stores.  </li>
            <li> Although it arrived a little late for my current flare-up (but much sooner than promised), it will be stored carefully for future use.</li>
            <li> With a single application,i found noticeable difference in pain and bleeding.</li>
            <li> Transaction and product was as expected.</li>
            <li> It took a few days of continual use (very tiny amount) to notice a difference in the pain, size &amp; itching.</li>
            <li> the other is not.</li>
            <li> however the last few times that I tried to buy it, it was not available.  </li>
            <li> It shrinks them down and takes care of that heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Wasted my time waiting.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about the expiration date, since it is no longer sold in the US (not sure why).  </li>
            <li> Relief is instantaneous as soon as a small dab of cream is applied.</li>
            <li> (I had bad hemorrhoids), but once it came in such relief was found!</li>
            <li> I have used these products in the past but was unable to find them in the drugstore anymore.  </li>
            <li> But alas, the cream is almost finished, and I see zero improvement.</li>
            <li> Anusol no longer sold in U.S.  Works as well if not better than U.S. equivalent and not loaded with chemical preservatives and artificial ingredients.  </li>
            <li> So sad that they stopped selling Anusol in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Artificial colors and flavors are banned.  </li>
            <li> having hemorrhoids isn&#x27;t the worse thing in the world but it can be annoying and distracting.  </li>
            <li> I read about this in an online IBS group from someone posting about painful hemorrhoids (the poster lives in the UK).</li>
            <li> The waiting time was painful</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> You can&#x27;t buy this stuff anymore. What they sell in store around me doesn&#x27;t work at all. This does. Just like it used to when you could buy it back in the 70&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Transaction and product was as expected.</li>
            <li> should have provided a better description. thought theses were suppositories.</li>
            <li> Had to wait like 3 times more the estimated time. Wasted my time waiting.</li>
            <li> Worked fine. Was recommended by my dr</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for. Couldn&#x27;t find it in my country and need it urgently!</li>
            <li> Product works very good.Was quoted $160.00 thru my insurance for one tube and it had to be ordered.Came home,went on line, found it for under $6.00 a tube.Cannot believe the price. Keep up the good work,</li>
            <li> This product is very well.  It is a good enough amount of product in the tube.  It does help resolve and ease symptoms.  I am glad my doctor recommended this to me and that it was available online at Amazon.  I could not find it anywhere near me in store.</li>
            <li> Works as good as Tucks!  Glad I could fine it!</li>
            <li> Works as stated in packaging</li>
            <li> Great product. It seems to look, smell and feel like a similar product that J &amp;J ceased to manufacture. Same great results. One drawback is the applicator has an edge around the hole in the tip. Needs to be more rounded to reduce irritation when inserted. I plan to buy more so I hope someone will work on this.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on good reviews, only to be left disappointed. I have used this product for well over a month now, hoping that eventually I will notice a difference. But alas, the cream is almost finished, and I see zero improvement. Will not buy again</li>
            <li> Product as described. Would purchase again from this seller.</li>
            <li> Product works well.  I was a little concerned about the expiration date, since it is no longer sold in the US (not sure why).  Anyway, expiration date on my shipment is for 03/2018, 3 years from now.  I am very satisfied, and the price (UK to NJ) is most reasonable.</li>
            <li> Works okay, but he best I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well, doctor recommended for me as safe in pregnancy. Took a long time to get to me but came from overseas.</li>
            <li> My mom needed this got in great time.</li>
            <li> Effective and Works very well.</li>
            <li> works well to eliminate ichinng. Did nothing to reduce swelling. Still works better than preparation H. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this one.</li>
            <li> No one likes to talk about it but having hemorrhoids isn&#x27;t the worse thing in the world but it can be annoying and distracting.  This cream works well.  It shrinks them down and takes care of that heavy feeling.</li>
            <li> Excellent medicine for hemorrhoids.</li>
            <li> I have used these products in the past but was unable to find them in the drugstore anymore.  They&#x27;re great products; they should still be available for purchase from local merchants, but alas, they are not.</li>
            <li> Thus for this product is working great.  Everything has calmed down and have not been experiencing any more flare ups.</li>
            <li> this ointment was very much appreciated and healing.  however the last few times that I tried to buy it, it was not available.  I want to keep ordering it but it has not been on the screen to buy.</li>
            <li> Thanks got that I have found Anusol as a replacement for Tucks ointment!!&lt;br /&gt;For some dummy reason they stopped selling it in US and there is no other like it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for providing Anusol!!!</li>
            <li> I use this one when I have some itching issues and it seem sto do the trick.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> Great product.  So sad that they stopped selling Anusol in the U.S.</li>
            <li> It costs less to purchase and have shipped from UK for this product equivalent you can purchase in major chain drug stores.  Anusol no longer sold in U.S.  Works as well if not better than U.S. equivalent and not loaded with chemical preservatives and artificial ingredients.  Europe gets it.  Artificial colors and flavors are banned.  When are we going to finally figure out why so many US residents have so many ailments, behavioral and learning disabilities.  Not rocket science.</li>
            <li> I bought this for under eye bags and it works very well.  I had to order it from the UK as there is some ingredient that can&#x27;t be used in the US.  Just a dab under the eye, right on the bag, and it sucks right in.  I top it with an eye cream.</li>
            <li> I love anusol for hemorrhoids.It works very well.amazon is the only place I can buy it.It always get to me quickly</li>
            <li> Considering product came from England - very prompt arrival. Product was as described.</li>
            <li> It meets our expectations. Really like it</li>
            <li> Couldnt find it in the US anymore so I ordered it here. Best product for the treatment that I need</li>
            <li> I found this to be the best and most effective hemorrhoid cream and when I could no longer find it I ordered it from the UK.</li>
            <li> Anusol contains three ingredients designed especially for hemorrhoid relief, much more effective than the merely palliative remedies available in America, a sad commentary on the triumph of marketing over product quality in our American consumer economy. Thank you, McNeil Products Ltd, for continuing to manufacture Anusol in the UK. The special ingredients are zinc oxide (astringent), balsam peru (antiseptic) and bismuth oxide (astringent and antiseptic). Relief is instantaneous as soon as a small dab of cream is applied. My shipment from the UK from seller DirectKart took eleven days wrapped and taped securely in a cardboard sleeve. Although it arrived a little late for my current flare-up (but much sooner than promised), it will be stored carefully for future use. The enclosed informative instructions contain some useful practical tips for hemorrhoids such as cutting back on caffeine, salt, fat and sugar and adding more fiber to the diet.</li>
            <li> A great product for special needs.  I hope that Neil Meds will continue producing it.  I hope you will modify he tube that begins to ooze the product after a while.  Make it more like the original tube that is more liable.   ALSO YOU NEED TO INCREASE THE ZINC OXIDE TO 12.75% LIKE THE ORIGINAL FORMULA.</li>
            <li> I DONT KNOW WHAT TO SAY! DOES NOT WORK FOR ME.</li>
            <li> With a single application,i found noticeable difference in pain and bleeding. Life saver.</li>
            <li> does not worked for her</li>
            <li> I read about this in an online IBS group from someone posting about painful hemorrhoids (the poster lives in the UK). Of course as a sufferer of IBS-D &amp; hemorrhoids I wanted to try it (Prep H only works so much). The waiting time was painful (I had bad hemorrhoids), but once it came in such relief was found! It took a few days of continual use (very tiny amount) to notice a difference in the pain, size &amp; itching. Finally the hemorrhoids are shrinking. I won&#x27;t compare this to Prep H, because every product works different for each person. What I will say is that this stuff really has helped me &amp; I am going to re-order for the next time I have hemorrhoids just so I can have an extra on hand (don&#x27;t want to run out)</li>
            <li> This was exactly what we have been looking for.  Price is great!</li>
            <li> It worked great for my external hemorrhoid but not for the internal one, that is still a problem.  I don&#x27;t know if it works to well for itching or pain since I had neither of those symptoms.  I just know one is gone and the other is not.</li>
