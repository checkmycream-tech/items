            <li>I absolutely love this fragrance for my man.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but waaaaaay better performance in longevity and silage..</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance..</li>
            <li>And people always tell it is a respectable cologne.</li>
            <li>This has become my favorite cologne!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I love this perfume.</li>
            <li>; Best cologne I&#x27;ve ever bough and I&#x27;ve bought all the big names like Versace, Gucci and Dolce &amp; Gabanna; I love Ferragmo more than any of those.</li>
            <li>But says it smells a lot better.</li>
            <li>It is worth it for the price and smell so good.</li>
            <li>have had many compliments</li>
            <li>the smell is good.&lt;br /&gt;overall, it is ok.</li>
            <li>Love the item.</li>
            <li>It is easy on the nose and easy to wear.  </li>
            <li>Makes you feel good, helps you handle your busy day when you are and feel confident.</li>
            <li>even is free</li>
            <li>Since you don&#x27;t get to return this type of item, you may want to opt for a trial size if available</li>
            <li>Fantastic scent.</li>
            <li>I love it, smells fresh, like you just got out of the shower.</li>
            <li>It is clear and allows good visibility of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>If the projection and longevity were better, the tally would be much higher.  </li>
            <li>, that is unless you are familiar with this cologne, of course.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great perfume exactly like the one we purchased before from major store.</li>
            <li>price/value is fantastic - the current online rate is about $30 for a good size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I ordered this for my brother, he loves it; is fresh and not that strong and lasts all day...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool, clean and manly.</li>
            <li>It is gentle an elegant.</li>
            <li>a good sweet one to wear during the winter or summer night or possibly a summer day..</li>
            <li>smells very loud and cheap!</li>
            <li>Additionally, it will make a great tight quarter office cologne -</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like it was worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Give it 15 minuets on your body and will take on a whole new dynamic that is quite pleasant and light.</li>
            <li>And this one is just right.  </li>
            <li>But if you like to switch things up more quickly, you might consider a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li>I was really excited the first time i smelled it, but gradually i noticed that the scent is not there, it smells like pure alcohol at first and then after maybe 2 mins</li>
            <li>Pour Homme offers great flexibility or versatility - being light and of solid universal notes, it can be worn any time of year and for any occasion.  </li>
            <li>My wife noted the same, saying that the cologne was very, very light.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptic about the price and worried that I am going to receive other box than the one on the photo, but when i opened the package i was great surprised.</li>
            <li>I am a big fan of Salvatore Ferragamo fragrances and have many to chose from.  </li>
            <li>The bottling and packaging are first class.  </li>
            <li>This cologne has a very sticky fresh out the bottle smell.</li>
            <li>One if the most underrated fragrances I&#x27;ve come across..it smells similar to Prada LUNA ROSA..</li>
            <li>Free Time has just recently crept into my Top Ten...</li>
            <li>won&#x27;t find a better quality sweet scent that&#x27;s blended this well at such a low price</li>
            <li>A little bug spray kind of a scent.</li>
            <li>very goooooooood excelent</li>
            <li>Im unsure if I got the real stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does not seems to be a real ferragamo.</li>
            <li>My friend wears way too much.</li>
            <li>I found this cologne very lacking.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>but the black is better.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a new scent, and found this at Nordstrom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>perfume salvatore ferragamo not have the original flavor, totally different in content, had bought earlier in the USA</li>
            <li>scent disappeared in half an hour after spraying more than ten times!!</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Wow</li>
            <li>it will not offend those with sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Currently I purchase for my son and he really likes it as well.  </li>
            <li>Do not waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li>There is nothing distinctive about it, and it does not last very long...less than an hour  </li>
            <li>Lasts on me all day in a hectic and busy office setting.</li>
            <li>I am always getting noticed by how I smell unlike the other guy and the first day I had this on, the women noticed.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the colognes that are over the top manly, nor do I like the ones that are tough to distinguish from women&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>It was tinted yellow and should have been clear.</li>
            <li>The parfum does not last at all, it seems it is old, so</li>
            <li>I do recommend this product but just know you must smell it on your skin and only after a few minuets should you get the right affect.</li>

            <li> it does not smell like it should, and no mater how much you out on, still no scent, but a very little fragance mixed With alcohol.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s dark and clear at the same time.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a big bottle (2-3 squirts in the am does it for me), so it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Masculine and a little darker than the regular juice</li>
            <li> It also smelled differently than previous bottles I have bought.</li>
            <li> even contains black letters when he should be red.</li>
            <li> Little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> But I was a bit shell shocked by the price tag, so I opted to do a little on line shopping to see if I could find a better price.  </li>
            <li> This one was beyond watered down.</li>
            <li> It also seemed watered down.  </li>
            <li> Slightly spicy...</li>
            <li> But, the scent held for less than an hour.  </li>
            <li> poor quality,i dont know if the other have the same problem or not</li>
            <li> After buying this from Amazon, I used this for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Not strong.</li>
            <li> Was not sure about purchasing colone thru the mail, but it came in one piece</li>
            <li> Not sure how to describe it,</li>
            <li> im not sure what was tamppered with...  </li>
            <li> At least try the small samples before you go all in.</li>
            <li> But you need VERY little of it!</li>
            <li> People often get it confused with Armani.</li>
            <li> If you are buying cologne from Amazon you will get a fake.</li>
            <li> This is the equivalent of buying some fake Jordans.</li>
            <li> Homme comes out of the bottle with aqua and floral notes - and call me crazy -</li>
            <li> Or i just got the wrong stuff!</li>
            <li> terrible  .</li>

            <li> Pour Homme is very pleasant scent that once you apply, you have the clean and fresh showered feeling.  I am a big fan of Salvatore Ferragamo fragrances and have many to chose from.  Free Time has just recently crept into my Top Ten...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pour Homme comes out of the bottle with aqua and floral notes - and call me crazy - I smell some minty notes somewhere... It is easy on the nose and easy to wear.  The downside is that Pour Homme lacks staying power and longevity.  Yes, you will get that occasional whiff up to four hours, but not that lasting power that you get throughout the day.  If I get 6-8 hours, I am pleased.  You may get 3-4 hours from Pour Homme...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No \\&quot;Wow Factor\\&quot; compliments to speak of - but I will add that is not out of the question.  The fragrance is very pleasant.  The bottling and packaging are first class.  Of noteworthy interest, I do love the bottle.  It is clear and allows good visibility of the fragrance.  Pour Homme offers great flexibility or versatility - being light and of solid universal notes, it can be worn any time of year and for any occasion.  Additionally, it will make a great tight quarter office cologne - it will not offend those with sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price/value is fantastic - the current online rate is about $30 for a good size bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My final tally for Pour Homme is 4.0 stars out of 5 stars.  If the projection and longevity were better, the tally would be much higher.  Given the pleasantry of the fragrance, the bottle design, and the price/value, I would definitely recommend buying.  Throw it in the gym bag... Play like a Champion...</li>
            <li> very goooooooood excelent</li>
            <li> Was not sure about purchasing colone thru the mail, but it came in one piece and I am happy with the price, so I will be purchasing my colone this was for now on.  Oh and this stuff is great as well.</li>
            <li> I love this one. It&#x27;s perfect for wintertime. Masculine and a little darker than the regular juice</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new scent, and found this at Nordstrom&#x27;s. I liked it because it&#x27;s neither too feminine nor too husky. I don&#x27;t like the colognes that are over the top manly, nor do I like the ones that are tough to distinguish from women&#x27;s.  I suppose I&#x27;m a Goldilocks when it comes to cologne. And this one is just right.  But I was a bit shell shocked by the price tag, so I opted to do a little on line shopping to see if I could find a better price.  This one was just right, so I bought it, and am happy with the results.  One caveat:  it&#x27;s a big bottle (2-3 squirts in the am does it for me), so it lasts a long time.  18 mos in, and I still have 1/2 bottle left. I&#x27;m frugal, so that&#x27;s good news for me. But if you like to switch things up more quickly, you might consider a smaller bottle.</li>
            <li> This cologne has a very sticky fresh out the bottle smell. A little bug spray kind of a scent. Give it 15 minuets on your body and will take on a whole new dynamic that is quite pleasant and light. I do recommend this product but just know you must smell it on your skin and only after a few minuets should you get the right affect.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001FWXHUW F Pour Homme by Salvatore Ferragamo 100ml 3.4oz EDT Spray]]    I absolutely love this fragrance for my man.  Currently I purchase for my son and he really likes it as well.  Very light but nice and stays with you all day.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t like the odor...</li>
            <li> the longest I&#x27;ve ever had to wait for my items to ship from Amazon. terrible  . even is free</li>
            <li> This was not the correct cologne. It was tinted yellow and should have been clear. It also smelled differently than previous bottles I have bought. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Its very good and delivery was on time. Thank you</li>
            <li> Im unsure if I got the real stuff. I read the reviews before buying it and they looked good. I was really excited the first time i smelled it, but gradually i noticed that the scent is not there, it smells like pure alcohol at first and then after maybe 2 mins an almost unnoticeable  scent appears.&lt;br /&gt;It does not seems to be a real ferragamo. Or i just got the wrong stuff!</li>
            <li> Bought for my friends birthday. The cologne has very nice notes. But you need VERY little of it! My friend wears way too much. If my boyfriend used this cologne it would have to be tiniest spray. Little goes a LONG way.</li>
            <li> Slightly spicy...it&#x27;s okay. A different smell for a change</li>
            <li> One if the most underrated fragrances I&#x27;ve come across..it smells similar to Prada LUNA ROSA..but waaaaaay better performance in longevity and silage..I love this fragrance..a good sweet one to wear during the winter or summer night or possibly a summer day..this is a year around scent..excellent quality again..it arrived in timely fashion and the box wasn&#x27;t bent and the fragrance protected..won&#x27;t find a better quality sweet scent that&#x27;s blended this well at such a low price</li>
            <li> It is  awesome, very good stuff,I recommend</li>
            <li> nice but the black is better.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing. Not sure how to describe it, but it&#x27;s dark and clear at the same time. Kinda nutty? Idk just buy it because it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
            <li> Bought this perfume as a gift and i really loved it. great price at amazon as usual, best quality indeed</li>
            <li> Do not waste your time or money on this. If you are buying cologne from Amazon you will get a fake. This is the second time this has happened to me with two different colognes. The fragrance smells nothing like the department store bottle. This one was beyond watered down. It smelled as close to water with an ammonia type of scent. Believe me, you will lose your money!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> That is my second time to use that product.It just perfect for men.And people always tell it is a respectable cologne.</li>
            <li> This has become my favorite cologne!!!&lt;br /&gt; It has a great scent for day or evening events. It is a must have!!!!</li>
            <li> smells very loud and cheap! i wouldn&#x27;t even spray this on a corpse</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I was skeptic about the price and worried that I am going to receive other box than the one on the photo, but when i opened the package i was great surprised. It&#x27;s a great perfume exactly like the one we purchased before from major store.</li>
            <li> very good fragrance but the packaging wrapper was opened from underneath. im not sure what was tamppered with...  hope some one lets me know if anything else was in the box.</li>
            <li> I found this cologne very lacking.  There is nothing distinctive about it, and it does not last very long...less than an hour  I don&#x27;t feel like it was worth the money.  Since you don&#x27;t get to return this type of item, you may want to opt for a trial size if available, that is unless you are familiar with this cologne, of course.</li>
            <li> Excellent men&#x27;s fragrance; been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Loved  the perfume. It is gentle an elegant. Not strong. I get compliments when I use it.Very good price for what you get.</li>
            <li> The parfum does not last at all, it seems it is old, so it does not smell like it should, and no mater how much you out on, still no scent, but a very little fragance mixed With alcohol.</li>
            <li> It was A GIFT FOR MY BEST FRIEND, SMELL WELL</li>
            <li> Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this perfume salvatore ferragamo not have the original flavor, totally different in content, had bought earlier in the USA and you have sent me has the same fragrance in the bottle even contains black letters when he should be red. I do not agree</li>
            <li> This smells expensive and handsome... Does that make sense? Well, those are the two words that come to mind... Also &amp;#34;exclusive&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s three words now.</li>
            <li> Having received the refund from beautyencounter&lt;br /&gt;Very poor quality,i dont know if the other have the same problem or not&lt;br /&gt;The scent disappeared in half an hour after spraying more than ten times!!</li>
            <li> Fantastic scent. I love it, smells fresh, like you just got out of the shower. Makes me feel like a million bucks and that&#x27;s what I want out of a Cologne. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat what I paid which was around 30. Lasts on me all day in a hectic and busy office setting. I work in an office with all being women besides myself and another gentleman. I am always getting noticed by how I smell unlike the other guy and the first day I had this on, the women noticed. Makes you feel good, helps you handle your busy day when you are and feel confident. This was a bargain for me. At least try the small samples before you go all in. Bottom line; Best cologne I&#x27;ve ever bough and I&#x27;ve bought all the big names like Versace, Gucci and Dolce &amp; Gabanna; I love Ferragmo more than any of those. For realz.</li>
            <li> This scent is awesome &amp; one of my all time favorites. People often get it confused with Armani. But says it smells a lot better.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Faragamo. I always have this one in collection. I have people asking me what perfume are you wearing.</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne blends in with my body chemistry. People I deal with all the time , they love it.always getting complements.this helps me have a pleasant day.</li>
            <li> Lo compre por su aroma unico y su precio es fantastico. Solo a traves de este medio puedo conseguir estos perfume a ese precio.</li>
            <li> It is worth it for the price and smell so good. I bought this for my boyfriend&#x27;s birthday! He loves it!</li>
            <li> Hi all,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this cologne a couple of years ago.  I had seen (and smelled it ) in a department store and really liked the bright, fruity scent.  After buying this from Amazon, I used this for a few days.  But, the scent held for less than an hour.  It also seemed watered down.  My wife noted the same, saying that the cologne was very, very light.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying any Ferragamo colognes any time soon.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t even come close to what i was expecting. This is the equivalent of buying some fake Jordans.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! My bf gets compliments all the time</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my brother, he loves it; is fresh and not that strong and lasts all day... also is cheaper to buy it here that in a retail store..</li>
            <li> I really like the fragrance.  It&#x27;s cool, clean and manly.</li>
            <li> This is the best F cologne and the original. I made this my trademark scent. The ladies and my spouse loves it.</li>
            <li> have had many compliments</li>
            <li> i buy this for my friend, but he said it is not the one showed in picture.&lt;br /&gt;but the smell is good.&lt;br /&gt;overall, it is ok.</li>
            <li> Love the item. Would purchase again from this company. My boyfriend loved it as as Vanentines Day gift. Definately a great buy.</li>
