            <li>and it certainly feels wonderful on my skin.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>but beside that, its a nice product</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve affectionately dubbed it my &amp;#34;hot flash spray&amp;#34; because I use it when I&#x27;m feeling too warm, for whatever reason.</li>
            <li>, it feels good, the packaging is cute.</li>
            <li>I really liked that because I needed the product soon</li>
            <li>Inisfree now and loving it a lot more.</li>
            <li>because I figured a mist wouldn&#x27;t be oily and would be perfect for my sensitive yet acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>I have no idea what it does specifically, but it makes my face smell nice, and the packaging is freakin adorable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s adorable and feels very refreshing, especially in hot and humid weather.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so refreshing, and the scent is rather pleasant and light.</li>
            <li>I love the packaging and the product itself is quite refreshing and helps me keep a nice glow</li>
            <li>it used to have the most pleasant light floral fruity refreshing cucumber scent and now it smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li>They were thrilled to receive an adorable bunny face spray and love it as well.</li>
            <li>Also feels great on the face on a hot day like another review said :)</li>
            <li>Good product, it does its job and is super cute.</li>
            <li>I carry this in my bag on hot days and it feels very refreshing and smells lovely!</li>
            <li>I have been using korean products and mist for years and this was just ok.</li>
            <li>The bottle is cute but the cap broke after 1 week :</li>
            <li>Will probably buy again because it&#x27;s so darn adorable.</li>
            <li>Cute as heck.</li>
            <li>I love this product it feels nice and light on the face and the packaging is adorable..</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this</li>
            <li>The mist itself seems ok</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cute container.</li>
            <li>This is so freaking cute</li>
            <li>It does come with a spray top that&#x27;s removable</li>
            <li>It also feels sooo refreshing to my skin.</li>
            <li>TIP: keep it in the fridge for a refreshing pick me up.</li>
            <li>I love the way it feels when you spritz it on</li>
            <li>but I guess better safe</li>
            <li>Refreshing and brightening (not whitening).</li>
            <li>The smell is light and airy, just like the spray ^.^ also, it gives a brighter look to my face!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is light, kind of a fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent (so I&#x27;m able to use it in the office where there are lots of scent-sensitive individuals)</li>
            <li>Smells really good and it works really well for oily skin.</li>
            <li>Be warned that the scent is quite strong.</li>
            <li>but it works fine for me.</li>
            <li>Light fine mist.</li>
            <li>The spray is light, which I like, and you can use it without ruining your make up</li>
            <li>but it will make your skin look fresh and healthy.</li>
            <li>But like the Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream, the ingredients are in Korean so who knows what&#x27;s in this.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t break me out despite the bizarre oiliness it causes, but I can&#x27;t stand having to mop up my face every two hours.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice soft sent to it and its so cute.</li>
            <li>It revitalizes and gives the face a very fresh feel.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Product does fine as a moisturizing mist, but nothing special as &amp;#34;oil control.&amp;#34; Also, it smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li>It also leaves a nice, matte look while leaving your face soft like a baby&#x27;s booty.</li>
            <li>really cute and is very refreshing!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this.  </li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>It smells strongly of baby powder at first</li>
            <li>Kept my skin super hydrated and moist today.</li>
            <li>Still super cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I then decided to wear the spray, which has a pretty, light scent, alone under my makeup</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle and smells clean.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li>It dissipates, but meh, it&#x27;s a few seconds that I could be enjoying with a nice scent that I spend holding my breath instead.</li>
            <li>Worth it on cuteness, but not on price.</li>
            <li>The fragrance overall is nice.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>but once it dries it smells exactly like Fruity Pebbles cereal.</li>
            <li>This product isn&#x27;t exactly the cheapest, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>I wish more American products were styled this way.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for people who generally have dry skin, but get really oily if you use lotion.</li>
            <li>This mist doesn&#x27;t mess up my foundation, so it&#x27;s a nice refreshing option when my face feels dry or itchy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the effect is that you get too much liquid on your face at certain spots--</li>
            <li>it also really moisturizes your face.</li>
            <li>So I got this because I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>When I woke up my face was very oily.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets greasy really fast, so I couldn&#x27;t use face cream</li>
            <li>I am very upset.</li>
            <li>It shipped and delivered really fast; within a week I think.</li>
            <li>came much earlier than the expected delivery date, it has a nice mattifying and moisturizing effect but smells like baby powder</li>
            <li>Definitely reccommend, especially for summer time :)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend tonymolly products for there cuteness and quality.</li>
            <li>and I love using it during the hot weather as a little cool down.</li>
            <li>I used an oil absorbing sheet, and within a couple more hours my skin was slick again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>recommend using it right before you prime your face, and in the later hours when your face needs a pick-me-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>My original one came in a nice plastic box so it seemed a little shady that there was no seal or anything</li>
            <li>Not sure if it really does much, but it makes me feel clean and refreshed.</li>
            <li>The bunny mist I received was the new packaging (not the one with the almost human face, but the solid white bunny one), and was so cute</li>
            <li>Note: the picture is the old bottle design - what you will receive is the new one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got very oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and shine is one of the battles I fight on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>far it has not irritated my skin at all or made me break out.  </li>
            <li>I am quite sensitive to fragrance</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have very oily skin, but it keeps your face matte for maybe ten minutes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this spray before from another online website and was surprised when this arrived without packaging.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the old one.</li>
            <li>It dries quickly and makes my face look less shiny.</li>
            <li>Most American toners leave your face feeling tight, dry, and mask-like with astringents.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect major mattifying from this</li>
            <li>The only way I can describe it is like old baby wipes and baby powder.  </li>
            <li>It does seem to cut down on my oiliness and also makes my skin look glowing and healthy as opposed to just shiny and oily like it usually does.</li>
            <li>It is cute and small enough for travel (use it to moisturize my face during long plane flights) but it is not as rich and moisturising as other mists I used in the past.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell although it&#x27;s not exactly overpowering.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this spray before from another online website and was surprised when this arrived without packaging.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the old one.</li>
            <li> It dries quickly and makes my face look less shiny.</li>
            <li> Most American toners leave your face feeling tight, dry, and mask-like with astringents.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect major mattifying from this</li>
            <li> The only way I can describe it is like old baby wipes and baby powder.  </li>
            <li> It does seem to cut down on my oiliness and also makes my skin look glowing and healthy as opposed to just shiny and oily like it usually does.</li>
            <li> It is cute and small enough for travel (use it to moisturize my face during long plane flights) but it is not as rich and moisturising as other mists I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell although it&#x27;s not exactly overpowering.</li>
            <li> It smells good, faintly perfumy, but it&#x27;s an incredibly small bottle and won&#x27;t last long at all.  </li>
            <li> My cheeks and neck can get pretty dry during the day, but my forehead and chin can be a bit slick</li>
            <li> Within a few hours my face was CRAZY oily, way more than normal.  </li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin very long, either.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to tuck away in a drawer or tote, but it takes up too much room for me to carry around in my small purse.</li>
            <li> It sprays only half of the nozzle and the nozzle keeps moving around</li>
            <li> the product is too small and it is not going to last enough</li>
            <li> The product came bubble wrapped in a medium sized box, I found the box to be a little to big for the product</li>
            <li> I usually use it as a make up primer or just to freshen up after a long day of wearing the same make up.</li>
            <li> I think if I had purchased the other scent I would have given this product 4 stars.</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the OLD pocket bunny sleek mist and used it religiously</li>
            <li> I decided to order the sleek mist to help make my face less oily.</li>
            <li> I use this everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also disappointed because I wanted to take this in my purse but, even though it&#x27;s only 2oz, it&#x27;s actually bigger and heavier than my other mist that&#x27;s 3 oz.</li>
            <li> It spritzes out unevenly and in a small spray, so you have to spritz a lot of times and close up to your face.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think anything of it, showered as usual, and used the mist after I washed and dried my face.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not sure if it doesn&#x27;t anything it makes me feel refresh whenever i use it</li>
            <li> so you can at least fill it up with something else once</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to explain!  </li>
            <li> or it got worse.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there was something wrong with the spray nozzle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So unfortunately for me, this mist will not work.  </li>
            <li> then sorry.</li>
            <li> So bad.  </li>
            <li> really disappointed about</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> :-(</li>
            <li> Blech.</li>
            <li> And the smell to me was awful.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good! I like it! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I have been using korean products and mist for years and this was just ok. It is cute and small enough for travel (use it to moisturize my face during long plane flights) but it is not as rich and moisturising as other mists I used in the past. The bottle is cute but the cap broke after 1 week :(&lt;br /&gt;Using Inisfree now and loving it a lot more.</li>
            <li> smells great! Not sure if it really does much, but it makes me feel clean and refreshed. Will probably buy again because it&#x27;s so darn adorable.</li>
            <li> Cute as heck. The spray is light, which I like, and you can use it without ruining your make up</li>
            <li> I love this product it feels nice and light on the face and the packaging is adorable.. it also really moisturizes your face. The only thing im really disappointed about is it smells like babys.. you know that diaper scent.. it smells excactly like that but beside that, its a nice product</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect with this but I do like it a lot. I&#x27;ve got very oily, acne prone, sensitive skin and shine is one of the battles I fight on a daily basis. I&#x27;ve been using this to freshen up during the day. It does seem to cut down on my oiliness and also makes my skin look glowing and healthy as opposed to just shiny and oily like it usually does. Don&#x27;t expect major mattifying from this but it will make your skin look fresh and healthy. After using it I look like I just touched up my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far it has not irritated my skin at all or made me break out.  Be warned that the scent is quite strong. It smells strongly of baby powder at first but once it dries it smells exactly like Fruity Pebbles cereal. Very pleasant, although someone walking into the room after you spray it might ask you what that powdery smell is as it does linger in the air. I am quite sensitive to fragrance but this doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin very long, either. The packaging is very cute, the size is portable, and the lid stays on so you don&#x27;t need to worry about spillage in your purse.</li>
            <li> Most American toners leave your face feeling tight, dry, and mask-like with astringents. This one does the opposite. It&#x27;s so refreshing, and the scent is rather pleasant and light. It also leaves a nice, matte look while leaving your face soft like a baby&#x27;s booty.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Perfect for carrying in your purse!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there was something wrong with the spray nozzle. It sprays the mist in an irregular &#x27;doughnut&#x27; shape, like it&#x27;s clogged in the middle (it&#x27;s not). The mist itself seems ok I guess, it&#x27;s basically like scented water.</li>
            <li> This product is so cute and smells wonderful. I usually use it as a make up primer or just to freshen up after a long day of wearing the same make up. I highly recommend tonymolly products for there cuteness and quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cute container. Very cute. But the mist itself, I don&#x27;t like. It spritzes out unevenly and in a small spray, so you have to spritz a lot of times and close up to your face. I think the effect is that you get too much liquid on your face at certain spots--whatever it is, it&#x27;s not a mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally I also don&#x27;t like the fragrance. It&#x27;s like rosewater + perfume. It dissipates, but meh, it&#x27;s a few seconds that I could be enjoying with a nice scent that I spend holding my breath instead. I&#x27;m also disappointed because I wanted to take this in my purse but, even though it&#x27;s only 2oz, it&#x27;s actually bigger and heavier than my other mist that&#x27;s 3 oz.</li>
            <li> So I got this because I have very oily skin and I read that this can help keep your face matte before applying your makeup. This product isn&#x27;t exactly the cheapest, and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d recommend it. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because I have very oily skin, but it keeps your face matte for maybe ten minutes. And the smell to me was awful. The only way I can describe it is like old baby wipes and baby powder.  Wasn&#x27;t happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still unsure what this is supposed to do. I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell although it&#x27;s not exactly overpowering. I think it&#x27;s supposed to reduce oiliness but the effectiveness there is still to be seen. I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if I finally figure out how to make it work for me.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and it works really well for oily skin. It make my face not as oily as before</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this spray before from another online website and was surprised when this arrived without packaging. Like it&#x27;s literally just the spray bottle as pictured. My original one came in a nice plastic box so it seemed a little shady that there was no seal or anything...I sprayed it and the scent smells the same but I think from now on I will pay the extra 5 bucks to get the sealed one instead.</li>
            <li> I keep this mist at work. I&#x27;ve affectionately dubbed it my &amp;#34;hot flash spray&amp;#34; because I use it when I&#x27;m feeling too warm, for whatever reason. I have combination skin. My cheeks and neck can get pretty dry during the day, but my forehead and chin can be a bit slick so I opted for the Sleek Mist. This mist doesn&#x27;t mess up my foundation, so it&#x27;s a nice refreshing option when my face feels dry or itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very gentle and smells clean. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent (so I&#x27;m able to use it in the office where there are lots of scent-sensitive individuals) and it&#x27;s so cuuute! I wish more American products were styled this way. It&#x27;s small enough to tuck away in a drawer or tote, but it takes up too much room for me to carry around in my small purse. Overall, I&#x27;m glad I gave it a try!</li>
            <li> came much earlier than the expected delivery date, it has a nice mattifying and moisturizing effect but smells like baby powder</li>
            <li> smells like baby powder.</li>
            <li> This is so freaking cute it&#x27;s hard to explain!  But like the Appletox Smooth Massage Peeling Cream, the ingredients are in Korean so who knows what&#x27;s in this.  It smells good, faintly perfumy, but it&#x27;s an incredibly small bottle and won&#x27;t last long at all.  It does come with a spray top that&#x27;s removable so you can at least fill it up with something else once it&#x27;s all gone.  Worth it on cuteness, but not on price.</li>
            <li> I carry this in my bag on hot days and it feels very refreshing and smells lovely!</li>
            <li> I use this after I apply my facial routine and BB. It&#x27;s a great make up setter, giving it that radiant glow. It also feels sooo refreshing to my skin. I use it every 2-3 hours during work. Kept my skin super hydrated and moist today.</li>
            <li> I love the packaging and the product itself is quite refreshing and helps me keep a nice glow but the spray does not work correctly. It sprays only half of the nozzle and the nozzle keeps moving around so I never know where it&#x27;s going to spray. I have to use several pumps to get it where I want to.</li>
            <li> Note: the picture is the old bottle design - what you will receive is the new one. Still super cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product does fine as a moisturizing mist, but nothing special as &amp;#34;oil control.&amp;#34; Also, it smells like baby powder. Blech.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. It smells good, it feels good, the packaging is cute. If you&#x27;re on the fence just get it! You won&#x27;t be disappointed. TIP: keep it in the fridge for a refreshing pick me up.</li>
            <li> It´s really cute and is very refreshing!&lt;br /&gt;It was  delivered on time I really liked that because I needed the product soon but the size&lt;br /&gt;of the product is too small and it is not going to last enough</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this.  So bad.  The bunny mist I received was the new packaging (not the one with the almost human face, but the solid white bunny one), and was so cute I almost couldn&#x27;t stand it.  I washed my face in the evening, spritzed my face, and went to bed.  When I woke up my face was very oily.  I didn&#x27;t think anything of it, showered as usual, and used the mist after I washed and dried my face.  Within a few hours my face was CRAZY oily, way more than normal.  I used an oil absorbing sheet, and within a couple more hours my skin was slick again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So unfortunately for me, this mist will not work.  I love the way it feels when you spritz it on and it certainly feels wonderful on my skin.  It doesn&#x27;t break me out despite the bizarre oiliness it causes, but I can&#x27;t stand having to mop up my face every two hours.  Such a shame because I figured a mist wouldn&#x27;t be oily and would be perfect for my sensitive yet acne prone skin.  I&#x27;m going to use it at night only from now on and just shower it off in the morning.  My hunt for a mist that will hydrate without making me oily or breakout continues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soooo cute! No complaints!!! It is very good at moisturizing. I love it so much. I got the sleek mist which I think is for oilier skin but it works fine for me. I adore this!!!</li>
            <li> I decided to order the sleek mist to help make my face less oily. I first put on the mist and then my regular lotion and throughout the day my face got as oily as usual. I then decided to wear the spray, which has a pretty, light scent, alone under my makeup and it did help keep my face from getting so oily! I now replaced my regular lotion with this because it keeps my face feeling moisturized while seemingly keeping my face from getting so oily.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product like this. My skin gets greasy really fast, so I couldn&#x27;t use face cream or it got worse. This is a life saver.</li>
            <li> I love it!! It has a nice soft sent to it and its so cute. It dries quickly and makes my face look less shiny. It fits perfectly in my bag and I love using it during the hot weather as a little cool down. The product came bubble wrapped in a medium sized box, I found the box to be a little to big for the product but I guess better safe then sorry. I would order this again.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and brightening (not whitening). Nicely scented!</li>
            <li> It comes in a nice portable size, perfect for your purse/backpack!  It&#x27;s adorable and feels very refreshing, especially in hot and humid weather.  The smell is light and airy, just like the spray ^.^ also, it gives a brighter look to my face!  I love it!</li>
            <li> I use this everyday i&#x27;m not sure if it doesn&#x27;t anything it makes me feel refresh whenever i use it</li>
            <li> I like the mist is very nice</li>
            <li> I have the Sleek mist. It&#x27;s PERFECT for my combination skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It leaves my skin dewey but not oily!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is light, kind of a fruity smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using it right before you prime your face, and in the later hours when your face needs a pick-me-up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the packaging is suuuuper adorable!</li>
            <li> The fragrance overall is nice. It revitalizes and gives the face a very fresh feel. It&#x27;s a good product. I&#x27;d order it again.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what it does specifically, but it makes my face smell nice, and the packaging is freakin adorable.</li>
            <li> Good product, it does its job and is super cute. Also feels great on the face on a hot day like another review said :)</li>
            <li> I am obsessed with the OLD pocket bunny sleek mist and used it religiously but it turns out, when they repackaged they CHANGED THE FORMULA :-( I am very upset. it used to have the most pleasant light floral fruity refreshing cucumber scent and now it smells like baby powder. I still quite like the scent but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the old one.</li>
            <li> Very cute packaging. I keep it in my purse all the time. Light fine mist. However, I am not a fan of the baby powder smell. I think if I had purchased the other scent I would have given this product 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Love it! It smells nice and feels very good on the face. I bought one for my sister and one for my friend I love it so much. They were thrilled to receive an adorable bunny face spray and love it as well. Definitely reccommend, especially for summer time :)</li>
            <li> Great as a refreshing spray to keep in my purse.</li>
            <li> It shipped and delivered really fast; within a week I think. This is sooo cute! Not only that, it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for people who generally have dry skin, but get really oily if you use lotion. c:</li>
