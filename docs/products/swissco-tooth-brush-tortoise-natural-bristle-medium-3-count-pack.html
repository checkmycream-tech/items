    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This is one of the best toothbrushes I ever used.  </li>
            <li>Still, a great product.</li>
            <li>Looks good and works.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>Good thing</li>
            <li>Love these brushes!</li>
            <li>I use the medium bristle which is great for my teeth and easy on the gums.</li>
            <li>These are a nice substitute.  </li>
            <li>How Amazon remains so popular is puzzling.</li>
            <li>Natural is always the best.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, I plan to try the Fuchs and Smile-brite natural ones to see if I prefer one of the others to this one. :D  </li>
            <li>they are not only beautiful but do a great job of cleaning my teeth.  </li>
            <li>Amazon&#x27;s Shipping and Handling policies are more loathsome than that plague.</li>
            <li>I just ordered 3 more.</li>
            <li>These tortoise shell toothbrushes are a family favorite and everyone loves them.  </li>
            <li>I ordered these with Biotene toothpaste, as it was recommended to me as a better way of removing plaque from teth than nylon brushes and foaming-toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think it would be better at this point to use the bamboo toothbrushes with nylon bristles, than this product.  </li>
            <li>And as the bristle tips wear, they become even more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Great natural toothbrush</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>They work just fine for application used.</li>
            <li>The bristles feel great, while they last.</li>
            <li>The natural bristles have an absolutely wonderful feel in the mouth - soft, comfortable, densely-packed and non-irritating to my gums.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had them for a week and really enjoy the FEEL of the bristle.</li>
            <li>I hope Amazon keeps them available in Prime.</li>
            <li>--which is what I believe Amazon got rich on.</li>
            <li>Needs to be significantly improved.</li>
            <li>The quality isn&#x27;t quite as good, but still pretty high.  </li>
            <li>My teeth feel clean after using it</li>
            <li>Overall good quality</li>
            <li>Your teeth will full like you&#x27;ve just come from the dentist each brush</li>
            <li>I buy good toothbrushes, floss with Reach, and use both a regular toothpaste and SuperSmile and its rinse to keep coffee and tea stains at bay.</li>
            <li>I resent this method tremendously.</li>
            <li>I cannot give you super insightful review yet, as I&#x27;d have to use these longer term.</li>
            <li>I feel  as though I receive such an honest brush.  </li>
            <li>My gums find this medium one nice enough.</li>
            <li>People usually think soft is best</li>
            <li>I really like these neat tortoise toothbrushes!</li>
            <li>Bigger than most brush heads, takes some getting used to.</li>
            <li>These are quality toothbrushes, better than I can find locally.  </li>
            <li>Now that being said the modern day toothbrushes are far much better as far as hygiene goes, ask any dentist worth his salt.</li>
            <li>NOW, if I were to try again--while my teeth dwindle away towards an all liquid diet, I most certainly will have to pay the extra shipping and handling</li>
            <li>The brush is too long and the kids will not be able to use them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tough to reach the back teeth.ural ones to see if I prefer one of the others to this one. :D  </li>
            <li>yet the bristles are very yielding.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient.</li>
            <li>I really thought these handles were wood.  </li>
            <li>I could only return it for a full refund.</li>
            <li>Most of the toothbrushes available are the angled, thickened handles that will not fit into a standard toothbrush holder attached to the wall.  </li>
            <li>These toothbrushes not only fit my holder, they have natural, medium strength bristles.  </li>
            <li>After one normal brushing, this toothbrush literally disintegrated.</li>
            <li>So, this one might need every 3 weeks, and I can live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The natural bristle is much better than the common nylon, but becoming harder to find.</li>
            <li>The natural brush in med.toughened my gums and and cleaned thoroughly!  </li>
            <li>Guess I will use the other two to clean stuff around the house.</li>
            <li>This is my first natural toothbrush and I am hooked, I will never reach for another standard bristle brush again.  </li>
            <li>one.&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat I would add, is that they are on the large size, and some folks with smaller mouths may not like the large brush area.</li>
            <li>I used to use a Koh I Noor natural bristle toothbrush, but I can&#x27;t find them online anymore.  </li>
            <li>Natural bristles take getting used to.</li>
            <li>NO customer service number to use is especially cumbersome unless one wants to call Canada.</li>
            <li>I used one of these brushes far longer than you should use a toothbrush</li>
            <li>I would guess that anyone with sensitive gums would appreciate these.</li>
            <li>Yes, the natural bristles wear faster than plastic....</li>
            <li>I was advised soft might be too soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Vastly superior to the mediocre drugstore varieties.</li>
            <li>The brush surface area is very large, which is good in some ways, but bad</li>
            <li>I still use a small head nylon one to make sure I reach way back where my wisdom teeth grew in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>teeth should have regular cleaning, professionally.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy both artificial bristle brushes and alternate during the day, caues, really, I have no idea which is better.</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy both artificial bristle brushes and alternate during the day, caues, really, I have no idea which is better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These had a long head (larger than the nylon ones you see nowadays), so it might feel odd at first.</li>

            <li> Not a big deal if you live alone, but still a mess.</li>
            <li> The only straight toothbrushes I have found are of poor quality and have very soft bristles.  </li>
            <li> Natural bristle brushes smell a bit odd, but work well.</li>
            <li> As much as I still need HARD toothbrush bristles</li>
            <li> I would really like it in hard bristle.</li>
            <li> and i can tell you, no more bristles will fallout after that initial shedding period.</li>
            <li> something has changed with this product,  bristles are rough and fall out which didn&#x27;t happen with previous orders</li>
            <li> in that it makes it difficult to reach certain places.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I buy them 6 at a time!</li>
            <li> one would not wear Gucci loafers to mow the lawn and you would not wear worn sneakers to a black tie affair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tough to reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> They fall out in a few days.</li>
            <li> Some bristles may fallout but it will stop after a few brushes.</li>
            <li> We were poor and we only saw a dentist when something needed to be pulled.</li>
            <li> This is not a medium bristle it is the equivalent of a hard to extra hard brush that is not good for your gum tissue.  </li>
            <li> I would much rather have a short-lived toothbrush that does NOT abrade and rake my teeth/gums, than a stiff (painful) plastic</li>
            <li> They start off very stiff, but soften up after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Hard to gush over toothbrushes</li>
            <li> I ordered the HARD bristles, not the MEDIUM bristles (which I can get at any drug store) when the order was completed, it came out saying &#x27;medium&#x27; bristles, and by emailing they were already on the way</li>
            <li> The bristles are extremely hard.  </li>
            <li> the weeks it took to waste my time made my teeth much worse off as a result.</li>
            <li> I often wish to get something but in the end refrain from DOUBLING THE COST OF MY ORDER due to the insane &#x27;far from nominal&#x27; shipping and handling charge</li>
            <li> I have tetracycline staining (which can&#x27;t be removed by brushing, anyway, as its internal) from being sickly and lots of antibiotics in my youth.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores, and when I do, 3x what I paid here-thanks Jeff Bezos!</li>
            <li> Since it came in the wrong strength, (not size) I was not allowed to exchange an unopened package.</li>
            <li> Also, didn&#x27;t notice that the head of the brush has an offset elbow bend thing...rather awkward while brushing and causes paste</li>
            <li> Terrible product.</li>
            <li> Awful!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> something has changed with this product,  bristles are rough and fall out which didn&#x27;t happen with previous orders</li>
            <li> I really like these neat tortoise toothbrushes! I order them often and have never had a problem! Hard to gush over toothbrushes but they get the job done!!</li>
            <li> I used to use a Koh I Noor natural bristle toothbrush, but I can&#x27;t find them online anymore.  These are a nice substitute.  The quality isn&#x27;t quite as good, but still pretty high.  They start off very stiff, but soften up after a few uses.  Can&#x27;t beat the price, either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even chosen to order these for the holidays.  these tooth brushes are so solid.  even the handle seems weighty.  I feel  as though I receive such an honest brush.  yet the bristles are very yielding.  I recommend these tooth brush.</li>
            <li> Natural bristles take getting used to. The brush surface area is very large, which is good in some ways, but bad in that it makes it difficult to reach certain places.  Overall good quality</li>
            <li> Since it came in the wrong strength, (not size) I was not allowed to exchange an unopened package.I could only return it for a full refund. This is a product I do not want to have it is a product i NEED to have so the weeks it took to waste my time made my teeth much worse off as a result. I searched this product multiple times, finally agreed to get it even though in order to waive the shipping I had to &#x27;JOIN&#x27; something. Amazon&#x27;s Shipping and Handling policies are more loathsome than that plague. I often wish to get something but in the end refrain from DOUBLING THE COST OF MY ORDER due to the insane &#x27;far from nominal&#x27; shipping and handling charge--which is what I believe Amazon got rich on. I ordered the HARD bristles, not the MEDIUM bristles (which I can get at any drug store) when the order was completed, it came out saying &#x27;medium&#x27; bristles, and by emailing they were already on the way so the time wasting began. As much as I still need HARD toothbrush bristles I wouldn&#x27;t trust Amazon again. NO customer service number to use is especially cumbersome unless one wants to call Canada. And I do not care for your version of calling the customer--it&#x27;s just a way for you to collect information. I resent this method tremendously. NOW, if I were to try again--while my teeth dwindle away towards an all liquid diet, I most certainly will have to pay the extra shipping and handling and I won&#x27;t hear of it. How Amazon remains so popular is puzzling.</li>
            <li> Terrible product. The bristles feel great, while they last. They fall out in a few days. Also, didn&#x27;t notice that the head of the brush has an offset elbow bend thing...rather awkward while brushing and causes paste/spit to dribble out of your mouth and all over the handle and your hand so you look like you don&#x27;t know how to brush your teeth. Not a big deal if you live alone, but still a mess. Don&#x27;t buy these!</li>
            <li> People usually think soft is best but it isn&#x27;t. The natural brush in med.toughened my gums and and cleaned thoroughly!  I would really like it in hard bristle.</li>
            <li> Natural bristle brushes smell a bit odd, but work well.</li>
            <li> A brush made from animal hair, and you stick this product in your mouth. Sounds gross, works like a charm. Bigger than most brush heads, takes some getting used to. Still, a great product.</li>
            <li> Natural is always the best.</li>
            <li> Looks good and works. Some bristles may fallout but it will stop after a few brushes. I used one of these brushes far longer than you should use a toothbrush and i can tell you, no more bristles will fallout after that initial shedding period.</li>
            <li> i adore these toothbrushes! they are not only beautiful but do a great job of cleaning my teeth.  100% recommend.</li>

I would guess that anyone with sensitive gums would appreciate these. And as the bristle tips wear, they become even more comfortable. Yes, the natural bristles wear faster than plastic....WHO CARES? It&#x27;s not like these are breaking the bank or anything. I would much rather have a short-lived toothbrush that does NOT abrade and rake my teeth/gums, than a stiff (painful) plastic one.&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat I would add, is that they are on the large size, and some folks with smaller mouths may not like the large brush area. Other than that, I buy them 6 at a time!</li>
            <li> These tortoise shell toothbrushes are a family favorite and everyone loves them.  We plan to purchase them again.</li>
            <li> This is my first natural toothbrush and I am hooked, I will never reach for another standard bristle brush again.  Your teeth will full like you&#x27;ve just come from the dentist each brush and it seems like your mouth stays fresher longer.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best toothbrushes I ever used.  Will never go back to an un-natural toothbrush again.</li>
            <li> Loved it. My teeth feel clean after using it</li>
            <li> Great natural toothbrush</li>
            <li> I cannot give you super insightful review yet, as I&#x27;d have to use these longer term. I ordered these with Biotene toothpaste, as it was recommended to me as a better way of removing plaque from teth than nylon brushes and foaming-toothpaste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had them for a week and really enjoy the FEEL of the bristle. It took a couple days to get used to it, but now I kinda look forward to brushing, cause, here&#x27;s the thing: My teeth look marginally, but noticeably whiter, when I use these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have troublesome and unattractive teeth since childhood. We were poor and we only saw a dentist when something needed to be pulled. I didn&#x27;t even know teeth should have regular cleaning, professionally. I have tetracycline staining (which can&#x27;t be removed by brushing, anyway, as its internal) from being sickly and lots of antibiotics in my youth. And I drink tons of coffee and tea, hence stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me to NOTICE that teeth look LIGHTER just from changing toothbrushes was a revelation. I buy good toothbrushes, floss with Reach, and use both a regular toothpaste and SuperSmile and its rinse to keep coffee and tea stains at bay. With this toothbrush, I don&#x27;t have to use SuperSmile as often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, this is not to say I have WHITE TEETH. It&#x27;s just lighter using this than my nylon brushes. My gums find this medium one nice enough. I was advised soft might be too soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can tell these will wear out faster than my  nylon brushes. That&#x27;s fine. I change my nylon brushes once a month (was recommended by dentist to do this). So, this one might need every 3 weeks, and I can live with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These had a long head (larger than the nylon ones you see nowadays), so it might feel odd at first. I still use a small head nylon one to make sure I reach way back where my wisdom teeth grew in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like these brushes. I hope Amazon keeps them available in Prime. Very convenient. In the meantime, I plan to try the Fuchs and Smile-brite natural ones to see if I prefer one of the others to this one. :D  I will continue to buy both artificial bristle brushes and alternate during the day, caues, really, I have no idea which is better. But I notice a difference when I use THIS brush....and hopefully it&#x27;s not an illusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star off is for the shape of the head. It&#x27;s tough to reach the back teeth.ural ones to see if I prefer one of the others to this one. :D  I will continue to buy both artificial bristle brushes and alternate during the day, caues, really, I have no idea which is better.

            <li> After one normal brushing, this toothbrush literally disintegrated. When I went to use it the next morning, I found the plastic head and bristles had come apart. The plastic holding the rows of bristles had separated and the bristles were scattered. Good thing this didn&#x27;t happen during brushing...never seen anything like this. Awful!</li>
            <li> This is the 2nd batch I have purchased. They work just fine for application used. I use these personally but also as a prop in photography citing their vintage appearance....Now that being said the modern day toothbrushes are far much better as far as hygiene goes, ask any dentist worth his salt. So I have both on hand in house. I would compare this to shoes....one would not wear Gucci loafers to mow the lawn and you would not wear worn sneakers to a black tie affair.</li>
            <li> I really thought these handles were wood.  They look like wood, but they are not.  The bristles are extremely hard.  This is not a medium bristle it is the equivalent of a hard to extra hard brush that is not good for your gum tissue.  The brush is too long and the kids will not be able to use them.  I think it would be better at this point to use the bamboo toothbrushes with nylon bristles, than this product.  Needs to be significantly improved.</li>
