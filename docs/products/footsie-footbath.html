            <li>It heats up well, though it takes a minute to warm and all the warmth is under the feet.</li>

            <li>All in all, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>After trying it I was completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>i wonder if the metal basket is better at that.</li>
            <li>Love the basket for the liners.</li>
            <li>I was expecting much more from this product.</li>
            <li>Love this foit bath .I am a nail tech of 26 yrs and the bath with liners</li>

            <li>Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>I love this spa, both my size 12 feet fit nicely.</li>
            <li>The Footsie Bath keeps the client&#x27;s feet warm with the adjustable temperature control, but the water itself tends to get cool after 40 minutes or so.</li>
            <li>I love the basket and liners, so easy to fill and use.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it keeps the water nice &amp; warm</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t heat the water but more like keeping it warm for maybe 30-40 mins depending on how hot you start ..</li>
            <li>The footsie bath is so much better than the cheap alternative, I can&#x27;t imagine doing a pedicure without it.</li>
            <li>looks cute and really light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Heat</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>The cord is retractable for easy storage.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to travel with as it does not take up a lot of space.</li>
            <li>so easy to use if you do not have plumbing set up.</li>
            <li>Easy to use without having to spend a lot of time cleaning.</li>
            <li>I like the easy clean-up</li>

            <li>keeps the water warm but not so hot it hurts my feet.</li>

            <li>A lot of ladies do enjoy that.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li>The smell of burning plastic filled the room.  </li>
            <li>and that was an important factor for me.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a cheap drug store tub.</li>
            <li>Works great so far and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Thank you and Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li>I wanted a quiet, warm foot soak and I got it with this one!  </li>
            <li>no need to clean out a tub or worry about fungus/ bacteria stuck in jets.</li>
            <li>a on location spa its clean</li>
            <li>This product is only good for the refills the and travel the bottom gets to hot without hearing the water, only if you start with warm water the heat does keep it warm 4 about 35 min.</li>
            <li>My husband has large feet (size 13) and they fit within the tub without any issues!  </li>
            <li>not wide enough would&#x27;ve been perfect for my services if it wasn&#x27;t for that.</li>
            <li>and I work in a very small space so this footbath is PERFECT for me!</li>
            <li>It does keep the water nice and hot (you must start with hot water, so fill it in the bath first).</li>
            <li>The disposable liners make clean up between clients fast and easy.</li>
            <li>With that in mind, you must work quickly to ensure you are not giving your client (or yourself) a cool/cold pedicure.</li>
            <li>This item is pretty light weight</li>
            <li>Exactly what is needed for pedicures!</li>
            <li>The liners didn&#x27;t fit very well in it.  </li>
            <li>Since I am a size 13W shoe size I was very apprehensive whether or not my feet would be comfortable in the footsie Bath.</li>
            <li>The pull out tray and liner is a great concept, especially for those who plan to use this professionally.  </li>
            <li>Spend the money, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li>but so far she love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li>As a professional pedicurist, I love this spa.  </li>
            <li>The cord could be a little longer, just to allow better access to more areas.</li>
            <li>The vibration is weak, but the heat maintenance is very very good.</li>
            <li>ok, and the liners while cheap at a dollar a piece, must be bought in a pack of 100 (thus why I clean the liners for a few uses).</li>
            <li>Shipping Was Very Fast.</li>
            <li>It gets really hot under my feet.</li>
            <li>I loved this foot bath for the first few months.</li>
            <li>I would have preferred move vibration, but was more than willing to trade the extra heating for the motion.</li>
            <li>shipped fast!</li>
            <li>The individual plastic liners are much more sanitary</li>
            <li>However, it would be easier to start out with hot water as I did and maintain the water temperature with the heating element.  </li>
            <li>I am quite pleased overall, though.</li>
            <li>A regular foot bath from a pharmacy or department store does a better job.</li>
            <li>Its not its plastic .2..lower the temp , cause when only one liner at a tine is used .People with more weight to them will feel the heat on the bottom of there feet .</li>
            <li>I tried it for the first time and the bath started melting.  </li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li>Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li>The first one I purchased from Amazon DID not work.  </li>
            <li>I have so far come across two that had holes in them &amp; soaked me after I filled them.</li>
            <li>The vibrate feature is very poor at best.</li>
            <li>First off the seller of this product was very prompt in sending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally submit many reviews but thought future buyers should beware.</li>
            <li>There are certain parasites like fungus</li>
            <li>Thanks alot</li>
            <li>Not as much vibration as I like but the heat element works well.  </li>
            <li>I must say it is deep and does keep the water warm enough for a foot soak.</li>
            <li>Easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;Just want to mention that when heat and vibrate are on together it is a bit noisy, I usually just have the heat</li>
            <li>I love this pedicure item, like the fact that it is sanitary due to the disposable inserts but the price is too high for them.  </li>
            <li>Ialso highly recommend this for people who don&#x27;t want the hassle of keeping a standard (jetted) pedicure tub clean.</li>
            <li>the vibration is pretty gentle, but also pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>usually I have another pitcher to pour more hot water in...</li>
            <li>Others too shallow and when you have to add MORE HOT WATER</li>
            <li>When im finished with a client i just dispose of the liner and put a new one.</li>
            <li>This was supposed to be a professional quality foot bath.</li>
            <li>My manicurist has used this bucket professionally for years now.  </li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve returned others that were so loud even if you weren&#x27;t using the vibration/massage.)  </li>
            <li>It heats very well and vibrates for a soothing, refreshing treatment for sore, tired, achey feet.</li>
            <li>Item arrived broken, the box it came in looked liked it travled the universe.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted me about 9 years before it finally gave out which is far longer than I was expecting it to last!</li>
            <li>deep enough to cover the whole foot and ankle</li>
            <li>one thing I do like is the metal carry out, that way you don&#x27;t actually have to carry the whole tub.. very quiet too</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t have jets, but the liners mean no nasty fungus or mold, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Again the water does get cold after a while BUT plenty of room to add more hot.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only been used once so far.</li>
            <li>(I wouldn&#x27;t do that if I was a professional but only one or two people use it).</li>
            <li>The vibrating barely vibrates</li>
            <li>They can crack and leak if your&#x27;re not careful separating them for each pedi.</li>
            <li>cons: barely heats or vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;pros:</li>
            <li>removable liners, wire lift to empty water, and deep enough for whole feet and ankles</li>
            <li>what kinda funny is that although the tub is smaller htan my previous one, every client comments on how big and deep it is.</li>
            <li>however after only a few months of use, first it quit vibrating at all</li>
            <li>Pleased with the heating function but the vibration on the unit seems very weak.  </li>

            <li> The smell of burning plastic filled the room.  </li>
            <li> and that was an important factor for me.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a cheap drug store tub.</li>
            <li> Works great so far and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Thank you and Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted a quiet, warm foot soak and I got it with this one!  </li>
            <li> no need to clean out a tub or worry about fungus/ bacteria stuck in jets.</li>
            <li> a on location spa its clean</li>
            <li> This product is only good for the refills the and travel the bottom gets to hot without hearing the water, only if you start with warm water the heat does keep it warm 4 about 35 min.</li>
            <li> My husband has large feet (size 13) and they fit within the tub without any issues!  </li>
            <li> not wide enough would&#x27;ve been perfect for my services if it wasn&#x27;t for that.</li>
            <li> and I work in a very small space so this footbath is PERFECT for me!</li>
            <li> It does keep the water nice and hot (you must start with hot water, so fill it in the bath first).</li>
            <li> The disposable liners make clean up between clients fast and easy.</li>
            <li> With that in mind, you must work quickly to ensure you are not giving your client (or yourself) a cool/cold pedicure.</li>
            <li> This item is pretty light weight</li>
            <li> Exactly what is needed for pedicures!</li>
            <li> The liners didn&#x27;t fit very well in it.  </li>
            <li> Since I am a size 13W shoe size I was very apprehensive whether or not my feet would be comfortable in the footsie Bath.</li>
            <li> The pull out tray and liner is a great concept, especially for those who plan to use this professionally.  </li>
            <li> Spend the money, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> but so far she love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> As a professional pedicurist, I love this spa.  </li>
            <li> The cord could be a little longer, just to allow better access to more areas.</li>
            <li> The vibration is weak, but the heat maintenance is very very good.</li>
            <li> ok, and the liners while cheap at a dollar a piece, must be bought in a pack of 100 (thus why I clean the liners for a few uses).</li>
            <li> Shipping Was Very Fast.</li>
            <li> It gets really hot under my feet.</li>
            <li> I loved this foot bath for the first few months.</li>
            <li> I would have preferred move vibration, but was more than willing to trade the extra heating for the motion.</li>
            <li> shipped fast!</li>
            <li> The individual plastic liners are much more sanitary</li>
            <li> However, it would be easier to start out with hot water as I did and maintain the water temperature with the heating element.  </li>
            <li> I am quite pleased overall, though.</li>
            <li> A regular foot bath from a pharmacy or department store does a better job.</li>
            <li> Its not its plastic .2..lower the temp , cause when only one liner at a tine is used .People with more weight to them will feel the heat on the bottom of there feet .</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time and the bath started melting.  </li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> The first one I purchased from Amazon DID not work.  </li>
            <li> I have so far come across two that had holes in them &amp; soaked me after I filled them.</li>
            <li> The vibrate feature is very poor at best.</li>
            <li> First off the seller of this product was very prompt in sending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally submit many reviews but thought future buyers should beware.</li>
            <li> There are certain parasites like fungus</li>
            <li> Thanks alot</li>
            <li> Not as much vibration as I like but the heat element works well.  </li>
            <li> I must say it is deep and does keep the water warm enough for a foot soak.</li>
            <li> Easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;Just want to mention that when heat and vibrate are on together it is a bit noisy, I usually just have the heat</li>
            <li> I love this pedicure item, like the fact that it is sanitary due to the disposable inserts but the price is too high for them.  </li>
            <li> Ialso highly recommend this for people who don&#x27;t want the hassle of keeping a standard (jetted) pedicure tub clean.</li>
            <li> the vibration is pretty gentle, but also pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> usually I have another pitcher to pour more hot water in...</li>
            <li> Others too shallow and when you have to add MORE HOT WATER</li>
            <li> When im finished with a client i just dispose of the liner and put a new one.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a professional quality foot bath.</li>
            <li> My manicurist has used this bucket professionally for years now.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve returned others that were so loud even if you weren&#x27;t using the vibration/massage.)  </li>
            <li> It heats very well and vibrates for a soothing, refreshing treatment for sore, tired, achey feet.</li>
            <li> Item arrived broken, the box it came in looked liked it travled the universe.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted me about 9 years before it finally gave out which is far longer than I was expecting it to last!</li>
            <li> deep enough to cover the whole foot and ankle</li>
            <li> one thing I do like is the metal carry out, that way you don&#x27;t actually have to carry the whole tub.. very quiet too</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t have jets, but the liners mean no nasty fungus or mold, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Again the water does get cold after a while BUT plenty of room to add more hot.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only been used once so far.</li>
            <li> (I wouldn&#x27;t do that if I was a professional but only one or two people use it).</li>
            <li> The vibrating barely vibrates</li>
            <li> They can crack and leak if your&#x27;re not careful separating them for each pedi.</li>
            <li> cons: barely heats or vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;pros:</li>
            <li> removable liners, wire lift to empty water, and deep enough for whole feet and ankles</li>
            <li> what kinda funny is that although the tub is smaller htan my previous one, every client comments on how big and deep it is.</li>
            <li> however after only a few months of use, first it quit vibrating at all</li>
            <li> Pleased with the heating function but the vibration on the unit seems very weak.  </li>
            <li> I use it for personal use, so just rinse the insert and try to use as long as I can...</li>
            <li> Not great not bad.</li>
            <li> If the unit was on long enough (a really long time), it could have warmed up the water.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful that this product only heat and vibrate.&lt;br</li>
            <li> have only two star because I expected the bubble.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Stays hotter then any other portable tubs but still does get cold.love the deep tub.</li>
            <li> Minimal vibrate.</li>
            <li> not fast,  </li>
            <li> I did not give this product all 5 stars because when I received the product, it was cosmetically damaged due to the packaging from the manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> The shop that I work at unfortunately does not have room for the large pedicure thrones.</li>
            <li> It makes it even lighter to carry and makes less noise because there&#x27;s no metal rattling when it&#x27;s in vibrating mode.</li>
            <li> The box was previously opened and had been resealed.  </li>
            <li> The heat aspect is unpredictable.  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s never too hot or too cold.  </li>
            <li> But it is weak enough for us to wonder if this one is defective.  </li>
            <li> If you wash out the liner with a little bleach you can use them again</li>
            <li> The only downsides are the vibration is a little weak, but</li>
            <li> but I find the liners a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> If you have room you can store the liners AFTER cleaning them per customer and reuse them a few times.</li>
            <li> It is missing the spa effects because  of the liners which are costly@ $1.00 each.</li>
            <li> Super disappointed as it shows a metal tray.</li>
            <li> but there was hardly any vibration at all.  </li>
            <li> It is hard to relax when you have to keep adjusting the heat setting.  </li>
            <li> highly recommend NOT to buy this item. :(</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the liners are expensive and you have to buy in bulk!!  </li>
            <li> Not happy thay should explain what the basket is made of in the direction.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe something used for water and electricity could be so poorly made.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid a pedicurist would go broke with products like this.</li>
            <li> Again the water will get cold with the heat turned up to the highest setting.</li>
            <li> I wish the liners didn&#x27;t stick so bad in the stack.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m stuck with it for now :(</li>
            <li> But again I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  </li>
            <li> I just opened my package and I&#x27;m EXTREMELY disappointed that the basket isn&#x27;t metal.  </li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this product.</li>
            <li> the disposable liners are very expensive!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very disappointed.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> So bummed the heat doesn&#x27;t work ! I don&#x27;t have a back up in my salon so I can&#x27;t send it off and the closest place to buy a foot bath is an hour and a 1/2 away so I&#x27;m stuck with it for now :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t bubble just a lil vibration!! However it does keep the water heated! Right now this works for me &amp; my clients!!! Thank you and Fast delivery!!!</li>
            <li> I love this pedicure item, like the fact that it is sanitary due to the disposable inserts but the price is too high for them.  The price needs to be lowered. However, I will purchase them because you must have them to use and I love the footsie spa.</li>
            <li> Perfect for My Housecalls, got it super duper... Quick! Thanks alot</li>
            <li> Luv luv my husband and I love this foot spa, heat is very good, great space</li>
            <li> Well im testing out my footsie bath at the moment. I like it only for the hygienic purposes. When im finished with a client i just dispose of the liner and put a new one. The vibration is weak, but the heat maintenance is very very good. It gets really hot under my feet. Wish it had bubbles</li>
            <li> Fantastic! My nail tech says it does a great job keeping the water hot, and it looked nice. I also like the retractable cord.</li>
            <li> Very cheap looking. You can purchase for your own home. Not for salon use.</li>
            <li> Shipping Was Very Fast. Product Works Great Thank You</li>
            <li> Best foot spa ever.  Keeps water warm plus very convenient and easy to clean</li>
            <li> Keeps  warm fast shipping. Wish the vibration worked better</li>
            <li> Works great so far and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my girlfriend who is entering the nail care trade.  Pleased with the heating function but the vibration on the unit seems very weak.  Do not have another of the same model to compare.  But it is weak enough for us to wonder if this one is defective.  The retractable cord feature is nice as well as the plastic insert liners.  Would give five stars if the vibration was stronger.</li>
            <li> Great bath, my wife loves it for her shop</li>
            <li> Does not keep water warm and virtual no vibration</li>
            <li> It is excellent.  Love the disposable liners.  It arrived promptly.  Would recommend it to anyone to be used professionally or personally.</li>
            <li> I like the footsie bath but I don&#x27;t like that it doesn&#x27;t bubble the water. It does keep the water warm though</li>
            <li> I loved this foot bath for the first few months. it was everything I was looking for. deep enough to cover the whole foot and ankle and it actually heated the water. I would have preferred move vibration, but was more than willing to trade the extra heating for the motion. however after only a few months of use, first it quit vibrating at all and then the heat quit. This was supposed to be a professional quality foot bath. I&#x27;m afraid a pedicurist would go broke with products like this.</li>
            <li> Works good the vibration clients like be great if it bubbled some. The liners are the best sanitary measure to offer clients.</li>
            <li> This is a great footsie bath brand everyone in my salon uses this! Comes with liners to get you started! shipped fast!</li>
            <li> I love it!  But if it came w/a jet it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> Plastic carrying tray. Super disappointed as it shows a metal tray.</li>
            <li> My daughter is very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Love this and so do my clients.</li>
            <li> It met all my expectations!</li>
            <li> First off the seller of this product was very prompt in sending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed.  I am a Student Nail Tech and getting my products together.  This product didn&#x27;t vibrate at all.  Not sure about the heat because I started with hot water.  I knew I wouldn&#x27;t get the bubbling effect but there was hardly any vibration at all.  My basket was not wire like the picture it was plastic.  The liners didn&#x27;t fit very well in it.  And with the cost of these liners, they need to fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really thought this was one of the best one out there.  But again I was disappointed. So I returned it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for mobile techs, not heavy or bulky. Minimal vibrate. Overall great buy! And sanitary!</li>
            <li> This is actually the second Footsie Footbath I&#x27;ve had. The first one lasted me about 9 years before it finally gave out which is far longer than I was expecting it to last! I chose this brand over the others because of the great quality and equally great price. I love that they&#x27;ve replaced the wire basket with a plastic one. It makes it even lighter to carry and makes less noise because there&#x27;s no metal rattling when it&#x27;s in vibrating mode. I am a nail tech and I work in a very small space so this footbath is PERFECT for me! Ialso highly recommend this for people who don&#x27;t want the hassle of keeping a standard (jetted) pedicure tub clean. The individual plastic liners are much more sanitary and it makes my clients very happy to know that every liner I use is a new one! I just dump the water out and at the end if the week, I take all of the used liners home to put in the recycle bin. I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else for my pedicures!</li>
            <li> I purchased this product ultimately for my husband.  My husband has large feet (size 13) and they fit within the tub without any issues!  The pull out tray and liner is a great concept, especially for those who plan to use this professionally.  It does make cleaning up a lot easier.  I did not think the vibration mode was very effective.  The heating element did a great job of heating up the lower portion of the tub to the point where it started to hurt my feet.  If the unit was on long enough (a really long time), it could have warmed up the water.  However, it would be easier to start out with hot water as I did and maintain the water temperature with the heating element.  I did not give this product all 5 stars because when I received the product, it was cosmetically damaged due to the packaging from the manufacturer.  All in all, I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Since I am a size 13W shoe size I was very apprehensive whether or not my feet would be comfortable in the footsie Bath. After trying it I was completely satisfied.Great item.</li>
            <li> The basket was plastic not metal. Not happy thay should explain what the basket is made of in the direction.</li>
            <li> Confession: it&#x27;s only been used once so far. I bought this for my mother for Christmas and I recently gave her a pedicure. This item is pretty light weight and it&#x27;s easy to use. It does keep the water nice and hot (you must start with hot water, so fill it in the bath first). I LOOOVE the fact that it has liners. It&#x27;s too bad it doesn&#x27;t have jets, but the liners mean no nasty fungus or mold, and it&#x27;s so easy to clean. If you wash out the liner with a little bleach you can use them again (I wouldn&#x27;t do that if I was a professional but only one or two people use it). The only downsides are the vibration is a little weak, but ok, and the liners while cheap at a dollar a piece, must be bought in a pack of 100 (thus why I clean the liners for a few uses). The retractable cord is great, and it&#x27;s so easy to set up and put away.</li>
            <li> It was broken when I received it. So I am unsure of how it actually works.</li>
            <li> I returned this ideam the day after I recieved it and even put information in computer and have nothing back from them, which means I still have not gotten my refund and its been 3 three weeks.</li>
            <li> everything about it is pretty dang good, better than when it first came out. one drawback, using the frame with the liners prevents the heating element from coming in contact with the liner, so the water cools off. not fast,  but it doesn&#x27;t hold the heat especially well. only drawback. i wonder if the metal basket is better at that. the one that came with this tub is a plastic one. I am quite pleased overall, though. i use this in a day spa setting. what kinda funny is that although the tub is smaller htan my previous one, every client comments on how big and deep it is. lol.</li>
            <li> Doing pedicures for 20yrs. Here is my review after using this tub for 7 yrs. PROS-  no need to clean out a tub or worry about fungus/ bacteria stuck in jets. Love the basket for the liners. Stays hotter then any other portable tubs but still does get cold.love the deep tub. Others too shallow and when you have to add MORE HOT WATER it splashes all over the floor.&lt;br /&gt;CONS- no bubbles or Jets. A lot of ladies do enjoy that. Liners do crack and leak.I use 2 liners at once. If you have room you can store the liners AFTER cleaning them per customer and reuse them a few times. Again the water does get cold after a while BUT plenty of room to add more hot.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with this product. It is missing the spa effects because  of the liners which are costly@ $1.00 each. The vibrating is next to nothing. I must say it is deep and does keep the water warm enough for a foot soak. I was expecting much more from this product. It is misleading to call it a &amp;#34;footsie spa&amp;#34;, it is simply a foot tub.  I am a traveling cosmetologist and I was look for a product that offer the effects of a mini foot spa. A regular foot bath from a pharmacy or department store does a better job. The only attraction it has is the disposable liners.</li>
            <li> Love this foit bath .I am a nail tech of 26 yrs and the bath with liners is the best way to go . The only issue is 1. Its listed as a metal basket. Its not its plastic .2..lower the temp , cause when only one liner at a tine is used .People with more weight to them will feel the heat on the bottom of there feet . Otherwise I would buy another and  shipping was great and Fast!!</li>
            <li> keeps water warm and clients love the vibrations.</li>
            <li> I received the product in a timely manner. I love this product. It is easy to use and clean up.</li>
            <li> I tried it for the first time and the bath started melting.  The smell of burning plastic filled the room.  I&#x27;m can&#x27;t emphasize enough that it I had not noticed and water had gotten into those exposed burnt away electrics then a life could have been at risk via eletrocution.  I can&#x27;t believe something used for water and electricity could be so poorly made.  I have photos to back this up and will post asap.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted...</li>
            <li> This is the best pedicure bucket I have owned. The heating element is awesome.  It keeps water warm for over an hour. It has adjustable heating element so it&#x27;s never too hot or too cold.  The cord is retractable for easy storage.  The foot bath liners are recyclable too!  My manicurist has used this bucket professionally for years now.  Spend the money, it&#x27;s so worth it.</li>
            <li> I purchased my Footise Bath almost a month ago. I am a mobile nail technician and I love it! It&#x27;s lightweight and easy to travel with as it does not take up a lot of space. The disposable liners make clean up between clients fast and easy. The only complaints that I have are 1) the disposable liners are very expensive! I have found the cheapest ones on Amazon. 2) The Footsie Bath keeps the client&#x27;s feet warm with the adjustable temperature control, but the water itself tends to get cool after 40 minutes or so. With that in mind, you must work quickly to ensure you are not giving your client (or yourself) a cool/cold pedicure. Other than that, I love it!</li>
            <li> Just what I was expecting</li>
            <li> I bought two of these for my salon.  They work great!  It saves me time in sanitation and documenting.  I no longer have to worry about State Board critiquing as everything is disposable!  Love it!  It heats very well and vibrates for a soothing, refreshing treatment for sore, tired, achey feet.</li>
            <li> The vibrating barely vibrates so don&#x27;t count on that... it doesn&#x27;t heat the water but more like keeping it warm for maybe 30-40 mins depending on how hot you start .. usually I have another pitcher to pour more hot water in... one thing I do like is the metal carry out, that way you don&#x27;t actually have to carry the whole tub.. very quiet too</li>
            <li> This is perfect for mobile nails or even for a on location spa its clean the liners are great easy to carry and sanitary the bubbles you can make by adding some bubble bath to it and swishing the water my clients rather have the sanitation versus the jets and the seller was great!</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need.  I wish the liners didn&#x27;t stick so bad in the stack.  They can crack and leak if your&#x27;re not careful separating them for each pedi.</li>
            <li> Item arrived broken, the box it came in looked liked it travled the universe.  No return lables.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend NOT to buy this item. :(</li>
            <li> so easy to use if you do not have plumbing set up. clients love it too</li>
            <li> Bought this for my daughter who just graduated from nail school, she is using it in the salon. Only had it for 3 weeks but so far she love&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my footsie spa bath.  I love the basket and liners, so easy to fill and use.  My clients are assured that they are not going to contract any foot diseases. Easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;Just want to mention that when heat and vibrate are on together it is a bit noisy, I usually just have the heat on.&lt;br /&gt;All in all very glad I purchased this through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Great delivery time as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> This works well. The vibration is strong. It heats up well, though it takes a minute to warm and all the warmth is under the feet. The cord could be a little longer, just to allow better access to more areas.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this foot bath. Easy to use without having to spend a lot of time cleaning. Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my store.  The first one I purchased from Amazon DID not work.  The box was previously opened and had been resealed.  I sent it back and purchased another foot bath form Sally Beauty supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I purchased this foot bath is the disposable liners.  I found this to be a better sanitary solution than trying to disinfect the foot bath.  There are certain parasites like fungus that alcohol or bleach will not kill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liners are a bit pricey but that can be made up in the price charged to the client.</li>
            <li> cons: barely heats or vibrates.&lt;br /&gt;pros: removable liners, wire lift to empty water, and deep enough for whole feet and ankles</li>
            <li> I bought this model from this seller specifically because the written description said that it came with a metal basket, it arrived with a flimsy plastic basket which would have been acceptable if the bath had worked as advertised. The vibrate feature is very poor at best. I bought the Footsie Bath because it was described as having a very good heat feature for keeping the water hot. Again the water will get cold with the heat turned up to the highest setting. I could have bought a plastic tub for a few dollars and accomplished the same thing and kept a hundred dollars in my pocket. Do not buy this unit. I don&#x27;t normally submit many reviews but thought future buyers should beware.</li>
            <li> not wide enough would&#x27;ve been perfect for my services if it wasn&#x27;t for that.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I work at a salon with no spa chair.... This is great because it is easy to store, it stays warm and there is no cleaning involved, you just toss and go!  My only complaint is that the liners are expensive and you have to buy in bulk!!  It would be nice to sell them in 25 or 50 packs for those of us that dont need 100 liners at once!</li>
            <li> I wanted a quiet, warm foot soak and I got it with this one!  I don&#x27;t use the vibrator part, I wanted it quiet... the vibration is pretty gentle, but also pretty quiet. (I&#x27;ve returned others that were so loud even if you weren&#x27;t using the vibration/massage.)  This one comes with the plastic inserts and metal carrier, which I think you have to have.  I use it for personal use, so just rinse the insert and try to use as long as I can...</li>
            <li> This product is only good for the refills the and travel the bottom gets to hot without hearing the water, only if you start with warm water the heat does keep it warm 4 about 35 min.</li>
            <li> Exactly what is needed for pedicures!</li>
            <li> I like it but I find the liners a little flimsy. I have so far come across two that had holes in them &amp; soaked me after I filled them. I really like that it keeps the water nice &amp; warm &amp; I don&#x27;t have to rush thru a pedicure.</li>
            <li> Not as much vibration as I like but the heat element works well.  I like the easy clean-up and that was an important factor for me.  Not great not bad.</li>
            <li> Disappointed.  The vibration aspect is no substitute for a massage.  The heat aspect is unpredictable.  It is hard to relax when you have to keep adjusting the heat setting.  Big buyer&#x27;s regret.  Here.</li>
            <li> As a professional pedicurist, I love this spa.  The shop that I work at unfortunately does not have room for the large pedicure thrones. I purchased this to replace a cheap drug store tub. The footsie bath is so much better than the cheap alternative, I can&#x27;t imagine doing a pedicure without it.</li>
            <li> These spas are so convenient and the linets make sanitation EASY and THOROUGH!!</li>
            <li> Great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> I love this spa, both my size 12 feet fit nicely. keeps the water warm but not so hot it hurts my feet.</li>
            <li> I just opened my package and I&#x27;m EXTREMELY disappointed that the basket isn&#x27;t metal.  If I have any further issues I WILL RETURN and look elsewhere for a metal basket.</li>
            <li> Just be careful that this product only heat and vibrate.&lt;br /&gt;There is no bubble comes out.&lt;br /&gt;I saw a bubble on the product&#x27;s website but it was actually soap or something else.&lt;br /&gt;It looks cute and really light weight.&lt;br /&gt;Heat up quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have only two star because I expected the bubble.&lt;br /&gt;But the product itself is great.</li>
