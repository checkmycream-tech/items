            <li> Very soft! I love it!!</li>
            <li> I am truly enjoying this product. I have been a Jergens user for years, but my skin needed a change of product. Not greasy and moisturizes nicely. Arrived as expected.</li>
            <li> This lotion is the best for my dry skin in Arizona</li>
            <li> Love it!  Best price and I have looked everywhere!</li>

            <li> This lotion is Unbelievable- the amount of moisture it will give your skin is unreal. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly my skin was repaired and became soft again - I can honestly say I&#x27;ve never seen a lotion moisturize quite like this. The scent is wonderful not strong in the least just a faint fresh and clean smell.</li>
            <li> Really great product!!!&lt;br /&gt;My brother has very very dry skin and especially when he travel to dry country, his skin would crack! After using this product, his skin is so moisturized! It&#x27;s even glowing! The females in the family are all trying to &#x27;steal&#x27; some of his lotions!</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  When I put the lotion on  - it absorbs into the skin and leaving it smooth and smelling good.  It&#x27;s great for my skin and my elbows are nice an smooth now.  Even talked my husband into using it.</li>
            <li> My spouse and I have been using this product for over 25 years.  I agree with all the other 5 star reviewers.  For a non-SPF, all around lotion, this is the best.</li>

            <li> Very happy with product.</li>
            <li> I wish they still made the uncented version of this product which I can&#x27;t find anywhere.  Scent is a little too much for my husband who has sensitive skin and olfactory senses.</li>
