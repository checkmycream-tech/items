            <li>Great residue-free cleaning capability.</li>

            <li>Aveeno by and large makes wonderful products, and these cleansing pads are among the very best.     </li>
            <li>(I got a good deal at Wal-mart, shhh)</li>
            <li>This is my favorite side!  </li>
            <li>This is amazing, no product has done this.  </li>

            <li>These are nice cleansing pads.</li>
            <li>the absolute best!!</li>
            <li>and Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleansing Pads, 28-Count Pads (Pack of 3) had so many wonderful endorsements from the best of the best reviewers</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that Aveeno has become my favorite skincare line and the products I use now</li>
            <li>Very nice and worth the price.</li>
            <li>This exactly what I do and it works great.</li>
            <li>The exfoliating side though does feel really marvelous and does a good job, better than any other cleansing pad on the market for sure.</li>
            <li>I believe exfoliating is so important!  </li>
            <li>This product is a fraction of the price, and does a better job of cleaning.    </li>
            <li>They work well at removing makeup, etc, and they do not irritate my skin like so many others.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only been 2 days, and I am happy to say I see improvements already!  </li>
            <li>Plus they need the addition of some water to do their magic.</li>
            <li>I will admit I have been using a bit of spot fading cream when I think of it to take care of some sun damage, but I have yet to develop any more of a routine</li>
            <li>So many, in fact, that I will not presume to know what is going on inside her Cinderella world.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love...</li>
            <li>Works great, very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I hope for all our sakes they prove to be safe.</li>
            <li>I do love Aveeno products, but I&#x27;d be even happier with them if they erred on the safe side.</li>
            <li>Although it did not work for me, I have read many reviews that it helped others.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff..</li>
            <li>Great cleansing pad for adult skin.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a shame because in every other way it&#x27;s flawless.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s gentle, but I do wish there was a bit more scrubbing</li>
            <li>* Easy to use  </li>
            <li>This Aveeno line has been amazing for my skin and the Positively Radiant cleansing pads are a huge part of it.  </li>
            <li>There is a fragrance, but it is light and unobtrusive.</li>
            <li>No annoying smells.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy the process because to me it means a Zest for Life.</li>
            <li>Amazon, like always, is fabulous for this (see?</li>
            <li>so they last for a month :o)</li>
            <li>My skin feels so clean.  </li>
            <li>I use it to quickly clean my face before bed.</li>
            <li>Tub is large and takes more room  </li>
            <li>I just researched a bit and have found that virtually everything we use in personal care has parabens, including these cleansing pads, which have FIVE kinds of parabens, a controversial preservative in most make-up, lotion, shampoo, deodorant, sun block, etc.</li>
            <li>I just wanted my good complexion back.  </li>
            <li>She is always pursuing personal radiance and that is a motivator, something good to see.</li>
            <li>Started using this product after my mom recommended it and had no idea how much I would love it.</li>
            <li>I think there is of course a smell, but not a bad added perfume scent.    </li>
            <li>I use the smooth side first to remove my makeup and clean my face and then flip the pad over and use the textured side to exfoliate.  </li>
            <li>These pads do it all: cleanse, moisturize, and exfoliate which I think is so important if you want to keep your skin looking young, healthy, and glowing.</li>
            <li>First of all they are huge.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Now that some kind of hormonal changes seem to be afoot, I have been suddenly plagued with oily skin, pimples and blackheads.</li>
            <li>are well worth the price.</li>
            <li>While I believe these do clean the face, they didn&#x27;t really improve my complexion or do anything at all to change it.</li>
            <li>You wouldn&#x27;t think this is a big deal, but it&#x27;s super convenient to just be able to pull out a pad and wash your face with a premoistened, prelathered pad.</li>
            <li>soon as i got done the first time my face felt soo fresh.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this cleanser too and she has sensitive, easily irritated skin.</li>
            <li>At times it seems like too much of a process!  </li>
            <li>I am starting to sound like I don&#x27;t know what!)</li>
            <li>so you can actually stretch these packages quite more than one per day.</li>
            <li>I know that I purchased immediately and surprised Mama who is always so excited when you give her anything just about.</li>
            <li>The proof that the product cleans is that when I complete my cleansing ritual with with astringent, the cotton ball is virtually clean.</li>
            <li>Removes makeup and leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li>When I first saw this product, I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>The cleansing pads are gentle, but take off makeup completely and leave my face feeling very clean and soft, but not sticky or greasy and not at all</li>
            <li>With all of this water and foam and rinsing, it quickly became clear to me that I would not be using them the way I planned.</li>
            <li>They are quite large, so like another reviewer did</li>
            <li>Super clean, but not overly dry.  </li>
            <li>The product itself makes my face feel gently cleaned and leaves my skin feeling nice and exfoliated but hits some magic sweet spot where my skin never feels tight or rough afterwards, only soft and clean.</li>
            <li>highly recommend these!</li>
            <li>This product is very convenient.  </li>
            <li>Portion control (no worries on having to figure out how much to use)  </li>
            <li>Plus, my skin really glows and is radiant.     </li>
            <li>Note that the Postively Radiant line of mositurizers have a much heavier fragrance that did not appeal to me.    </li>
            <li>I bought these thinking they would be a fast way to take care of my skin before bed.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li>Why jump around if you find something that really works?</li>
            <li>I also use Aveeno Intense Relief Repair Cream on my arms and legs at night.</li>
            <li>Soft, smooth, clear skin.</li>
            <li>I have oily skin but can dry out easily</li>
            <li>The cannister is HUGE so its a bit difficult to travel with but great for home facial cleaning.</li>
            <li>I dont usually use cleansing pads, they are kind of extravagant, but i wanted some to have for away from home</li>
            <li>Super soapy; and, probably a bit larger than needed.  </li>
            <li>And the exfoliating side of the pad could be a little more.. exfoliating.  </li>
            <li>(you may not even need to use water although it&#x27;s probably better to dilute the solution a little).  </li>
            <li>I also found that you can easily peel the label off the container and reuse it for other things.</li>
            <li>After using it daily it did cause my face to dry out and feel pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Well, they are a little different than some kind of fast wiping pad.</li>
            <li>I guess for sensitive skin, this is just too much.</li>
            <li>, i cut them in half ( i could probaby easily make do with quarters)  ..</li>
            <li>It cleans very deep and leaves your skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li>As you can guess, I have tried so many products; cheap and expensive.  </li>
            <li>actually re-use the pads as long as I don&#x27;t have a lot of gunk or makeup on or something, and I&#x27;ve found that works just fine</li>
            <li>My skin is fairly sensitive and I was nervous about changing over to a new product without a transition.  </li>
            <li>but I still have some adult acne that&#x27;s too sensitive for the Clearasil crowd.  </li>
            <li>The pads have two sides: one side is a soft, chamois like side.</li>
            <li>I start with the soft side, then complete with the exfoliating side.     </li>
            <li>As far as Mama is concerned she has an army of products for every stage of her beauty treatment.</li>
            <li>I think of Aveeno as natural, so the ingredient surprised me.</li>
            <li>I will follow up when I have used this a little longer, but so far my acne is healing nicely all in just a few days.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the pads now for a month along with one of the Positively Radiant moisturizers and have not had one single breakout.  </li>
            <li>The only con I can think of is that the container is large, and the product only occupies about 3/4 of the jar.</li>
            <li>If using 2x per day, this large container will only last two weeks.</li>
            <li>When using the liquid cleansers, I sometimes use too much (which ends up being wasted by going down the drain) or not enough (which is a pain to have to get more while your face is soaped up).  </li>
            <li>When Mama keeps looking herself in the mirror and trying new clothes, even though sometimes she doesn&#x27;t really fit in them (a little too bulky, needs to loose poundage..)</li>
            <li>I had clear skin all my life and up to my 50&#x27;s never saw much need for extra attention outside a daily shower.</li>
            <li>Another thing I really like about this set up is although it&#x27;s more expensive than buying a container of liquid cleanser, there&#x27;s really no guessing involved.  </li>
            <li>The first few times I used them, I wondered if I&#x27;d even need a moisturizer, they left my face feeling</li>
            <li>In the past few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using the pads (once in the morning and once at night), my face feels softer and my skin is definitely brighter and more radiant.  </li>
            <li>The large face pads are such a waste and the container only holds 28.</li>

            <li> The cannister is HUGE so its a bit difficult to travel with but great for home facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> I dont usually use cleansing pads, they are kind of extravagant, but i wanted some to have for away from home</li>
            <li> Super soapy; and, probably a bit larger than needed.  </li>
            <li> And the exfoliating side of the pad could be a little more.. exfoliating.  </li>
            <li> (you may not even need to use water although it&#x27;s probably better to dilute the solution a little).  </li>
            <li> I also found that you can easily peel the label off the container and reuse it for other things.</li>
            <li> After using it daily it did cause my face to dry out and feel pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Well, they are a little different than some kind of fast wiping pad.</li>
            <li> I guess for sensitive skin, this is just too much.</li>
            <li> , i cut them in half ( i could probaby easily make do with quarters)  ..</li>
            <li> It cleans very deep and leaves your skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> As you can guess, I have tried so many products; cheap and expensive.  </li>
            <li> actually re-use the pads as long as I don&#x27;t have a lot of gunk or makeup on or something, and I&#x27;ve found that works just fine</li>
            <li> My skin is fairly sensitive and I was nervous about changing over to a new product without a transition.  </li>
            <li> but I still have some adult acne that&#x27;s too sensitive for the Clearasil crowd.  </li>
            <li> The pads have two sides: one side is a soft, chamois like side.</li>
            <li> I start with the soft side, then complete with the exfoliating side.     </li>
            <li> As far as Mama is concerned she has an army of products for every stage of her beauty treatment.</li>
            <li> I think of Aveeno as natural, so the ingredient surprised me.</li>
            <li> I will follow up when I have used this a little longer, but so far my acne is healing nicely all in just a few days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the pads now for a month along with one of the Positively Radiant moisturizers and have not had one single breakout.  </li>
            <li> The only con I can think of is that the container is large, and the product only occupies about 3/4 of the jar.</li>
            <li> If using 2x per day, this large container will only last two weeks.</li>
            <li> When using the liquid cleansers, I sometimes use too much (which ends up being wasted by going down the drain) or not enough (which is a pain to have to get more while your face is soaped up).  </li>
            <li> When Mama keeps looking herself in the mirror and trying new clothes, even though sometimes she doesn&#x27;t really fit in them (a little too bulky, needs to loose poundage..)</li>
            <li> I had clear skin all my life and up to my 50&#x27;s never saw much need for extra attention outside a daily shower.</li>
            <li> Another thing I really like about this set up is although it&#x27;s more expensive than buying a container of liquid cleanser, there&#x27;s really no guessing involved.  </li>
            <li> The first few times I used them, I wondered if I&#x27;d even need a moisturizer, they left my face feeling</li>
            <li> In the past few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using the pads (once in the morning and once at night), my face feels softer and my skin is definitely brighter and more radiant.  </li>
            <li> The large face pads are such a waste and the container only holds 28.</li>
            <li> I much prefer the Aveeno Calming cleanser, or the Olay Daily Facials (for lazy nights - no water required for those).  </li>
            <li> I have never had much of a skin \\&quot;routine\\&quot; other than letting some of the shampoo rinse down my face in the shower.</li>
            <li> if i wash it with normal bar soap like dove it gets extremely dry and tight.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve ever found that eliminates those rough red bumps I get on my arms and legs.</li>
            <li> At 41, I don&#x27;t really have skin that needs lots of moisturizing and delicate care</li>
            <li> If you find the pads are too big, cut them in half and double your product!  </li>
            <li> The overall blotchiness of my skin is gone and now I&#x27;m hoping with further use, my little sunspot freckles will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this stubborn in a long time!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible they were allergic to one of the ingredients, or they scrubbed too hard, or they didn&#x27;t rinse the cleanser off completely.    </li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m done, I rinse my face with luke-warm water and pat my skin dry.  </li>
            <li> Face can feel a bit dry after cleansing    </li>
            <li> I used up one jar of Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleansing Pads, and instead of jumping to some other product as I usually do, I ordered the three pack.</li>
            <li> I am ordering these from Amazon for the first time and thanks to another reviewer, I will start cutting the pads in half to save some money.</li>
            <li> I did not get the clear complexion ones, i would be afraid those would irritate, so be aware i am talking about the rregular ones, and they do not bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> So I put the tub of quartered pads in the shower stall, and I take one and go to town with the rough side during my shower.</li>
            <li> The other is a rougher side for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut them into quarters.</li>
            <li> I will be reusing the containers for other things around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s two weeks worth, which ends up being a little expensive after a while.  </li>
            <li> With this product, there is virtually no prep involved besides grabbing the tub and wetting your face (even less if you wash your face in the shower).  </li>
            <li> I cut the pads in half</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I am allergic to Aveeno&#x27;s Soap (not sure which one?)</li>
            <li> Work well for face cleansing, if cut in half.  </li>
            <li> Slightly abrasive pad with lots of foam.</li>
            <li> Just a little bit.  </li>
            <li> dried out.  </li>
            <li> GREEN IDEA - instead of recycling the tub,</li>
            <li> I read some one Else&#x27;s review about the packaging and agree that it is not as &#x27;green&#x27; as it could be.</li>
            <li> So, I think it&#x27;s too harsh for my face.</li>
            <li> You can tell this product is deep cleaning because your face tingles - not an uncomfortable tingle though (not for me anyway).  </li>
            <li> keep it, wash it out, and use it to keep your small cosmetics (cotton balls, Q-Tips, eye shadows, etc.)</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Aveeno has come to my rescue after years of spending money on all types of cleansers and moisturizers that after a few days or weeks of use would break my face out or dry it out so badly</li>
            <li> Even down to a quarter, they foam like crazy.</li>

            <li> At 41, I don&#x27;t really have skin that needs lots of moisturizing and delicate care but I still have some adult acne that&#x27;s too sensitive for the Clearasil crowd.  This Aveeno line has been amazing for my skin and the Positively Radiant cleansing pads are a huge part of it.  The overall blotchiness of my skin is gone and now I&#x27;m hoping with further use, my little sunspot freckles will go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the pads now for a month along with one of the Positively Radiant moisturizers and have not had one single breakout.  The cleansing pads are gentle, but take off makeup completely and leave my face feeling very clean and soft, but not sticky or greasy and not at all dried out.  The first few times I used them, I wondered if I&#x27;d even need a moisturizer, they left my face feeling so soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two drawbacks to the pads, not enough to drop them from five stars, but things I&#x27;d change if I could.  There are only 28 pads per container.  That&#x27;s two weeks worth, which ends up being a little expensive after a while.  And the exfoliating side of the pad could be a little more.. exfoliating.  Just a little bit.  It&#x27;s nice that it&#x27;s gentle, but I do wish there was a bit more scrubbing action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these!</li>
            <li> This product is very convenient.  I don&#x27;t know about you, but I sometimes have to force myself to wash my face, especially at night.  At times it seems like too much of a process!  With this product, there is virtually no prep involved besides grabbing the tub and wetting your face (even less if you wash your face in the shower).  For being a non-soap product, the pads foam up very nicely (you may not even need to use water although it&#x27;s probably better to dilute the solution a little).  I use the smooth side first to remove my makeup and clean my face and then flip the pad over and use the textured side to exfoliate.  This is my favorite side!  I believe exfoliating is so important!  It does a great job.  You can tell this product is deep cleaning because your face tingles - not an uncomfortable tingle though (not for me anyway).  After I&#x27;m done, I rinse my face with luke-warm water and pat my skin dry.  My skin feels so clean.  I follow cleansing with using witch hazel as a toner and extra virgin coconut oil as a moisturizer.    In the past few weeks that I&#x27;ve been using the pads (once in the morning and once at night), my face feels softer and my skin is definitely brighter and more radiant.  Just like it says - imagine that!  I have added this product to my daily routine.    My skin is fairly sensitive and I was nervous about changing over to a new product without a transition.  I read some reviews where people experienced an allergic type reaction.  I did not experience this at all.  It&#x27;s possible they were allergic to one of the ingredients, or they scrubbed too hard, or they didn&#x27;t rinse the cleanser off completely.    Another thing I really like about this set up is although it&#x27;s more expensive than buying a container of liquid cleanser, there&#x27;s really no guessing involved.  When using the liquid cleansers, I sometimes use too much (which ends up being wasted by going down the drain) or not enough (which is a pain to have to get more while your face is soaped up).  It should be noted, this product won the Allure&#x27;s Editor&#x27;s Choice Award!    In Summary:    Pros:  * Cleans well  * Great exfoliator  * Softens and brightens skin  * Portion control (no worries on having to figure out how much to use)  * Great for travel (throw some in a baggie and go)  * Easy to use  * Only 28 pads come in the container    Cons:  * More expensive than liquid cleanser  * Tub is large and takes more room  * Face can feel a bit dry after cleansing    Tips:  * If you find the pads are too big, cut them in half and double your product!  * GREEN IDEA - instead of recycling the tub, keep it, wash it out, and use it to keep your small cosmetics (cotton balls, Q-Tips, eye shadows, etc.)</li>
            <li> I am very happy that I found this pads. They are the best. It cleans very deep and leaves your skin fresh and soft.</li>
            <li> Just a great product. I have oily skin but can dry out easily so this product is wonderful. The scratchy side works perfectly. I read some one Else&#x27;s review about the packaging and agree that it is not as &#x27;green&#x27; as it could be. They suggested cutting the pads in half. This exactly what I do and it works great. I also found that you can easily peel the label off the container and reuse it for other things.</li>
            <li> I am a big Aveeno fan, but this product makes my skin burn!  I used 5 pads, hoping maybe I just needed to get used to it; but I will not be using the rest (including 2 unopened jars!).  I much prefer the Aveeno Calming cleanser, or the Olay Daily Facials (for lazy nights - no water required for those).  I guess for sensitive skin, this is just too much.</li>
            <li> I use it to quickly clean my face before bed. Works well, my face looks great. Aveeno makes quality products.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for six months now, and don&#x27;t know how I lived without it.     I decided to try this product to save some money -- I had been using Clinique and Prescriptives cleansers and exfoliators. This product is a fraction of the price, and does a better job of cleaning.    The cleansing pads are pre-moistened and all 28 pads retain their mositure in packaging. The pads have two sides: one side is a soft, chamois like side. The other is a rougher side for exfoliation. I start with the soft side, then complete with the exfoliating side.     I wear a water-resitant foundation, so I need a cleanser that does the job. The proof that the product cleans is that when I complete my cleansing ritual with with astringent, the cotton ball is virtually clean. Plus, my skin really glows and is radiant.     There is a fragrance, but it is light and unobtrusive. Note that the Postively Radiant line of mositurizers have a much heavier fragrance that did not appeal to me.    The only con I can think of is that the container is large, and the product only occupies about 3/4 of the jar. It could be made smaller.     I will continue to buy this product, and hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> These are nice cleansing pads. I dont usually use cleansing pads, they are kind of extravagant, but i wanted some to have for away from home (planning on going to the hospital for baby&#x27;s birth)  and since i like aveeno, i went for these.  They are quite large, so like another reviewer did, i cut them in half ( i could probaby easily make do with quarters)  .. i am just that frugal ;o)    They work well at removing makeup, etc, and they do not irritate my skin like so many others.  Even on the eyes.  No annoying smells.  I think there is of course a smell, but not a bad added perfume scent.    I did not get the clear complexion ones, i would be afraid those would irritate, so be aware i am talking about the rregular ones, and they do not bother my skin at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased the product based on Dr. Leslie Bauman&#x27;s recommendations for oily skin.  After using it for 3 weeks, my skin has improved a lot.</li>
            <li> im 21. i always struggled with my face. if i wash it with normal bar soap like dove it gets extremely dry and tight. and if i use medicated products i breakout. i never knew what tpo use until my mom told me to try them. soon as i got done the first time my face felt soo fresh. i continued to use them and my blemishes went away...(believe me i had ALOT) ive been using these non stop for about 4 or 5 years. the absolute best!!</li>
            <li> Well, for about a year my skin has been having acne flare-ups and i&#x27;m in my late 20&#x27;s.  I didn&#x27;t know what to do because I hadn&#x27;t had any acne this stubborn in a long time!  My T zone was terrible.  I would wash my face and an hour later you could see the oil on the surface. As you can guess, I have tried so many products; cheap and expensive.  I just wanted my good complexion back.  It&#x27;s only been 2 days, and I am happy to say I see improvements already!  I am waking up to little/no oil on my forehead!  This is amazing, no product has done this.  I will follow up when I have used this a little longer, but so far my acne is healing nicely all in just a few days.  Also, FYI:  I cut the pads in half so they last for a month :o)</li>
            <li> Great Product does as advertised. The cannister is HUGE so its a bit difficult to travel with but great for home facial cleaning.</li>
            <li> I have never had much of a skin \\&quot;routine\\&quot; other than letting some of the shampoo rinse down my face in the shower. I had clear skin all my life and up to my 50&#x27;s never saw much need for extra attention outside a daily shower. Now that some kind of hormonal changes seem to be afoot, I have been suddenly plagued with oily skin, pimples and blackheads. I bought these thinking they would be a fast way to take care of my skin before bed. Well, they are a little different than some kind of fast wiping pad. First of all they are huge. I followed the advice of other reviewers and cut them into quarters. Even down to a quarter, they foam like crazy. Plus they need the addition of some water to do their magic. With all of this water and foam and rinsing, it quickly became clear to me that I would not be using them the way I planned. So I put the tub of quartered pads in the shower stall, and I take one and go to town with the rough side during my shower. Happy day. With the simple addition of this process, it turns out I don&#x27;t even need a night routine anymore. My skin has improved 100% with just the daily scrub during my shower. The shiny oil, red pimples and blackheads are all gone. I will admit I have been using a bit of spot fading cream when I think of it to take care of some sun damage, but I have yet to develop any more of a routine and I have been getting comments about my beautiful skin!</li>
            <li> These are all products for Mama and the word on the grapevine is they make her feel beautiful. She is always pursuing personal radiance and that is a motivator, something good to see. When Mama keeps looking herself in the mirror and trying new clothes, even though sometimes she doesn&#x27;t really fit in them (a little too bulky, needs to loose poundage..) I enjoy the process because to me it means a Zest for Life. And Life, as we all should know by now, is for the Living! As far as Mama is concerned she has an army of products for every stage of her beauty treatment. So many, in fact, that I will not presume to know what is going on inside her Cinderella world. My job is to assist in any way I can and also to do the research on whatever product she requires nowadays. Amazon, like always, is fabulous for this (see? I am starting to sound like I don&#x27;t know what!) and Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleansing Pads, 28-Count Pads (Pack of 3) had so many wonderful endorsements from the best of the best reviewers I know that I purchased immediately and surprised Mama who is always so excited when you give her anything just about. 4 Stars but even if it deserved 5 I wouldn&#x27;t know about it!</li>
            <li> I love this product. No matter what else I use I end up going back to this product. My daughter loves this cleanser too and she has sensitive, easily irritated skin.</li>
            <li> Love...love...love this product!  This is the only thing I can use that doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin.  It deep cleans but it&#x27;s so gentle.</li>
            <li> Aveeno has come to my rescue after years of spending money on all types of cleansers and moisturizers that after a few days or weeks of use would break my face out or dry it out so badly I felt like my skin was going to crack. These pads do it all: cleanse, moisturize, and exfoliate which I think is so important if you want to keep your skin looking young, healthy, and glowing. I am ordering these from Amazon for the first time and thanks to another reviewer, I will start cutting the pads in half to save some money. That was a great tip! I can honestly say that Aveeno has become my favorite skincare line and the products I use now are well worth the price. Keep up the good work Aveeno!</li>
            <li> I have a Clarisonic, but still use these in my extra bathroom. They smell (and work) great.</li>
            <li> Works great, very convenient.  I use these every day and my 20 year-old daughter now uses them too.</li>
            <li> Very nice and worth the price. Removes makeup and leaves my skin soft and clean.</li>
            <li> I used up one jar of Aveeno Active Naturals Positively Radiant Cleansing Pads, and instead of jumping to some other product as I usually do, I ordered the three pack. Why jump around if you find something that really works? And this does. Soft, smooth, clear skin. Super clean, but not overly dry.  Easy to use, and reasonably priced. I use it at night, followed by derma e hyaluric acid night cream (no parabens). Great combo. I also use Aveeno Intense Relief Repair Cream on my arms and legs at night. (I got a good deal at Wal-mart, shhh) It&#x27;s the ONLY thing I&#x27;ve ever found that eliminates those rough red bumps I get on my arms and legs. It does contain parabens, which some suspect of being potentially carcinogenic. That&#x27;s a shame because in every other way it&#x27;s flawless. Aveeno by and large makes wonderful products, and these cleansing pads are among the very best.     I just researched a bit and have found that virtually everything we use in personal care has parabens, including these cleansing pads, which have FIVE kinds of parabens, a controversial preservative in most make-up, lotion, shampoo, deodorant, sun block, etc. I think of Aveeno as natural, so the ingredient surprised me. But it turns out you have to search diligently to find personal care products without them.  I hope for all our sakes they prove to be safe. I do love Aveeno products, but I&#x27;d be even happier with them if they erred on the safe side.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and I am happy with it but I do feel like an Earth Killer when using. The large face pads are such a waste and the container only holds 28. If using 2x per day, this large container will only last two weeks. I will be reusing the containers for other things around the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro: Smells Great&lt;br /&gt;Gentle face wash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Environmentally unfriendly&lt;br /&gt;Pricey&lt;br /&gt;One container only lasts two weeks.</li>
            <li> When I first saw this product, I really wanted to try it. I was skeptical at first because I am allergic to Aveeno&#x27;s Soap (not sure which one?) but I had no problems with this product. After using it daily it did cause my face to dry out and feel pretty easily. So, I think it&#x27;s too harsh for my face. (I do get acne, if it makes a difference.) The exfoliating side though does feel really marvelous and does a good job, better than any other cleansing pad on the market for sure. While I believe these do clean the face, they didn&#x27;t really improve my complexion or do anything at all to change it. It also didn&#x27;t decrease, and possibly increased the redness on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short:&lt;br /&gt;1. If you have acne, this probably isn&#x27;t going to help it.&lt;br /&gt;2. If you&#x27;re simply looking for something to exfoliate and brighten your skin, I would recommend this. Although it did not work for me, I have read many reviews that it helped others.</li>
            <li> Super soapy; and, probably a bit larger than needed.  Work well for face cleansing, if cut in half.  Great residue-free cleaning capability.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.. That is all.</li>
            <li> Started using this product after my mom recommended it and had no idea how much I would love it. You wouldn&#x27;t think this is a big deal, but it&#x27;s super convenient to just be able to pull out a pad and wash your face with a premoistened, prelathered pad. The product itself makes my face feel gently cleaned and leaves my skin feeling nice and exfoliated but hits some magic sweet spot where my skin never feels tight or rough afterwards, only soft and clean. Plus it smells awesome! This is definitely a part of my daily routine now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually re-use the pads as long as I don&#x27;t have a lot of gunk or makeup on or something, and I&#x27;ve found that works just fine -- each pad has quite a bit of lather and stuff in it so you can actually stretch these packages quite more than one per day.</li>
            <li> Slightly abrasive pad with lots of foam. Great cleansing pad for adult skin.</li>
            <li> I have  been  using  this  for years.  Your skin  looks amazing every time  you use  it.</li>
    </ol>
