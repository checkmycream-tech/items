            <li> Love it! Clean, fresh, seems greasy at first, but only a small amount is needed.  Been using this for years.  Sometimes they change the name or packaging, but the product stays the same.  I will buy it online at the best prices for a long time.</li>
            <li> Vivo Per Lei product is excellent for all.  I Love this mark.</li>

            <li> I love this serum....I have ordered this several times and it is luxurious and nice on skin.</li>
            <li> I had break outs I stoped using it</li>
            <li> Leaves skin very soft and smooth. (Less is more; just use a little). Noticed an immediate reduction in fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Nice serum, especially for drier skin.</li>
            <li> Really a great cream  with a great fragrance.  Not sure what it really does, but I like it!  What can be bad about vitamin C on your face?</li>
            <li> After ordering another product I got this message from the company saying they were giving me an &amp;#34;upgrade.&amp;#34;  Not what I wanted.  Working on getting my money refunded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Our valued customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thank you for your interest in our store and would like to inform you that with this new year celebration,&lt;br /&gt;we decided to give our customers a nice upgrade gift from us and sent instead of the  Vivo Per Lei Vitamin C Facial Serum&lt;br /&gt;the new upgrade Vivo per lei Vitamin C serum  from the New  Diamond collection with the old version price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are sure you will like  this New product and also our service and prompt delivery timing&lt;br /&gt;and hope you will give us the 5-star rating as something else will hurt us deeply.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love this product.  So soothing and feels so Smooth going on. I have ordered before and Don&#x27;t want to be without.  Also ordered one for a friend</li>
            <li> It goes on very smooth and shiny so the day cream has to be used with it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful. Love the way it goes on. So velvety. A little goes a long way. Too early to see results, but will continue to use.</li>
            <li> This product is so emollient yet light weight on the skin. I&#x27;ve noticed how nourished my skin&#x27;s appearance has become since using the serum.  I have normal to dry skin and the serum has helped me retain moisture. The orange scented fragrance is refreshing. Lastly, the price is very reasonable for the product.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t tell the difference....</li>
