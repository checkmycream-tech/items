            <li>The best part is that they save me from tugging with my fingernails.  </li>
            <li>These tools are great!</li>
            <li>What works best is a mini spoon that you can get at any kitchen store or Bed Bath and Beyond.  </li>

            <li>Great concept but</li>
            <li>I ordered ThePulTool (thepultool.com), which worked great for six months before breaking.</li>
            <li>Works great for grabbing as well as sliding them over the buttons.</li>
            <li>so these work great for me.</li>
            <li>I love these!!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more effect, more discreet and doesn&#x27;t cost 25$!!!</li>

            <li>This seems like a good idea</li>

            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>It is amazing.</li>
            <li>This tool is handy to help pop of one of the ends</li>
            <li>It is nice to have one at home and one in my bag.</li>
            <li>had gotten proficient at removing Invisalign on my own, instructions with product indicate it may take some practice to get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li>I also liked the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; so I can keep one in my car, purse, bathroom, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>still like ThePulTool best, particularly since it fits in my case, but</li>
            <li>Very easily.  </li>
            <li>I love, love it  !</li>
            <li>I keep one in my purse, one in my office and one at home, but I think it would be good to have extras, because this is as important as my toothbrush now.</li>
            <li>it the retainer removal tool makes it EASY!</li>
            <li>Allows you to get one side started easily!</li>
            <li>I received my first set of Invisalign trays three weeks ago, and had a great deal of difficulty removing them.  </li>
            <li>Nice ideas, easy to use but soon realized that using tool caused my retainer to break.  </li>
            <li>You are better off tearing your fingernail than using this device.</li>
            <li>Much better than any improvised methods, like crochet hooks, tweezers and the like.</li>
            <li>I am ordering more today</li>
            <li>Much better than shoving your fingers into your mouth to try and remove your liners.  </li>
            <li>Would not have been able to remove the braces without it.  </li>
            <li>The Outie is very affordable, and Natalie&#x27;s staff is great..</li>
            <li>Love the Retainer Brite, works as described.</li>
            <li>so considering how many they send</li>
            <li>He used it twice, and said it hurt more using these than just doing it by hand.</li>
            <li>Suggestion to Outie makers: If you can get the maker to use a stronger plastic, even if it cost a bit more to the consumer, it would be a much better product.</li>
            <li>If you do make a revised version, I will be more than glad to order the product and update my review.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact, I have never even found it able to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; the edge to begin the process.  </li>
            <li>After breaking most of my fingernails trying to get my trays out, I went online to do my research.</li>
            <li>Oh, I love these outies.</li>
            <li>I still can&#x27;t make the hook side work, but I&#x27;m so glad they come in a six-pack because I have them stashed everywhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing invisalign for six months and lost track of how many fingernails</li>
            <li>Ingenious design.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Better off using my fingernails to grab an edge.  </li>
            <li>I poked and jabbed myself more with them.</li>
            <li>The quality is equal and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li>My fingernails do a better job.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>and i love love this tool.  </li>
            <li>I love these things.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using a bobby pin.</li>
            <li>I love Outie Tool as I&#x27;m now able to remove the retainers easily.</li>
            <li>they seem to work pretty good.</li>
            <li>Up until I got my Invisilign braces, my fingernails had always looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li>This is so superior to the tool the dentist gave me that it isn&#x27;t even funny.</li>
            <li>If the plastic was stronger, I&#x27;d easily give 5 stars to this ingenious item.</li>
            <li>I am able to pop the aligners out easily now</li>
            <li>It removes the aligners much more easily that with your hands.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just happy that I found these lifesavers early in treatment</li>
            <li>and I have yet to successfully remove my new aligner without them.</li>
            <li>These can be handy in the right situations.</li>
            <li>it makes removing the liners easy without breaking my finger  nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Taking them out to eat is an easy task now.</li>
            <li>Removing invisalign trays is actually a really easy process, and you get the hang of it after doing it once or twice.</li>
            <li>They break too easily.</li>
            <li>This is something you can make at home easily.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that easy.</li>
            <li>The need for this item is overstated and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as easily or as painlessly as they make it seem.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve discovered if I rinse my mouth with warm to hot water before removing trays,  they will come off quite easily.</li>
            <li>The tool itself looks fine</li>
            <li>They worked fine and came in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li>Using the Outie has been a huge help.  </li>
            <li>The plastic knife was much more useful for me.</li>
            <li>until they&#x27;re available again, I recommend the Outie Tool.</li>
            <li>that night I found these &amp; it has been smooth sailing since.</li>
            <li>but when I tried to use it, the plastic is so cheap, it couldn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li>Once the backs are free, you can use either both hands or the Outie to pull them off of the front.</li>
            <li>but after I did, I have been more gentle so that I don&#x27;t break any more.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li>This is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>Threw away the original invisalign tool immediately after these arrived.</li>
            <li>I have invisilign and like most I freaked out the first week I had them and ordered these per online reviews.</li>
            <li>I was terrified the first week that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get my Invisalign off</li>
            <li>I was quite excited when I saw these.  </li>
            <li>These are ok, but believe me, after your first week with invisilign braces, you will never use them.  </li>
            <li>Keep it clean and you can keep reusing it.</li>
            <li>Removal is super quick and easy--</li>
            <li>During the first couple days with a new pair of Invisalign trays, it requires a good amount of effort to pull the trays out of my mouth for eating.  </li>
            <li>The tool popped the trays right out - no pain, and very quickly.  </li>
            <li>A true life saver.</li>
            <li>I love these things so much.</li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m sure this could work for some people, but you really don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li>But warm water seems to soften them just enough to come off easily, even without the outie.  </li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;push up&amp;#34; feature for the bottom trays didn&#x27;t work on one side for me, as I have to grab the tray from the inside of my teeth because of a large attachment in that area, but fortunately the pulling end works fine on the bottom tray as well as</li>
            <li>My orthodontist had never heard of the Outie, so I brought one in to show him--hopefully he will pass on this great idea to his other patients.</li>
            <li>I am new to invisiline and this handy little tool works great.  </li>
            <li>These tools helped tremendously.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know whether an alternative material (steel??) would work better, but I DO know you should plan to have and keep more than one Outie because they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off growing your finger nails a bit longer than normal to pry off the invisalign than using these.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t over do it with very hot water, it may damage the trays.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately I bought the Outie tool when I first got Invisalign</li>
            <li>I have yet to have an Outtie break, still using the first one I took out of the package in December!</li>
            <li>I thought it will be very useful for me at certain stage of treatment</li>
            <li>These outies are fantastic, real life savers.</li>
            <li>The whole order prob costs $1 to manufacture which means there is a huge markup.</li>
            <li>These are good especially because you can have them in different places since it comes with more than one.  </li>
            <li>It sounds like some folks have had success, so by all means do try it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice that they send you several of them so that if one breaks, you&#x27;re not stuck trying to get your trays out by yourself without anything to help.</li>
            <li>In fairness though, a friend gave me a different kind to try, and it didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li>Especially came in handy when I got my attachments placed.</li>
            <li>This great little tool pops them right out.  </li>
            <li>They weren&#x27;t significantly easier to use to remove my aligners than using my fingers and the hook side was pure nonsense as there was no way to get it between my aligner and my tooth.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27; have strong fingernails, these are pretty much a necessity.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t mind taking them for a quick 10 minutes to have some hot coffee or whatever.</li>
            <li>it popped it right off.</li>
            <li>I ordered on Tuesday, received a response communication right way, and they were delivered Thursday.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, after the first tray of braces I can remove them easily enough with no tools.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky that my natural nails are pretty strong</li>
            <li>Since they are not expensive at all, it is worth trying them just to see whether they work for you.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Original review: Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The Outie Tool really works!</li>
            <li>So much easier when removing braces!  </li>
            <li>Broke my nails while trying to remove the aligners after the first time they were put on.</li>
            <li>Got the tool 4 days after my first set of trays.</li>
            <li>I bought these before I received my first set of Aligners.  </li>
            <li>What I found were these simple but ingenious tools to remove the Invisalign trays.</li>
            <li>I bought these when I first got invisalign.  </li>
            <li>This tool is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the Outie for over a month and have not broken one yet!</li>
            <li>- I kept breaking off my attachments, and once I purchased this tool, it eliminated many future trips to the ortho office for replacement attachments.</li>
            <li>Wish my dentist had recommended it when I first got the braces.  </li>
            <li>Nothing would work and I honestly thought that I would not eat for a week or two due to the difficulty in removing the aligners.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to get the top aligner out but for the bottom I use a hard plastic toothpick.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re new to aligners you&#x27;ll quickly develop a technique that takes them out efficiently with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Outie tool works much better -- not quite as good as ThePulTool, but not bad, and has little trouble grabbing the trays.</li>
            <li>Worth the high price because it works.</li>
            <li>When I first got my Invisaligns at the beginning of August, 2009, I ordered this tool but didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li>After the first couple days, I didn&#x27;t really feel any pain removing them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been able to keep them long.  </li>
            <li>I really needed this devise when I first got my invisaline braces, becuase I couldn&#x27;t get them out without it.  </li>
            <li>The tool is not rigid enough and bends too easily.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but I learned from practice that if  I just left the tray in over night, in the morning it was easy to remove without a tool.  </li>
            <li>then I do not think that this tool is strong enough to lever the retainer off.</li>
            <li>I ended up ordering the large economy sized bag after several broke real easily removing the upper aligners.</li>
            <li>I can remove my bottom trays fine but no way on the upper one unless I have my outie tool!  </li>
            <li>It was actually really too large.</li>
            <li>Very helpful.</li>
            <li>Very helpful</li>
            <li>Really helps to remove braces.</li>
            <li>Makes life so much easier.  </li>
            <li>After that the aligners became much easier to remove without the help of any tools.</li>
            <li>Nadine, the owner, is very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>All I can say is that I am much happier about my trays now.</li>
            <li>Without outies, I always chipped my nails and ruined my manicure, but this makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li>This is much faster and neater for removal and replacement.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li>I really need a device that will be reliable.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very happy!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li>Pull straight up/down, not out.</li>
            <li>it makes getting my braces out so much easier...</li>
            <li>This tool makes removal of the retainer trays so much easier, and saves on fingernail repair too.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing I didn&#x27;t get the instructions very well.</li>
            <li>Makes taking out much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li>They pop out much easier that way.</li>
            <li>I high recommend this!</li>
            <li>The tool is so simple to use and is so very useful.</li>
            <li>Even after the first week or so of a new tray when they loosened up, my fingernails were still getting chipped.  </li>
            <li>I decided that I will not keep paying for this and started using the Dentek Sonic Pick which works much better, but it is dangerously sharp though.     </li>
            <li>I now only use them for the first day or two after I switch trays, but they are still worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s large enough to get a good grip, but small enough to fit in my purse.  </li>
            <li>When I first started wearing my Clear Correct aligners it took me about 30 minutes to remove them &amp; I ended up popping my crown off...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side pulls the top down and one side pushes the bottom up.</li>
            <li>Outie tools arrived just in time for me to switch to a new set of aligners, so I now have had a chance to really try it out.  </li>
            <li>The main issue at the time was pulling them up and over the attachment points --</li>
            <li>As others have reported, it simply wouldn&#x27;t grab onto the Invisalign trays, no matter how many different ways I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>After that, you will be able to pull the braces off with your fingers, also starting at the back.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this tool to if you have a number of buttons on your teeth.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little getting use to for the top</li>
            <li>Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but I find that my thumb nail is much more effective in removing my upper and lower trays.  </li>
            <li>It may work better for people who have few or no attachments.</li>
            <li>The ends of the Outie are tapered enough to get between the plastic and the gum and strong enough to pull the Invisalign off.</li>
            <li>My braces were on so tight and my fingernails are soft that I busted my lips many times just trying to remove them</li>
            <li>so I was used to using it - after the attachments I would not have been able to remove my aligners especially the first few days after change over .</li>
            <li>What did help was changing my new tray at night.</li>
            <li>so can&#x27;t really say much about the quality when it is being actually used.</li>
            <li>By the time they arrived a few days later, I had gotten the hang of taking the aligners out on my own, but still gave the Outie a try.</li>
            <li>An easier, tool free way to remove retainers is to simply grab with your finger nail on the inside of the tooth towards the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li>I have short nails and taking my aligners was a pain when I first got my aligners.  </li>
            <li>But then I found these little tools and now they come off easily.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I bought these because I was anxious about starting invisalign treatment.</li>
            <li>The plastic material needs to be more stronger and less brittle, especially for pulling off the uppers.</li>
            <li>I found that taking my 2 index fingers and pulling from the back and front from the back edge of the tray at the same time worked just fine for me.</li>
            <li>The concept of Outie is terrific, but these cheap plastic tools last only about four weeks.</li>
            <li>On some of the really difficult-to-remove sets that break the outies I use a wooden tongue depressor (even they break eventually) for the uppers and the outie to pop out the lowers.</li>
            <li>I completely relied on these when I had Invisalign</li>
            <li>They work well but aren&#x27;t really needed if you pry your braces off from the back.</li>
            <li>I ordered 3 and so far</li>
            <li>This tool fixed everything.  </li>
            <li>but now I have no trouble at all with it</li>
            <li>Like many Outie users, at first I was extremely excited to finally have found something that is actually made to remove these, almost impossible to remove, aligners.</li>
            <li>The other end hooks over the top aligner to pull it down.  </li>
            <li>They take all the stress out of the removal of invisible braces, especially for new patients who haven&#x27;t yet got the knack of removing their braces without inadvertently removing their fingernails.</li>
            <li>the hooks are far too thick to get in the areas you need them to fit.</li>
            <li>Do one side first, then the other.</li>
            <li>New Invisalign trays or retainers are VERY tight when you first put them in.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the Outie for a week and so far it is working as described.</li>
            <li>The latter tool was a complete fiasco.</li>
            <li>I ordered these because my first two Invisalign trays were tough to get off for the first couple of days.  </li>
            <li>I heard a lot about the pain of removing the invisalign trays, so I invested some cash for these special removal tools, which are literally just clumsy plastic hooks.</li>
            <li>The tool does not work well, It does not clip or grip on the top Invisalign tray well at all, and trying to use it takes an awkward amount of time which is really embarrassing when you&#x27;re in public and trying to be discreet.</li>
            <li>It is when trying to remove an aligner during the first few days (when you just made the switch) that one will break almost all Outies ordered, in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li>When these first arrived I thought I had wasted my money.</li>
            <li>I ordered it in a panic the first night I got Invisalign because I was having so much trouble getting the aligners off.</li>
            <li>After breaking a few nails trying to remove my first set of Invisalign trays, I purchased the Outie removers that I had read about on an Invisalign feedback site.</li>
            <li>You can buy it at any drugstore, it costs less, and it&#x27;s actually more effective; the thin floss easily fits under the base of the invisalign tray at the back of your molar.  </li>
            <li>The first few weeks, these things really helped by getting those tight trays off and on my teeth when needed.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget has made my life so much easier.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> The best part is that they save me from tugging with my fingernails.  </li>

            <li> What works best is a mini spoon that you can get at any kitchen store or Bed Bath and Beyond.  </li>

            <li> Great concept but</li>
            <li> I ordered ThePulTool (thepultool.com), which worked great for six months before breaking.</li>
            <li> Works great for grabbing as well as sliding them over the buttons.</li>
            <li> so these work great for me.</li>
            <li> I love these!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s more effect, more discreet and doesn&#x27;t cost 25$!!!</li>

            <li> This seems like a good idea</li>
            <li> I bought just 3, I should have bought more!</li>

            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> It is amazing.</li>
            <li> This tool is handy to help pop of one of the ends</li>
            <li> It is nice to have one at home and one in my bag.</li>
            <li> had gotten proficient at removing Invisalign on my own, instructions with product indicate it may take some practice to get the hang of using it.</li>
            <li> I also liked the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; so I can keep one in my car, purse, bathroom, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> still like ThePulTool best, particularly since it fits in my case, but</li>
            <li> Very easily.  </li>
            <li> I love, love it  !</li>
            <li> I keep one in my purse, one in my office and one at home, but I think it would be good to have extras, because this is as important as my toothbrush now.</li>
            <li> it the retainer removal tool makes it EASY!</li>
            <li> Allows you to get one side started easily!</li>
            <li> I received my first set of Invisalign trays three weeks ago, and had a great deal of difficulty removing them.  </li>
            <li> Nice ideas, easy to use but soon realized that using tool caused my retainer to break.  </li>
            <li> You are better off tearing your fingernail than using this device.</li>
            <li> Much better than any improvised methods, like crochet hooks, tweezers and the like.</li>
            <li> I am ordering more today</li>
            <li> Much better than shoving your fingers into your mouth to try and remove your liners.  </li>
            <li> Would not have been able to remove the braces without it.  </li>
            <li> The Outie is very affordable, and Natalie&#x27;s staff is great..</li>
            <li> Love the Retainer Brite, works as described.</li>
            <li> so considering how many they send</li>
            <li> He used it twice, and said it hurt more using these than just doing it by hand.</li>
            <li> Suggestion to Outie makers: If you can get the maker to use a stronger plastic, even if it cost a bit more to the consumer, it would be a much better product.</li>
            <li> If you do make a revised version, I will be more than glad to order the product and update my review.</li>
            <li> As a matter of fact, I have never even found it able to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; the edge to begin the process.  </li>
            <li> After breaking most of my fingernails trying to get my trays out, I went online to do my research.</li>
            <li> Oh, I love these outies.</li>
            <li> I still can&#x27;t make the hook side work, but I&#x27;m so glad they come in a six-pack because I have them stashed everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing invisalign for six months and lost track of how many fingernails</li>
            <li> Ingenious design.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Better off using my fingernails to grab an edge.  </li>
            <li> I poked and jabbed myself more with them.</li>
            <li> The quality is equal and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> My fingernails do a better job.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> and i love love this tool.  </li>
            <li> I love these things.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using a bobby pin.</li>
            <li> I love Outie Tool as I&#x27;m now able to remove the retainers easily.</li>
            <li> they seem to work pretty good.</li>
            <li> Up until I got my Invisilign braces, my fingernails had always looked pretty good.  </li>
            <li> This is so superior to the tool the dentist gave me that it isn&#x27;t even funny.</li>
            <li> If the plastic was stronger, I&#x27;d easily give 5 stars to this ingenious item.</li>
            <li> I am able to pop the aligners out easily now</li>
            <li> It removes the aligners much more easily that with your hands.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just happy that I found these lifesavers early in treatment</li>
            <li> and I have yet to successfully remove my new aligner without them.</li>
            <li> These can be handy in the right situations.</li>
            <li> it makes removing the liners easy without breaking my finger  nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Taking them out to eat is an easy task now.</li>
            <li> Removing invisalign trays is actually a really easy process, and you get the hang of it after doing it once or twice.</li>
            <li> They break too easily.</li>
            <li> This is something you can make at home easily.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that easy.</li>
            <li> The need for this item is overstated and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as easily or as painlessly as they make it seem.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve discovered if I rinse my mouth with warm to hot water before removing trays,  they will come off quite easily.</li>
            <li> The tool itself looks fine</li>
            <li> They worked fine and came in a timely manner.  </li>
            <li> Using the Outie has been a huge help.  </li>
            <li> The plastic knife was much more useful for me.</li>
            <li> until they&#x27;re available again, I recommend the Outie Tool.</li>
            <li> that night I found these &amp; it has been smooth sailing since.</li>
            <li> but when I tried to use it, the plastic is so cheap, it couldn&#x27;t do</li>
            <li> Once the backs are free, you can use either both hands or the Outie to pull them off of the front.</li>
            <li> but after I did, I have been more gentle so that I don&#x27;t break any more.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> Threw away the original invisalign tool immediately after these arrived.</li>
            <li> I have invisilign and like most I freaked out the first week I had them and ordered these per online reviews.</li>
            <li> I was terrified the first week that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get my Invisalign off</li>
            <li> I was quite excited when I saw these.  </li>
            <li> These are ok, but believe me, after your first week with invisilign braces, you will never use them.  </li>
            <li> Keep it clean and you can keep reusing it.</li>
            <li> Removal is super quick and easy--</li>
            <li> During the first couple days with a new pair of Invisalign trays, it requires a good amount of effort to pull the trays out of my mouth for eating.  </li>
            <li> The tool popped the trays right out - no pain, and very quickly.  </li>
            <li> A true life saver.</li>
            <li> I love these things so much.</li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m sure this could work for some people, but you really don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> But warm water seems to soften them just enough to come off easily, even without the outie.  </li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;push up&amp;#34; feature for the bottom trays didn&#x27;t work on one side for me, as I have to grab the tray from the inside of my teeth because of a large attachment in that area, but fortunately the pulling end works fine on the bottom tray as well as</li>
            <li> My orthodontist had never heard of the Outie, so I brought one in to show him--hopefully he will pass on this great idea to his other patients.</li>
            <li> I am new to invisiline and this handy little tool works great.  </li>
            <li> These tools helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether an alternative material (steel??) would work better, but I DO know you should plan to have and keep more than one Outie because they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off growing your finger nails a bit longer than normal to pry off the invisalign than using these.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over do it with very hot water, it may damage the trays.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately I bought the Outie tool when I first got Invisalign</li>
            <li> I have yet to have an Outtie break, still using the first one I took out of the package in December!</li>
            <li> I thought it will be very useful for me at certain stage of treatment</li>
            <li> These outies are fantastic, real life savers.</li>
            <li> The whole order prob costs $1 to manufacture which means there is a huge markup.</li>
            <li> These are good especially because you can have them in different places since it comes with more than one.  </li>
            <li> It sounds like some folks have had success, so by all means do try it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice that they send you several of them so that if one breaks, you&#x27;re not stuck trying to get your trays out by yourself without anything to help.</li>
            <li> In fairness though, a friend gave me a different kind to try, and it didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> Especially came in handy when I got my attachments placed.</li>
            <li> This great little tool pops them right out.  </li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t significantly easier to use to remove my aligners than using my fingers and the hook side was pure nonsense as there was no way to get it between my aligner and my tooth.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27; have strong fingernails, these are pretty much a necessity.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t mind taking them for a quick 10 minutes to have some hot coffee or whatever.</li>
            <li> it popped it right off.</li>
            <li> I ordered on Tuesday, received a response communication right way, and they were delivered Thursday.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, after the first tray of braces I can remove them easily enough with no tools.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky that my natural nails are pretty strong</li>
            <li> Since they are not expensive at all, it is worth trying them just to see whether they work for you.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Original review: Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The Outie Tool really works!</li>
            <li> So much easier when removing braces!  </li>
            <li> Broke my nails while trying to remove the aligners after the first time they were put on.</li>
            <li> Got the tool 4 days after my first set of trays.</li>
            <li> I bought these before I received my first set of Aligners.  </li>
            <li> What I found were these simple but ingenious tools to remove the Invisalign trays.</li>
            <li> I bought these when I first got invisalign.  </li>
            <li> This tool is exactly what I need.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Outie for over a month and have not broken one yet!</li>
            <li> - I kept breaking off my attachments, and once I purchased this tool, it eliminated many future trips to the ortho office for replacement attachments.</li>
            <li> Wish my dentist had recommended it when I first got the braces.  </li>
            <li> Nothing would work and I honestly thought that I would not eat for a week or two due to the difficulty in removing the aligners.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m able to get the top aligner out but for the bottom I use a hard plastic toothpick.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re new to aligners you&#x27;ll quickly develop a technique that takes them out efficiently with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Outie tool works much better -- not quite as good as ThePulTool, but not bad, and has little trouble grabbing the trays.</li>
            <li> Worth the high price because it works.</li>
            <li> When I first got my Invisaligns at the beginning of August, 2009, I ordered this tool but didn&#x27;t think much of it.</li>
            <li> After the first couple days, I didn&#x27;t really feel any pain removing them.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve always been able to keep them long.  </li>
            <li> I really needed this devise when I first got my invisaline braces, becuase I couldn&#x27;t get them out without it.  </li>
            <li> The tool is not rigid enough and bends too easily.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but I learned from practice that if  I just left the tray in over night, in the morning it was easy to remove without a tool.  </li>
            <li> then I do not think that this tool is strong enough to lever the retainer off.</li>
            <li> I ended up ordering the large economy sized bag after several broke real easily removing the upper aligners.</li>
            <li> I can remove my bottom trays fine but no way on the upper one unless I have my outie tool!  </li>
            <li> It was actually really too large.</li>
            <li> Very helpful.</li>
            <li> Very helpful</li>
            <li> Really helps to remove braces.</li>
            <li> Makes life so much easier.  </li>
            <li> After that the aligners became much easier to remove without the help of any tools.</li>
            <li> Nadine, the owner, is very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> All I can say is that I am much happier about my trays now.</li>
            <li> Without outies, I always chipped my nails and ruined my manicure, but this makes my life so much easier.</li>
            <li> This is much faster and neater for removal and replacement.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really help.</li>
            <li> I really need a device that will be reliable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very happy!![[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Pull straight up/down, not out.</li>
            <li> it makes getting my braces out so much easier...</li>
            <li> This tool makes removal of the retainer trays so much easier, and saves on fingernail repair too.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing I didn&#x27;t get the instructions very well.</li>
            <li> Makes taking out much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> They pop out much easier that way.</li>
            <li> I high recommend this!</li>
            <li> The tool is so simple to use and is so very useful.</li>
            <li> Even after the first week or so of a new tray when they loosened up, my fingernails were still getting chipped.  </li>
            <li> I decided that I will not keep paying for this and started using the Dentek Sonic Pick which works much better, but it is dangerously sharp though.     </li>
            <li> I now only use them for the first day or two after I switch trays, but they are still worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s large enough to get a good grip, but small enough to fit in my purse.  </li>
            <li> When I first started wearing my Clear Correct aligners it took me about 30 minutes to remove them &amp; I ended up popping my crown off...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side pulls the top down and one side pushes the bottom up.</li>
            <li> Outie tools arrived just in time for me to switch to a new set of aligners, so I now have had a chance to really try it out.  </li>
            <li> The main issue at the time was pulling them up and over the attachment points --</li>
            <li> As others have reported, it simply wouldn&#x27;t grab onto the Invisalign trays, no matter how many different ways I tried to use it.</li>
            <li> After that, you will be able to pull the braces off with your fingers, also starting at the back.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool to if you have a number of buttons on your teeth.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little getting use to for the top</li>
            <li> Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but I find that my thumb nail is much more effective in removing my upper and lower trays.  </li>
            <li> It may work better for people who have few or no attachments.</li>
            <li> The ends of the Outie are tapered enough to get between the plastic and the gum and strong enough to pull the Invisalign off.</li>
            <li> My braces were on so tight and my fingernails are soft that I busted my lips many times just trying to remove them</li>
            <li> so I was used to using it - after the attachments I would not have been able to remove my aligners especially the first few days after change over .</li>
            <li> What did help was changing my new tray at night.</li>
            <li> so can&#x27;t really say much about the quality when it is being actually used.</li>
            <li> By the time they arrived a few days later, I had gotten the hang of taking the aligners out on my own, but still gave the Outie a try.</li>
            <li> An easier, tool free way to remove retainers is to simply grab with your finger nail on the inside of the tooth towards the back of the mouth.</li>
            <li> I have short nails and taking my aligners was a pain when I first got my aligners.  </li>
            <li> But then I found these little tools and now they come off easily.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought these because I was anxious about starting invisalign treatment.</li>
            <li> The plastic material needs to be more stronger and less brittle, especially for pulling off the uppers.</li>
            <li> I found that taking my 2 index fingers and pulling from the back and front from the back edge of the tray at the same time worked just fine for me.</li>
            <li> The concept of Outie is terrific, but these cheap plastic tools last only about four weeks.</li>
            <li> On some of the really difficult-to-remove sets that break the outies I use a wooden tongue depressor (even they break eventually) for the uppers and the outie to pop out the lowers.</li>
            <li> I completely relied on these when I had Invisalign</li>
            <li> They work well but aren&#x27;t really needed if you pry your braces off from the back.</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 and so far</li>
            <li> This tool fixed everything.  </li>
            <li> but now I have no trouble at all with it</li>
            <li> Like many Outie users, at first I was extremely excited to finally have found something that is actually made to remove these, almost impossible to remove, aligners.</li>
            <li> The other end hooks over the top aligner to pull it down.  </li>
            <li> They take all the stress out of the removal of invisible braces, especially for new patients who haven&#x27;t yet got the knack of removing their braces without inadvertently removing their fingernails.</li>
            <li> the hooks are far too thick to get in the areas you need them to fit.</li>
            <li> Do one side first, then the other.</li>
            <li> New Invisalign trays or retainers are VERY tight when you first put them in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Outie for a week and so far it is working as described.</li>
            <li> The latter tool was a complete fiasco.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because my first two Invisalign trays were tough to get off for the first couple of days.  </li>
            <li> I heard a lot about the pain of removing the invisalign trays, so I invested some cash for these special removal tools, which are literally just clumsy plastic hooks.</li>
            <li> The tool does not work well, It does not clip or grip on the top Invisalign tray well at all, and trying to use it takes an awkward amount of time which is really embarrassing when you&#x27;re in public and trying to be discreet.</li>
            <li> It is when trying to remove an aligner during the first few days (when you just made the switch) that one will break almost all Outies ordered, in a matter of seconds.</li>
            <li> When these first arrived I thought I had wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I ordered it in a panic the first night I got Invisalign because I was having so much trouble getting the aligners off.</li>
            <li> After breaking a few nails trying to remove my first set of Invisalign trays, I purchased the Outie removers that I had read about on an Invisalign feedback site.</li>
            <li> You can buy it at any drugstore, it costs less, and it&#x27;s actually more effective; the thin floss easily fits under the base of the invisalign tray at the back of your molar.  </li>
            <li> The first few weeks, these things really helped by getting those tight trays off and on my teeth when needed.  </li>
            <li> This little gadget has made my life so much easier.  </li>
            <li> and they are very difficult to get out, mostly every time you change to a new tray.</li>
            <li> I guess that is why the price is a little high.</li>
            <li> I found plastic or wooden crochet hooks to be just as effective, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> Life has been much easier with this little tool!</li>
            <li> They work fine but are a little hard on the gums to try and grab the Invisalign.</li>
            <li> When I first got my braces, I had a hard time getting them out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> When used during the last few days of the aligner period (the days almost tie to switch to a new aligner)</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I survived two months without these they have helped me so much with taking out my trays and makes it</li>
            <li> I have 15 attachments and the Invisalign is really hard to get out of my mouth after the first few days of a new tray.  </li>
            <li> My orthodontist suggested that I buy this when I had trouble getting a new tray out.  </li>
            <li> I never take the time to post product reviews - positive or negative.  </li>
            <li> 2 have broke, so I have kept the third one to use when I go out and have reverted back to using a teaspoon at other times.</li>
            <li> If I had known it would be even more awkward than using my hand to remove Invisalign I would not have even bothered.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The secret to getting your Invisaligns out is to use the tool first at the back of your mouth and work your way to the front.</li>
            <li> I have neither had damage to any of my attachments due to the Outtie as claimed by some, nor have I had any extra difficulty with removal over areas with attachments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The attachments can make the brace very tight and as the tool is only made of plastic, it weakens very quickly especially at the end that is used to lever up the bottom retainer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s really tough only the first few days.</li>
            <li> painless removal when its at the most painful.</li>
            <li> ** Upon coming across several negative reviews on the quality of this product, I felt it necessary to follow up on my experience with the Outtie.</li>
            <li> but in fact it was not really needed.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of $25--and</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say they are any easier or harder to use than fingernails, but I like that</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness someone posted about having the same trouble.  </li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve only broken 1</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the Outie tool breaking  (and I have 7 attachments on my upper teeth alone, so they&#x27;re not easy to remove).  </li>
            <li> Contrary to other reviews, I&#x27;ve been using one for over a week and it hasn&#x27;t broken, and seems very sturdy.  </li>
            <li> Since they are small and the edge is thin, it takes the aligners off fast and simply.</li>
            <li> I use it sometimes, and other times I just pop the invisalign out with my fingers.</li>
            <li> I imagine they are not designed to put up with extreme pressure.</li>
            <li> On first try I was not impressed with it.</li>
            <li> other paces</li>
            <li> I still prefer to use my fingers but if the first attempt fails, I reach for the outie and it works perfect.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do need to be a little careful as not to tear your tray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Really my only complaint is cost.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the plastic tip on the Outie, by design I suppose, is not that strong because it&#x27;s thin, so it tends to snap off after a few tries at prying out the retainer.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to plunk down the $ on this plastic tool..</li>
            <li> BUT I could not make it for less, nobody else sells it, and it is almost a necessity with attachments...</li>
            <li> I ordered the Outie tool less than a week after I got fitted for my Invisalign.  </li>
            <li> The first day after I got my Invisalign, I was desperate to find an easier way to remove them.  </li>
            <li> Today I just received my week 2 aligners and they are tight.</li>
            <li> Now I know how to get the trays out without the tool, but occasionally a new tray is difficult to remove</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s still a little tricky at the beginning, these do help.  </li>
            <li> Save me a lot of trouble and help prevent doing damage to the aligner due to excessive bending during removal.</li>
            <li> I wish there was an instrument made of metal, with a thin enough rubber-covered end.</li>
            <li> These Retainer Removal Tools have worked on a few occasions, but on a couple of others the tip broke when I was trying to take my invisalign braces off.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> It works wonders and you can get 20 or 30 in a pack for a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Outie because I had so much trouble removing my invisable braces.  </li>
            <li> My clear retainers are very tight, and it&#x27;s difficult to take them out.</li>
            <li> Shortly after trying these out I realized that the only benefit of using these was not having to use your finger nails which can be painful if your retainers are in tight.</li>
            <li> I was having such a difficult time removing my aligner because of the attachments (3).</li>
            <li> If u were buying this product to be discreet when taking your trays out, don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> I was not able to get them off.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I needed them.</li>
            <li> no more panic attacks or embarrassing moments trying to remove the trays discreetly.</li>
            <li> Mine may have been so difficult to both remove and replace because I have several attachments on my teeth.  </li>
            <li> Before, I was only removing the brace 3 times per day because it was so difficult.  </li>
            <li> For me, it was a total waste of money I am afraid.</li>
            <li> the aligners then were much tighter on the teeth, and the ends of the outie started to break.. :(</li>
            <li> all three have broken by now, in less than 2 weeks....</li>
            <li> The outie is difficult to use and honestly useless after day 2 in your new trays.</li>
            <li> and I had a hard time removing my aligners.</li>
            <li> A bit hard to maneuver around the invasilgn</li>
            <li> Too hard to use.  </li>
            <li> Bought for my son so he has one with him and extras if he loses any</li>
            <li> If you have these braces, no Dentist should send you out of the Dentist office without them or at least tell you about them.  </li>
            <li> Too delicate.</li>
            <li> One brand I tried was so thick that it couldn&#x27;t get into the space between my gum and the Invisalign.</li>
            <li> I showed the outie to my dentist and she had never seen one before so there must be a marketing opportunity that Nadine &amp; Co are missing there !!</li>
            <li> Once I got my invisalign attachments put on, it made removing my trays almost impossible resulting in cut lips and lots of frustration... not to mention how unsanitary it felt to be constantly putting my hands inside my mouth.  </li>
            <li> because the spoon seems a little weird.</li>
            <li> the material is too weak.</li>
            <li> This product sucks!</li>
            <li> I was doubtful at first, but they proved me wrong!</li>
            <li> The hard material they are made of made it difficult to place between my gums and the aligners.</li>
            <li> Sorry to write a negative review.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve broken trying to get them out.  </li>
            <li> Its unnecessary.</li>
            <li> In a year, I haven&#x27;t broken any of the Outies.</li>
            <li> The tips are too thick to get in there, and the hook end is at the wrong angle.</li>
            <li> No more standing in front of the mirror with my arm halfway in my mouth, awkwardly trying to pull the tray out.  </li>
            <li> No more having to reach into your mouth with your hands, possibly cutting your gums with your fingernails.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible time trying to remove my Invisalign braces, and it only got worse after they added attachments.</li>
            <li> I just started Invisalign and the retainers are extremely difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> The problem with Invisalign is that they don&#x27;t tell you how difficult the aligners are to remove after you get attachments bonded to your teeth.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I went to order another one, the website says they&#x27;re backordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it comes in a package of six</li>
            <li> I found these almost useless.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know if some are tighter than others, but in my case it was easier to use my nails than fiddle with an awkward implement.</li>
            <li> The day I got the attachments it was almost impossible to remove the aligner.</li>
            <li> I did not give this 1 star because it&#x27;s a bad product but because the company/people are charging $20 dollars for something that cost them 0.50 cents to make in China.</li>
            <li> Too bad my dentist has never heard of them.</li>
            <li> Using the outie was totally awkward and annoying.</li>
            <li> and I was so frustrated that I avoided eating</li>
            <li> I have invisaign, but I also like keeping my nails neatly painted and hate chipped polish.</li>
            <li> It was horrible trying to use a guitar pick.  </li>
            <li> Without it I would be spending an awful lot of time trying to take my braces out.</li>
            <li> I was having an awful time removing my Invisalign braces until I purchased this tool.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Very helpful. I keep on set in the bathroom and one in my purse.  Very helpful so I don&#x27;t break my fragile nails or ruin any manicures.  You won&#x27;t regret it.  I&#x27;m almost at the end of my invisalign and still have all pieces, no breakage.</li>
            <li> I had 12 attachments placed on my teeth. The day I got the attachments it was almost impossible to remove the aligner. Outie tool is a life saver.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because my first two Invisalign trays were tough to get off for the first couple of days.  While it&#x27;s still a little tricky at the beginning, these do help.  The best part is that they save me from tugging with my fingernails.  I usually use them for the first couple days, then I just use fingernails after my teeth have moved and the trays are easier to get off.</li>
            <li> Life has been much easier with this little tool! My dentist put attachments on my teeth since week 1 and I had a hard time removing my aligners. Nothing would work and I honestly thought that I would not eat for a week or two due to the difficulty in removing the aligners.   Today I just received my week 2 aligners and they are tight. However, with the Outie tools, i removed them in a matter of seconds. It is just amazing. Since they are not expensive at all, it is worth trying them just to see whether they work for you.</li>
            <li> A bit hard to maneuver around the invasilgn but they work well. Honestly, after the first tray of braces I can remove them easily enough with no tools.</li>
            <li> Really helps to remove braces. Worth the high price because it works.</li>
            <li> The tool looks like it would be helpful in removing the aligners but that&#x27;s not the case. The hard material they are made of made it difficult to place between my gums and the aligners. You are better off tearing your fingernail than using this device. Not only that but the hooks are far too thick to get in the areas you need them to fit.</li>
            <li> These outies are fantastic, real life savers. If invisalign wanted to improve their customer service, they would provide these to their patients. They take all the stress out of the removal of invisible braces, especially for new patients who haven&#x27;t yet got the knack of removing their braces without inadvertently removing their fingernails. Much better than any improvised methods, like crochet hooks, tweezers and the like.</li>
            <li> When I first got my Invisaligns at the beginning of August, 2009, I ordered this tool but didn&#x27;t think much of it. Last week, I got the attachments put on my teeth. I could not have removed my aligners without this tool! There is NOTHING like it. I bought just 3, I should have bought more! I keep one in my purse, one in my office and one at home, but I think it would be good to have extras, because this is as important as my toothbrush now. Never want to be caught without it! It is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought them pre-emptively thinking I would need them once the buttons went on but I actually found them much more difficult to use then my fingers.  My orthodontist taught me to take my invisalign off outside in and they just pop out that way.</li>
            <li> I think this was the quickest transaction I have ever had,it seemed like the next day the item arrived.The tool is so simple to use and is so very useful. before this I seemed to have all of my fingers in my mouth at the same time trying to lever the darn Invisalign off my teeth, and I have arthritis in my fingers so my grip is not what it used to be. I am ordering more today so i have them everywhere, car. work, home. . .\\&quot;[[ASIN:B001NFS4HW Invisible Braces - Retainer Removal Tool - Outie]]</li>
            <li> I was having such a difficult time removing my aligner because of the attachments (3). The Outie Tool really works! it popped it right off. Thank you thank you.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off growing your finger nails a bit longer than normal to pry off the invisalign than using these.</li>
            <li> I purchased the outie just before I got attachments on my teeth so I was used to using it - after the attachments I would not have been able to remove my aligners especially the first few days after change over . I showed the outie to my dentist and she had never seen one before so there must be a marketing opportunity that Nadine &amp; Co are missing there !!&lt;br /&gt;If you want to preserve your nails and save yourself a lot of stress BUY AN OUTIE</li>
            <li> The product works well. I like it.  Helps to remove my invisalign well.  I use it sometimes, and other times I just pop the invisalign out with my fingers.</li>
            <li> These tools are great!</li>
            <li> The tool itself looks fine but I&#x27;ve never got to use it so can&#x27;t really say much about the quality when it is being actually used. I thought it will be very useful for me at certain stage of treatment but in fact it was not really needed.</li>
            <li> The outies worked well until I had the attachments put on my teeth... the aligners then were much tighter on the teeth, and the ends of the outie started to break.. :( all three have broken by now, in less than 2 weeks.... I wish there was an instrument made of metal, with a thin enough rubber-covered end.</li>
            <li> Much better than shoving your fingers into your mouth to try and remove your liners.  They work just like they described.</li>
            <li> Recently got Invisalign braces.  Had heard about this tool and purchased prior to Ortho visit.  Thank God I did.  Would not have been able to remove the braces without it.  Makes life so much easier.  Anyone getting Invisalign, do yourself a favor and purchases this product.</li>
            <li> These are good especially because you can have them in different places since it comes with more than one.  They work fine but are a little hard on the gums to try and grab the Invisalign. What works best is a mini spoon that you can get at any kitchen store or Bed Bath and Beyond.  Since they are small and the edge is thin, it takes the aligners off fast and simply. I still use the removal tool if I have to remove these in public (try not to) because the spoon seems a little weird.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased! it makes removing the liners easy without breaking my finger  nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have shown it to my orthodontist office staff.</li>
            <li> During the first couple days with a new pair of Invisalign trays, it requires a good amount of effort to pull the trays out of my mouth for eating.  The main issue at the time was pulling them up and over the attachment points -- when I used my fingers to pull them out, I was simply pushing against the attachments and causing pain on those teeth when I did so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Outie tools arrived just in time for me to switch to a new set of aligners, so I now have had a chance to really try it out.  The tool popped the trays right out - no pain, and very quickly.  No more standing in front of the mirror with my arm halfway in my mouth, awkwardly trying to pull the tray out.  My wife doesn&#x27;t have to hear me swearing like a sailor out of pain and frustration anymore.</li>
            <li> The concept of Outie is terrific, but these cheap plastic tools last only about four weeks. I found plastic or wooden crochet hooks to be just as effective, and much less expensive.</li>
            <li> I love this thing!  I received my first set of Invisalign trays three weeks ago, and had a great deal of difficulty removing them.  This great little tool pops them right out.  The Outie is very affordable, and Natalie&#x27;s staff is great.. I ordered on Tuesday, received a response communication right way, and they were delivered Thursday.  Can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
            <li> This is definitely worth the money! So much easier when removing braces!  Start removing from the back molars.  A &amp;#34;must have&amp;#34;!</li>
            <li> Initially, I had difficulty in taking out my alligners. My finger nails took the brunt of it!&lt;br /&gt;Now it the retainer removal tool makes it EASY!</li>
            <li> The Outie is a Godsend! Threw away the original invisalign tool immediately after these arrived. I ended up ordering the large economy sized bag after several broke real easily removing the upper aligners. I keep them everywhere: at home, at work, in my car, and on me at all times.  The plastic material needs to be more stronger and less brittle, especially for pulling off the uppers. My orthodontist had never heard of them before(!!). On some of the really difficult-to-remove sets that break the outies I use a wooden tongue depressor (even they break eventually) for the uppers and the outie to pop out the lowers. If the plastic was stronger, I&#x27;d easily give 5 stars to this ingenious item.</li>
            <li> The outie helps with popping off Invisalign, especially after getting attachments.  However, I&#x27;ve discovered if I rinse my mouth with warm to hot water before removing trays,  they will come off quite easily. Don&#x27;t over do it with very hot water, it may damage the trays.  But warm water seems to soften them just enough to come off easily, even without the outie.  This has been my experience, we are all different. Read outie instructions for preventing breakage.  Love the Retainer Brite, works as described.</li>
            <li> I too have invisalign and they are very difficult to get out, mostly every time you change to a new tray. This tool is handy to help pop of one of the ends so you can grab it. I cannot say that you can only use the tool to get your trays out but the tool will help those who do not have nails to slip under the tray and save those who have nails to keep them from breaking and getting brittle. I use the tool to lift up the back of the tray enough so I can grab it with my fingers. I have not had the problem with the tool breaking but you do receive 6 tools (mine came with a bonus 7th tool) so considering how many they send I imagine they are not designed to put up with extreme pressure. The hand part of the tool is sturdy but the tips that actually slip under the tray are thinner which will make them easier to break.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my boyfriend who has invisilign braces.  He used it twice, and said it hurt more using these than just doing it by hand.</li>
            <li> Broke my nails while trying to remove the aligners after the first time they were put on. Ordered the tool after that hoping it would help. Until tool arrived used a plastic knife for a couple of days to help me remove the aligners. After that the aligners became much easier to remove without the help of any tools. Got the tool 4 days after my first set of trays. On first try I was not impressed with it. The tool is not rigid enough and bends too easily. The plastic knife was much more useful for me.</li>
            <li> Definitely a must to get the Invisalign braces out of your mouth to eat.  Bought for my son so he has one with him and extras if he loses any</li>
            <li> Nice ideas, easy to use but soon realized that using tool caused my retainer to break.  Thank you though for opportunity to try.</li>
            <li> I just started Invisalign and the retainers are extremely difficult to remove.  I&#x27;m recovering from injuries in both hands and this adds to the difficulty. I love Outie Tool as I&#x27;m now able to remove the retainers easily. I recommend this product enthusiastically to anyone using Invisalign!     Nadine, the owner, is very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly![[ASIN:B001NFS4HW Invisible Braces - Retainer Removal Tool - Outie]]</li>
            <li> Like many Outie users, at first I was extremely excited to finally have found something that is actually made to remove these, almost impossible to remove, aligners. When used during the last few days of the aligner period (the days almost tie to switch to a new aligner) they seem to work pretty good. It is when trying to remove an aligner during the first few days (when you just made the switch) that one will break almost all Outies ordered, in a matter of seconds. I actually reordered Outies about 3 or 4 times. I have reached a point I decided that I will not keep paying for this and started using the Dentek Sonic Pick which works much better, but it is dangerously sharp though.     Suggestion to Outie makers: If you can get the maker to use a stronger plastic, even if it cost a bit more to the consumer, it would be a much better product. Great concept but the material is too weak. If you do make a revised version, I will be more than glad to order the product and update my review.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this tool to if you have a number of buttons on your teeth.  This tool has been a lifesaver!!</li>
            <li> I bought these before I received my first set of Aligners.  I have tried several times, but have never found the angle of this item to be correct to remove them.  As a matter of fact, I have never even found it able to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; the edge to begin the process.  Perhaps I am doing something wrong, but I find that my thumb nail is much more effective in removing my upper and lower trays.  Sorry to write a negative review.  It sounds like some folks have had success, so by all means do try it.  For me, it was a total waste of money I am afraid.</li>
            <li> The problem with Invisalign is that they don&#x27;t tell you how difficult the aligners are to remove after you get attachments bonded to your teeth. I got my attachments yesterday (15 of them) and my aligners would not budge.  Fortunately I bought the Outie tool when I first got Invisalign and it was a godsend after I got the attachments. The staff at my orthodontist office was also very impressed with this tool.  I am able to pop the aligners out easily now and I don&#x27;t even need a mirror anymore. It is literally the only thing that I can use to remove my aligners. One end of the tool pushes the bottom aligner up and out. The other end hooks over the top aligner to pull it down.  I never leave home without my Outie tool!</li>
            <li> This works well once you get used to it. It removes the aligners much more easily that with your hands. It is nice to have one at home and one in my bag.</li>
            <li> Invaluable to my son who is wearing invisalign braces.</li>
            <li> After breaking most of my fingernails trying to get my trays out, I went online to do my research. What I found were these simple but ingenious tools to remove the Invisalign trays. All I can say is that I am much happier about my trays now. Taking them out to eat is an easy task now. I think all of the dentists that provide Invisalign treatment should recommend these Outie tools. I keep them all over the house and in every purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Outie for a week and so far it is working as described. Thank you for saving my fingernails!</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of $25--and it doesn&#x27;t work efficiently! If I had known it would be even more awkward than using my hand to remove Invisalign I would not have even bothered. The tool does not work well, It does not clip or grip on the top Invisalign tray well at all, and trying to use it takes an awkward amount of time which is really embarrassing when you&#x27;re in public and trying to be discreet. If u were buying this product to be discreet when taking your trays out, don&#x27;t waste your time! This product sucks! Just use your fingers it&#x27;s more effect, more discreet and doesn&#x27;t cost 25$!!!</li>
            <li> Oh, I love these outies. I have one in my pouch, at home, and another spare in my car just in case. Without outies, I always chipped my nails and ruined my manicure, but this makes my life so much easier. Whoever invented this must be a genius and life savior for Invisaligne wearers.</li>
            <li> When I got my Essex retainers I was not able to get them off.  It was horrible trying to use a guitar pick.  The ordeal left me not wanting to wear them.  But then I found these little tools and now they come off easily.  Very easily.  Every orthodontics should give these out to their patients.  A true life saver.</li>
            <li> I love these!! I cannot remove my braces without them!!</li>
            <li> Works great! painless removal when its at the most painful. I love these things so much. I was doubtful at first, but they proved me wrong! A+++ rating.</li>
            <li> I have a youth with invisalign braces, and removal and replacement of the aligners seemed to require every finger in the mouth at once.  This is much faster and neater for removal and replacement.  EVERYONE&#x27;s happier with the removal tool!</li>
            <li> When these first arrived I thought I had wasted my money. They weren&#x27;t significantly easier to use to remove my aligners than using my fingers and the hook side was pure nonsense as there was no way to get it between my aligner and my tooth. However, two days later I got my attachments on and this tool became a life saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One week later and I have yet to successfully remove my new aligner without them. I still can&#x27;t make the hook side work, but I&#x27;m so glad they come in a six-pack because I have them stashed everywhere. If you have or plan to get attachments - you need these!</li>
            <li> Allows you to get one side started easily!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t really help. My clear retainers are very tight, and it&#x27;s difficult to take them out. These devices did not make a difference.</li>
            <li> I had a terrible time trying to remove my Invisalign braces, and it only got worse after they added attachments. I ordered ThePulTool (thepultool.com), which worked great for six months before breaking. Unfortunately, when I went to order another one, the website says they&#x27;re backordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation, I ordered both this set of Outie tools and the pair of blue, angled Retainer Removal Tools (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00KBWE6UM) from Amazon. The latter tool was a complete fiasco. As others have reported, it simply wouldn&#x27;t grab onto the Invisalign trays, no matter how many different ways I tried to use it. A complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Outie tool works much better -- not quite as good as ThePulTool, but not bad, and has little trouble grabbing the trays. The &amp;#34;push up&amp;#34; feature for the bottom trays didn&#x27;t work on one side for me, as I have to grab the tray from the inside of my teeth because of a large attachment in that area, but fortunately the pulling end works fine on the bottom tray as well as the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still like ThePulTool best, particularly since it fits in my case, but until they&#x27;re available again, I recommend the Outie Tool. It&#x27;s nice that they send you several of them so that if one breaks, you&#x27;re not stuck trying to get your trays out by yourself without anything to help.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I bought these because I was anxious about starting invisalign treatment. I heard a lot about the pain of removing the invisalign trays, so I invested some cash for these special removal tools, which are literally just clumsy plastic hooks. I see on here that some people swear by these, but I can tell you (after just completing my invisalign treatment - I bought these a year ago) that I never onced used these hooks. Removing invisalign trays is actually a really easy process, and you get the hang of it after doing it once or twice. After the first couple days, I didn&#x27;t really feel any pain removing them. All in all, I&#x27;m sure this could work for some people, but you really don&#x27;t need them.</li>
            <li> The product is of good quality, but by the time these arrived,&lt;br /&gt;I had gotten proficient at removing Invisalign on my own, instructions with product indicate it may take some practice to get the hang of using it. I found no need to go that route. As a result, I&#x27;ve not used them.</li>
            <li> I bought these when I first got invisalign.  The first few weeks, these things really helped by getting those tight trays off and on my teeth when needed.  After a while, I got used to doing it without using these things.</li>
            <li> A must have if you ask me! When I first started wearing my Clear Correct aligners it took me about 30 minutes to remove them &amp; I ended up popping my crown off...that night I found these &amp; it has been smooth sailing since. Now I think they give you one with your starter kit...but I like having extra ones so I can keep one in my travel case &amp; other paces so I am never out without one.</li>
            <li> Wish I had found these sooner.  I&#x27;ve been wearing invisalign for six months and lost track of how many fingernails I&#x27;ve broken trying to get them out.  This tool is exactly what I need. Plus it keeps my fingers out of my mouth. Works great for grabbing as well as sliding them over the buttons.</li>
            <li> Its unnecessary. Just pull them out with your fingers.</li>
            <li> I use this to remove my invisalign braces. I have attachments and my fingernails were starting to hurt from attempting to remove the trays. I also always felt like I was going to break it. Upon searching I found this product and it appears to be the only product and it is only sold from this one seller. I guess that is why the price is a little high. Some people suggested crochet hooks but I didn&#x27;t want to risk it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One side pulls the top down and one side pushes the bottom up. Ingenious design. It&#x27;s plastic so it breaks before it breaks your invisalign (although it looks like it could damage them if used aggressively). I still prefer to use my fingers but if the first attempt fails, I reach for the outie and it works perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really my only complaint is cost. One order with tax and shipping is $25+ and that gets you 7 of them. The whole order prob costs $1 to manufacture which means there is a huge markup. BUT I could not make it for less, nobody else sells it, and it is almost a necessity with attachments... So just suck it up and pay for it. I rate the design a 5/5 and the value a 3/5</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to plunk down the $ on this plastic tool..but I&#x27;m glad I did.  I have 15 attachments and the Invisalign is really hard to get out of my mouth after the first few days of a new tray.  This tool makes it a lot easier...not to mention my nails have been saved. I&#x27;ve had the Outie for over a month and have not broken one yet! You do need to be a little careful as not to tear your tray.</li>
            <li> Too hard to use.  Better off using my fingernails to grab an edge.  Don&#x27;t know if some are tighter than others, but in my case it was easier to use my nails than fiddle with an awkward implement.</li>
            <li> These Retainer Removal Tools have worked on a few occasions, but on a couple of others the tip broke when I was trying to take my invisalign braces off.  I really need a device that will be reliable.</li>
            <li> I have invisilign and like most I freaked out the first week I had them and ordered these per online reviews. They didn&#x27;t work for me. I poked and jabbed myself more with them. I found that taking my 2 index fingers and pulling from the back and front from the back edge of the tray at the same time worked just fine for me. Figuring out how to take your invisible braces off just takes a bit of time and patience. Don&#x27;t feel rushed to get these.</li>
            <li> I completely relied on these when I had Invisalign - I kept breaking off my attachments, and once I purchased this tool, it eliminated many future trips to the ortho office for replacement attachments.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how I survived two months without these they have helped me so much with taking out my trays and makes it so I am not sticking my fingers in my mouth.</li>
            <li> An invaluable too. Without it I would be spending an awful lot of time trying to take my braces out. With the Outie, it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> They worked fine and came in a timely manner.  When I first got my braces, I had a hard time getting them out of my mouth.  These tools helped tremendously.</li>
            <li> They work well but aren&#x27;t really needed if you pry your braces off from the back. If you don&#x27; have strong fingernails, these are pretty much a necessity.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me at all. I ordered it in a panic the first night I got Invisalign because I was having so much trouble getting the aligners off. By the time they arrived a few days later, I had gotten the hang of taking the aligners out on my own, but still gave the Outie a try. For the life of me I cannot get this to take of the aligners. All it does is scrape up my gums. Save your money.</li>
            <li> Save yourself some time and money and buy a Reach Flosser.  You can buy it at any drugstore, it costs less, and it&#x27;s actually more effective; the thin floss easily fits under the base of the invisalign tray at the back of your molar.  Now you know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Reach-Access-Flosser/dp/B0017TU2HE/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1366732265&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;reach+flosser</li>
            <li> I have invisaign, but I also like keeping my nails neatly painted and hate chipped polish. I wouldn&#x27;t say they are any easier or harder to use than fingernails, but I like that I no longer chip my polish.</li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my money. The outie is difficult to use and honestly useless after day 2 in your new trays. Using the outie was totally awkward and annoying.</li>
            <li> This product is great!  No more having to reach into your mouth with your hands, possibly cutting your gums with your fingernails.</li>
            <li> I was terrified the first week that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to get my Invisalign off so I ordered these. But after a week of waiting for them, I had mastered taking them in and out with my hands. I personally do not feel these are needed.</li>
            <li> I was quite excited when I saw these.  I have short nails and taking my aligners was a pain when I first got my aligners.  These are flimsy, don&#x27;t grip the aligner properly and basically do not do what their sole purpose is.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  If you&#x27;re new to aligners you&#x27;ll quickly develop a technique that takes them out efficiently with your fingers.</li>
            <li> This item is the same that I need for my braces. The quality is equal and the price is excellent.</li>
            <li> These did not work at Ll. They break too easily.</li>
            <li> If, like me,  you have attachments with your invisilign then I do not think that this tool is strong enough to lever the retainer off. The attachments can make the brace very tight and as the tool is only made of plastic, it weakens very quickly especially at the end that is used to lever up the bottom retainer. I ordered 3 and so far 2 have broke, so I have kept the third one to use when I go out and have reverted back to using a teaspoon at other times.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good idea but when I tried to use it, the plastic is so cheap, it couldn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s thing. My fingernails do a better job.</li>
            <li> I never take the time to post product reviews - positive or negative.  But I just had to share that this product is the best!  Up until I got my Invisilign braces, my fingernails had always looked pretty good.  I&#x27;m lucky that my natural nails are pretty strong and I&#x27;ve always been able to keep them long.  But when I got my Invisalign braces, my thumbnails just got DESTROYED.  Even after the first week or so of a new tray when they loosened up, my fingernails were still getting chipped.  This tool fixed everything.  I love it.  Wish my dentist had recommended it when I first got the braces.  My thumbnails have grown back and I&#x27;m very happy!![[ASIN:B001NFS4HW Invisible Braces - Retainer Removal Tool - Outie]]</li>
            <li> This product does not work for me. I have several attachments with my invisalign treatment. Using this product as directed does not help me remove the aligners. It may work better for people who have few or no attachments.</li>
            <li> The first day after I got my Invisalign, I was desperate to find an easier way to remove them.  These work perfectly.  I now only use them for the first day or two after I switch trays, but they are still worth it.</li>
            <li> The secret to getting your Invisaligns out is to use the tool first at the back of your mouth and work your way to the front. Pull straight up/down, not out. Do one side first, then the other. The ends of the Outie are tapered enough to get between the plastic and the gum and strong enough to pull the Invisalign off. Once the backs are free, you can use either both hands or the Outie to pull them off of the front. One brand I tried was so thick that it couldn&#x27;t get into the space between my gum and the Invisalign. In a year, I haven&#x27;t broken any of the Outies. I have used three in the package. I keep one in my purse, one in the kitchen, and one in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really tough only the first few days. After that, you will be able to pull the braces off with your fingers, also starting at the back. A spoon handle works just as well and won&#x27;t break. In a pinch, I use the handle of plastic utensils. However, that&#x27;s so crass!</li>
            <li> Save money...I&#x27;m able to get the top aligner out but for the bottom I use a hard plastic toothpick.  It works wonders and you can get 20 or 30 in a pack for a few bucks.  Keep it clean and you can keep reusing it.</li>
            <li> This item did not work for me.  It was actually really too large.</li>
            <li> I was having an awful time removing my Invisalign braces until I purchased this tool. I love, love it  ! Now the braces slip off in a second and spare breaking my nails.....................awesome !!!</li>
            <li> Not sure I needed them.</li>
            <li> i just recently got the invisilign braces and i love love this tool.  it makes getting my braces out so much easier...</li>
            <li> After breaking a few nails trying to remove my first set of Invisalign trays, I purchased the Outie removers that I had read about on an Invisalign feedback site. What a difference!!! Removal is super quick and easy--no more panic attacks or embarrassing moments trying to remove the trays discreetly. My orthodontist had never heard of the Outie, so I brought one in to show him--hopefully he will pass on this great idea to his other patients. I&#x27;m just happy that I found these lifesavers early in treatment--I can&#x27;t imagine tugging on the trays with your fingers for an entire year--there are enough drawbacks to the system already!!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t work at all on my invisalign trays. Just can&#x27;t get the hooks in there. The tips are too thick to get in there, and the hook end is at the wrong angle. In fairness though, a friend gave me a different kind to try, and it didn&#x27;t work either.</li>
            <li> This tool makes removal of the retainer trays so much easier, and saves on fingernail repair too.  I keep one in my purse for when I eat out, 1 at the office, and the others at home.</li>
            <li> These can be handy in the right situations. I&#x27;m a dental assistant and just started Invisalign. I think these can be helpful to some but as a learning curve .</li>
            <li> I ordered the Outie tool less than a week after I got fitted for my Invisalign.  I was having difficulties removing them and my dentist recommended this.  Thank gosh he did!  They work wonderfully.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the Outie tool breaking  (and I have 7 attachments on my upper teeth alone, so they&#x27;re not easy to remove).  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> **UPDATE** Upon coming across several negative reviews on the quality of this product, I felt it necessary to follow up on my experience with the Outtie. 7 months have passed with daily, multiple times a day, of use. I have yet to have an Outtie break, still using the first one I took out of the package in December! I have neither had damage to any of my attachments due to the Outtie as claimed by some, nor have I had any extra difficulty with removal over areas with attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Original review: Super fast shipping. Makes removing braces a breeze! Saves nails and the pain and frustration for those who don&#x27;t have any. Especially came in handy when I got my attachments placed. Raved about it to my orthodontist and encouraged him to order for his patients. They were all amazed at the ease of using the tool.</li>
            <li> This is so superior to the tool the dentist gave me that it isn&#x27;t even funny. Use this - not that - it is just that simple</li>
            <li> This is something you can make at home easily. I did not give this 1 star because it&#x27;s a bad product but because the company/people are charging $20 dollars for something that cost them 0.50 cents to make in China.</li>
            <li> If you have Invisalign braces and want to take them out with ease- invest in this tool! It is amazing.</li>
            <li> Save me a lot of trouble and help prevent doing damage to the aligner due to excessive bending during removal.</li>
            <li> This little gadget has made my life so much easier.  Once I got my invisalign attachments put on, it made removing my trays almost impossible resulting in cut lips and lots of frustration... not to mention how unsanitary it felt to be constantly putting my hands inside my mouth.  I keep one of these in every purse I own!!!</li>
            <li> I am new to invisiline and this handy little tool works great.  I also liked the &amp;#34;extras&amp;#34; so I can keep one in my car, purse, bathroom, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have short finger nails so these work great for me.</li>
            <li> It works awesome for my bottoms, whereas i was using my thumbnail all the time. It takes a little getting use to for the top but now I have no trouble at all with it</li>
            <li> These are ok, but believe me, after your first week with invisilign braces, you will never use them.  Hold off.</li>
            <li> I bought these when I began wearing invisalign retainers. I no longer use them. Tried them a couple of times, but I just use my fingers now to remove/insert my aligners. I&#x27;m guessing I didn&#x27;t get the instructions very well. Who knows? They may work for you.</li>
            <li> The Outie is invaluable if you are an Invisalign wearer. New Invisalign trays or retainers are VERY tight when you first put them in. Don&#x27;t know what I would have done had I not be warned to have an Outie on hand to pry the retainer out. Finger nails don&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s not that easy. Unfortunately, the plastic tip on the Outie, by design I suppose, is not that strong because it&#x27;s thin, so it tends to snap off after a few tries at prying out the retainer. I don&#x27;t know whether an alternative material (steel??) would work better, but I DO know you should plan to have and keep more than one Outie because they don&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I love these things. Too bad my dentist has never heard of them.</li>
            <li> I really needed this devise when I first got my invisaline braces, becuase I couldn&#x27;t get them out without it.  Unfortunately, it comes in a package of six and I really only need one.  Now I know how to get the trays out without the tool, but occasionally a new tray is difficult to remove so I keep one in my bag just in case.</li>
            <li> If you have these braces, no Dentist should send you out of the Dentist office without them or at least tell you about them.  My braces were on so tight and my fingernails are soft that I busted my lips many times just trying to remove them and I was so frustrated that I avoided eating just so I didn&#x27;t have to take them out.  Thank goodness someone posted about having the same trouble.  Thank you so much!!!</li>
            <li> Too delicate. You&#x27;re better off using a bobby pin.</li>
            <li> Works awesome on the invislign braces.  Makes taking out much easier and quicker.</li>
            <li> The need for this item is overstated and it doesn&#x27;t work nearly as easily or as painlessly as they make it seem. Also they&#x27;re way over priced. Shortly after trying these out I realized that the only benefit of using these was not having to use your finger nails which can be painful if your retainers are in tight. An easier, tool free way to remove retainers is to simply grab with your finger nail on the inside of the tooth towards the back of the mouth. They pop out much easier that way.</li>
            <li> I bought the Outie because I had so much trouble removing my invisable braces.  Mine may have been so difficult to both remove and replace because I have several attachments on my teeth.  Using the Outie has been a huge help.  It&#x27;s large enough to get a good grip, but small enough to fit in my purse.  Contrary to other reviews, I&#x27;ve been using one for over a week and it hasn&#x27;t broken, and seems very sturdy.  Before, I was only removing the brace 3 times per day because it was so difficult.  Now I don&#x27;t mind taking them for a quick 10 minutes to have some hot coffee or whatever. I high recommend this!</li>
            <li> These are a must if you are getting invisalign braces!  I can remove my bottom trays fine but no way on the upper one unless I have my outie tool!  Do wish they were a tad bit stronger.  So far I&#x27;ve only broken 1 but after I did, I have been more gentle so that I don&#x27;t break any more.  I have one of these everywhere cause you never know when you&#x27;ll need one.</li>
            <li> My orthodontist suggested that I buy this when I had trouble getting a new tray out.  It didn&#x27;t help.  What did help was changing my new tray at night. I don&#x27;t know why, but I learned from practice that if  I just left the tray in over night, in the morning it was easy to remove without a tool.  I found these almost useless.</li>
