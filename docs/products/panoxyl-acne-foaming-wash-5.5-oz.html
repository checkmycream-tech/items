            <li>Lil lady is happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t even describe how happy this makes me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The cloth is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;SO happy.</li>
            <li>and it works great.  </li>
            <li>But its a great product.</li>
            <li>Great product.  </li>
            <li>This is great.  </li>
            <li>controls my acne great</li>
            <li>Always a great product and a great price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li>best thing about the foaming wash is that it washes clean.  </li>
            <li>Great product have been using for many year.</li>
            <li>This brand works great for me and keeps me acne free!</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t wear nice tops, even had intimacy problems.</li>
            <li>and you can control the amount you use very easily.  </li>
            <li>It also seems to be more effective</li>
            <li>Add a microderm abrasion scrub after or in place of the prewash for even better results.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling better then soap post-wash.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it, it cleared up my acne and got rid of my ingrown whiskers.</li>
            <li>so make sure you use a oil free moisturizer with spf !</li>
            <li>all love it</li>
            <li>Most drug stores carry products with salicylic acid, which does not work for me at all.  </li>
            <li>( I&#x27;d say it keeps 70% of the redness/ breakouts at bay) but pleased that he has received a lot of relief with this product.</li>
            <li>It is over the counter- you can buy it in many shops.</li>
            <li>many  months,  and it seemed to help  his acne.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>And try to avoid touching your face.</li>
            <li>I use this once a day in the shower and with a Salux cloth for exfoliation for my best and back acne.</li>
            <li>However, the more I used it, the better my skin got.</li>
            <li>It works it really works!!!!  </li>
            <li>Once adding the panoxyl I have notice more a flawless look with no new breakouts</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t even try to use it on more sensitive areas though, lol.</li>
            <li>Great product kept my skin clear and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite strong</li>
            <li>I recommend this to my patients and my own family members as a first line acne treatment.  </li>
            <li>But I stuck with it, and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  </li>
            <li>Highest concentration of benzoyl peroxide wash available over the counter.</li>
            <li>I first tried my pharmacy&#x27;s generic brand, and it wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li>but I have reduced it to just using it in the morning to get all the oils off of my face and a more gentle cleanser at night.</li>
            <li>Now, I only use this on my skin and a really good moisturizer</li>
            <li>PanOxyl quickly ruined my towel though (no surprise since it has Peroxide in).</li>
            <li>you should find PanOxyl effecting you quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice to get more than expected sometimes.</li>
            <li>Love this brand for the adult acne.</li>
            <li>This definitely works for acne - and it&#x27;s pretty strong so probably better for acne on the back/shoulder area.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll apply it right after I wash, brush my teeth, and apply it again.  </li>
            <li>but you really need to let it rest on your face for a bit for the full effect.</li>
            <li>Pretty damn powerful for a non prescription.</li>
            <li>Benzoyl peroxide wash is great because not only does it work, but assuming you thoroughly wash your face with water, it doesn&#x27;t come with the bleaching risk that the topical lotions and gels do.  </li>
            <li>Interestingly, the Retin-A seemed to control acne somewhat, but it didn&#x27;t do enough.  </li>
            <li>It SCRUBS like no loofa or any similar product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried MANY products over the years and have found only two that work for me--Proactive and PanOxyl.</li>
            <li>My doctor first recommended this to me when i was 19</li>
            <li>first I was using it in the shower</li>
            <li>The 10% BP really is better for cystic teen acne, I think.  </li>
            <li>PanOxyl has really helped me keep my skin calm.  </li>
            <li>He said Im gonna get flaky or peeling skin during the first week</li>
            <li>really works for my son!</li>
            <li>I have spent years looking for a good face wash that keeps my sensitive skin clear and acne free.</li>
            <li>A great and less drying face wash combo to keep pores clean for the long haul.</li>
            <li>Even at 70+ years of age, he still has outbreaks of acne and this product helps to clear it up quickly.</li>
            <li>Other wise your skin will more than likely get red, sting, and peel.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>The combination really works well.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It really does change your life when you no longer have pimples on your face.  </li>
            <li>If you have clogged pores or bacterial acne, I really think you should give this stuff a shot.  </li>
            <li>am writing this review for both products since I don&#x27;t know which one is responsible for this awesomeness.</li>
            <li>It really does.  </li>
            <li>, i started using the foaming wash and it really cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li>just my cheek would break out its very drying and doesnt lather much its still holding up prob have it for a while it holds alot</li>
            <li>I really like panoxyl.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really helps.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>After the 5th day, i simply had to reintroduce a light moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I really like this wash.</li>
            <li>(I guess things I should already be doing anyways haha...), which works really well for me.</li>
            <li>I would also advise that users wear sunscreen regularly because my skin became more sensitive to sun exposure after I started using this product.</li>
            <li>Works better than Pro Active for me and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>I found it very effective in helping with my acne, its a little drying, but I&#x27;ll take dry over acne any day.</li>
            <li>I also use Simple&#x27;s Repleneshing Rich Moisturizer since it&#x27;s nice and thick, and not irritating.  </li>
            <li>people are concerned that their skin may be too sensitive for it (the concentration of BP is pretty high).</li>
            <li>It is a  decent  product.  </li>
            <li>This face wash is over all a decent product.</li>
            <li>Its a good value because a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clear, does not overdry my skin, and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Took a break for a few days, and now I&#x27;m just using it once a day, more as a preventative than anything at this point.  </li>
            <li>The actual Panoxyl is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I think this stuff leaves a slight peroxide film on your face through out the day, which I am good with because it keeps my face clear but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li>Non-irritating or drying to my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My clear skin owes it to you Amazon!</li>
            <li>-  since  my  son  has  not  been  using  it  for  the  past  5  months.&lt;br /&gt;Without  using  this  product,  there are  more  pimples.  </li>
            <li>I started going overboard to make sure that I rinsed it all off</li>
            <li>I started getting acne as an adult, and typically get the &amp;#34;cyst&amp;#34; kind of pimples that take a long time to develop and go away.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time in my 27 years of life that I have found a cleanser that actually helps to keep my face and body clear.</li>
            <li>The package was right, it can dry out yiur skin if you</li>
            <li>It is keeping my skin clear even in humid conditions.</li>
            <li>It can&#x27;t seem to 100% clear it up</li>
            <li>Helps clear my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t clear up overnight</li>
            <li>but you will stay clear if you continue to use it.  </li>
            <li>Yeah probably--but you&#x27;ll be left with rough, red, burned, sandpaper-like skin that flakes and peels, which doesn&#x27;t look any better than acne.</li>
            <li>Ive suffered from acne since I was 13 years old</li>
            <li>Just some old scarring and pixelated areas.</li>
            <li>Also, might be a placebo effect, but the old pixelated marks seem to be fading quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>service guy fixed my order and expedited it.  </li>
            <li>Even as an adult I would continue to get acne flare ups.</li>
            <li>PanOxyl washes off completely.</li>
            <li>For me, this seems to work really well, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li>Start out slow and work your way up to using it more frequently.  </li>
            <li>Clean vs. tight or stripped.</li>
            <li>Made a big different at first.</li>
            <li>It manages my breakouts better than all the other products I have tried, but be careful!</li>
            <li>major side effect is dryness, however, I am prepared to accept dryness for clear skin.  </li>
            <li>The existing acne went away faster and new breakouts were less intense.</li>
            <li>It the only product that keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 years old, male.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use anything but coconut oil on my skin now for fear of irritating it even more.</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and started drying up my daughter&#x27;s persistent acne visibly faster than other products.</li>
            <li>I only uses 2 -3 times per week and alternate with my other products such as an exfoliating 1 time a week and a mild daily cleanser 2 times a day (morning&amp; night) and a clay mask once a week.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out</li>
            <li>Irritated and dried out my skin, but this isn&#x27;t my first time using product.</li>
            <li>Also, when I first started using it, I noticed that this dried out my skin a lot.</li>
            <li>but it also left my skin super dry and tight and scaly.</li>
            <li>I think, in general, the skin on your body is thicker and is less delicate than your face, which means it can tolerate more abrasive acne treatments.</li>
            <li>My oil production is half as much now.</li>
            <li>My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long time, and it&#x27;s only getting clearer.  </li>
            <li>The foaming wash lasts a long time--a little dab applied to your hands works into a full lather if your face is wet.</li>
            <li>It takes about 2 months to clear, roughly...</li>

            <li> I think this stuff leaves a slight peroxide film on your face through out the day, which I am good with because it keeps my face clear but doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> Non-irritating or drying to my very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> My clear skin owes it to you Amazon!</li>
            <li> -  since  my  son  has  not  been  using  it  for  the  past  5  months.&lt;br /&gt;Without  using  this  product,  there are  more  pimples.  </li>
            <li> I started going overboard to make sure that I rinsed it all off</li>
            <li> I started getting acne as an adult, and typically get the &amp;#34;cyst&amp;#34; kind of pimples that take a long time to develop and go away.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time in my 27 years of life that I have found a cleanser that actually helps to keep my face and body clear.</li>
            <li> The package was right, it can dry out yiur skin if you</li>
            <li> It is keeping my skin clear even in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> It can&#x27;t seem to 100% clear it up</li>
            <li> Helps clear my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t clear up overnight</li>
            <li> but you will stay clear if you continue to use it.  </li>
            <li> Yeah probably--but you&#x27;ll be left with rough, red, burned, sandpaper-like skin that flakes and peels, which doesn&#x27;t look any better than acne.</li>
            <li> Ive suffered from acne since I was 13 years old</li>
            <li> Just some old scarring and pixelated areas.</li>
            <li> Also, might be a placebo effect, but the old pixelated marks seem to be fading quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> service guy fixed my order and expedited it.  </li>
            <li> Even as an adult I would continue to get acne flare ups.</li>
            <li> PanOxyl washes off completely.</li>
            <li> For me, this seems to work really well, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different</li>
            <li> Start out slow and work your way up to using it more frequently.  </li>
            <li> Clean vs. tight or stripped.</li>
            <li> Made a big different at first.</li>
            <li> It manages my breakouts better than all the other products I have tried, but be careful!</li>
            <li> major side effect is dryness, however, I am prepared to accept dryness for clear skin.  </li>
            <li> The existing acne went away faster and new breakouts were less intense.</li>
            <li> It the only product that keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old, male.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use anything but coconut oil on my skin now for fear of irritating it even more.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and started drying up my daughter&#x27;s persistent acne visibly faster than other products.</li>
            <li> I only uses 2 -3 times per week and alternate with my other products such as an exfoliating 1 time a week and a mild daily cleanser 2 times a day (morning&amp; night) and a clay mask once a week.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out</li>
            <li> Irritated and dried out my skin, but this isn&#x27;t my first time using product.</li>
            <li> Also, when I first started using it, I noticed that this dried out my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> but it also left my skin super dry and tight and scaly.</li>
            <li> I think, in general, the skin on your body is thicker and is less delicate than your face, which means it can tolerate more abrasive acne treatments.</li>
            <li> My oil production is half as much now.</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long time, and it&#x27;s only getting clearer.  </li>
            <li> The foaming wash lasts a long time--a little dab applied to your hands works into a full lather if your face is wet.</li>
            <li> It takes about 2 months to clear, roughly...</li>
            <li> Always a new blemish, and the resulting dark mark would take months to fade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned, 10% BP will dry the hell out of your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t knock this stuff because it did clear my skin up a lot, but I would only use it maybe every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Recently, my skin started looking worse then it did in high school, so searched and found Panoxyle on Amazon and bought it fast.</li>
            <li> but I guess pretty common for these types of products.</li>
            <li> So far, the pimples on my arms and back have dried out -</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Also took the redness out of at least half of the old and new...</li>
            <li> Use it only once a day and moisturize with cetaphil the other end of the day.</li>
            <li> however it does make your face dry</li>
            <li> those with really dry skin, or prone to cystic acne (which dry skin aggravates), I recommend starting by washing once a day every other day, and then going to once a day after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I recommend a prewash to remove oil, PamnOxyl should be left on for a few minutes, then</li>
            <li> I went to the military and a doctor prescribed benzoyl peroxide gel for the face after I wash my face.  </li>
            <li> Having a thick moisturizer will clear up the dryness.  </li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> first I was experiencing these kinds of symptoms all over but since cutting down my frequency of use and incorporating cerave creme, my skin is soft and my acne has improved.</li>
            <li> This combination is somewhat common for both dry and oily skin (because one type isn&#x27;t enough...</li>
            <li> I noticed my forhead getting dry and tight</li>
            <li> Retin-A .05 due to ongoing pimple problems.  </li>
            <li> Cleared up my skin really quickly, I only use a little bit twice a day after a little bit a salicylic acid wash and it seems to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended this along with a Retin-A for a small break out of white heads.</li>
            <li> so I would advise using it once every other day to start off with.</li>
            <li> started using this brand in March of this year and within two weeks my breakouts were under control and now seven months later I have very few breakouts and when I do have a pimple, it is always on the surface vs in the tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little too irritating for my skin, so my dermatologist suggested only using it once every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely make extra effort to keep this stuff away from your eye area, mouth, and under your nose.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s ever been severe, but it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of slowing down.  </li>
            <li> This product is definitely responsible for clearing up bad acne on my husband&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> I have also found that the wash is less drying than the bar--though in the winter I sometimes find the 10% is too</li>
            <li> Black heads diminished.</li>
            <li> I do noticed a bit of drying so don&#x27;t leave it on for too long or scrub to hard.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin and added this to my regimen and have been experience little to no breakouts.</li>
            <li> I shave with it everyday.</li>
            <li> I got to where I was using it twice a day for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Apply for a few minutes every morning and night any</li>
            <li> If I forget to wash my face or take makeup off and get blemished, it clears them up in a few days.  </li>
            <li> I found this product at a small doctor&#x27;s office pharmacy a few years ago and now use nothing else.  </li>
            <li> Controls blemishes and excessive oil.</li>
            <li> In comparison to other BP products, Panoxyl seems to be the least irritating.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been pretty annoying, so I decided to try this product.</li>
            <li> to the Foaming Washing a year or so ago when I had a hard time finding the bar.</li>
            <li> So what I did was just switch to taking only cold showers and applying a lotion immediately afterwards</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff after suffering a really bad breakout for unknown reasons.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s going to get worse</li>
            <li> , MUCH WORSE, before it gets better&amp;#34; deals.  </li>
            <li> not sure if it works didnt have bad acne</li>
            <li> It is extremely difficult to find products with benzoyl peroxide at these stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Proactive is extremely expensive and requires a subscription service.  </li>
            <li> , that was a sad surprise</li>
            <li> Worst case, doxycycline helps body acne (and last resort - accutane for severe cystic).</li>
            <li> and then my face started peeling like crazy around my mouth and nose.  </li>
            <li> I assume this is because the BP is pulling all of the bad stuff toward the surface to get rid of it.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely hated my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this brand for the adult acne. It works any where you put it on. I do noticed a bit of drying so don&#x27;t leave it on for too long or scrub to hard. But noticeably reduces pimples over night.</li>
            <li> I go to a dermatologist regularly.  Last year, I was prescribed Retin-A .05 due to ongoing pimple problems.  I&#x27;m 25 years old, male.  Interestingly, the Retin-A seemed to control acne somewhat, but it didn&#x27;t do enough.  I still had breakouts and pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, my derm recommended I apply retin-a at night, then in the morning, get a shower and wash with Panoxyl.  This combination is somewhat common for both dry and oily skin (because one type isn&#x27;t enough...ugh!)  I must say - I have never been clearer!  The combination really works well.  In comparison to other BP products, Panoxyl seems to be the least irritating.  It also seems to be more effective and I like the foaming properties of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does change your life when you no longer have pimples on your face.  If you have clogged pores or bacterial acne, I really think you should give this stuff a shot.  My dermatologist recommended it and I will definitely buy it regularly from now on.</li>
            <li> HeHelps quite a bit with preventing or clearing up standard breakouts. I recommend a prewash to remove oil, PamnOxyl should be left on for a few minutes, then later a moisturizer to prevent dryness. Add a microderm abrasion scrub after or in place of the prewash for even better results.</li>
            <li> This face soap is the best! Even after our family was stationed in Germany, I still needed my Panoxyl face soap and Amazon offered it at a low price and exceeded my expectations with their speedy delivery! My clear skin owes it to you Amazon!</li>
            <li> Best face wash I have found.  Non-irritating or drying to my very sensitive skin.  Controls blemishes and excessive oil.</li>
            <li> Great for getting the city grime and gunk off my face at the end of the day in NYC. When it foams it started dissolving off the oil and or dirt. Leaves my skin feeling better then soap post-wash. Clean vs. tight or stripped. Afterward, I can moisturize or apply Tretinoin and moisturize.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it, it cleared up my acne and got rid of my ingrown whiskers. I shave with it everyday.</li>
            <li> For some reason, I started having problems with pimples on my shoulders and my upper back area. It&#x27;s been pretty annoying, so I decided to try this product. So far, the pimples on my arms and back have dried out - so I will continue using this.</li>
            <li> Will this get rid of your acne? Yeah probably--but you&#x27;ll be left with rough, red, burned, sandpaper-like skin that flakes and peels, which doesn&#x27;t look any better than acne. I moisturized too...it didn&#x27;t make a difference.</li>
            <li> Ive suffered from acne since I was 13 years old and I am now 22, this is the only face wash that I have ever used that had actually cleared my face within a week. however it does make your face dry so make sure you use a oil free moisturizer with spf !</li>
            <li> Made a big different at first. Then, stopped working.</li>
            <li> I found it very effective in helping with my acne, its a little drying, but I&#x27;ll take dry over acne any day. Cleared up my skin really quickly, I only use a little bit twice a day after a little bit a salicylic acid wash and it seems to do the trick for me.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years, I&#x27;ve also given it to my kids, nieces,&lt;br /&gt;nephews and grandkids, when they had breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all love it</li>
            <li> Lil lady is happy, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> My daughters dermatologist recommended this face wash and she&#x27;s seen results from it. Would recommend for acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have always had a problem back. Always a new blemish, and the resulting dark mark would take months to fade. Couldn&#x27;t wear nice tops, even had intimacy problems. Absolutely hated my back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought &amp;#34;Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/towel&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Stiefel PanOxyl 10 Percent Benzoyl Peroxide Foaming Wash&amp;#34; at the same time since I saw that combination recommended in one of the reviews. That was 40 days ago. Not one blemish since then!! Just some old scarring and pixelated areas. I can&#x27;t even describe how happy this makes me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PanOxyl quickly ruined my towel though (no surprise since it has Peroxide in). I don&#x27;t care!!! Also, might be a placebo effect, but the old pixelated marks seem to be fading quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am writing this review for both products since I don&#x27;t know which one is responsible for this awesomeness. The cloth is great. It SCRUBS like no loofa or any similar product I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried many. Don&#x27;t even try to use it on more sensitive areas though, lol. I use this combination on my back, then switch to a milder soap and softer cloth for the rest of my body. Could probably do my feet with it too.. will try that next time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SO happy.</li>
            <li> Great product have been using for many year. It is keeping my skin clear even in humid conditions.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this product for years and loves it.  Even at 70+ years of age, he still has outbreaks of acne and this product helps to clear it up quickly.</li>
            <li> I started getting acne as an adult, and typically get the &amp;#34;cyst&amp;#34; kind of pimples that take a long time to develop and go away.  Most drug stores carry products with salicylic acid, which does not work for me at all.  It is extremely difficult to find products with benzoyl peroxide at these stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried MANY products over the years and have found only two that work for me--Proactive and PanOxyl. Proactive is extremely expensive and requires a subscription service.  I found this product at a small doctor&#x27;s office pharmacy a few years ago and now use nothing else.  It keeps my skin clear, does not overdry my skin, and is a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Works better than Pro Active for me and is much cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great product kept my skin clear and smooth to the touch.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely responsible for clearing up bad acne on my husband&#x27;s back. It can&#x27;t seem to 100% clear it up ( I&#x27;d say it keeps 70% of the redness/ breakouts at bay) but pleased that he has received a lot of relief with this product. He reports no dryness but please rinse well or this will STAIN your towels and clothing!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 25 but have been suffering from nonstop acne since I was 12.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s ever been severe, but it hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of slowing down.  I&#x27;ve tried what seems like every OTC product as well as Rx antibiotic medications, both topical and internal.  This caught my eye from another person&#x27;s review on how this was their replacement for a discontinued Rx wash they were using.  Benzoyl peroxide works.  It really does.  It kills the acne causing bacteria, thus you have no source for acne to begin.  However, this for me was one of those &amp;#34;it&#x27;s going to get worse, MUCH WORSE, before it gets better&amp;#34; deals.  I assume this is because the BP is pulling all of the bad stuff toward the surface to get rid of it.  My face was hell for about a month, to the point where makeup just was not enough to cover everything.  But I stuck with it, and I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.  My face hasn&#x27;t been this clear in a long time, and it&#x27;s only getting clearer.  I might even consider going out in public without any make up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, 10% BP will dry the hell out of your skin if you&#x27;re not careful.  Start out slow and work your way up to using it more frequently.  I got to where I was using it twice a day for a few weeks and then my face started peeling like crazy around my mouth and nose.  Took a break for a few days, and now I&#x27;m just using it once a day, more as a preventative than anything at this point.  I also use Simple&#x27;s Repleneshing Rich Moisturizer since it&#x27;s nice and thick, and not irritating.  I&#x27;ll apply it right after I wash, brush my teeth, and apply it again.  This tends to prevent any dryness.</li>
            <li> I have been using the bar for awhile but it became unavailable, i started using the foaming wash and it really cleared up my acne.</li>
            <li> not sure if it works didnt have bad acne just my cheek would break out its very drying and doesnt lather much its still holding up prob have it for a while it holds alot</li>
            <li> My doctor first recommended this to me when i was 19 and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. Not once during concistant use did i have a breakout. You can FEEL the results in just 3 minutes as your skin starts feeling like it&#x27;s drying out. I found that I had to dial back my use because the 10% Benzoyl Peroxide was so strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was using it in the shower but you really need to let it rest on your face for a bit for the full effect. Apply for a few minutes every morning and night any you should find PanOxyl effecting you quickly.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended 10 benzoil peroxide.  I really like panoxyl.  It does not dry out and you can control the amount you use very easily.  It lasts a long time.  A side note - I made a mistake when I was ordering and the online cust. service guy fixed my order and expedited it.  Nice to get more than expected sometimes.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this face wash to me.  I&#x27;ve been using it the last year and it works great.  As a warning, it might bleach your towels or bathmat if you use them immediately after washing with it.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to my patients and my own family members as a first line acne treatment.  Highest concentration of benzoyl peroxide wash available over the counter.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps. I first tried my pharmacy&#x27;s generic brand, and it wasn&#x27;t that great. The actual Panoxyl is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and started drying up my daughter&#x27;s persistent acne visibly faster than other products. The 10% BP really is better for cystic teen acne, I think.  Also took the redness out of at least half of the old and new...</li>
            <li> Very good product. I have acne prone skin and added this to my regimen and have been experience little to no breakouts. I only uses 2 -3 times per week and alternate with my other products such as an exfoliating 1 time a week and a mild daily cleanser 2 times a day (morning&amp; night) and a clay mask once a week. Once adding the panoxyl I have notice more a flawless look with no new breakouts</li>
            <li> I started using this stuff after suffering a really bad breakout for unknown reasons. I used it 1-2x a day for almost 2 weeks. My skin did start clearing up but it also left my skin super dry and tight and scaly. I can&#x27;t use anything but coconut oil on my skin now for fear of irritating it even more. I can&#x27;t knock this stuff because it did clear my skin up a lot, but I would only use it maybe every other day or so. Definitely not twice a day. Also it bleached my washcloth and my towel, that was a sad surprise but I guess pretty common for these types of products.</li>
            <li> It is a  decent  product.  It is over the counter- you can buy it in many shops. I  had my teenage son wash with it  many  months,  and it seemed to help  his acne.  I  see the difference  between  using  it  and  not  using  it  -  since  my  son  has  not  been  using  it  for  the  past  5  months.&lt;br /&gt;Without  using  this  product,  there are  more  pimples.  The soap made by the same company  does not work as well as this.  I  also used the sulfur clay masks by Peter Thomas Roth - keep on for 5 hours.  ( you can use them as spot treatments also)</li>
            <li> Recommended by my dermatologist. Very good product.</li>
            <li> PanOxyl has really helped me keep my skin calm.  Even as an adult I would continue to get acne flare ups. I switched from  [[ASIN:B0000Y3COC PanOxyl Bar 10% - 4 oz - 1 Bar]] to the Foaming Washing a year or so ago when I had a hard time finding the bar. I am glad I did.  The foaming wash lasts a long time--a little dab applied to your hands works into a full lather if your face is wet. I have also found that the wash is less drying than the bar--though in the winter I sometimes find the 10% is too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing about the foaming wash is that it washes clean.  I find that a lot of face and acne products feel like there is a residue left over.  PanOxyl washes off completely. And it works: my face is calmer when I regularly use this product (and the convenience of ordering online can&#x27;t be beat!)</li>
            <li> Pretty damn powerful for a non prescription. The package was right, it can dry out yiur skin if you uae it too often. I noticed my forhead getting dry and tight so I had to start using a lotion after I used it. But its a great product.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived on time. Thanks</li>
            <li> A dermatologist recommended this along with a Retin-A for a small break out of white heads. Use only at night. Results are visible in 2-3 days if you do not use a moisturizer at night. Black heads diminished. After the 5th day, i simply had to reintroduce a light moisturizer. Purpose from Johnson n Johnson. After outbreak, I created a mixture of water, Panoxyl and Purpose face wash. A great and less drying face wash combo to keep pores clean for the long haul.</li>
            <li> It manages my breakouts better than all the other products I have tried, but be careful! It&#x27;s quite strong so I would advise using it once every other day to start off with. I would also advise that users wear sunscreen regularly because my skin became more sensitive to sun exposure after I started using this product.</li>
            <li> I had been using salsylic acid on my face ever since I have had acne.  I went to the military and a doctor prescribed benzoyl peroxide gel for the face after I wash my face.  The acne cleared up.  So i was honorably discharged and got to thinking maybe the wash should be benzoyl peroxide based as well.  It works it really works!!!!  My oil production is half as much now.</li>
            <li> Irritated and dried out my skin, but this isn&#x27;t my first time using product.</li>
            <li> This is the first time in my 27 years of life that I have found a cleanser that actually helps to keep my face and body clear. I was using it morning and night but I have reduced it to just using it in the morning to get all the oils off of my face and a more gentle cleanser at night. I also stopped using it at night because for a while I could not figure out why my pillow cases kept getting bleached out spots on them.. Ruined all of my pillow cases before it dawned on me. I also ruined a couple of colored towels before realizing this as well. Once I did associate the product with the ruining my pillow cases and towels I started going overboard to make sure that I rinsed it all off but it didn&#x27;t stop it. I think this stuff leaves a slight peroxide film on your face through out the day, which I am good with because it keeps my face clear but doesn&#x27;t dry it out. I just use my white towels now and it&#x27;s all good. I recommend it as a spot treatment as well.</li>
            <li> Very good face wash.  Helps clear my son&#x27;s acne.</li>
            <li> Very good product Does the job quite well for me. Wouldnt use anything else, unless you bring back the 8% cream..</li>
            <li> I use this in the shower with the Clairisonic Mia. It will bleach anything it touches, It will even lighten the stubborn blackheads that aren&#x27;t leaving. This is my third tube so I would definitely recommend and purchase again.</li>
            <li> This face wash is over all a decent product. Its a good value because a little goes a long way. It is a little too irritating for my skin, so my dermatologist suggested only using it once every other day.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely make extra effort to keep this stuff away from your eye area, mouth, and under your nose. Other wise your skin will more than likely get red, sting, and peel.&lt;br /&gt;At first I was experiencing these kinds of symptoms all over but since cutting down my frequency of use and incorporating cerave creme, my skin is soft and my acne has improved. I will continue this face wash but I might consider the lower dose version so I do not have to skip a day.</li>
            <li> This is great.  If I forget to wash my face or take makeup off and get blemished, it clears them up in a few days.  It the only product that keeps my face clear.</li>
            <li> I really like this wash. I had used it years ago, but then could no longer find it in stores. Recently, my skin started looking worse then it did in high school, so searched and found Panoxyle on Amazon and bought it fast. It has helped quite a bit, and I plan on continuing to use it as part of my skin regiment.&lt;br /&gt;For those with really dry skin, or prone to cystic acne (which dry skin aggravates), I recommend starting by washing once a day every other day, and then going to once a day after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I purchased this multiple times. Love it. It&#x27;s recommended by my dermatologist. Use it only once a day and moisturize with cetaphil the other end of the day. Will cause dryness but you can avoid it. This product works.</li>
            <li> This definitely works for acne - and it&#x27;s pretty strong so probably better for acne on the back/shoulder area.  It won&#x27;t clear up overnight but you will stay clear if you continue to use it.  It takes about 2 months to clear, roughly...Cleocin might help too - ask your dermatologist.  Worst case, doxycycline helps body acne (and last resort - accutane for severe cystic).</li>
            <li> controls my acne great</li>
            <li> I have spent years looking for a good face wash that keeps my sensitive skin clear and acne free. Since I suffer from cystic acne I cannot use just any face wash.  I did some research and found Panoxyl 10 to be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this brand in March of this year and within two weeks my breakouts were under control and now seven months later I have very few breakouts and when I do have a pimple, it is always on the surface vs in the tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major side effect is dryness, however, I am prepared to accept dryness for clear skin.  Having a thick moisturizer will clear up the dryness.  Also remember that in order for this product to work, you must use it every day.  I wash my face in the morning and at night.  And try to avoid touching your face.</li>
            <li> I use this once a day in the shower and with a Salux cloth for exfoliation for my best and back acne. Within a couple weeks of using it, I already could tell the difference. The existing acne went away faster and new breakouts were less intense. After over a month of using it, I stopped getting breakouts altogether.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people are concerned that their skin may be too sensitive for it (the concentration of BP is pretty high). I think, in general, the skin on your body is thicker and is less delicate than your face, which means it can tolerate more abrasive acne treatments. For me, this seems to work really well, but everyone&#x27;s skin is different so be careful. Also, when I first started using it, I noticed that this dried out my skin a lot. So what I did was just switch to taking only cold showers and applying a lotion immediately afterwards (I guess things I should already be doing anyways haha...), which works really well for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this face wash for about five years.  Benzoyl peroxide wash is great because not only does it work, but assuming you thoroughly wash your face with water, it doesn&#x27;t come with the bleaching risk that the topical lotions and gels do.  This brand works great for me and keeps me acne free!</li>
            <li> Always a great product and a great price.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist told me to use this. He said Im gonna get flaky or peeling skin during the first week or so which is what happened. However, the more I used it, the better my skin got. Now, I only use this on my skin and a really good moisturizer and I&#x27;m done!</li>
            <li> really works for my son!</li>
