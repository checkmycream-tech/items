            <li>Feels great after a nice shave.</li>
            <li>This product is a good value and feels nice on my face and neck.  </li>
            <li>Smells even better!</li>
            <li>It will make your skin look simply amazing within 30 minutes of you applying it.  </li>
            <li>It also absorbs into the skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say I have never used better products.</li>
            <li>I still like my Proraso products, but you get a lot more bang for your buck with the Suavecito.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li>smells ok but leaves skin a litter sticky not for me</li>
            <li>As a post shave, its ok.  </li>
            <li>Great stuff, I use it after every shave to cool things off after the hot towel..</li>
            <li>Perfect for dry skin!</li>
            <li>Cool and refreshing.</li>
            <li>So first of all the stuff is awesome for the visual effect it has as a moisturizer and concealer.  </li>
            <li>Excellent for year round use.</li>
            <li>Cool on your face.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and it is refreshing, but far from overpowering.  </li>
            <li>Smells minty fresh and leaves my skin nice and soft.</li>
            <li>The overall scent is more herbal.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it smells exactly like minty cocaine.</li>
            <li>Leaves my face smooth and soft, not oily.</li>
            <li>The menthol scent leaves quickly and your left with smooth skin.</li>
            <li>I know nobody uses pencils anymore, but the eraser head is about the right size in terms of how much of this stuff you should apply.  </li>
            <li>Large 8 oz.</li>
            <li>As far as performance, it goes on very lightweight and does disappear fairly quickly leaving my freshly shaved skin feeling fairly soft.</li>
            <li>Really like the scent, application and the way it feels after application.</li>
            <li>For men as aftershave, or women for a light moisturizer...great after facial exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Not too much menthol, very minty.</li>
            <li>I find the menthol really soothes my skin and gives it a moisturized feel.</li>
            <li>Not as heavy on the menthol as I would have liked, and the eucalyptus is much more prevalent than expected.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much more than any other brand of after shave.  </li>
            <li>Better than art of shaving, neiva, neuter gena, a tie with Jack Black after gel</li>
            <li>I usually fan a bit of air on my face right after application, this cools things down very nicely..</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Leaving my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I have been using Proraso products for a long time and had to try the Suavecito based on the positive reviews and recommendations.  </li>

            <li> I have been using Proraso products for a long time and had to try the Suavecito based on the positive reviews and recommendations.  This stuff works well and it is a great value for the money.  The tub this creme comes in os going to last me a long time.  It goes on smooth and it is refreshing, but far from overpowering.  It also absorbs into the skin nicely.  If you are at all interested in it, for the price, you would be silly not to try it.  Suavecito vanishing creme is a great bargain for the price.  I still like my Proraso products, but you get a lot more bang for your buck with the Suavecito.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and great price. I use it daily!</li>
            <li> Great product. Cool on your face. Doesn&#x27;t leave my face oily. A little goes s long way. Smells great. You get a lot for the $.</li>
            <li> Not as heavy on the menthol as I would have liked, and the eucalyptus is much more prevalent than expected.  The overall scent is more herbal.  As far as performance, it goes on very lightweight and does disappear fairly quickly leaving my freshly shaved skin feeling fairly soft. I&#x27;ll use this tub, but will probably not replace it.</li>
            <li> This product is a good value and feels nice on my face and neck.  I like the jar instead of a bottle or plastic tube.  My wife also likes it and uses it after shaving her legs.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great product.</li>
            <li> Really like the scent, application and the way it feels after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Suavecito shaving products for a month or so. I can honestly say I have never used better products. I have sensitive skin with a tough beard and over the years I have tried just about every product I could find. With the Suavecito I get a close shave with a minimal amount of razor burn and the Vanishing creme soothes that.</li>
            <li> Large 8 oz. tub. Smells minty fresh and leaves my skin nice and soft. A little bit goes a long way, so this will last me a few months I reckon. Awesome find!</li>
            <li> smells ok but leaves skin a litter sticky not for me</li>
            <li> Soooo awesome! Man or woman, this stuff rocks! Cool and refreshing. For men as aftershave, or women for a light moisturizer...great after facial exfoliation. Helps control breakouts, and even helps heal breakouts and diminish scars.</li>
            <li> So first of all the stuff is awesome for the visual effect it has as a moisturizer and concealer.  It will make your skin look simply amazing within 30 minutes of you applying it.  That&#x27;s the good.  And you don&#x27;t need a lot of it - in fact you shouldn&#x27;t use a lot of it.  I know nobody uses pencils anymore, but the eraser head is about the right size in terms of how much of this stuff you should apply.  Seriously.  It&#x27;s that effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the downside is that it will make your skin totally greasy after a few hours of it being applied, causing you to blot or wipe it off lest you look like you&#x27;re sweating.  Especially if you&#x27;re darker in skin tone.</li>
            <li> Yes, it smells exactly like minty cocaine. For reals. The consistency is just like Noxzema and a little dab goes a long way, so should last a long time. There seems to be some sort of liquid separation that happens in the tub, so I just shake it up before use. Soothing post shave experience and no oily break outs later. So remember....minty, cocainey Suavecito! Tony Montana approved.</li>
            <li> This is a great, soothing aftershave creme. Not too much menthol, very minty. Excellent for year round use. Leaves my face smooth and soft, not oily. You get a ton of product for little money. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Feels good. Smells even better!</li>
            <li> Great stuff, I use it after every shave to cool things off after the hot towel.. I usually fan a bit of air on my face right after application, this cools things down very nicely..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mix it when you get it. That will take care of the watery consistency. Use before talc not after..</li>
            <li> Feels great after a nice shave. I find the menthol really soothes my skin and gives it a moisturized feel.</li>
            <li> Menthol, refreshing,soft, creamy perfect for after a shave. Leaving my skin soft. The menthol scent leaves quickly and your left with smooth skin. Better than art of shaving, neiva, neuter gena, a tie with Jack Black after gel and but this is cream. Kiel&#x27;s is close but this is manlier. Perfect for dry skin!</li>
            <li> As a post shave, its ok.  It doesn&#x27;t do much more than any other brand of after shave.  Does smell very nice though, so I am going to keep using it.</li>
