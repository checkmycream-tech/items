            <li>I recieved this product for free from influnser, and it did a good job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences products before and generally liked them, but I do think this is my favorite one.</li>

            <li>Recieved a free sample and LOVED it.</li>
            <li>This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo was a wonderful surprise.</li>
            <li>I imagine a &amp;#34;detoxification&amp;#34; would take more than one wash, so perhaps that process explains my results, but no matter, the shampoo smells and works amazing</li>
            <li>I think its the best fragrance Herbal Essences has come up with in a good long while.  </li>
            <li>Gives a really good lather though with just one pump full which I liked.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing as well, very fresh!</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo has a wonderful smell, lathers nicely, leaves my hair looking good, or at least as good as it can look.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, a very good shampoo for decent price.  </li>
            <li>A rich and creamy lather covered my head which felt and, as mentioned, smelled good.</li>
            <li>Loved the fresh scent and the detoxifying naturals!</li>
            <li>It has a nice light scent which I also liked.</li>
            <li>It lathers up great and kind of &amp;#34;tingles&amp;#34; on my scalp in a way I really like.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers good to clean my hair and freshen it.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells great, very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>very clean and smells great, received complimentary</li>
            <li>I have to say I was pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li>For it&#x27;s price range, this shampoo is pretty great.</li>
            <li>One thing I enjoy is having nice clean and smell good hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I liked that it rinsed easy</li>
            <li>I received a free trial size of this Herbal Essences shampoo from Vox Box and I love it!</li>
            <li>Got these products to try for free and I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li>I am very thrilled about the clean sensation of this product,I got this product for free testing for free!</li>
            <li>I washed my hair many times with this shampoo and it makes my hair feels clean and smells great but not as the original herbal essences products.</li>
            <li>Ok so I tried this product free from Influenster, I have to say I love it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, I love the smell.</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not terribly overpowering either.</li>
            <li>for the detox side, I can&#x27;t be totally sure if it does what it says.</li>
            <li>I am in love with the scent.</li>
            <li>Many shampoos use a lot of great-sounding phrases and buzz words to get you buy their product.</li>
            <li>and I have thoroughly enjoyed using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this shampoo system :)</li>
            <li>Love how my hair feels too.</li>
            <li>but in a good fresh way</li>
            <li>(There are more ingredients</li>
            <li>Lovely is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>Love how it made my hair shiny but not oily.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This product also makes my hair a lot more manageable while brushing it.</li>
            <li>It also makes my hair much more hydrated</li>
            <li>I love the way this product smells.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Had a light, nice scent.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I got this shampoo to test for free from Influenster!  </li>
            <li>great and very relaxing</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, ingredients could be better.  </li>
            <li>The smell does wear off after a while and of course it&#x27;s not like magic.</li>
            <li>I’m already in love with these products and love how my hair smells, looks, and feels.</li>
            <li>This is a ok shampoo.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>i am in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I personally love this product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to my friends for sure.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was ok.</li>
            <li>When I had initially used the set, which includes a shampoo, conditioner, and an intensive treatment, my hair had tons of product in it from styling it the day before, so with its detoxifying attributes I thought it would be perfect to try out.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job of cleaning my locks while at the same time hydrating them.</li>
            <li>For the most part when it comes to shampoo, that&#x27;s the wife&#x27;s job</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>At this length I&#x27;m better off using just shampoo and nothing else.  </li>
            <li>The scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li>I received the trio of Wild Naturals products containing cassia and lemon basil to review (free of charge) and was impressed by the smell and the results.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I got this shampoo for free as a sample from Influenster!</li>
            <li>My favorite product from this line was the intensive treatment.</li>
            <li>and I like to leave a review stating that I am in love with this collection as soon as I receive this product</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the Lemon basil with cassia flower sent.</li>
            <li>The sent is so refreshing that it makes me feel relaxed.</li>
            <li>I used it in combination with the conditioner, which I was also highly pleased with.</li>
            <li>To start with I love most of the herbal essences products.</li>
            <li>Salon quality aroma for sure.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightand refreshing...</li>
            <li>Love that the scent lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to try this shampoo out for free!</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li>, I mostly pick up on the ginger over the lemon and cassia.</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d a deluxe sample to try free from influenster in my VoxBox</li>
            <li>the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t work the best with my hair type which is curly.</li>
            <li>I love the Thai Lemon Basil smell.  </li>
            <li>I actually enjoyed all three products.  </li>
            <li>I can go outside and not have to worry about my hair in the humid weather, like how awesome is that!</li>
            <li>and i cant stop feeling and touching my hair after i shower</li>
            <li>However, this wasn&#x27;t my favorite shampoo</li>
            <li>However, I do love the Herbal essence shampoo in the orange container.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s for women for the most part.  </li>
            <li>I would love to see it come in a volumizing version.  </li>
            <li>and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li>I love herbal essence scents and the naturals line</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the shampoo quite a bit.</li>
            <li>I followed up with the matching conditioner and was equally pleased.</li>
            <li>It is worth noting, however, that the fragrance does not linger after my shower, which I consider to be a good thing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used so many Herbal Essences products over the years and have always like them.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner was ok as well.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li>I have to say I love this product</li>

            <li>I LOVE LOVE</li>

            <li>I was satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this shampoo for review, and I was certainly glad I did.</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences has proved to be a refreshing break from the harshness I sometimes put my hair through.</li>
            <li>I used the oil elixir the next morning and a couple drops did an awesome job of rejuvenating my curls for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just OK</li>
            <li>I love the way they smell</li>
            <li>and I must say, I love them.</li>

            <li>Herbal Essences is a brand I trust and have been using for many years</li>
            <li>and I was going to be able to try out one of their newest products.</li>
            <li>so I could see how the product performed over time, and I have to say that the longer I use it, the better my hair looks and feels.</li>

            <li>and it&#x27;s pretty good.  </li>
            <li>;) who doesn&#x27;t like receiving compliments about their hair smelling good?</li>
            <li>Was so excited to try them out!</li>
            <li>In fact, my hair looks better than it has for quite some time-shiny ,silky, and full of volume!</li>
            <li>I am beyond happy with this product line and while the products I received were for a free trial, I will absolutely continue to purchase these items.</li>
            <li>I color my hair, and also shampoo and blow dry every day, so my hair is not always in the best shape.</li>
            <li>It was okay, but I noticed that my hair was getting greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li>Next, the shampoo lathers rather nicely, and the conditioner was great for detangling.  </li>
            <li>It works great, cool my scalp and felt like a medicated shampoo at first</li>
            <li>I got a complimentary sample via Influnester and have really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li>It does a very nice job of getting the gunk of the products out of the hair yet leaving it fresh, light and clean.  </li>
            <li>And was so clean!</li>
            <li>This shampoo cut through any and all residue from styling products leaving my hair feeling really clean!  </li>
            <li>Like all herbal essences products, this particular line smells amazing!</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t often get that jazzed about a certain scent, but this stuff smells really good.</li>
            <li>I am not normally a lemon fan but this shampoo had a nice invigorating scent and it felt great also :-)</li>

            <li>Loved getting to try this great product, the smell was great and the shampoo really lathered well for a small amount.</li>
            <li>HERBAL ESSENCES Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo and Detoxifying Conditioner works great.</li>
            <li>I have used this for three mornings now, and I can safely say that my hair is softer and feels cleaner in that a comb runs through it smoothly without any clumps or tangles.</li>
            <li>I also love the light, lemon-basil smell.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling shampoo that isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li>The scent was light and refreshing and reminded me of the times I have gone to get my hair cut</li>
            <li>It smells good, and really cleans well.</li>

            <li>I was really excited when I saw the name &amp;#34;wildly natural&amp;#34; because I had been looking for a shampoo that was better for my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall good product and would recommend!</li>
            <li>other than that it is a great product and i would recommen!!</li>
            <li>So I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d ever actually pay for it unless walmart or somewhere runs a good sale!</li>
            <li>I was excited to try it because I love Herbal Essence products.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received my free Influenster VoxBox in the mail with this product!</li>
            <li>I bought the full size shampoo even before my tester ran out!</li>
            <li>Hair felt clean and the scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li>It is clean and refreshing without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love herbal essences it smelled so good and keeps my hair so soft too.</li>
            <li>I love the clean smell that this product has.</li>
            <li>I like this product most out of the detox line, as I feel it really cleans your hair and scalp with a nice herbal touch.</li>
            <li>These products leave a strong musky citrus smell.</li>
            <li>This is an OK Product for the price, but it isn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li>I would like they have more good things to come and something more specific for every type of hair</li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh and clean!</li>
            <li>Smell great, clean well, not heavy feeling.</li>

            <li>This product smelled amazing and left my hair feeling very clean and smooth!</li>
            <li>The Detoxifying products left my hair feeling smelling good, clean, soft without fly away hairs.  </li>
            <li>The smell makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa… It leaves my fine hair clean without stripping.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very fresh, lemon based scent.</li>

            <li>hair does feel very clean and fresh after using it.</li>
            <li>It did have slip so I was able to detangle very quickly and easily, and my hair was very soft but strong and not overly mushy at all.  </li>
            <li>I would say this product is great, has a nice smell and works great in my hair, however i have very dry hair that needs a ton of extra moisturizer, although very hydrating, for my hair</li>
            <li>They are light and lefty hair feeling really clean.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this free in an Influenster box and, while I do like the scent, it doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair.</li>
            <li>This shampoo does a nice job of gently cleansing my hair, with a mild, lemony fragrance and a very surprisingly rich lather.  </li>
            <li>I significantly noticed the difference after 3 washes.</li>
            <li>Smells great, though it doesn&#x27;t linger long after a wash.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about trying it because I don&#x27;t use herbal essences very often but with the way it made my hair feel I would use it all the time!</li>
            <li>Shampoo is a good one, with a low enough price and sufficiently attractive packaging</li>
            <li>So when I got this in the mail I was so excited to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the scent.</li>
            <li>but then you realize that it&#x27;s herbal essences because of the unique scent.</li>
            <li>This is mostly a chemical product with the first two ingredients being:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the lemony smell at first until I was overtaken by the basil.</li>
            <li>I was excited.</li>
            <li>I really love this shampoo after a night out, it really strips all of the product and junk out of your hair!</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary sample to try and I&#x27;ll definately be buying it!</li>
            <li>The scent was refreshing and crisp.</li>
            <li>I received the complimentary herbal essence rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner, and oil from influenster to review!</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I was one of the few lucky people who were chosen to test this product!!</li>
            <li>The smell is very crisp and clean &amp; the products really do make your hair feel nice.</li>
            <li>I have very fine, straight hair, but this shampoo</li>
            <li>When I learned that I was going to get the shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment in my first voxbox, I was very excited.</li>
            <li>it gets my hair really clean.</li>
            <li>It smells citrus and clean.</li>
            <li>it made my head feel clean</li>
            <li>It rinsed cleanly away without any residue.</li>
            <li>Even went 2 days without washing my hair and it still lathered and felt clean.</li>
            <li>really clean feeling.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always amazed at how clean my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>this shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>I had paid about twice as much for my healthy shampoo than the cost would be for the Herbal Essence ( this was a free test product in this</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I used to like Herbal Essences&#x27; Drama Clean</li>
            <li>My hair feels really clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>I received a complimentary package from Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo/conditioner and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean.</li>
            <li>While giving it a clean shiny look.</li>
            <li>Itreally does clean well</li>
            <li>I am almost completely finished with it, I love it!</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;m always looking for products to increase the shine in my hair, I was pretty excited to try it!</li>
            <li>After using this product just once my hair feels clean and full of life.  </li>
            <li>Much more information can be found concerning these seeds, but it does seem reasonably certain that they add value to the conditioning properties of this shampoo to heal damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked that it made my hair soft and clean with one wash.  </li>
            <li>I love this product it let my hair really shiny and clean feeling</li>
            <li>It smelled so good and left my hair feeling so clean.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the smell if the new line, it&#x27;s floral-y to me and the dry oil spray adds a beautiful non greasy shine.</li>
            <li>I got this product for free to review but that does not mean that I am just going to love the product.</li>
            <li>Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li>I have to say the elixir is my favorite as I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>It rinsed cleanly and quickly.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Influenster for the free product!</li>
            <li>My hair feels stronger and has more volume than ever, thanks to the detoxifying shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I really love the lemon scent, it also lathers up very well</li>
            <li>, it isn&#x27;t overly floral or overly sweet.</li>
            <li>The shampoo feels thick and smells delicious!!</li>
            <li>I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review completely free.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo and conditioner package is okay, but I don&#x27;t like how it made my hair smell - it smells too much like chemicals for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li>After using it, my hair is full and soft, and has a nice luster.</li>
            <li>typically don&#x27;t care much for shampoos as my heart belongs to conditioner, but this one is simply wonderful.</li>
            <li>I was pretty excited when I learned I would receive this product as well as the conditioner and intensive treatment conditioner in my very first vox box!</li>
            <li>It lathered up nicely and left my hair feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>Some smells, albeit pleasant smells, are best left behind in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean scent that wakes me up in the morning</li>
            <li>The shampoo, conditioner &amp; intensive treatment altogether leaves my hair feeling clean &amp; refreshed, with a fresh lemony scent.</li>
            <li>I was able to try and review these products thanks to the complimentary samples from influenster.</li>
            <li>It tames it and keeps it super hydrated.</li>
            <li>I received a free bottle of this shampoo from influenster to review and test and so far I love it.</li>
            <li>When I purchase shampoo, I am looking for two main things, price and lack of too many unpronounceable chemicals.</li>
            <li>Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day!</li>
            <li>I may have been able to try this thanks to a sample, but I will definitely be buying more!  </li>
            <li>Great end results, since it left my hair looking smooth and feeling soft to the touch, absolutely ready to unleash my own pure self in my revitalized locks.</li>
            <li>Love the smell other wise works just as good as any other products</li>
            <li>Overall, I am VERY, VERY pleased with the product and how my hair feels.</li>
            <li>I like the smell and my hair looks better than normal after using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did because I wouldn&#x27;t normally try it myself.  </li>
            <li>Second I noticed the amazing clean feeling of my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li>nothing special other than the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>The product smells great and it left my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>I recommend it to anyone who is searching for something new and healthy for their hair.</li>
            <li>Refreshing and made my hair look like new.</li>
            <li>Love the summery scent of this new shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>I washed my hair first with a good lather, I then finished with the conditioner and the intensive treatment conditioner last.</li>
            <li>I like the conditioner because it was very lightweight and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li>They also make flat ironing my hair so much simpler because I do not have near as many fly aways/frizzies.</li>
            <li>I grew up using Herbal Essences products, I admit that besides their high quality, I’ve always love the products fragrance, and this Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo excels at it, because the scent is outstanding.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed as I squeezed a modest amount of shampoo into the palm of my hand was a light and pleasant citrus smell which became more pronounced as I worked the shampoo into my wet hair and scalp.</li>
            <li>I love the fresh scent, I do wish that the scent lasted longer after my shower, it seems to fade pretty fast.</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have ever used this product and it&#x27;s fanatasic!</li>
            <li>Almost from the first use, I could tell a significant difference - the hair felt healthier, smoother, softer and even my scalp condition has improved.</li>
            <li>Overall, I was extremely pleased with the set!</li>
            <li>I love how it made my hair so soft as well!</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered very nicely and left my scalp and strands feeling extra clean!</li>
            <li>First the smell; the scent was clean and fruity but not overpoweringly so.</li>
            <li>I have very oily fine hair</li>
            <li>My hair is not thin, but it is fine, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li>I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to see that it was detoxifying because I feel like that is exactly what my hair and scalp need right now.</li>
            <li>I got this free from an Influenster VoxBox to test and am very please with the results of the shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir.</li>
            <li>I received this as a free sample in my voxbox and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I just jumped out of the shower and not only does my hair feel amazing</li>
            <li>I received a free trial from Influenster, and I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li>My hair felt great while using the product and also once my hair dried.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this shampoo, conditioner, and intense conditioning treatment thru Influenster.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this shampoo, conditioner and Intense treatment in my VoxBox.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Thoughts overall... I liked this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>My hair felt so soft after it dried, I am very impressed.</li>
            <li>When I first opened the bottle it smelt like fresh flowers and sweet fruit.</li>
            <li>its like waking up in the morning to the fresh scent of lemon and basil.</li>
            <li>I was pleased to have a chance to try Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo with Cassia Seeds.</li>
            <li>I received this complimentary on behalf of influenster to try.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has an appealing color and soft lemony fresh scent.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it&#x27;s fresh but feminine.  </li>
            <li>I also have my hair colored at a salon using the most natural ingredient hair color line that I could</li>
            <li>I really liked the product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shied away from many soft drinks and preserved foods with those ingredients, and there is no reason for me to tolerate it in my shampoo.</li>
            <li>It seems like the product is worth buying.</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t know exactly what to call the scent, but it&#x27;s a burst of fresh rather than coming across as sweet or flowery.</li>
            <li>received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>I will definitely purchase this shampoo on my own.</li>

            <li>and I simply love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel so soft and</li>
            <li>I received the Detoxifying set as a complimentary trial from Influenster.</li>
            <li>I love the way this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo smells.  </li>

            <li>I received the products complimentary to test and review.</li>

            <li>It leaves my hair feeling nice and clean, without feeling stripped and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li>concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary as a set in order to rate and review.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like the scent, and I do find myself choosing shampoos that have a nice scent that&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li>I receved a complimentary shampoo through voxbox.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and not like perfume, and cleans my hair just the way I need it to.</li>
            <li>I got this product complimentary from Influenster</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m really enjoying them.</li>
            <li>It made my hair so soft and light feeling!</li>
            <li>, just fresh.</li>
            <li>It left our scalps fresh and the shampoo smells nice.</li>
            <li>The intensive cream is by far my favorite, felt like  </li>
            <li>I was given a complimentary sample to test and review.</li>
            <li>It has a delightfully fresh lemon scent.</li>
            <li>But, as the other reviews reveal, the name is referring more to the exotic nature of some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li>Was not to excited about the scent however the outcome of my hair feeling soft, light and voluminous validated everything else.</li>
            <li>The shampoo left my hair feeling clean, healthy and fresh.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too fond of (it is ok, but I prefer something a little more sweet).</li>
            <li>When I used it my hair instantly felt softer and more clean.</li>
            <li>This however had my curls looking smooth and clean and soft without frizz.</li>
            <li>It has a clean fresh lemony scent that really wakes me up and</li>
            <li>At first, it made my hair look and feel pretty clean.</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel very clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Today was the first day of testing my free products of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals, and I can already tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>It did keep my hair somewhat under control, but it wasn&#x27;t as good as some other shampoos I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>was not overly excited to really sample this product, since I am not a drugstore brand user of hair products, but I was obligated, so I did.  </li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it if you want your hair to feel very soft, smooth, clean, and luscious!</li>
            <li>I was right</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of the HE Illuminating line, its clean and fruity and</li>
            <li>I enjoy basil, mainly eating it, not shampooing my hair with it.</li>
            <li>particularly so when I was sent a free sample to try and review</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft and rejuvenated and the lemon smell makes it feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair feeling so soft and clean!</li>
            <li>It made my hair feel so soft and clean!</li>
            <li>The new Wild Naturals work amazing and</li>
            <li>I received it as a free product to test, and I have to admit I was less than thrilled to see it was Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li>The product did at least smell great in the bottle and also while shampooing, but then the scent quickly faded.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always switching up what haircare I use and have used and been happy with Herbal Essences in the past.</li>
            <li>It lathered great with just a small amount.</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and crisp, but isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I received this complimentary product via Influenster for testing purposes and the first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>
            <li>Granted, I don&#x27;t have long flowing lavishing locks to attend to, but I really liked this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I just tried the herbal essence natural wild shampoo this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love!</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not usually a picky person when it comes to a shampoo so long as it cleans my hair and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li>As a man, I can live with the light lemon smell coming from my head throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I really love it, it doesn’t linger for long, but while it lasts is a true pleasure.</li>
            <li>The main things that I look for in haircare products are scent, how clean it makes my hair feel, and softness; this line hit all of these points for me.</li>
            <li>Overall, I felt like it was a good clarifying shampoo, leaving my hair soft and not weighed-down.</li>
            <li>Wild Naturals Shampoo lathers up well and rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>Whether this is the result of the Cassia seeds that our proudly touted on the bottle or simply the overall quality of this name-brand shampoo, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all for a more natural product that is gentle for my hair and helps to detox all of the nasties out of it.</li>
            <li>I also really like that it made my curls super defined and shiny.</li>
            <li>The ingredients left my hair smelling good and I felt that the ingredients were not harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li>and my hair laid fairly flatter than what is typical.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thick shampoo, which is better than the runny kind that pours out of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It is a nice big bottle that lasts a long time (and I tend to use more at a time).</li>
            <li>but so far it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li>It really does deeply clean your hair, rinses out well, and creates a soft and clean finish.</li>
            <li>It smooths down all of my little fly away frizzies, and makes my hair super smooth!</li>
            <li>Definitely a new line I&#x27;m excited about.</li>
            <li>Most likely will be buying it soon.</li>
            <li>I have never had a shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner that I love so much!</li>
            <li>I was given a sample of this shampoo to try and I was pleasantly surprised with how light shampoo was.</li>
            <li>I would love to try it in a different scent.</li>
            <li>This review is based on a free sample I received in a voxbox of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment through my influenster membership.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I only buy top of the line toiletries and appliances for my hair.  </li>
            <li>I would first wash my hair with the shampoo, then follow up with the conditioner and intensive treatment.</li>
            <li>I am more into the salon shampoos/conditioners, but I would probably buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li>First I noticed the smell.</li>
            <li>This was my first time using the product</li>
            <li>I will most definitely use it again</li>
            <li>every time after I use it my hair feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li>Very Cleansing!</li>
            <li>you are washing your hair with a real lemon and orange!</li>
            <li>I got the shampoo and conditioner set thanks to @Influenster to try out!</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t need to use so much product!</li>
            <li>you hair comes out very shiny!</li>
            <li>This shampoo really has cleaned my scalp quite well!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if there is a big difference, but it was OK.  </li>
            <li>Will most likely buy this product for myself!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Just be aware that you get what you pay for, and this shampoo isn&#x27;t exactly what the name implies.  </li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;m not a big expert on shampoos, soaps, lotions, creams, etc.,</li>
            <li>This Herbal Essences variety seems to really work well for me, though I should point out that I generally have healthy hair anyway and would not consider myself someone in need of detoxification.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Shampoo complementary from influenster.com</li>
            <li>Got the voxbox of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection for free for my review.</li>
            <li>definitely will keep using this more</li>
            <li>I actually like it better than I thought I would.</li>
            <li>I remember the Herbal Essences from my youth leaving my hair smelling like flowers for a whole day!</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m glad because now I finally have discovered a shampoo that works for me.</li>
            <li>and it is the first time I’ve used Herbal Essences products for naturals.</li>
            <li>When I first put the product in my hair</li>
            <li>l love the product and will definitely buy it in the store.</li>
            <li>It does make my hair feel soft &amp; smooth, though.</li>
            <li>I would not use the first two products without it.</li>
            <li>I received all three products in this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals system free in order to test and review them.</li>
            <li>If citrus is a favorite scent in your household i would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li>The scent was a bit overbearing at first</li>
            <li>I even felt I had more volume but the only think I didn&#x27;t like was the smell...</li>
            <li>and it made my hair feel very soft and clean.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean after using the shampoo, but it usually feels clean after using most brands.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair shiny, but overall it wasn&#x27;t anything spectacular or new.</li>
            <li>To begin, I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product to test and review for FREE from Influenster, in a Vox Box.</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive herbal essences wild natural detoxifying shampoo for free to test.  </li>
            <li>The true test came the next day, when my hair and scalp was still feeling clean and not oily.</li>
            <li>but it is enough to make your hair feel very clean and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li>For those of us that need a little more &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t quite fit the need.</li>
            <li>My hair has felt as though it has dealt with a flat iron better since I started using it.</li>
            <li>Influenster  just gave me Herbal Essences wild naturals complimentary to tryout, test, and review!</li>
            <li>I used the product just as any other shampoo and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with it.</li>
            <li>I received Wild Naturals complimentary to review!</li>
            <li>I have been trying the full Detoxifying line for several days and so far am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The conditioner was a bit runny for my liking but other than that it worked nicely.</li>
            <li>I received the whole Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection free from Influenster to test out and write a review  </li>
            <li>Left hair soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li>I like the way my hair feels after being washed, soft even before applying a conditioner, and shining clean.</li>
            <li>The smell is different - good different!  </li>
            <li>Also it makes my hair incredibly soft i love having soft hair</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost as if they try to make it seem that this is more of a natural product when you can clearly read the ingredients and see that it is not.</li>
            <li>I normally have extremely frizzy hair and am very cautious about the types of products I use and this product is perfect for frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li>Very fresh, clean, and a little sweet.  </li>
            <li>When using the shampoo I could almost feel my scalp tingling for a deep clean of my hair!</li>
            <li>After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to purchase this along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li>After getting out of the shower it really did live up to its claims, my hair held felt nice and completely clean without any leftover product residue from the previous day.</li>
            <li>This is a thick shampoo which lathers up very nicely, it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li>I pretty much go by how my hair and scalp feel after use of a product.</li>
            <li>When I first got the product, I was very intrigued by the packaging and the scent.</li>
            <li>I have only had this product for a few days, and so far I am very impressed with it.</li>
            <li>My hair dies feel &amp;#34;detoxified&amp;#34; slightly, and clean and fresh which is important.</li>
            <li>I really like detoxifying shampoos because I have pretty oily hair</li>
            <li>It lathered up easily and left my hair feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But it isn&#x27;t really, truly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, and it always annoys me when I see a greenwashed product that isn&#x27;t exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>The collection is available in most retail stores and I would definitely suggest purchasing the entire collection!</li>
            <li>This really did illuminate my hair, but it also made it really shiny!</li>
            <li>I do, however, like the idea behind it, but honestly it sounds kind of far fetched.</li>
            <li>I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong</li>
            <li>It was thick and did a good job of cleaning my hair without drying it out, which is important to someone like me who has natural hair.</li>
            <li>I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but I would definitely purchase them on my own in the future!!</li>
            <li>I used the shampoo a few more times than the conditioner because my hair is really short and, let&#x27;s be honest, I don&#x27;t really care about conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair really soft and there were very little fly aways.</li>
            <li>After blow drying my hair straight to see the results, the entire regimen left my hair feeling very light and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to get the last bit out, which is not always the case in some bottle</li>
            <li>When used with the conditioner, it makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I will definitely continue using my samples and will strongly consider purchasing them from the story when I run out.</li>
            <li>My hair was smooth and less frizzy than normal and felt very clean.</li>
            <li>You might experience dry hair, damage and breakage with constant use, so I would advise using this once every week or 2 unless you have extremely good</li>
            <li>I used all three products and was pleasantly surprised that it did not dry my hair out and my color looked even better.</li>
            <li>it brought my fine hair back to life!</li>
            <li>I cannot speak to the effect of this shampoo on coarse or curly hair, but for my hair, which is fine and straight, it works very well.</li>
            <li>The shampoo cleans my hair very well without drying it out.</li>
            <li>thanks again influenster..</li>
            <li>It lathers really really, too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>This combines the strengthening features I got from my old shampoo and combines them with a fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really felt as if the shampoo was removing all of the residue that was in my hair.</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of it....</li>
            <li>This shampoo is the real deal.</li>
            <li>and I really like how it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>I am covering up grays, so that isn’t really ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>I received this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo as well as the Conditioner and Intensive Treatment complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li>and they really wash well.</li>
            <li>Lastly I noticed the light weight silky smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li>It smells very fruity with some floral notes almost like escada(sunset?) perfume.</li>
            <li>I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Detoxifying Shampoo for free</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir.</li>
            <li>The price is significantly higher than normal shampoos so that might be a mitigating factor for some.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and when you use the shampoo and conditioner as a set</li>
            <li>it is help me so much</li>
            <li>I received this for a free trial to review through Vox Box and plan to use it again in the future.</li>
            <li>Also, the scent reminds me of straight up lemons...</li>
            <li>It was also gentle - some shampoos make my scalp</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>Smell is something I really look for in a shampoo since it fills the shower and helps determine how I start my day.</li>
            <li>This cleans your hair but gently.  </li>
            <li>I used the whole collection with included shampoo, intensive treatment, and conditioner.</li>
            <li>He did not seem to have as much body as mine, but then his hair is much shorter.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So when I found out about this it really did change the feel and look of my hair.</li>
            <li>something my hair really needed.</li>
            <li>As I was combing through my hair after towel drying my hair seemed very slippery.</li>
            <li>but I dont really know if it did that to my hair or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li>thanks too #influenstervox</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>Its very energizing.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to try out the intensive treatment conditioner since my hair is color treated and very brittle.</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair after using this product no frizz, or anything.</li>
            <li>Using the three  together really work.</li>
            <li>so I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I really tried to like this product.</li>
            <li>but thanks @influenster</li>
            <li>I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li>It cleaned my hair very well.</li>
            <li>and it really seemed to make a difference with my hair.</li>
            <li>I had been using another Herbal Essences product for a while and the switch to this one really seemed to make a difference.</li>
            <li>The gel was thick, not watery, and I felt like it was a good quality shampoo.</li>
            <li>I loved how thick and foamy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li>I love the thick and rich lather and</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling fresh and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li>but it really is rich and lasting.</li>
            <li>Based on my purely subjective opinion, I recommend this shampoo highly.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feelings really clean.</li>
            <li>This shampoo left my hair clean without over drying.  </li>
            <li>Leave my hair feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li>Even the next morning my hair still felt clean.  </li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li>its just plain amazing The products leaves my hair smelling and feeling fantastic,  Used in conjunction with the Detoxifying Conditioner, my hair is left feeling soft and silky with a shine!</li>
            <li>The very first use of this shampoo, conditioner and intense treatment left my hair was soft and manageable, I would recommend to anyone with damaged hair!!!</li>
            <li>Got fid of build up and left my medium length fine straight hair soft</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that tends to get oily at the roots but a little drier at the ends since I do get it color treated.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s pairings left my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I did not leave it on my hair very long since I have fine texture hair</li>
            <li>After a long day, I enjoy using this product so I can relax.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is some kind of allergic reaction, but I&#x27;ve ceased to use it so my scalp and face could return to normalcy.</li>
            <li>but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li>For those of you with normal tresses though, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>Creates a nice cleansing foam without having to use excessive amounts of product.</li>
            <li>This is the first drugstore brand shampoo that had that &amp;#34;Earthy&amp;#34; natural smell that I like.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t liked the brand in the past</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down, and even looks like it has more volume.</li>
            <li>It also did not weigh my hair down, which many conditioners do.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is a little overwhelming, but it really wakes you up.</li>
            <li>I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review!</li>
            <li>As far as shine, I&#x27;m not so sure that it imparts much shine-as compared with some other shine products I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li>I applied the product and worked up a decent lather.</li>
            <li>Overall, I really enjoyed the shampoo and will definitely consider purchasing.</li>
            <li>I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li>The main thing is that it did not make me break out.  </li>
            <li>Finally took it for a spin, and I have to say I love the smell and the deep conditioner</li>
            <li>and I think this shampoo ways it down a smidge more than my hair normally is.</li>
            <li>, I was so excited to receive and try this product I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences products for a long time</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers well and made my hair very soft!</li>
            <li>(otherwise I just co-wash), because I&#x27;m very concerned about shampoos stripping the natural oils from my hair, this was not a problem with this shampoo!</li>
            <li>The scent is long lasting and the shampoo made my scalp feel super clean.</li>
            <li>After my hair is dry, it feels so much lighter and full of volume.</li>
            <li>, well,  I usually wash my hair twice a week since my hair tends to get dry on the edges and oily on the roots, Basil works great with  that issue</li>
            <li>I pretreated my hair with coconut oil the night before, which can sometimes require a repeat shampoo to remove completely, but it only took one wash with this new detoxifying shampoo to leave my hair clean and ready for conditioner.</li>
            <li>I also have chemically treated hair, so this may not have been the best choice as it made my hair dull and dry, and the smell was gone on the same day I washed it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you haven&#x27;t already tried it.</li>
            <li>but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>The intensive conditioning spray/oil elixir I also highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The detoxifying shampoo helped remove build-up which gave my hair a little more volume.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I will purchase however, because it isn&#x27;t sulfate free, which is extremely important to my very fine, partially dried out hair!!</li>
            <li>it is the next day that I am writing this review and my hair feels exceptionally clean and soft.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>-in-all, I think this is a terrific choice for a shampoo to get all the past hair product residue out of your hair and leave it clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>and my hair is very moisture after using Herbal Essences wild naturals</li>
            <li>I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive treatment and conditioner, but can tell that my hair felt so much softer after just the shampoo.</li>
            <li>I was surprised with how much I like this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have long, thick, wavy hair that requires a great product to keep it &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>However, if I didn’t color my hair, I would use this product about 2-3 times/month as a break from your normal hair care routine to spruce things up.  </li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when my sample runs out--</li>
            <li>I got a free sample through the Mail of herbal essences wild natural detoxifying shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>My hair felt better and cleaner after I dried it.</li>
            <li>I personally have curly/wavy (WILD) hair and this tames it more than thee occasional shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li>I received this product complimentary for testing purposes only.</li>
            <li>The conditioners leave my grey hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>After using these products for a few days, I can say that I do, in fact love them.</li>
            <li>I liked that it wasn&#x27;t too thick of a consistency.</li>
            <li>The consistency was nice and thick and lathered well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this shampoo is that it made my very fine hair harder to style.  </li>
            <li>This was okay left my hair dry</li>
            <li>As someone who uses a lot of products on my curly, dry hair, I need a good deep clean every now and then to keep my hair from looking greasy and dull.</li>
            <li>Used in conjunction with the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner and the Intesive Treatment, my hair was left feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Wild Naturals detoxifying shampoo left my hair feeling thoroughly clean and naturally nourished.</li>
            <li>and I must say I&#x27;m impress with this new shampoo</li>
            <li>I am sold, this is my new hair care choice.</li>
            <li>So I tried this new line as part of a test market.</li>
            <li>it makes it look like new hair</li>
            <li>I like this new line of shampoos and conditioners by Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li>that a deep conditioning treatment is available in the same scent</li>
            <li>Lathers well and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li>My hair felt very soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not someone who washes my hair very frequently, but I would probably use this product again.</li>
            <li>The dry oil spray wasn&#x27;t too greasy although you do need to use more than one or two sprays(as directed on the bottle) for long hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work better on someone whose hair isn&#x27;t quite as bad as mine, but either way, it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I like the natural elements as well!</li>
            <li>I got this product for free to test and review through a website called Influenster, along with some other Herbal Essences Wild Naturals products.</li>
            <li>As with most advertising, I think they&#x27;ve gone a bit overboard on the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; thing.</li>
            <li>but this did the exact opposite!</li>
            <li>Received my complimentary box of herbal essences wild natural shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner to try.  </li>
            <li>The detoxifying qualities of this shampoo was impressive and definitely on the same level as the expensive salon products.</li>
            <li>The only thing i would change is the scent, while it smells clean, I am not a fan of the overall scent.</li>
            <li>My hair is often dry and brittle and this product made it super soft.</li>
            <li>I think it left some residue in my hair the next day and didn&#x27;t make it feel that clean.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and am always worried new products will cause breakouts and this did not.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I color my hair and need a sulfate free shampoo for long term use.</li>
            <li>herbs and other nice things are a very distant afterthought.  </li>
            <li>These products, however, left my hair with more volume than the previous products I was using.</li>
            <li>It is too too funny to have a wild natural Ayurvedic product straight from the corporate vats of publicly traded mega conglomerate P&amp;G, but Herbal Essences Wild Naturals (Detoxifying!)</li>
            <li>The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo actually has less chemicals than the brand I have been using that is supposedly a healthy product purchased from the &amp;#34;health food store&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean and not weighed down by product.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and strong feeling and less frizzy then usual.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very concentrated; a little bit does a nice lather (I don&#x27;t like it when the shampoo is too liquid and when one pours it into one&#x27;s hand in the shower, the shampoo ends up wasted in the shower floor).</li>
            <li>The reason I have 4 stars out of 5 is because the conditioner was runny and had to use a little more because it didn&#x27;t apply to wet hair very well.</li>
            <li>Clear formulation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>so I was wondering if it would leave my hair dry and brittle or actually feeling clean and</li>
            <li>It also keeps hair clear and scented after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would really reccomed trying Wild Naturals to add an extra boost to your hair!</li>
            <li>It was a clear, thicker formula that foamed up well.</li>
            <li>They have helped my hair so much in the short time I have been using them!</li>
            <li>Herbal Essences calls it &amp;#34;  wildly invigorating&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin, use cautiously.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a heavy hair product user, so</li>
            <li>I have no had that happen so far.</li>
            <li>As far as its claims for providing hair with strength and making it luscious.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li>was sent a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo Lemon Basil for to test and review.  </li>
            <li>The detoxifying part of the shampoo really helped with my flakey scalp problems that I have on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I received this Wild Naturals Detoxifying set for testing purposes</li>
            <li>Similar to how it is if I put in too much conditioner.</li>
            <li>Do not use it too frequently though, as it dries out the scalp and can leave dandruff if over used.</li>
            <li>and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>WILD NATURALS fool you.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t mind it much, but don&#x27;t expect an actual lemon basil scent.</li>
            <li>hair is soft and manageable afterwards.  </li>
            <li>After washing out my hair felt really soft even before brushing.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it</li>
            <li>I love the fresh lemon smell it left behind</li>
            <li>I received a sample of Herbal Essences Wild Natural Detoxifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they leave my hair any cleaner or softer than my normal shampoo, but they definitely smell better.  </li>
            <li>This product line surprised me.</li>
            <li>My hair was soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>But the intensive treatment is definitely needed to make me feel like I&#x27;m really conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>and i gotta say this shampoo and conditioner left my hair really silky</li>
            <li>I also received the conditioner and smoothing serum that goes along with this line to complete the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shiny, and voluminous all day.</li>
            <li>I used it in conjunction with the conditioner and intensive conditioning treatment and my hair came out soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I received these items complimentary but will definitely be buying in the future!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fresh, vaguely citrusy, and extremely refreshing in the morning without being overpowering.</li>
            <li>I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks</li>
            <li>Normally when I blow- dry my hair, my hair ends up straight</li>
            <li>and I as I continue to use it I notice a difference in my scalp being more moist and less dry</li>
            <li>I plan on using this in rotation with my other shampoo to keep my routine fresh.</li>
            <li>My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li>However, the scent is much more subtle upon application and after use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Herbal Essences seems to clean my hair without stripping the life out of it, so after using it for two weeks, I feel like I could keep on using it without destroying my hair.</li>
            <li>I was also interested to see how much of a ‘detoxification’ the product provided since when I think of detox I think of removal of toxins and waste</li>
            <li>I checked the ingredients and found that both shampoos use the same main ingredients that strip the residue from hair strands:  Sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium chloride, citric acid.  </li>
            <li>I normally have a problem with shampoo s that are to heavy, but this left my hair so clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately, since I&#x27;m sometimes scent sensitive), the smell doesn&#x27;t really stay much with you after your hair</li>
            <li>But comparing to price it is a highly recommended shampoo for regular wash.</li>
            <li>I have super curly hair and makes my hair feel moisturized and looks silly smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sort of a shampoo snob and usually buy my stuff, sulfate free from my salon.</li>
            <li>I was anxious to give it a go since I enjoy herbal shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>Normally my hair would be starting to get oily at the roots</li>
            <li>Whether it&#x27;s from switching shampoos or the ingredients in this shampoo, my hair has been behaving very well, feels better and doesn&#x27;t seem to get dirty as fast.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m sure straight hair might have different results from thin or curly hair like mine.</li>
            <li>My hair is straight, thin, and fine.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and almost thin curly hair.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get enough of this new offering from Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re looking for a new shampoo, look no further.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice any scent after my hair was dry</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough of a clarifying shampoo to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li>I recently used this Herbal Essences Wild Natural Detoxifying shampoo.</li>
            <li>I have baby, fine hair and have a hard time with a lot of hair products.  </li>
            <li>ingredients just as my other shampoo contains and also roughly many of same chemicals as all other shampoos.</li>
            <li>left my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li>My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use!</li>
            <li>I have very dry, straight hair and these</li>
            <li>far!&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling clean and fluffy.</li>
            <li>I got the chance to follow it up with the mask and conditioner from the same line, I would highly suggest you do the same!</li>
            <li>My hair seems soft after shower but not much different than always</li>
            <li>so far I will be adding it to my daily regiment.</li>
            <li>I used the detoxifying shampoo, detoxifying conditioner, and the Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment together as the back of the bottles recommend.  </li>
            <li>I fixed this with a marker and wrote a big S and C on the correct bottles.</li>
            <li>It left my hear shiny and soft as well.</li>
            <li>I rec&#x27;d the complete set of these as part of my last Vox Box.</li>
            <li>It also left my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with the smell, I&#x27;ve noticed that it causes my scalp to itch and flake—</li>
            <li>would however absolutely recommend this product to men and women who have coarse, thick or virgin hair, as I feel it would be beneficial and useful to them.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I have confidence that this product works well, as most Herbal Essences products do, with the exception for those who have thin hair.</li>
            <li>I do highly recommend this shampoo&amp; conditioner if your hair isn&#x27;t as dry as mine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The pretty package design features springy yellow and green; I especially like the clear bottle so you can see the contents and visually assess how much product is left.</li>
            <li>It left my hair feeling very soft; it definitely does its job!</li>
            <li>I was less interested in the so-called &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This might not be an issue for a lot of people, because  truly NATURAL hair care products are usually pretty expensive, and for less than $6.00, this is OK for what it is.  </li>
            <li>find that since I live in a dry climate, products like this one are a bit drying to my hair</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair repaired, especially dry hair, like mine.</li>
            <li>It definitely cleaned my hair well and left it feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and cut way back on the tangles I had to manage afterwards.</li>
            <li>However, that effect went away throughout the day, and my hair was left gaining its old oil back.</li>
            <li>After the first use, I noticed that my hair seemed soft and shinier than usual.</li>
            <li>In my opinion it has a pretty heavy citrus smell while using it, but it doesnt leave a scent that lasts afterwards.</li>
            <li>I have very thick full hair and sometimes product can leave residue, but not this!</li>
            <li>and I was concerned that so much product would weigh my hair down or make it oily but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned about trying it because I am a second day hair girl who wants to keep her color vibrant as long as possible.  </li>
            <li>Usually shampoos for curly hair make my scalp feel super greasy and my curls always look flat after</li>
            <li>The shampoo itself gets a nice lather and truly cleans all of the build-up left behind by other products.</li>
            <li>It smells clean, but subtle.</li>
            <li>Now that it&#x27;s dry, the hair feels soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li>And since she cuts it regularly, it is always pretty neat on the ends and harsh products</li>
            <li>&amp; I could really care less, this though is something I can definitely recommend to others.  </li>
            <li>made them feel soft - especially the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li>I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li>My hair is waist length,  thin, fine and prone to damage</li>
            <li>Personally, for me and my fine, color treated hair, I found the shampoo to be a bit harsh as it did its job a little too well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the smell of basil, even if the shampoo only smells a little like it.  </li>
            <li>The scent is citrus-y, but more in the light orange range than lemon in my opinion, like the artificial orange flavor that hard orange candies had when I was a kid.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;To be honest, I am a hair care snob.  </li>
            <li> This was effective in cleansing and didn&#x27;t strip me hair of</li>
            <li> I liked the product.</li>
            <li> This is my honest opinion about the product.</li>
            <li> It does smell nice, the smell reminds me of something tropical.</li>
            <li> As with all Herbal Essences products, the scent was really nice.</li>

            <li> it lathers nicely.  </li>
            <li> And it lathers up nicely.</li>
            <li> So whether this will work for you is a matter of what kind of hair you have and</li>
            <li> It lathers up nice and rinses away</li>
            <li> It has a nice fragrance while and after you wash your hair.</li>
            <li> Would have been nice if that would have been included with product.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice.  </li>
            <li> It did its job, but it was nothing spectacular.</li>

            <li> To me, they have a nice citrus scent - almost grapefruit.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to rinse out too.</li>

            <li> The smell is amazing and after using it my hair feels so much better</li>
            <li> Recieved a free sample and LOVED it.</li>
            <li> This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo was a wonderful surprise.</li>
            <li> I imagine a &amp;#34;detoxification&amp;#34; would take more than one wash, so perhaps that process explains my results, but no matter, the shampoo smells and works amazing</li>
            <li> I think its the best fragrance Herbal Essences has come up with in a good long while.  </li>
            <li> Gives a really good lather though with just one pump full which I liked.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing as well, very fresh!</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  </li>
            <li> This shampoo has a wonderful smell, lathers nicely, leaves my hair looking good, or at least as good as it can look.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, a very good shampoo for decent price.  </li>
            <li> A rich and creamy lather covered my head which felt and, as mentioned, smelled good.</li>
            <li> Loved the fresh scent and the detoxifying naturals!</li>
            <li> It has a nice light scent which I also liked.</li>
            <li> It lathers up great and kind of &amp;#34;tingles&amp;#34; on my scalp in a way I really like.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers good to clean my hair and freshen it.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great, very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> very clean and smells great, received complimentary</li>
            <li> I have to say I was pretty happy with the results.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s price range, this shampoo is pretty great.</li>
            <li> One thing I enjoy is having nice clean and smell good hair!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I liked that it rinsed easy</li>
            <li> I received a free trial size of this Herbal Essences shampoo from Vox Box and I love it!</li>
            <li> Got these products to try for free and I&#x27;m in love!  </li>
            <li> I am very thrilled about the clean sensation of this product,I got this product for free testing for free!</li>
            <li> I washed my hair many times with this shampoo and it makes my hair feels clean and smells great but not as the original herbal essences products.</li>
            <li> Ok so I tried this product free from Influenster, I have to say I love it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, I love the smell.</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not terribly overpowering either.</li>
            <li> for the detox side, I can&#x27;t be totally sure if it does what it says.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the scent.</li>
            <li> Many shampoos use a lot of great-sounding phrases and buzz words to get you buy their product.</li>
            <li> and I have thoroughly enjoyed using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this shampoo system :)</li>
            <li> Love how my hair feels too.</li>
            <li> but in a good fresh way</li>
            <li> (There are more ingredients</li>
            <li> Lovely is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li> Love how it made my hair shiny but not oily.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> This product also makes my hair a lot more manageable while brushing it.</li>
            <li> It also makes my hair much more hydrated</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Had a light, nice scent.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo to test for free from Influenster!  </li>
            <li> great and very relaxing</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, ingredients could be better.  </li>
            <li> The smell does wear off after a while and of course it&#x27;s not like magic.</li>
            <li> I’m already in love with these products and love how my hair smells, looks, and feels.</li>
            <li> This is a ok shampoo.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> i am in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I personally love this product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to my friends for sure.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was ok.</li>
            <li> When I had initially used the set, which includes a shampoo, conditioner, and an intensive treatment, my hair had tons of product in it from styling it the day before, so with its detoxifying attributes I thought it would be perfect to try out.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I made the switch.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job of cleaning my locks while at the same time hydrating them.</li>
            <li> For the most part when it comes to shampoo, that&#x27;s the wife&#x27;s job</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> At this length I&#x27;m better off using just shampoo and nothing else.  </li>
            <li> The scent is lovely.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m okay with that.  </li>
            <li> I received the trio of Wild Naturals products containing cassia and lemon basil to review (free of charge) and was impressed by the smell and the results.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo for free as a sample from Influenster!</li>
            <li> My favorite product from this line was the intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> and I like to leave a review stating that I am in love with this collection as soon as I receive this product</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the Lemon basil with cassia flower sent.</li>
            <li> The sent is so refreshing that it makes me feel relaxed.</li>
            <li> I used it in combination with the conditioner, which I was also highly pleased with.</li>
            <li> To start with I love most of the herbal essences products.</li>
            <li> Salon quality aroma for sure.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightand refreshing...</li>
            <li> Love that the scent lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this shampoo out for free!</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li> , I mostly pick up on the ginger over the lemon and cassia.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d a deluxe sample to try free from influenster in my VoxBox</li>
            <li> the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t work the best with my hair type which is curly.</li>
            <li> I love the Thai Lemon Basil smell.  </li>
            <li> I actually enjoyed all three products.  </li>
            <li> I can go outside and not have to worry about my hair in the humid weather, like how awesome is that!</li>
            <li> and i cant stop feeling and touching my hair after i shower</li>
            <li> However, this wasn&#x27;t my favorite shampoo</li>
            <li> However, I do love the Herbal essence shampoo in the orange container.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s for women for the most part.  </li>
            <li> I would love to see it come in a volumizing version.  </li>
            <li> and I really enjoyed it.</li>
            <li> I love herbal essence scents and the naturals line</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the shampoo quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I followed up with the matching conditioner and was equally pleased.</li>
            <li> It is worth noting, however, that the fragrance does not linger after my shower, which I consider to be a good thing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many Herbal Essences products over the years and have always like them.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner was ok as well.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product.</li>
            <li> I have to say I love this product</li>

            <li> It also took a lot more shampoo per application than others I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE</li>

            <li> The smell is not my favorite</li>

            <li> I was satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo for review, and I was certainly glad I did.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences has proved to be a refreshing break from the harshness I sometimes put my hair through.</li>
            <li> I used the oil elixir the next morning and a couple drops did an awesome job of rejuvenating my curls for the rest of the day!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just OK</li>
            <li> I love the way they smell</li>
            <li> and I must say, I love them.</li>

            <li> I enjoyed the softness of it and ,again, enjoyed the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair looks and feels.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences is a brand I trust and have been using for many years</li>
            <li> and I was going to be able to try out one of their newest products.</li>

            <li> I am beyond happy with this product line and while the products I received were for a free trial, I will absolutely continue to purchase these items.</li>
            <li> I color my hair, and also shampoo and blow dry every day, so my hair is not always in the best shape.</li>
            <li> It was okay, but I noticed that my hair was getting greasy very quickly.</li>
            <li> Next, the shampoo lathers rather nicely, and the conditioner was great for detangling.  </li>
            <li> It works great, cool my scalp and felt like a medicated shampoo at first</li>
            <li> I got a complimentary sample via Influnester and have really enjoyed it!</li>
            <li> It does a very nice job of getting the gunk of the products out of the hair yet leaving it fresh, light and clean.  </li>

            <li> I received this as a free sample from Influenster to review and I have to say I love the Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Loved getting to try this great product, the smell was great and the shampoo really lathered well for a small amount.</li>
            <li> HERBAL ESSENCES Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo and Detoxifying Conditioner works great.</li>
            <li> I have used this for three mornings now, and I can safely say that my hair is softer and feels cleaner in that a comb runs through it smoothly without any clumps or tangles.</li>
            <li> I also love the light, lemon-basil smell.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling shampoo that isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>

            <li> It smells good, and really cleans well.</li>
            <li> First the invigorating scent of Thai Lemon Basil was a great aid to help me wake up and start my morning off right.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not quite sure how it detoxifies, but it did leave my hair silky smooth and easy to brush after I used it.</li>
            <li> and they leave my hair feeling squeaky clean and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I was really excited when I saw the name &amp;#34;wildly natural&amp;#34; because I had been looking for a shampoo that was better for my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall good product and would recommend!</li>
            <li> other than that it is a great product and i would recommen!!</li>
            <li> So I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d ever actually pay for it unless walmart or somewhere runs a good sale!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try it because I love Herbal Essence products.  </li>

            <li> Hair felt clean and the scent is refreshing.</li>

            <li> I love herbal essences it smelled so good and keeps my hair so soft too.</li>
            <li> I love the clean smell that this product has.</li>
            <li> I like this product most out of the detox line, as I feel it really cleans your hair and scalp with a nice herbal touch.</li>
            <li> These products leave a strong musky citrus smell.</li>
            <li> This is an OK Product for the price, but it isn&#x27;t anything special.  </li>
            <li> I would like they have more good things to come and something more specific for every type of hair</li>
            <li> The smell is very fresh and clean!</li>
            <li> Smell great, clean well, not heavy feeling.</li>

            <li> Most products that say detoxifying or rejuvenating either make my hair oily or dry but my hair felt great with this product.</li>
            <li> so I could give an accurate report.</li>

            <li> This shampoo does a nice job of gently cleansing my hair, with a mild, lemony fragrance and a very surprisingly rich lather.  </li>
            <li> I significantly noticed the difference after 3 washes.</li>
            <li> Smells great, though it doesn&#x27;t linger long after a wash.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about trying it because I don&#x27;t use herbal essences very often but with the way it made my hair feel I would use it all the time!</li>
            <li> Shampoo is a good one, with a low enough price and sufficiently attractive packaging</li>
            <li> So when I got this in the mail I was so excited to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the scent.</li>
            <li> but then you realize that it&#x27;s herbal essences because of the unique scent.</li>
            <li> This is mostly a chemical product with the first two ingredients being:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I enjoyed the lemony smell at first until I was overtaken by the basil.</li>
            <li> I was excited.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo after a night out, it really strips all of the product and junk out of your hair!</li>

            <li> I have very fine, straight hair, but this shampoo</li>
            <li> When I learned that I was going to get the shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment in my first voxbox, I was very excited.</li>
            <li> it gets my hair really clean.</li>
            <li> It smells citrus and clean.</li>
            <li> it made my head feel clean</li>

            <li> really clean feeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always amazed at how clean my hair feels.  </li>
            <li> this shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> I had paid about twice as much for my healthy shampoo than the cost would be for the Herbal Essence ( this was a free test product in this</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I used to like Herbal Essences&#x27; Drama Clean</li>
            <li> My hair feels really clean after using this product.</li>

            <li> Since I&#x27;m always looking for products to increase the shine in my hair, I was pretty excited to try it!</li>
            <li> After using this product just once my hair feels clean and full of life.  </li>
            <li> Much more information can be found concerning these seeds, but it does seem reasonably certain that they add value to the conditioning properties of this shampoo to heal damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked that it made my hair soft and clean with one wash.  </li>

            <li> It smelled so good and left my hair feeling so clean.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the smell if the new line, it&#x27;s floral-y to me and the dry oil spray adds a beautiful non greasy shine.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to review but that does not mean that I am just going to love the product.</li>
            <li> Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked.</li>
            <li> I have to say the elixir is my favorite as I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> It rinsed cleanly and quickly.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Influenster for the free product!</li>

            <li> I really love the lemon scent, it also lathers up very well</li>

            <li> I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review completely free.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner package is okay, but I don&#x27;t like how it made my hair smell - it smells too much like chemicals for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad</li>
            <li> After using it, my hair is full and soft, and has a nice luster.</li>
            <li> typically don&#x27;t care much for shampoos as my heart belongs to conditioner, but this one is simply wonderful.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I learned I would receive this product as well as the conditioner and intensive treatment conditioner in my very first vox box!</li>
            <li> It lathered up nicely and left my hair feeling clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> Some smells, albeit pleasant smells, are best left behind in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean scent that wakes me up in the morning</li>

            <li> It tames it and keeps it super hydrated.</li>
            <li> I received a free bottle of this shampoo from influenster to review and test and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> When I purchase shampoo, I am looking for two main things, price and lack of too many unpronounceable chemicals.</li>
            <li> Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day!</li>
            <li> I may have been able to try this thanks to a sample, but I will definitely be buying more!  </li>
            <li> Great end results, since it left my hair looking smooth and feeling soft to the touch, absolutely ready to unleash my own pure self in my revitalized locks.</li>
            <li> Love the smell other wise works just as good as any other products</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did because I wouldn&#x27;t normally try it myself.  </li>
            <li> Second I noticed the amazing clean feeling of my scalp and hair.  </li>
            <li> nothing special other than the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The product smells great and it left my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> I recommend it to anyone who is searching for something new and healthy for their hair.</li>
            <li> Refreshing and made my hair look like new.</li>
            <li> Love the summery scent of this new shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair first with a good lather, I then finished with the conditioner and the intensive treatment conditioner last.</li>
            <li> I like the conditioner because it was very lightweight and rinsed out easily.</li>
            <li> They also make flat ironing my hair so much simpler because I do not have near as many fly aways/frizzies.</li>
            <li> I grew up using Herbal Essences products, I admit that besides their high quality, I’ve always love the products fragrance, and this Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo excels at it, because the scent is outstanding.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed as I squeezed a modest amount of shampoo into the palm of my hand was a light and pleasant citrus smell which became more pronounced as I worked the shampoo into my wet hair and scalp.</li>
            <li> I love the fresh scent, I do wish that the scent lasted longer after my shower, it seems to fade pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have ever used this product and it&#x27;s fanatasic!</li>
            <li> Almost from the first use, I could tell a significant difference - the hair felt healthier, smoother, softer and even my scalp condition has improved.</li>
            <li> Overall, I was extremely pleased with the set!</li>
            <li> I love how it made my hair so soft as well!</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered very nicely and left my scalp and strands feeling extra clean!</li>
            <li> First the smell; the scent was clean and fruity but not overpoweringly so.</li>
            <li> I have very oily fine hair</li>
            <li> My hair is not thin, but it is fine, if that makes sense.</li>
            <li> I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to see that it was detoxifying because I feel like that is exactly what my hair and scalp need right now.</li>
            <li> I got this free from an Influenster VoxBox to test and am very please with the results of the shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample in my voxbox and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I just jumped out of the shower and not only does my hair feel amazing</li>
            <li> I received a free trial from Influenster, and I really wanted to like it.</li>
            <li> My hair felt great while using the product and also once my hair dried.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo, conditioner, and intense conditioning treatment thru Influenster.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo, conditioner and Intense treatment in my VoxBox.  </li>
            <li> This has a fresh and invogorating scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thoughts overall... I liked this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> My hair felt so soft after it dried, I am very impressed.</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle it smelt like fresh flowers and sweet fruit.</li>
            <li> its like waking up in the morning to the fresh scent of lemon and basil.</li>
            <li> I was pleased to have a chance to try Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo with Cassia Seeds.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary on behalf of influenster to try.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has an appealing color and soft lemony fresh scent.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it&#x27;s fresh but feminine.  </li>
            <li> I also have my hair colored at a salon using the most natural ingredient hair color line that I could</li>
            <li> I really liked the product and would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve shied away from many soft drinks and preserved foods with those ingredients, and there is no reason for me to tolerate it in my shampoo.</li>
            <li> It seems like the product is worth buying.</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> It has such a light and refreshing smell and</li>
            <li> The lemon and orange scent is so fresh</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know exactly what to call the scent, but it&#x27;s a burst of fresh rather than coming across as sweet or flowery.</li>
            <li> received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this shampoo on my own.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and I simply love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel so soft and</li>
            <li> I received the Detoxifying set as a complimentary trial from Influenster.</li>
            <li> I love the way this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo smells.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels fresh washed even 2 days after using this.</li>
            <li> okay, as far as cheaper shampoos went.</li>
            <li> I received the products complimentary to test and review.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it makes me hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling nice and clean, without feeling stripped and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary as a set in order to rate and review.</li>
            <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the scent, and I do find myself choosing shampoos that have a nice scent that&#x27;s on sale.</li>
            <li> I receved a complimentary shampoo through voxbox.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and not like perfume, and cleans my hair just the way I need it to.</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary from Influenster</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m really enjoying them.</li>
            <li> It made my hair so soft and light feeling!</li>
            <li> , just fresh.</li>
            <li> It left our scalps fresh and the shampoo smells nice.</li>
            <li> The intensive cream is by far my favorite, felt like  </li>
            <li> I was given a complimentary sample to test and review.</li>
            <li> It has a delightfully fresh lemon scent.</li>
            <li> But, as the other reviews reveal, the name is referring more to the exotic nature of some of the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Was not to excited about the scent however the outcome of my hair feeling soft, light and voluminous validated everything else.</li>
            <li> The shampoo left my hair feeling clean, healthy and fresh.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too fond of (it is ok, but I prefer something a little more sweet).</li>
            <li> When I used it my hair instantly felt softer and more clean.</li>
            <li> This however had my curls looking smooth and clean and soft without frizz.</li>
            <li> It has a clean fresh lemony scent that really wakes me up and</li>
            <li> At first, it made my hair look and feel pretty clean.</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel very clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Today was the first day of testing my free products of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals, and I can already tell a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> It did keep my hair somewhat under control, but it wasn&#x27;t as good as some other shampoos I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> was not overly excited to really sample this product, since I am not a drugstore brand user of hair products, but I was obligated, so I did.  </li>
            <li> and I highly recommend it if you want your hair to feel very soft, smooth, clean, and luscious!</li>
            <li> I was right</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of the HE Illuminating line, its clean and fruity and</li>
            <li> I enjoy basil, mainly eating it, not shampooing my hair with it.</li>
            <li> particularly so when I was sent a free sample to try and review</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft and rejuvenated and the lemon smell makes it feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> it leaves my hair feeling so soft and clean!</li>
            <li> It made my hair feel so soft and clean!</li>
            <li> The new Wild Naturals work amazing and</li>
            <li> I received it as a free product to test, and I have to admit I was less than thrilled to see it was Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> The product did at least smell great in the bottle and also while shampooing, but then the scent quickly faded.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always switching up what haircare I use and have used and been happy with Herbal Essences in the past.</li>
            <li> It lathered great with just a small amount.</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and crisp, but isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product via Influenster for testing purposes and the first thing I noticed was the smell.</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t have long flowing lavishing locks to attend to, but I really liked this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I just tried the herbal essence natural wild shampoo this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not usually a picky person when it comes to a shampoo so long as it cleans my hair and smells pleasant.</li>
            <li> As a man, I can live with the light lemon smell coming from my head throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I really love it, it doesn’t linger for long, but while it lasts is a true pleasure.</li>
            <li> The main things that I look for in haircare products are scent, how clean it makes my hair feel, and softness; this line hit all of these points for me.</li>
            <li> Overall, I felt like it was a good clarifying shampoo, leaving my hair soft and not weighed-down.</li>
            <li> Wild Naturals Shampoo lathers up well and rinses off easily.</li>
            <li> Whether this is the result of the Cassia seeds that our proudly touted on the bottle or simply the overall quality of this name-brand shampoo, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all for a more natural product that is gentle for my hair and helps to detox all of the nasties out of it.</li>
            <li> I also really like that it made my curls super defined and shiny.</li>
            <li> The ingredients left my hair smelling good and I felt that the ingredients were not harsh on my hair.</li>
            <li> and my hair laid fairly flatter than what is typical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thick shampoo, which is better than the runny kind that pours out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is a nice big bottle that lasts a long time (and I tend to use more at a time).</li>
            <li> but so far it&#x27;s just fine.  </li>
            <li> It really does deeply clean your hair, rinses out well, and creates a soft and clean finish.</li>
            <li> It smooths down all of my little fly away frizzies, and makes my hair super smooth!</li>
            <li> Definitely a new line I&#x27;m excited about.</li>
            <li> Most likely will be buying it soon.</li>
            <li> I have never had a shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner that I love so much!</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this shampoo to try and I was pleasantly surprised with how light shampoo was.</li>
            <li> I would love to try it in a different scent.</li>
            <li> This review is based on a free sample I received in a voxbox of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment through my influenster membership.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I only buy top of the line toiletries and appliances for my hair.  </li>
            <li> I would first wash my hair with the shampoo, then follow up with the conditioner and intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> I am more into the salon shampoos/conditioners, but I would probably buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> First I noticed the smell.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the product</li>
            <li> I will most definitely use it again</li>
            <li> every time after I use it my hair feels so soft and light.</li>
            <li> Very Cleansing!</li>
            <li> you are washing your hair with a real lemon and orange!</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo and conditioner set thanks to @Influenster to try out!</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t need to use so much product!</li>
            <li> you hair comes out very shiny!</li>
            <li> This shampoo really has cleaned my scalp quite well!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if there is a big difference, but it was OK.  </li>
            <li> Will most likely buy this product for myself!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Just be aware that you get what you pay for, and this shampoo isn&#x27;t exactly what the name implies.  </li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not a big expert on shampoos, soaps, lotions, creams, etc.,</li>
            <li> This Herbal Essences variety seems to really work well for me, though I should point out that I generally have healthy hair anyway and would not consider myself someone in need of detoxification.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Shampoo complementary from influenster.com</li>
            <li> Got the voxbox of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection for free for my review.</li>
            <li> definitely will keep using this more</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than I thought I would.</li>
            <li> I remember the Herbal Essences from my youth leaving my hair smelling like flowers for a whole day!</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m glad because now I finally have discovered a shampoo that works for me.</li>
            <li> and it is the first time I’ve used Herbal Essences products for naturals.</li>
            <li> When I first put the product in my hair</li>
            <li> l love the product and will definitely buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> It does make my hair feel soft &amp; smooth, though.</li>
            <li> I would not use the first two products without it.</li>
            <li> I received all three products in this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals system free in order to test and review them.</li>
            <li> If citrus is a favorite scent in your household i would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> The scent was a bit overbearing at first</li>
            <li> I even felt I had more volume but the only think I didn&#x27;t like was the smell...</li>
            <li> and it made my hair feel very soft and clean.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean after using the shampoo, but it usually feels clean after using most brands.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair shiny, but overall it wasn&#x27;t anything spectacular or new.</li>
            <li> To begin, I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product to test and review for FREE from Influenster, in a Vox Box.</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive herbal essences wild natural detoxifying shampoo for free to test.  </li>
            <li> The true test came the next day, when my hair and scalp was still feeling clean and not oily.</li>
            <li> but it is enough to make your hair feel very clean and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.</li>
            <li> For those of us that need a little more &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t quite fit the need.</li>
            <li> My hair has felt as though it has dealt with a flat iron better since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Influenster  just gave me Herbal Essences wild naturals complimentary to tryout, test, and review!</li>
            <li> I used the product just as any other shampoo and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with it.</li>
            <li> I received Wild Naturals complimentary to review!</li>
            <li> I have been trying the full Detoxifying line for several days and so far am pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was a bit runny for my liking but other than that it worked nicely.</li>
            <li> I received the whole Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection free from Influenster to test out and write a review  </li>
            <li> Left hair soft and smells amazing</li>
            <li> I like the way my hair feels after being washed, soft even before applying a conditioner, and shining clean.</li>
            <li> The smell is different - good different!  </li>
            <li> Also it makes my hair incredibly soft i love having soft hair</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost as if they try to make it seem that this is more of a natural product when you can clearly read the ingredients and see that it is not.</li>
            <li> I normally have extremely frizzy hair and am very cautious about the types of products I use and this product is perfect for frizzy and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Very fresh, clean, and a little sweet.  </li>
            <li> When using the shampoo I could almost feel my scalp tingling for a deep clean of my hair!</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to purchase this along with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> After getting out of the shower it really did live up to its claims, my hair held felt nice and completely clean without any leftover product residue from the previous day.</li>
            <li> This is a thick shampoo which lathers up very nicely, it doesn&#x27;t take much.</li>
            <li> I pretty much go by how my hair and scalp feel after use of a product.</li>
            <li> When I first got the product, I was very intrigued by the packaging and the scent.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few days, and so far I am very impressed with it.</li>
            <li> My hair dies feel &amp;#34;detoxified&amp;#34; slightly, and clean and fresh which is important.</li>
            <li> I really like detoxifying shampoos because I have pretty oily hair</li>
            <li> It lathered up easily and left my hair feeling clean but not dried out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;But it isn&#x27;t really, truly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, and it always annoys me when I see a greenwashed product that isn&#x27;t exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> The collection is available in most retail stores and I would definitely suggest purchasing the entire collection!</li>
            <li> This really did illuminate my hair, but it also made it really shiny!</li>
            <li> I do, however, like the idea behind it, but honestly it sounds kind of far fetched.</li>
            <li> I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong</li>
            <li> It was thick and did a good job of cleaning my hair without drying it out, which is important to someone like me who has natural hair.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but I would definitely purchase them on my own in the future!!</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo a few more times than the conditioner because my hair is really short and, let&#x27;s be honest, I don&#x27;t really care about conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair really soft and there were very little fly aways.</li>
            <li> After blow drying my hair straight to see the results, the entire regimen left my hair feeling very light and squeaky clean.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to get the last bit out, which is not always the case in some bottle</li>
            <li> When used with the conditioner, it makes my hair super soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue using my samples and will strongly consider purchasing them from the story when I run out.</li>
            <li> My hair was smooth and less frizzy than normal and felt very clean.</li>
            <li> You might experience dry hair, damage and breakage with constant use, so I would advise using this once every week or 2 unless you have extremely good</li>
            <li> I used all three products and was pleasantly surprised that it did not dry my hair out and my color looked even better.</li>
            <li> it brought my fine hair back to life!</li>
            <li> I cannot speak to the effect of this shampoo on coarse or curly hair, but for my hair, which is fine and straight, it works very well.</li>
            <li> The shampoo cleans my hair very well without drying it out.</li>
            <li> thanks again influenster..</li>
            <li> It lathers really really, too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> This combines the strengthening features I got from my old shampoo and combines them with a fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really felt as if the shampoo was removing all of the residue that was in my hair.</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of it....</li>
            <li> This shampoo is the real deal.</li>
            <li> and I really like how it makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> I am covering up grays, so that isn’t really ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> I received this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo as well as the Conditioner and Intensive Treatment complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> and they really wash well.</li>
            <li> Lastly I noticed the light weight silky smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li> It smells very fruity with some floral notes almost like escada(sunset?) perfume.</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Detoxifying Shampoo for free</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir.</li>
            <li> The price is significantly higher than normal shampoos so that might be a mitigating factor for some.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and when you use the shampoo and conditioner as a set</li>
            <li> it is help me so much</li>
            <li> I received this for a free trial to review through Vox Box and plan to use it again in the future.</li>
            <li> Also, the scent reminds me of straight up lemons...</li>
            <li> It was also gentle - some shampoos make my scalp</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Smell is something I really look for in a shampoo since it fills the shower and helps determine how I start my day.</li>
            <li> This cleans your hair but gently.  </li>
            <li> I used the whole collection with included shampoo, intensive treatment, and conditioner.</li>
            <li> He did not seem to have as much body as mine, but then his hair is much shorter.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So when I found out about this it really did change the feel and look of my hair.</li>
            <li> something my hair really needed.</li>
            <li> As I was combing through my hair after towel drying my hair seemed very slippery.</li>
            <li> but I dont really know if it did that to my hair or not.&lt;br</li>
            <li> thanks too #influenstervox</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> Its very energizing.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to try out the intensive treatment conditioner since my hair is color treated and very brittle.</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair after using this product no frizz, or anything.</li>
            <li> Using the three  together really work.</li>
            <li> so I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this product.</li>
            <li> but thanks @influenster</li>
            <li> I have naturally straight hair</li>
            <li> It cleaned my hair very well.</li>
            <li> and it really seemed to make a difference with my hair.</li>
            <li> I had been using another Herbal Essences product for a while and the switch to this one really seemed to make a difference.</li>
            <li> The gel was thick, not watery, and I felt like it was a good quality shampoo.</li>
            <li> I loved how thick and foamy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> I love the thick and rich lather and</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling fresh and rejuvenated!</li>
            <li> but it really is rich and lasting.</li>
            <li> Based on my purely subjective opinion, I recommend this shampoo highly.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feelings really clean.</li>
            <li> This shampoo left my hair clean without over drying.  </li>
            <li> Leave my hair feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li> Even the next morning my hair still felt clean.  </li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling wonderfully clean.</li>
            <li> its just plain amazing The products leaves my hair smelling and feeling fantastic,  Used in conjunction with the Detoxifying Conditioner, my hair is left feeling soft and silky with a shine!</li>
            <li> The very first use of this shampoo, conditioner and intense treatment left my hair was soft and manageable, I would recommend to anyone with damaged hair!!!</li>
            <li> Got fid of build up and left my medium length fine straight hair soft</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that tends to get oily at the roots but a little drier at the ends since I do get it color treated.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s pairings left my hair very soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I did not leave it on my hair very long since I have fine texture hair</li>
            <li> After a long day, I enjoy using this product so I can relax.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is some kind of allergic reaction, but I&#x27;ve ceased to use it so my scalp and face could return to normalcy.</li>
            <li> but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li> For those of you with normal tresses though, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> Creates a nice cleansing foam without having to use excessive amounts of product.</li>
            <li> This is the first drugstore brand shampoo that had that &amp;#34;Earthy&amp;#34; natural smell that I like.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t liked the brand in the past</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down, and even looks like it has more volume.</li>
            <li> It also did not weigh my hair down, which many conditioners do.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is a little overwhelming, but it really wakes you up.</li>
            <li> I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review!</li>
            <li> As far as shine, I&#x27;m not so sure that it imparts much shine-as compared with some other shine products I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
            <li> I applied the product and worked up a decent lather.</li>
            <li> Overall, I really enjoyed the shampoo and will definitely consider purchasing.</li>
            <li> I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> The main thing is that it did not make me break out.  </li>
            <li> Finally took it for a spin, and I have to say I love the smell and the deep conditioner</li>
            <li> and I think this shampoo ways it down a smidge more than my hair normally is.</li>
            <li> , I was so excited to receive and try this product I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences products for a long time</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers well and made my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> (otherwise I just co-wash), because I&#x27;m very concerned about shampoos stripping the natural oils from my hair, this was not a problem with this shampoo!</li>
            <li> The scent is long lasting and the shampoo made my scalp feel super clean.</li>
            <li> After my hair is dry, it feels so much lighter and full of volume.</li>
            <li> , well,  I usually wash my hair twice a week since my hair tends to get dry on the edges and oily on the roots, Basil works great with  that issue</li>
            <li> I pretreated my hair with coconut oil the night before, which can sometimes require a repeat shampoo to remove completely, but it only took one wash with this new detoxifying shampoo to leave my hair clean and ready for conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also have chemically treated hair, so this may not have been the best choice as it made my hair dull and dry, and the smell was gone on the same day I washed it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you haven&#x27;t already tried it.</li>
            <li> but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> The intensive conditioning spray/oil elixir I also highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The detoxifying shampoo helped remove build-up which gave my hair a little more volume.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will purchase however, because it isn&#x27;t sulfate free, which is extremely important to my very fine, partially dried out hair!!</li>
            <li> it is the next day that I am writing this review and my hair feels exceptionally clean and soft.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> -in-all, I think this is a terrific choice for a shampoo to get all the past hair product residue out of your hair and leave it clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> and my hair is very moisture after using Herbal Essences wild naturals</li>
            <li> I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive treatment and conditioner, but can tell that my hair felt so much softer after just the shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was surprised with how much I like this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that requires a great product to keep it &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> However, if I didn’t color my hair, I would use this product about 2-3 times/month as a break from your normal hair care routine to spruce things up.  </li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when my sample runs out--</li>
            <li> I got a free sample through the Mail of herbal essences wild natural detoxifying shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> My hair felt better and cleaner after I dried it.</li>
            <li> I personally have curly/wavy (WILD) hair and this tames it more than thee occasional shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary for testing purposes only.</li>
            <li> The conditioners leave my grey hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> After using these products for a few days, I can say that I do, in fact love them.</li>
            <li> I liked that it wasn&#x27;t too thick of a consistency.</li>
            <li> The consistency was nice and thick and lathered well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only problem I have with this shampoo is that it made my very fine hair harder to style.  </li>
            <li> This was okay left my hair dry</li>
            <li> As someone who uses a lot of products on my curly, dry hair, I need a good deep clean every now and then to keep my hair from looking greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> Used in conjunction with the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner and the Intesive Treatment, my hair was left feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Wild Naturals detoxifying shampoo left my hair feeling thoroughly clean and naturally nourished.</li>
            <li> and I must say I&#x27;m impress with this new shampoo</li>
            <li> I am sold, this is my new hair care choice.</li>
            <li> So I tried this new line as part of a test market.</li>
            <li> it makes it look like new hair</li>
            <li> I like this new line of shampoos and conditioners by Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> that a deep conditioning treatment is available in the same scent</li>
            <li> Lathers well and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair.</li>
            <li> My hair felt very soft and clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who washes my hair very frequently, but I would probably use this product again.</li>
            <li> The dry oil spray wasn&#x27;t too greasy although you do need to use more than one or two sprays(as directed on the bottle) for long hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it would work better on someone whose hair isn&#x27;t quite as bad as mine, but either way, it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I like the natural elements as well!</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to test and review through a website called Influenster, along with some other Herbal Essences Wild Naturals products.</li>
            <li> As with most advertising, I think they&#x27;ve gone a bit overboard on the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; thing.</li>
            <li> but this did the exact opposite!</li>
            <li> Received my complimentary box of herbal essences wild natural shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner to try.  </li>
            <li> The detoxifying qualities of this shampoo was impressive and definitely on the same level as the expensive salon products.</li>
            <li> The only thing i would change is the scent, while it smells clean, I am not a fan of the overall scent.</li>
            <li> My hair is often dry and brittle and this product made it super soft.</li>
            <li> I think it left some residue in my hair the next day and didn&#x27;t make it feel that clean.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and am always worried new products will cause breakouts and this did not.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I color my hair and need a sulfate free shampoo for long term use.</li>
            <li> herbs and other nice things are a very distant afterthought.  </li>
            <li> These products, however, left my hair with more volume than the previous products I was using.</li>
            <li> It is too too funny to have a wild natural Ayurvedic product straight from the corporate vats of publicly traded mega conglomerate P&amp;G, but Herbal Essences Wild Naturals (Detoxifying!)</li>
            <li> The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo actually has less chemicals than the brand I have been using that is supposedly a healthy product purchased from the &amp;#34;health food store&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean and not weighed down by product.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and strong feeling and less frizzy then usual.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very concentrated; a little bit does a nice lather (I don&#x27;t like it when the shampoo is too liquid and when one pours it into one&#x27;s hand in the shower, the shampoo ends up wasted in the shower floor).</li>
            <li> The reason I have 4 stars out of 5 is because the conditioner was runny and had to use a little more because it didn&#x27;t apply to wet hair very well.</li>
            <li> Clear formulation.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> so I was wondering if it would leave my hair dry and brittle or actually feeling clean and</li>
            <li> It also keeps hair clear and scented after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would really reccomed trying Wild Naturals to add an extra boost to your hair!</li>
            <li> It was a clear, thicker formula that foamed up well.</li>
            <li> They have helped my hair so much in the short time I have been using them!</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences calls it &amp;#34;  wildly invigorating&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, use cautiously.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a heavy hair product user, so</li>
            <li> I have no had that happen so far.</li>
            <li> As far as its claims for providing hair with strength and making it luscious.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural</li>
            <li> was sent a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo Lemon Basil for to test and review.  </li>
            <li> The detoxifying part of the shampoo really helped with my flakey scalp problems that I have on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I received this Wild Naturals Detoxifying set for testing purposes</li>
            <li> Similar to how it is if I put in too much conditioner.</li>
            <li> Do not use it too frequently though, as it dries out the scalp and can leave dandruff if over used.</li>
            <li> and I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> WILD NATURALS fool you.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t mind it much, but don&#x27;t expect an actual lemon basil scent.</li>
            <li> hair is soft and manageable afterwards.  </li>
            <li> After washing out my hair felt really soft even before brushing.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it</li>
            <li> I love the fresh lemon smell it left behind</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Herbal Essences Wild Natural Detoxifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they leave my hair any cleaner or softer than my normal shampoo, but they definitely smell better.  </li>
            <li> This product line surprised me.</li>
            <li> My hair was soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> But the intensive treatment is definitely needed to make me feel like I&#x27;m really conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> and i gotta say this shampoo and conditioner left my hair really silky</li>
            <li> I also received the conditioner and smoothing serum that goes along with this line to complete the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shiny, and voluminous all day.</li>
            <li> I used it in conjunction with the conditioner and intensive conditioning treatment and my hair came out soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I received these items complimentary but will definitely be buying in the future!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fresh, vaguely citrusy, and extremely refreshing in the morning without being overpowering.</li>
            <li> I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks</li>
            <li> Normally when I blow- dry my hair, my hair ends up straight</li>
            <li> and I as I continue to use it I notice a difference in my scalp being more moist and less dry</li>
            <li> I plan on using this in rotation with my other shampoo to keep my routine fresh.</li>
            <li> My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless.</li>
            <li> However, the scent is much more subtle upon application and after use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Herbal Essences seems to clean my hair without stripping the life out of it, so after using it for two weeks, I feel like I could keep on using it without destroying my hair.</li>
            <li> I was also interested to see how much of a ‘detoxification’ the product provided since when I think of detox I think of removal of toxins and waste</li>
            <li> I checked the ingredients and found that both shampoos use the same main ingredients that strip the residue from hair strands:  Sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium chloride, citric acid.  </li>
            <li> I normally have a problem with shampoo s that are to heavy, but this left my hair so clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately, since I&#x27;m sometimes scent sensitive), the smell doesn&#x27;t really stay much with you after your hair</li>
            <li> But comparing to price it is a highly recommended shampoo for regular wash.</li>
            <li> I have super curly hair and makes my hair feel moisturized and looks silly smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sort of a shampoo snob and usually buy my stuff, sulfate free from my salon.</li>
            <li> I was anxious to give it a go since I enjoy herbal shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Normally my hair would be starting to get oily at the roots</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s from switching shampoos or the ingredients in this shampoo, my hair has been behaving very well, feels better and doesn&#x27;t seem to get dirty as fast.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m sure straight hair might have different results from thin or curly hair like mine.</li>
            <li> My hair is straight, thin, and fine.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and almost thin curly hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this new offering from Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re looking for a new shampoo, look no further.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice any scent after my hair was dry</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough of a clarifying shampoo to use on a daily basis.</li>
            <li> I recently used this Herbal Essences Wild Natural Detoxifying shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have baby, fine hair and have a hard time with a lot of hair products.  </li>
            <li> ingredients just as my other shampoo contains and also roughly many of same chemicals as all other shampoos.</li>
            <li> left my hair silky soft!</li>
            <li> My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use!</li>
            <li> I have very dry, straight hair and these</li>
            <li> far!&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling clean and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I got the chance to follow it up with the mask and conditioner from the same line, I would highly suggest you do the same!</li>
            <li> My hair seems soft after shower but not much different than always</li>
            <li> so far I will be adding it to my daily regiment.</li>
            <li> I used the detoxifying shampoo, detoxifying conditioner, and the Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment together as the back of the bottles recommend.  </li>
            <li> I fixed this with a marker and wrote a big S and C on the correct bottles.</li>
            <li> It left my hear shiny and soft as well.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d the complete set of these as part of my last Vox Box.</li>
            <li> It also left my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with the smell, I&#x27;ve noticed that it causes my scalp to itch and flake—</li>
            <li> would however absolutely recommend this product to men and women who have coarse, thick or virgin hair, as I feel it would be beneficial and useful to them.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I have confidence that this product works well, as most Herbal Essences products do, with the exception for those who have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I do highly recommend this shampoo&amp; conditioner if your hair isn&#x27;t as dry as mine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The pretty package design features springy yellow and green; I especially like the clear bottle so you can see the contents and visually assess how much product is left.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling very soft; it definitely does its job!</li>
            <li> I was less interested in the so-called &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This might not be an issue for a lot of people, because  truly NATURAL hair care products are usually pretty expensive, and for less than $6.00, this is OK for what it is.  </li>
            <li> find that since I live in a dry climate, products like this one are a bit drying to my hair</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair repaired, especially dry hair, like mine.</li>
            <li> It definitely cleaned my hair well and left it feeling incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and cut way back on the tangles I had to manage afterwards.</li>
            <li> However, that effect went away throughout the day, and my hair was left gaining its old oil back.</li>
            <li> After the first use, I noticed that my hair seemed soft and shinier than usual.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it has a pretty heavy citrus smell while using it, but it doesnt leave a scent that lasts afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have very thick full hair and sometimes product can leave residue, but not this!</li>
            <li> and I was concerned that so much product would weigh my hair down or make it oily but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned about trying it because I am a second day hair girl who wants to keep her color vibrant as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> Usually shampoos for curly hair make my scalp feel super greasy and my curls always look flat after</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself gets a nice lather and truly cleans all of the build-up left behind by other products.</li>
            <li> It smells clean, but subtle.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s dry, the hair feels soft and bouncy.</li>
            <li> And since she cuts it regularly, it is always pretty neat on the ends and harsh products</li>
            <li> &amp; I could really care less, this though is something I can definitely recommend to others.  </li>
            <li> made them feel soft - especially the dry oil spray.</li>
            <li> I have fine, thin hair</li>
            <li> My hair is waist length,  thin, fine and prone to damage</li>
            <li> Personally, for me and my fine, color treated hair, I found the shampoo to be a bit harsh as it did its job a little too well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the smell of basil, even if the shampoo only smells a little like it.  </li>
            <li> The scent is citrus-y, but more in the light orange range than lemon in my opinion, like the artificial orange flavor that hard orange candies had when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> I first put the product in my hand in the shower, I did not love the scent but the formula felt good, not to thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> So I was really excited when the Wild Naturals line came out, especially since it had a detoxifying shampoo -- it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to find shampoo for oily hair.</li>
            <li> On top of that, it&#x27;s also caused little rashes on my face that will last for a few days (I&#x27;m assuming when I&#x27;m washing it off the soap runs down my face and causes this).</li>
            <li> (have had that occur with other natural products)&lt;br /&gt;-Smelled</li>
            <li> I would say this shampoo is at least the same, if not better than most I use.</li>
            <li> I only needed a small amount to shampoo my whole head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am unsure how to determine whether or not my hair is &amp;#34;detoxified.&amp;#34; I also am not sure that the shampoo can &amp;#34;Unleash the Pure You&amp;#34; as stated on the label.</li>
            <li> My hair is very short, thick, fine, dark brown and greying, and tends to be dry these days.  </li>
            <li> The shampoo itself is very thick and gives a full lather.</li>
            <li> I was careful to rinse the shampoo completely from my hair before I toweled it dry.</li>
            <li> The conditioner wasn&#x27;t too heavy or thick and was easy to run through hair from root to tip.</li>
            <li> Overall the Herbal Essence lathers well, gets my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or have any other negative effects.</li>
            <li> Usually, shampoos that cleanse or strip away excess oils really well tend to leave my hair drier than I&#x27;d like, and that&#x27;s what happened with this</li>
            <li> All tho it didnt last as long as I would like it too.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully the Herbal Essences people have come a long way since I last used their products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;About me, I have long (mid-back length) hair, that is dyed blonde.</li>
            <li> When all products were used in conjunction, the fruity smell definitely lasts all day long which is a plus!</li>
            <li> only thing i don&#x27;t like is there is no such extra thing on this shampoo comparing to other products.</li>
            <li> It did feel like it cleaned my hair well but left it dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> The problem for me is that I have very dry, very thin hair and most of the &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; shampoos strip the life out of my hair (although they do remove the residues that build up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is short and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had enough time yet to determine if it&#x27;s made any difference from other shampoos I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It brought the shine back to my hair and the deep treatment helped to remove the last little bit of fry out of my hair from over use of flat irons and blow dryers.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works just as well if not better than some high end shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really appreciate that because my hair is so delicate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more into spa scents, but this one has an artificial smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have used it and found my hair has been soft and not too frizzy after it has dried.</li>
            <li> I have an oily scalp and found myself needing to wash my hair everyday on my old shampoo.</li>
            <li> how long you like to keep</li>
            <li> Often with my hair texture I shy away from heavy conditioners and intensive treatments, but this collection left my hair soft, shiny, and full of body.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not sure if my hair could withstand normal use of this.&lt;br /&gt;*i</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t really comment on the quality of this shampoo when used with thick, long hair since I have neither.</li>
            <li> * Takes a bit of time to fully lather, then once it does the suds are thick and foamy, feels like they are really working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have very thin, fine, and oily hair, and this hasn&#x27;t created a problem with any of my hair</li>
            <li> only slight negative point I see is that the shampoo does have a huge lather and for someone who likes a lot of foam like me that was weird at first.</li>
            <li> I wish the shampoo and conditioner bottles looked distinguishly different from each other.</li>
            <li> and I can not say that it has done anything different then any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> The product picture doesn’t show how clear the shampoo is, nearly transparent and is also, very thick.</li>
            <li> and it can get dry.</li>
            <li> which is saying something since i have dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> I never blow dry my hair or do anything with it</li>
            <li> I wash my hair every day and as a result  - over  time - my hair can dry out or become somewhat lifeless.</li>
            <li> I was worried that, being a clarifying formula, this shampoo would strip and dry out my hair.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t strip it and make it dry and flyaway.  </li>
            <li> I like the shine results after my hair gets dry, and I didn&#x27;t have any frizz at all after using my curling Iron.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried shampoos where it would dry out my hair when I use it</li>
            <li> Used alone my hair was like straw and so dry I could not even comb it.</li>
            <li> My hair wasn’t dry or covered in a film afterwards.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that has lots of gray mixed.</li>
            <li> Normally, I use salon quality shampoo, but have used other Herbal Essences products in the past.</li>
            <li> My hair was so soft after it dried and still is to this moment!</li>
            <li> I have thin, stick-straight hair that gets pretty oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any buildup since I&#x27;ve used it which is a plus since short hair doesn&#x27;t need anything weighing it down.</li>
            <li> The smell is very fresh and doesn&#x27;t smell fake like other companies&#x27; do.</li>
            <li> It also did not strip my hair or leave it dry and damaged!  </li>
            <li> It felt dry and grainy if that makes any sense!</li>
            <li> I found It left my hair manageable but no more than my current shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it was weigh it down as most intensive conditioners do on me.</li>
            <li> I paired it with the detoxifying conditioner and the intensive treatment as I have very dry hair.</li>
            <li> I have been searching for a shampoo/conditioner to help with my extremely itchy scalp, and dry, brittle hair.</li>
            <li> Half way through the day my hair had gone flat and was in my face.</li>
            <li> I have hard water; however it leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> I usually use deep conditioners and expensive shampoos, but these products actually worked really well!</li>
            <li> so I have to be careful.  </li>
            <li> The products made it easier to detangle my wet hair out of the shower also.</li>
            <li> I personally only plan to use it after heavy product use in my hair or once a week</li>
            <li> and they wash my hair in the salon sinks.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few days and will definitely be purchasing in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but that is just personal preference.</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how thick this shampoo is</li>
            <li> The detoxing chemicals might have been too strong for me! :(</li>
            <li> Shampoo makes my hair dry and conditioner weights my hair down</li>
            <li> My only complaint about it is I don&#x27;t think the smell lasts as long as it should.</li>
            <li> The conditioner was a little runny but after using the treatment conditioner my hair dried so soft and fluffy.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few different brands for hair care and really am not loyal to any one</li>
            <li> saw this &amp;#34;Detoxifying&amp;#34; shampoo from Herbal Essences and wondered if it could do the job of the other stuff.  </li>
            <li> it does no better than any other basic shampoo I tried.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;-Conditioner is a bit runny (when compared to other products</li>
            <li> I shampoo every other day</li>
            <li> I have switched to Herbal Essences due to this sample.</li>
            <li> but I knew that it dries my hair out from having seen that ingredient in other products.</li>
            <li> The other thing is (that I noticed anyway), it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue or film like some shampoos do.  </li>
            <li> Other than patchouli, I have yet to experience a shampoo scent that matches up to what the bottle says, so this isn&#x27;t a surprise.  </li>
            <li> Every once in a while, you need to use a shampoo that removes the build-up of hair products and other conditioning shampoos, so I thought I would give this one a shot.</li>
            <li> The shampoo and conditioner come in similar bottles with the words shampoo and conditioner in small letters.</li>
            <li> Be careful with this!</li>
            <li> When I tried it I thought it might be like other shampoos.</li>
            <li> I like to use this shampoo and conditioner to remove buildup from other products I use.</li>
            <li> It made my thin find hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I usually reach for shampoos with less chemicals and definitely no sulfates, but this shampoo has both.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I used this shampoo for about three weeks, once every other day (so, every 2 days), and was not thrilled with the overall results.</li>
            <li> I typically wash my hair every other day, so I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo followed by the conditioner</li>
            <li> I literally felt like someone was cutting fresh lemons while I was in the shower.</li>
            <li> I had very damaged hair from bleaching it and was skeptical that this would help.</li>
            <li> only complaint is in the packaging.</li>
            <li> Also I like to go a few days in between washes and was curious how my hair would hold up after using this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> husband has thick, coarse, curly hair.</li>
            <li> I typically have a hard time keeping volume, but this shampoo has made a big difference.</li>
            <li> and I found my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down by the product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will use this as my every day shampoo, but I will keep it on hand to refresh my hair when it starts feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li> My daughter, on the other hand, has short, thick, heavy hair that stands up to continual dyeing, heat styling and all kinds of products and her hair never seems to suffer from the abuse.  </li>
            <li> i recommend other people using this product!</li>
            <li> My hair always feels weighed down everyday from other products.</li>
            <li> and I like how there are less chemicals on it.</li>
            <li> I noticed less frizz with his hair.</li>
            <li> After styling my hair it seemed like it had an odd residue on it.</li>
            <li> I had previously been using volume infusing products.</li>
            <li> I have been testing these products for about a week and a half now</li>
            <li> The cream just takes a slight drop.</li>
            <li> I also used the set of the on my 7 year old son, his hair is long and needs the extra conditioning because it gets knotted up bad, his hair dried to a non tangled softness!</li>
            <li> I felt like you NEEDED (or at least I needed) the dry oil to supplement the conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; on the marketing.</li>
            <li> I thought the conditioner could have been a little thicker/creamer.</li>
            <li> I am a little skeptical of the claims of health and beauty products but this one certainly lived up to its claim - at least for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like it was a game changer, but I&#x27;d definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> I have uneven wavy hair and straighten my hair every day.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always disliked the heavy perfumed sent of this brand but thought I&#x27;d give this version a try</li>
            <li> every day i do use hair products and by the end of the week, my hair feels heavy and gunky.  </li>
            <li> I shampoo and condition my hair almost everyday</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of the scent when I use it.</li>
            <li> Typically I shy away from herbal essences due to prior experience with their hair products that stripped my hair of moisture and made the ends straw, but this shampoo didn&#x27;t do that.</li>
            <li> My biggest concern lately has been regarding my hair being extremely frizzy all the time.</li>
            <li> , it also gives my thin, flat hair body and shine.  </li>
            <li> Used with either or both of the conditioners my hair always turned out so dull and oily that within a few hours I had to reshampoo with another product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the accompanying conditioner, so I am not sure how just the shampoo alone works.</li>
            <li> In the past I used--and recommended--Neutrogena&#x27;s Anti-Residue Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I would buy it in the store and use it as a once-a-week break from my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> Usually I have a problem with shampoos drying my hair out, or stripping my hair of the color.</li>
            <li> I have been using this system of haircare for the past week or so</li>
            <li> Again from a short haired guys perspective you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I usually go for the earthy stuff like Scruples or Aveda.</li>
            <li> Not something I&#x27;d usually go for, since I like the frutier scents.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what it smells like.  </li>
            <li> basil,&amp;#34; though I am not sure that is how I would describe it.</li>
            <li> After I rinsed it out my shower turned into an oil slick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure about the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; or purifies my hair.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the way your hands feel when you wash it off, it was just really weird</li>
            <li> Instead of limp and freyed ends, my hair looked fuller and bouncy!</li>
            <li> I usually use volume building shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> My hair is really thick but small portion can lather root to tip.</li>
            <li> I felt the need to &amp;#34;Repeat,&amp;#34; which hardly ever happens with my shampoos.</li>
            <li> and that is hard to find.</li>
            <li> By midday my hair looked greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> Lately, I&#x27;ve had problems with an itchy scalp</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not meant to be negative at all.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these products for customers who have thin hair because it made it feel heavy</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for me, I have thin, flat hair</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell of quality is what I mean.</li>
            <li> As for natural, there is am awful long list if chemicals in the ingredients but paraben isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I am very lazy when it comes to shampoos.</li>
            <li> (though subtle)</li>
            <li> After a while my hair gets heavy and limp and almost looks dirty as soon as it dries after washing.  </li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad by any means, just different - a  lemony herbal type scent.</li>
            <li> I just wish that it did not have the sulfates that are not good for curly hair.</li>
            <li> No need to shampoo twice, even after a tough work out at the gym.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very thick</li>
            <li> When I rinse, some of that conditioner stays behind and becomes the dreaded &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> These products worked well and did the job; however, I have thin hair.</li>
            <li> I received the detoxifying shampoo and conditioner to try and, I must say, I was skeptical</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> , not sticky, just weird.  </li>
            <li> but no one carries it yet unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Ill continue to use this.</li>
            <li> and I cannot believe the amount of body my (very thin) hair has.</li>
            <li> It Wasn&#x27;t horrible the shampoo just made my hair feel very dry until I used the conditioner and treatment</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with the lather.</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all</li>
            <li> As it turns out I was sadly disappointed.</li>
            <li> I hate having to closely read labels in the shower.</li>
            <li> but I hated how it made my hair feel after I was done washing</li>
            <li> This was the worst part.</li>
            <li> and it is nasty feeling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This has a fresh and invogorating scent. It is a great scent to start the day with being citrus. I have used it and found my hair has been soft and not too frizzy after it has dried. My hair has felt as though it has dealt with a flat iron better since I started using it. This is a great product and I would look for it again.</li>
            <li> * Has a REALLY GREAT floral scent.  I really liked it.&lt;br /&gt;* Clear formulation.&lt;br /&gt;* Takes a bit of time to fully lather, then once it does the suds are thick and foamy, feels like they are really working.&lt;br /&gt;* Seems to rinse out completely.&lt;br /&gt;* My hair seems soft after shower but not much different than always and I use conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thoughts overall... I liked this shampoo.  I didn&#x27;t feel like it was a game changer, but I&#x27;d definitely use it again.</li>
            <li> I am very lazy when it comes to shampoos. I probably don&#x27;t take care of my hair the way I should. So, when I had the chance to buy a detox shampoo, I figured if anyone could use it, I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the smell. It&#x27;s a very fresh, lemon based scent. However, it&#x27;s not terribly overpowering either. As a man, I can live with the light lemon smell coming from my head throughout the day. I also like the way it makes my hair feel and look. It definitely cleans well and makes my hair feel soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the detox side, I can&#x27;t be totally sure if it does what it says. I do, however, like the idea behind it, but honestly it sounds kind of far fetched. However, it&#x27;s a great smelling shampoo that leaves your hair looking. That is enough for me.</li>
            <li> I am in love with the scent. The shampoo cleans my hair very well without drying it out. I paired it with the detoxifying conditioner and the intensive treatment as I have very dry hair. I would recommend this product to my friends and family. Most likely will be buying it soon.</li>
            <li> Influenster  just gave me Herbal Essences wild naturals complimentary to tryout, test, and review! It Smells so good, I was so excited to receive and try this product I&#x27;ve been using Herbal Essences products for a long time and I must say I&#x27;m impress with this new shampoo it gets my hair really clean. My scalp looks feels amazing and my hair feel more strengthening feels like a spa at home.-the scent is overwhelming very pleasant  and my hair is very moisture after using Herbal Essences wild naturals thanks again influenster..so far I will be adding it to my daily regiment.</li>
            <li> This is AWESOME-smelling shampoo. Really nice. I don&#x27;t often get that jazzed about a certain scent, but this stuff smells really good. Unfortunately, (or maybe fortunately, since I&#x27;m sometimes scent sensitive), the smell doesn&#x27;t really stay much with you after your hair dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does feel very clean and fresh after using it. I don&#x27;t feel any sort of build-up or waxy feel to my hair at all. It lathers really really, too. I would say this shampoo is at least the same, if not better than most I use. My hair feels really great and soft after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea what cassia seeds are. Many shampoos use a lot of great-sounding phrases and buzz words to get you buy their product. &amp;#34;Hand-harvested&amp;#34; cassia seeds did make me take note, but it would not influence me buying a product or not. I pretty much go by how my hair and scalp feel after use of a product. I can tell you my hair feels wonderful, it smells great (though subtle) and I have thoroughly enjoyed using this shampoo. I would definitely add this to my regular rotation.</li>
            <li> i received this product for free in return for my review. I would say this product is great, has a nice smell and works great in my hair, however i have very dry hair that needs a ton of extra moisturizer, although very hydrating, for my hair it just not enough. I do highly recommend this shampoo&amp; conditioner if your hair isn&#x27;t as dry as mine.</li>
            <li> I got this in a VoxBox to test and I love it! This works so well! It made my hair super soft and it smells amazing! I have never had a shampoo, conditioner, and deep conditioner that I love so much! I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It smooths down all of my little fly away frizzies, and makes my hair super smooth! The only thing i would change is the scent, while it smells clean, I am not a fan of the overall scent.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo as a free sample in my voxbox. I have been searching for a shampoo/conditioner to help with my extremely itchy scalp, and dry, brittle hair. I was really excited to see that it was detoxifying because I feel like that is exactly what my hair and scalp need right now. I love the fresh scent, I do wish that the scent lasted longer after my shower, it seems to fade pretty fast. But it was like as soon as I put it on my scalp, I could feel it working! I used the detoxifying shampoo, detoxifying conditioner, and the Wild Naturals Intensive Treatment together as the back of the bottles recommend.  My hair felt so soft after it dried, I am very impressed. I will definitely be going out to buy all three products. They have helped my hair so much in the short time I have been using them!</li>
            <li> Loved this product! Received it free from Influenster. My hair is often dry and brittle and this product made it super soft. Plus it smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I love the smell!!! Great stuff!</li>
            <li> My hair is noticeably softer and cleaner feeling  I used this product shortly after getting my hair dyed red and I did not lose any color. I did use in Combination with the matching conditioner a d deep treatment. I was able to try and review these products thanks to the complimentary samples from influenster.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this shampoo and it leaves my hair shiny and smooth. Will definetly purchase this in the future!</li>
            <li> When I first got the product, I was very intrigued by the packaging and the scent. I was also interested to see how much of a ‘detoxification’ the product provided since when I think of detox I think of removal of toxins and waste so I was wondering if it would leave my hair dry and brittle or actually feeling clean and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first put the product in my hand in the shower, I did not love the scent but the formula felt good, not to thick and not too thin. I applied the product and worked up a decent lather. I again did not like the scent while washing my hair, it has a lemon- lime scent that reminds me of lemon-lime soda, not the lemongrass that I think they were going for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did use the accompanying conditioner, so I am not sure how just the shampoo alone works. Overall, I am VERY, VERY pleased with the product and how my hair feels. I have been using the products together for three days now and I cannot believe the amount of body my (very thin) hair has. Normally when I blow- dry my hair, my hair ends up straight but I have had so much body and volume and ironically once dried, my fiancé complimented me on how good my hair smelt and felt too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this I had been using Mane and Tail Shampoo, which is great but doesn’t have a great after smell. This combines the strengthening features I got from my old shampoo and combines them with a fresh smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair feels light, smells great and has great movement- I am beyond happy with this product line and while the products I received were for a free trial, I will absolutely continue to purchase these items.</li>
            <li> I got this product free from Influenster to test and review and I loved it! I really felt as if the shampoo was removing all of the residue that was in my hair. I significantly noticed the difference after 3 washes.</li>
            <li> The scent is a little overwhelming, but it really wakes you up. Over all I liked the way my hair felt after using it. It is smooth and strong feeling and less frizzy then usual.</li>
            <li> Ok so I tried this product free from Influenster, I have to say I love it! Smells amazing, lemony and minty. I washed my hair first with a good lather, I then finished with the conditioner and the intensive treatment conditioner last. Leaves your hair smooth and smelling great. I would recommend this shampoo system :)</li>
            <li> When I first opened the bottle it smelt like fresh flowers and sweet fruit. When I used it my hair instantly felt softer and more clean. I got this free from an Influenster VoxBox to test and am very please with the results of the shampoo, conditioner, and oil elixir. I have to say the elixir is my favorite as I have very curly hair and it can get dry. It tames it and keeps it super hydrated.</li>
            <li> I got a complimentary sample via Influnester and have really enjoyed it! The detoxfying aspect was great for my hair as it can get filled with pollution living in a city!</li>
            <li> I received a free trial size of this Herbal Essences shampoo from Vox Box and I love it! It smells citrus and clean. Love how my hair feels too.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo as well as the conditioner and the intensive treatment serum as part of a free package. I was really excited when I saw the name &amp;#34;wildly natural&amp;#34; because I had been looking for a shampoo that was better for my hair. But, as the other reviews reveal, the name is referring more to the exotic nature of some of the ingredients. I liked that these shampoos are part of a collection and the shampoo smells very refreshing. It left my hair feeling very soft; it definitely does its job!</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Smells great and leaves hair clean and shinny</li>
            <li> I liked it, it was okay i liked the feeling it gave me afterwards it made my head feel clean lol but in a good fresh way</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel and look amazing!</li>
            <li> I received the whole Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection free from Influenster to test out and write a review  I have been using the products and I am pleasantly overwhelmed with results. Talk about amazing smell WOW! its like waking up in the morning to the fresh scent of lemon and basil. its just plain amazing The products leaves my hair smelling and feeling fantastic,  Used in conjunction with the Detoxifying Conditioner, my hair is left feeling soft and silky with a shine!</li>
            <li> I grew up using Herbal Essences products, I admit that besides their high quality, I’ve always love the products fragrance, and this Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo excels at it, because the scent is outstanding. I really love it, it doesn’t linger for long, but while it lasts is a true pleasure. The most important function of the shampoo is to clean both hair and scalp. I like the way my hair feels after being washed, soft even before applying a conditioner, and shining clean. The product picture doesn’t show how clear the shampoo is, nearly transparent and is also, very thick. It&#x27;s very concentrated; a little bit does a nice lather (I don&#x27;t like it when the shampoo is too liquid and when one pours it into one&#x27;s hand in the shower, the shampoo ends up wasted in the shower floor). Did I mention that it has an amazing scent? Well, it does.</li>
            <li> I pick up hair residue because I often use 2 in 1 shampoos (that include conditioner).  When I rinse, some of that conditioner stays behind and becomes the dreaded &amp;#34;residue&amp;#34;.  After a while my hair gets heavy and limp and almost looks dirty as soon as it dries after washing.  In the past I used--and recommended--Neutrogena&#x27;s Anti-Residue Shampoo.  But I didn&#x27;t really like the smell of it....and the smell would linger on and on and on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this &amp;#34;Detoxifying&amp;#34; shampoo from Herbal Essences and wondered if it could do the job of the other stuff.  I checked the ingredients and found that both shampoos use the same main ingredients that strip the residue from hair strands:  Sodium laureth sulfate, cocamidopropyl betaine, sodium chloride, citric acid.  (There are more ingredients but (along with water) these are found in both shampoos.)  So, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, and the lemon and basil give the shampoo a citrus-y, minty, refreshing fragrance.  Herbal Essences calls it &amp;#34;  wildly invigorating&amp;#34;.  I think its the best fragrance Herbal Essences has come up with in a good long while.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I was pleased to have a chance to try Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo with Cassia Seeds. The first thing I noticed as I squeezed a modest amount of shampoo into the palm of my hand was a light and pleasant citrus smell which became more pronounced as I worked the shampoo into my wet hair and scalp. A rich and creamy lather covered my head which felt and, as mentioned, smelled good. I was careful to rinse the shampoo completely from my hair before I toweled it dry. My hair felt very soft and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked up the uses for Cassia Seeds on the Internet as they relate to hair care and found that these seeds strengthen hair roots and improve circulation. Much more information can be found concerning these seeds, but it does seem reasonably certain that they add value to the conditioning properties of this shampoo to heal damaged hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now it is the next day that I am writing this review and my hair feels exceptionally clean and soft. My guess is that most readers of this review are going to be just as happy as I am with this excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t care for the smell</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent. It smells great and leaves your hair lusting for more of its luscious goodness. I can&#x27;t get enough of this new offering from Herbal Essences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically don&#x27;t care much for shampoos as my heart belongs to conditioner, but this one is simply wonderful. I find myself spending extra time in the shower while I embrace its awe and wonder. Lovely is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new shampoo, look no further. This shampoo is the real deal. It&#x27;s inexpensive and wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay and I like how there are less chemicals on it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell other wise works just as good as any other products</li>
            <li> I was given a sample of this shampoo to try and I was pleasantly surprised with how light shampoo was. My hair doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down, and even looks like it has more volume. I normally have a problem with shampoo s that are to heavy, but this left my hair so clean and soft. It has a nice light scent which I also liked.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this product to try and used it this morning. My hair has been on the dry, frizzy side lately, and I was pleasantly surprised with how smooth and silky my hair feels today after just one use! I also used the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Intensive treatment and conditioner, but can tell that my hair felt so much softer after just the shampoo. Good stuff!</li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy hair that requires a great product to keep it &amp;#34;tame&amp;#34;. This shampoo was in the middle for me. It wasn&#x27;t bad. It did keep my hair somewhat under control, but it wasn&#x27;t as good as some other shampoos I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is gel-like, rather than cream-based (which may be part of why it didn&#x27;t work as well for me). The scent is nice and citrusy. It is a nice big bottle that lasts a long time (and I tend to use more at a time). It is easy to get the last bit out, which is not always the case in some bottle designs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you have low-maintenance hair, this would work well. For those of us that need a little more &amp;#34;power&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t quite fit the need.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:deef021a3ca2e47a8b757594f024eb6c]] Is it toooo obvious the shampoo has been used?</li>
            <li> Got this in a set from influenster for free. Absolutely love the smell if the new line, it&#x27;s floral-y to me and the dry oil spray adds a beautiful non greasy shine. Definitely a new line I&#x27;m excited about.</li>
            <li> I was wowed with my results after just 3 uses of this product. It left my hair feeling fresh and rejuvenated! My hair felt like I had just stepped out of a salon!</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary on behalf of influenster to try. I am not normally a lemon fan but this shampoo had a nice invigorating scent and it felt great also :-)</li>
            <li> Great product. Leaves hair feeling clean and not weighed down by product.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product. It hydrates my hair and makes it feel more silky and smooth. I will continue to purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always switching up what haircare I use and have used and been happy with Herbal Essences in the past. I received a free sample of this product to test from Influenster and can say that I am happy with it. The main things that I look for in haircare products are scent, how clean it makes my hair feel, and softness; this line hit all of these points for me. I really like the smell of the HE Illuminating line, its clean and fruity and I love how soft it makes my hair feel. I consider myself to be picky when choosing beauty products, and this is one that I will definitely consider buying next time I go to buy haircare.</li>
            <li> After reading all the positive reviews, I decided to purchase this along with the conditioner. Even though I&#x27;m kind of obsessed with the smell, I&#x27;ve noticed that it causes my scalp to itch and flake—a problem I&#x27;ve never had before when I&#x27;ve used Acure Organics or Aveeno shampoo. On top of that, it&#x27;s also caused little rashes on my face that will last for a few days (I&#x27;m assuming when I&#x27;m washing it off the soap runs down my face and causes this). I&#x27;m not sure if this is some kind of allergic reaction, but I&#x27;ve ceased to use it so my scalp and face could return to normalcy. I also have chemically treated hair, so this may not have been the best choice as it made my hair dull and dry, and the smell was gone on the same day I washed it. I wanted to like this so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, use cautiously. The detoxing chemicals might have been too strong for me! :(</li>
            <li> Smells amazing! Love how it made my hair shiny but not oily. I will be buying this again for sure!</li>
            <li> I received this to try from inflencter. I found this product to have a light scent and I found my hair wasn&#x27;t weighed down by the product. I found It left my hair manageable but no more than my current shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product. When used with the conditioner, it makes my hair super soft and shiny. It smells very nice, too, tropical and lots of fruits! This product also makes my hair a lot more manageable while brushing it. I was sent the product free to test and review for buyers. It also makes my hair much more hydrated which is saying something since i have dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Really love these products! Smell great, clean well, not heavy feeling. Will get again.</li>
            <li> So this shampoo isn&#x27;t much different from any Herbal Essence I&#x27;ve tried except that it is extra sudsy.  It smells good.  I don&#x27;t notice anything especially detoxifying about it as claimed.  As for natural, there is am awful long list if chemicals in the ingredients but paraben isn&#x27;t one of them.</li>
            <li> I love the way this product smells.  I got a travel size in Shampoo and Condition and after just one wash my hair smells great and feels soft.  Friends even complimented me on how good my hair smells :)</li>
            <li> Works amazing! Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy at all! Would recommend to anyone who ask me!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. It is amazing!!! It leaves your hair manageable, shiny, soft and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feelings really clean. Had a light, nice scent. I like the natural elements as well! Overall good product and would recommend!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product to try. All opinions are my own and are my honest thoughts on the product.  This shampoo has an appealing color and soft lemony fresh scent. I was disappointed with the lather. I felt the need to &amp;#34;Repeat,&amp;#34; which hardly ever happens with my shampoos. Even with the second washing, I felt lather was lacking. It rinsed cleanly and quickly.  I&#x27;m not a heavy hair product user, so I don&#x27;t feel my hair is any &amp;#34;less toxic.&amp;#34;  Overall, I felt like it was a good clarifying shampoo, leaving my hair soft and not weighed-down. I would buy it in the store and use it as a once-a-week break from my usual shampoo.</li>
            <li> Great scent and it leaves my hair feeling so soft and clean!</li>
            <li> It works great on my hair and leaves it smelling nice. I&#x27;m just not a huge fan of the scent when I use it. I would love to try it in a different scent. I got this product free to test and review. I recommend this product if you like lemon scent, and hair that smells good.</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that has lots of gray mixed. I&#x27;ve been looking for a shampoo that would bring back the shine and bounce that I had years ago. This did just that with a great smell. It lathered great with just a small amount. Wonderful for gray hair and that is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Got this free for a review through Influenster. Smells great, though it doesn&#x27;t linger long after a wash. Cleans well though!</li>
            <li> Recently received the shampoo, conditioner and the intensive treatment for testing and reviewing. So far I am very impressed with all 3 items. Usually I have a problem with shampoos drying my hair out, or stripping my hair of the color. I have no had that happen so far. It smells absolutely amazing! I have only had this product for a few days, and so far I am very impressed with it. I recommend it to anyone who is searching for something new and healthy for their hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is the best option for thin, fine hair. My hair felt clean, but was limp and lifeless. Half way through the day my hair had gone flat and was in my face.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the citrusy scent of this shampoo. My hair smelled amazing all day! And was so clean! The shampoo lathers well and made my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> I have been using this system of haircare for the past week or so and I really like how it makes my hair feel.  The smell is different - good different!  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it, but it&#x27;s fresh but feminine.  Not overpowering or too sweet, kind of like a rainforest.  I typically wash my hair every other day, so I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo followed by the conditioner and then I used the deep treatment twice. I have color treated hair and this does not seem to adversely affect my color.  I got this product free to test and review.</li>
            <li> Yay!  I got this shampoo to test for free from Influenster!  I really liked it!  It has this awesome, light, citrus scent without being too heavy or overpowering.  The shampoo did a great job cleaning my hair and getting rid of all the build up that happens over time. It also did not strip my hair or leave it dry and damaged!  Way to go Herbal Essence!</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells awesome, which is the biggest plus. Lathers well and doesn&#x27;t weigh down my fine hair. As far as its claims for providing hair with strength and making it luscious. it does no better than any other basic shampoo I tried. My hair dies feel &amp;#34;detoxified&amp;#34; slightly, and clean and fresh which is important. But it&#x27;s nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! This is the first time that I have ever used this product and it&#x27;s fanatasic! It makes my hair feel Great! I have super curly hair and makes my hair feel moisturized and looks silly smooth. I would recommend this anyone with any hair type</li>
            <li> This review is based on a free sample I received in a voxbox of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment through my influenster membership.&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, I am a hair care snob.  I only buy top of the line toiletries and appliances for my hair.  I have uneven wavy hair and straighten my hair every day.  I also have my hair colored at a salon using the most natural ingredient hair color line that I could find.&lt;br /&gt;I was not overly excited to really sample this product, since I am not a drugstore brand user of hair products, but I was obligated, so I did.  The smell is actually quite refreshing and invigorating, I always prefer citrus smelling products, so that was a pleasant surprise. Next, the shampoo lathers rather nicely, and the conditioner was great for detangling.  After blow drying my hair straight to see the results, the entire regimen left my hair feeling very light and squeaky clean.  I did feel like it stripped my hair color a bit, making it lighter.  I am covering up grays, so that isn’t really ideal.&lt;br /&gt;Due to my concern with the stripping of hair color, I would not use this product again.  However, if I didn’t color my hair, I would use this product about 2-3 times/month as a break from your normal hair care routine to spruce things up.  I do not think it is an ideal every day product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is actually very nice!! It gets your hair very clean and smells great!! The scent lasts as well. Not sure if I will purchase however, because it isn&#x27;t sulfate free, which is extremely important to my very fine, partially dried out hair!!</li>
            <li> Smelled great and made my hair feel amazing! I really liked the product and would definitely buy it again. Thanks Influenster for the free product!</li>
            <li> I received this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo as well as the Conditioner and Intensive Treatment complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I used the products for a week. I would first wash my hair with the shampoo, then follow up with the conditioner and intensive treatment. The shampoo lathered nicely and smells great. It does a great job cleaning the hair. I would definitely recommend using the conditioner and intensive treatment as well. I have fine, thin hair and I was concerned that so much product would weigh my hair down or make it oily but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I received the product as a free sample through Influenster and love it!! The smell makes me feel like I&#x27;m at a spa… It leaves my fine hair clean without stripping.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;-Cleaned my hair and did not make it feel greasy (have had that occur with other natural products)&lt;br /&gt;-Smelled great and very relaxing&lt;br /&gt;-Love that a deep conditioning treatment is available in the same scent&lt;br /&gt;-Great price for girls who don&#x27;t like spending tons on hair products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-Conditioner is a bit runny (when compared to other products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Loved the product. Disclaimer: I did receive this as a sample from influenster.com.</li>
            <li> I liked that it made my hair soft and clean with one wash.  I have longish hair for a dude, and don&#x27;t always have time to condition.  This was effective in cleansing and didn&#x27;t strip me hair of it&#x27;s natural moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, ingredients could be better.  Citric acid and Sodium benzoate combine to form carcinogenic benzene.  I&#x27;ve shied away from many soft drinks and preserved foods with those ingredients, and there is no reason for me to tolerate it in my shampoo.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to test and review through a website called Influenster, along with some other Herbal Essences Wild Naturals products. I liked the product. I liked that it wasn&#x27;t too thick of a consistency. I also liked that I didn&#x27;t have to use a lot of the product for it to cover my whole head. It seems like the product is worth buying. I priced it in the store and also on here, and it seems like its a fair price. I am more into the salon shampoos/conditioners, but I would probably buy this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells so good, and it gets your hair really nice and clean. I use a LOT of product in my hair, and this shampoo did a good job of getting it all out. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, and I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again when my sample runs out--even my fiancé likes it)</li>
            <li> As someone who uses a lot of products on my curly, dry hair, I need a good deep clean every now and then to keep my hair from looking greasy and dull. This shampoo did a good job of removing product build-up and leaving my hair clean without completely drying it out. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the smell, but that is just personal preference. It&#x27;s not offensive, but not my cup of tea. I don&#x27;t think I will use this as my every day shampoo, but I will keep it on hand to refresh my hair when it starts feeling weighed down. Note: I received a free sample of this product.</li>
            <li> This product along with the Conditioner smell so great and they really wash well. I got this product for free to review but that does not mean that I am just going to love the product. This is my honest opinion about the product. The smell does wear off after a while and of course it&#x27;s not like magic. It is just shampoo and conditioner. So do not expect an amazing product that will do everything. It does smell nice, the smell reminds me of something tropical.</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample in my voxbox and I really like it. It has a great scent and cleans well. I just wish that it did not have the sulfates that are not good for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample through the Mail of herbal essences wild natural detoxifying shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioning treatment. First I noticed the smell. It was so fresh and wonderful citress smelling. I literally felt like someone was cutting fresh lemons while I was in the shower. Second I noticed the amazing clean feeling of my scalp and hair.  Lastly I noticed the light weight silky smoothness of my hair. I would highly recommend these products!</li>
            <li> Today was the first day of testing my free products of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals, and I can already tell a huge difference.  It’s like paradise in a bottle.  First the invigorating scent of Thai Lemon Basil was a great aid to help me wake up and start my morning off right.  My hair feels stronger and has more volume than ever, thanks to the detoxifying shampoo and conditioner.  I’m already in love with these products and love how my hair smells, looks, and feels.</li>
            <li> This is a ok shampoo. I received it in my free voxbox from influenster. It smells good but I have always had a problem with herbal essence products leaving my hair feeling stringy and greasy. I like that its a travel size. I don&#x27;t think I will be purchasing this product in the future even tho it is a affordable product.</li>
            <li> This was my first time using the product and I absolutely love it. I will most definitely use it again</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is amazing. I have used it for a week now (3 washes) and it&#x27;s been great. The consistency was nice and thick and lathered well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes</li>
            <li> I loved the way this product smells and it left my hair looking and feeling so nice! I recieved this in my influenster voxbox</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. i am in love with this shampoo. I have fine hair, but a lot of it. This shampoo cut through any and all residue from styling products leaving my hair feeling really clean!  Used in conjunction with the Wild Naturals Detoxifying Conditioner and the Intesive Treatment, my hair was left feeling clean and soft. I shampoo every other day and I was able to make it through with no greasiness!  I may have been able to try this thanks to a sample, but I will definitely be buying more!  The smell is amazing as well, very fresh!</li>
            <li> This whole collection is amazing! It has such a light and refreshing smell and every time after I use it my hair feels so soft and light. will definitely keep on using in the future! I received these items complimentary but will definitely be buying in the future!</li>
            <li> Bought this product and it was amazing. Got fid of build up and left my medium length fine straight hair soft</li>
            <li> I received the shampoo/conditioner/dry oil set in an influenster vox box. Was so excited to try them out! Like all herbal essences products, this particular line smells amazing! It smells very fruity with some floral notes almost like escada(sunset?) perfume. As far as shine, I&#x27;m not so sure that it imparts much shine-as compared with some other shine products I&#x27;ve tried before. Gives a really good lather though with just one pump full which I liked. The conditioner wasn&#x27;t too heavy or thick and was easy to run through hair from root to tip.When all products were used in conjunction, the fruity smell definitely lasts all day long which is a plus! The dry oil spray wasn&#x27;t too greasy although you do need to use more than one or two sprays(as directed on the bottle) for long hair. Even with numerous sprays, it didn&#x27;t give any greasy feeling to my hair.</li>
            <li> I got this product from Influenster to test and review for free. The scent of the shampoo I wasn&#x27;t too fond of (it is ok, but I prefer something a little more sweet). But the product works well. It left my hair feeling clean and soft. I have very fine, straight hair, but this shampoo and it&#x27;s pairings left my hair very soft and smooth. And it also helps to take out the frizz! Overall, I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I personally love this product. I just jumped out of the shower and not only does my hair feel amazing, it smells great too. The smell is very fresh and doesn&#x27;t smell fake like other companies&#x27; do. The condition that it leaves my hair in is great and I will defiantly start using this product. I highly recommend this if you haven&#x27;t already tried it.</li>
            <li> Very Cleansing! Smells Great Too!</li>
            <li> I recently received a sample of the Herbal Essences Detoxifying Shampoo for free so I could test and review it. I have thin, stick-straight hair that gets pretty oily if I don&#x27;t wash it every day. Normally, I use salon quality shampoo, but have used other Herbal Essences products in the past. This shampoo smells great, very clean and fresh. It also felt very clean after I used it. The true test came the next day, when my hair and scalp was still feeling clean and not oily. Although I really enjoyed the scent, it didn&#x27;t stick around as long as I would&#x27;ve liked. Overall, I really enjoyed the shampoo and will definitely consider purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this! I did receive this for free from VoxBox/Influenster. I have very fine and almost thin curly hair. I can&#x27;t use anything that is moisturizing or I look like I have greasy hair and there is no way I can skip a wash. This however had my curls looking smooth and clean and soft without frizz. The conditioner is amazing as well. I did wait to write my review until I had used this for several washes so I could give an accurate report.</li>
            <li> I was using another brand of shampoo when I received a free sample of this through Influencer. I have switched to Herbal Essences due to this sample. This shampoo smells so phenomenonal! Leaves my hair feeling clean and fresh, and smelling fantastic! The lemon and orange scent is so fresh its like you are washing your hair with a real lemon and orange! I am sold, this is my new hair care choice.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this collection to review. I had very damaged hair from bleaching it and was skeptical that this would help. I usually use deep conditioners and expensive shampoos, but these products actually worked really well! As with all Herbal Essences products, the scent was really nice. A light, fruity/floral smell that stays even after you wash it off. My hair felt better and cleaner after I dried it. Good product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed this product. It made my hair feel so soft and clean! I would recommend it to my friends for sure.</li>
            <li> I received this sample free to try, and I am so impressed I will probably purchase soon. I can&#x27;t get over the smell of the lemon/basil. It smells clean, but subtle. I don&#x27;t get out of the shower smelling like a flower bomb. The shampoo lathered very nicely and left my scalp and strands feeling extra clean!</li>
            <li> I received a sample package of this from influenster &amp; I really liked the shampoo. I have natural 4a kinky curly hair &amp; it left my hair feeling really clean &amp; strong (the cassia extract) but without leaving it with that stripped feeling. The conditioner was ok. It did have slip so I was able to detangle very quickly and easily, and my hair was very soft but strong and not overly mushy at all.  I didn&#x27;t care much for the elixir. I read the ingredients beforehand and saw that it had silicones. I&#x27;m not against silicones at all but I saw that isopropyl myristate was high up on the ingredient list. Companies use it in serums so that your hair isn&#x27;t left with that greasy feeling but I knew that it dries my hair out from having seen that ingredient in other products. I decided to try it out anyway because every companies formulation is different. It dried my hair up sooo much and left it tangled. I decided to rinse my hair and deep condition but that did nothing so I had to shampoo &amp; deep condition all over again to get that product off of my hair.</li>
            <li> I had received this product for free to review. To start off the product smells amazing, very fresh and clean, just like lemons. When I had initially used the set, which includes a shampoo, conditioner, and an intensive treatment, my hair had tons of product in it from styling it the day before, so with its detoxifying attributes I thought it would be perfect to try out. After getting out of the shower it really did live up to its claims, my hair held felt nice and completely clean without any leftover product residue from the previous day. In all I would say this set is very good and I would defiantly consider purchasing it when my samples runs out.</li>
            <li> Shampoo makes my hair dry and conditioner weights my hair down</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo complementary to try from Influenster and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all, in fact I would recommend it to everyone! If you love shampoo that smells good and leaves your hair as soft and tangle free as can be this is for you! If you try it you won&#x27;t go back to anything else! I wasn&#x27;t sure about trying it because I don&#x27;t use herbal essences very often but with the way it made my hair feel I would use it all the time! &amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm. Refreshing and made my hair look like new.</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.  I gave it  three stars; very nice product for the price point.  Left hair soft and smells amazing but my hair became very oily by the end of the day, which does not happen with my normal regimen.</li>
            <li> I got the shampoo and conditioner set thanks to @Influenster to try out! I absolutely love it! The smell is amazing like all Herbal Essences products I have used so far!&lt;br /&gt;It left my hair feeling clean and fluffy. I never blow dry my hair or do anything with it but my hair fell beautifully after using this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The only slight negative point I see is that the shampoo does have a huge lather and for someone who likes a lot of foam like me that was weird at first. But the effects definitely made up for it!</li>
            <li> I ADORE this shampoo! I have an oily scalp and found myself needing to wash my hair everyday on my old shampoo. I used to use an OGX brand one and I am glad I made the switch. Typically I shy away from herbal essences due to prior experience with their hair products that stripped my hair of moisture and made the ends straw, but this shampoo didn&#x27;t do that. It does an excellent job of cleaning my locks while at the same time hydrating them. I definitely recommend! By the way, I have a lot of hair and I didn&#x27;t need to use so much product!</li>
            <li> Granted, I don&#x27;t have long flowing lavishing locks to attend to, but I really liked this shampoo.  For the most part when it comes to shampoo, that&#x27;s the wife&#x27;s job &amp; I could really care less, this though is something I can definitely recommend to others.  #1 thing it has going for it, the scent.  Not only does it smell great in &amp; after the shower, but you can still smell it at the end of the day.  The other thing is (that I noticed anyway), it doesn&#x27;t leave an oily residue or film like some shampoos do.  Most importantly, I felt clean after using it.  Again from a short haired guys perspective you really can&#x27;t go wrong with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I am a little skeptical of the claims of health and beauty products but this one certainly lived up to its claim - at least for me. I wash my hair every day and as a result  - over  time - my hair can dry out or become somewhat lifeless. Almost from the first use, I could tell a significant difference - the hair felt healthier, smoother, softer and even my scalp condition has improved. I would definitely recommend this product as a short term regime to revitalize your hair - even if it does not become an everyday-use product for you. The price is significantly higher than normal shampoos so that might be a mitigating factor for some. I have not used it together with a conditioner, and have felt no need to do so. All around a fabulous product.</li>
            <li> It is too too funny to have a wild natural Ayurvedic product straight from the corporate vats of publicly traded mega conglomerate P&amp;G, but Herbal Essences Wild Naturals (Detoxifying!) Shampoo is a good one, with a low enough price and sufficiently attractive packaging I&#x27;ll probably buy it on my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pretty package design features springy yellow and green; I especially like the clear bottle so you can see the contents and visually assess how much product is left. I don&#x27;t know exactly what to call the scent, but it&#x27;s a burst of fresh rather than coming across as sweet or flowery. Wild Naturals Shampoo lathers up well and rinses off easily. Great end results, since it left my hair looking smooth and feeling soft to the touch, absolutely ready to unleash my own pure self in my revitalized locks.</li>
            <li> Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo is a good shampoo for my hair. It cleaned it well, had a good lather, and a lovely scent of lemon and basil. It is gentle enough of a clarifying shampoo to use on a daily basis. The gel was thick, not watery, and I felt like it was a good quality shampoo. As with most advertising, I think they&#x27;ve gone a bit overboard on the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; thing. But it is a very good shampoo and worth the money.</li>
            <li> The best thing about this shampoo is that it does not smell like the nausiatingly flowery Herbal Essence I&#x27;m used to.  I&#x27;ve always disliked the heavy perfumed sent of this brand but thought I&#x27;d give this version a try and I&#x27;m glad I did.  I prefer unscented formulas but if there is a scent then I go for this type.  Its earthy, woody, and not flowery at all.  My hair is very short, thick, fine, dark brown and greying, and tends to be dry these days.  At this length I&#x27;m better off using just shampoo and nothing else.  I was worried that, being a clarifying formula, this shampoo would strip and dry out my hair.  But it does not.  I&#x27;ve used it four times and no drying.  It gives my hair some body and I like how my hair looks.</li>
            <li> I used the product just as any other shampoo and wasn&#x27;t too thrilled with it. It did feel like it cleaned my hair well but left it dry afterwards. It smelled great if it was a cleaner but not the kind of scent I want my hair to smell like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!  I have very fine hair that tends to get oily at the roots but a little drier at the ends since I do get it color treated.  This shampoo left my hair clean without over drying.  It was very soft and shiny. It rinsed cleanly away without any residue. The scent is lovely.  It isn&#x27;t overpowering at all.  Very fresh, clean, and a little sweet.  I didn&#x27;t really notice any scent after my hair was dry but I&#x27;m okay with that.  Another thing I loved is that this shampoo lathers like a dream!  Also I like to go a few days in between washes and was curious how my hair would hold up after using this shampoo.  I&#x27;m on day two and it&#x27;s pretty good.  Normally my hair would be starting to get oily at the roots but so far it&#x27;s just fine.  I&#x27;m very impressed.  This shampoo works just as well if not better than some high end shampoos that I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent a sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo Lemon Basil for to test and review.  While this was sent to me, these are my genuine opinions.  I will definitely purchase this shampoo on my own.</li>
            <li> I recently used this Herbal Essences Wild Natural Detoxifying shampoo. I really love the lemon scent, it also lathers up very well so i don&#x27;t need to use 2-3 times. My hair is really thick but small portion can lather root to tip. It also keeps hair clear and scented after every wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing i don&#x27;t like is there is no such extra thing on this shampoo comparing to other products.It is just a regular shampoo with Cassia seeds. But comparing to price it is a highly recommended shampoo for regular wash.</li>
            <li> The bright lemon scent of this shampoo is my favorite aspect about it, along with some great suds. I received the trio of Wild Naturals products containing cassia and lemon basil to review (free of charge) and was impressed by the smell and the results. My hair is fairly thinned after the birth of my daughter and needs all the help it can get. The detoxifying shampoo helped remove build-up which gave my hair a little more volume. I plan on using this in rotation with my other shampoo to keep my routine fresh.</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo! I have always liked shampoos that clarify your hair and this is one of the best ones I used, and it smelled great! Sort of lemony but also some floral tones and not at all overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this product it let my hair really shiny and clean feeling</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this shampoo from influenster and I love it. I like the smell and my hair looks better than normal after using the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo for free as a sample from Influenster! This shampoo is great! It smells good, and really cleans well. The detoxifying part of the shampoo really helped with my flakey scalp problems that I have on a daily basis. Now my hair is flake free. The shampoo also helped my greasiness that I get within the next day of washing. Except for with this shampoo I can go 2-3 days before my next wash because it works so well! Defiantly a bang for your buck!</li>
            <li> I recieved this product for free from influnser, and it did a good job. Very moisturizing and when you use the shampoo and conditioner as a set you hair comes out very shiny!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product to try for free and i didn&#x27;t fall in love with this shampoo like i thought i would. I usually reach for shampoos with less chemicals and definitely no sulfates, but this shampoo has both. It did smell very fresh and pleasant and lathered well-because of the sulfates. If the sulfates &amp; chemicals don&#x27;t bother you then this might suit your needs. My favorite product from this line was the intensive treatment.</li>
            <li> Hello I received this collection of products as a sample trial and I like to leave a review stating that I am in love with this collection as soon as I receive this product I noticed that it smelled amazing and I as I continue to use it I notice a difference in my scalp being more moist and less dry I highly recommend this product it is help me so much and I will continue to use this very happy that I got to try these products</li>
            <li> I received this Wild Naturals Detoxifying set for testing purposes and I love it. I love the Lemon basil with cassia flower sent. I feel like I am at a spa when I use it. The sent is so refreshing that it makes me feel relaxed. After a long day, I enjoy using this product so I can relax. I have hard water; however it leaves my hair feeling soft. I will be buying all three: the shampoo, conditioner and intensive treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shannon</li>
            <li> I received this as a free sample from Influenster to review and I have to say I love the Shampoo.  It has a clean fresh lemony scent that really wakes me up and it lathers nicely.  It makes my hair feel very clean and leaves it full of body and gives it lots of volume.  I will definitely continue to use this shampoo. Thank you Influenster!</li>
            <li> I received Wild Naturals complimentary to review! I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner combination! It smells amazing! After my hair is dry, it feels so much lighter and full of volume. I would really reccomed trying Wild Naturals to add an extra boost to your hair!</li>
            <li> I got this free in an Influenster box and, while I do like the scent, it doesn&#x27;t do anything special for my hair. The shampoo itself is very thick and gives a full lather. Lately, I&#x27;ve had problems with an itchy scalp and I was hoping maybe I&#x27;d notice an improvement after using this shampoo, but I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I received this Herbal Essences product, along with others, free to test and review via Influenster. Overall, I was extremely pleased with the set! I&#x27;ve used Herbal Essences products before and generally liked them, but I do think this is my favorite one. It really does deeply clean your hair, rinses out well, and creates a soft and clean finish. Plus, it smells fantastic. I used it in combination with the conditioner, which I was also highly pleased with. Great product, will be buying it in the future.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free to try and write a review. To start with I love most of the herbal essences products. So when I got this in the mail I was so excited to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo smells so good!! And it lathers up nicely. It makes my hair smells good and makes it so soft. I made my sister try also. And she loves it too!! I would purchase this later when I am done with sample.</li>
            <li> This smells absolutely amazing. Salon quality aroma for sure. It definitely cleaned my hair well and left it feeling incredibly soft. Unfortunately for me, I have thin, flat hair and I think this shampoo ways it down a smidge more than my hair normally is. Similar to how it is if I put in too much conditioner. For those of you with normal tresses though, I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is amazing. It&#x27;s lightand refreshing...reminds me of a day at the spa. Leave my hair feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li> Great smell and lather. No need to shampoo twice, even after a tough work out at the gym. Even went 2 days without washing my hair and it still lathered and felt clean. Love that the scent lingers throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to try this shampoo out for free! I used it in combination with the intensive treatment and conditioner. I loved the clean, citrusy smell of the products and felt it left my hair clean and soft and gave it lightweight feeling. Overall I am happy with the results from this product!</li>
            <li> Creates a nice cleansing foam without having to use excessive amounts of product. Hair felt clean and the scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> I received this as a test product ffrom influenster, I could not be more happy with this product. It smells wonderful, I mostly pick up on the ginger over the lemon and cassia. It left my hair feeling nice and clean and smelling great! I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting to detoxify their hair.</li>
            <li> I was sent a sample of this shampoo to try and review. At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like the scent. It wasn&#x27;t bad by any means, just different - a  lemony herbal type scent. However, the scent is much more subtle upon application and after use. I actually love the way this smells when using it as well as how my hair smells after! I have been trying the full Detoxifying line for several days and so far am pleased with the results. I have fine hair, and this shampoo gives my hair lots of volume without drying it out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not someone who washes my hair very frequently, but I would probably use this product again. I received a free sample from Influenster, and used this product along with the coordinating conditioner. I did like the fragrance, and it did the job of cleaning my hair well!</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product because the &amp;#34;naturals&amp;#34; name caught my attention.  It lived up to the herbal essences standard-- it was clean, fresh, and smelled nice.  I received this for a free trial to review through Vox Box and plan to use it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d a deluxe sample to try free from influenster in my VoxBox and I simply love the smell and the way it makes my hair feel so soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I will be adding this to my favorites list for hair products!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks influenster!</li>
            <li> I got a travel size supply of this from Influnester.com in the mail! it smells so great! the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t work the best with my hair type which is curly. other than that it is a great product and i would recommen!!</li>
            <li> I received the detoxifying shampoo and conditioner to try and, I must say, I was skeptical but I tried it. To my surprise I actually loved the products! I&#x27;m sort of a shampoo snob and usually buy my stuff, sulfate free from my salon. I usually go for the earthy stuff like Scruples or Aveda. This is the first drugstore brand shampoo that had that &amp;#34;Earthy&amp;#34; natural smell that I like. It made my hair feel very clean and soft. I like the conditioner because it was very lightweight and rinsed out easily. I will buy it in the future!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is in the packaging. I wish the shampoo and conditioner bottles looked distinguishly different from each other. I hate having to closely read labels in the shower.</li>
            <li> I love the Thai Lemon Basil smell.  It is very refreshing and uplifting, which I need in the morning!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was given three products (Detoxifying Shampoo, Conditioner &amp; Intensive Treatment) by Influenster to try &amp; write a review.  I actually enjoyed all three products.  I have baby, fine hair and have a hard time with a lot of hair products.  The Detoxifying products left my hair feeling smelling good, clean, soft without fly away hairs.  It also did not weigh my hair down, which many conditioners do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really has cleaned my scalp quite well! I have had no problems with dandruff or oily hair. I like this product most out of the detox line, as I feel it really cleans your hair and scalp with a nice herbal touch. I received a free bottle of this shampoo from influenster to review and test and so far I love it.</li>
            <li> I received a trial size sample of this shampoo. I like the fragrance, it isn&#x27;t overly floral or overly sweet. It was thick and did a good job of cleaning my hair without drying it out, which is important to someone like me who has natural hair. I only needed a small amount to shampoo my whole head. I shampoo my hair about once a month (otherwise I just co-wash), because I&#x27;m very concerned about shampoos stripping the natural oils from my hair, this was not a problem with this shampoo! I pretreated my hair with coconut oil the night before, which can sometimes require a repeat shampoo to remove completely, but it only took one wash with this new detoxifying shampoo to leave my hair clean and ready for conditioner.</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is awesome! It smells great, leaves my hair flawless, and the best part NO FRIZZ! I can go outside and not have to worry about my hair in the humid weather, like how awesome is that! This is the best product I&#x27;ve used and i cant stop feeling and touching my hair after i shower, it is that awesome! I totally recommend this product, don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
            <li> This product is great!  It made my thin find hair very soft and manageable. The smell was fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;I was sent this item for review</li>
            <li> I really like detoxifying shampoos because I have pretty oily hair and I like that really clean feeling. However, this wasn&#x27;t my favorite shampoo and I won&#x27;t be going out to get it. I think it left some residue in my hair the next day and didn&#x27;t make it feel that clean. Not a fan. Also, the scent reminds me of straight up lemons... no basil in here at all. Not something I&#x27;d usually go for, since I like the frutier scents. However, I do love the Herbal essence shampoo in the orange container. That&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: I also got this in an influenster box for review.</li>
            <li> I used the shampoo a few more times than the conditioner because my hair is really short and, let&#x27;s be honest, I don&#x27;t really care about conditioner.  That&#x27;s for women for the most part.  Having said that...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife&#x27;s comments:  &amp;#34;It sounds fancy with all the talk about cassia seeds and what-not.  I don&#x27;t really like the smell of basil, even if the shampoo only smells a little like it.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what it smells like.  The lemon part of it was pleasant.  My hair felt clean after using the shampoo, but it usually feels clean after using most brands.  I don&#x27;t know if there is a big difference, but it was OK.  It was also gentle - some shampoos make my scalp tingle.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There you have it from someone with a lot of curly hair.</li>
            <li> I received the Detoxifying set as a complimentary trial from Influenster. I have to say I was pretty happy with the results. It brought the shine back to my hair and the deep treatment helped to remove the last little bit of fry out of my hair from over use of flat irons and blow dryers. Gotta admit though, the price is a bit steep for a broke college student. So I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d ever actually pay for it unless walmart or somewhere runs a good sale!</li>
            <li> Love it! Smells amazing!!</li>
            <li> Loved getting to try this great product, the smell was great and the shampoo really lathered well for a small amount. Will most likely buy this product for myself!</li>
            <li> I was given the shampoo and conditioner to try.  It left my hair feeling like I had just left the salon. I&#x27;m always amazed at how clean my hair feels.  It&#x27;s easier to style and has a healthier appearance.</li>
            <li> HERBAL ESSENCES Wild Naturals Rejuvenating Shampoo and Detoxifying Conditioner works great. I washed my hair many times with this shampoo and it makes my hair feels clean and smells great but not as the original herbal essences products. It works great, cool my scalp and felt like a medicated shampoo at first but then you realize that it&#x27;s herbal essences because of the unique scent. Was not to excited about the scent however the outcome of my hair feeling soft, light and voluminous validated everything else.</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo to try in an influenster vox box.  I was excited to try it because I love Herbal Essence products.  The scent of this shampoo is wonderful.  I love the thick and rich lather and this shampoo leaves my hair feeling clean.  The only problem I have with this shampoo is that it made my very fine hair harder to style.  I would love to see it come in a volumizing version.  I would purchase this shampoo again as a monthly treatment in conjucnction with the conditioner.</li>
            <li> For it&#x27;s price range, this shampoo is pretty great. I received a sample of this to try and I really enjoyed it. the shampoo has a nice, clean lemony scent and does a good job of cleaning my hair. I love herbal essence scents and the naturals line is no different. I would definitely recommend this to friends and family!</li>
            <li> Did a great job getting my hair clean and smelled great too.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as part of the Influenster testing program. I enjoyed the shampoo quite a bit. The smell is refeshing- perfect for waking up. The shampoo itself gets a nice lather and truly cleans all of the build-up left behind by other products. Do not use it too frequently though, as it dries out the scalp and can leave dandruff if over used.</li>
            <li> So I tried this new line as part of a test market. I took the samples with me on vacation and I was pleasantly surprised. First the smell; the scent was clean and fruity but not overpoweringly so. It lathered up easily and left my hair feeling clean but not dried out. I followed up with the matching conditioner and was equally pleased. The conditioner left my hair feeling soft and cut way back on the tangles I had to manage afterwards. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I color my hair and need a sulfate free shampoo for long term use. Now if it came sulfate free it would be perfect.</li>
            <li> I got this product for reviewing purposes from Influenster.  I&#x27;m so glad I did because I wouldn&#x27;t normally try it myself.  I was amazed at how great of a product it is and how cheap it is!</li>
            <li> The new Wild Naturals work amazing and the smell is great also!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product from Influenster and would definitely recommend it to others. The shampoo has a nice scent that lasts throughout the whole day but isn&#x27;t overpowering. The shampoo left my hair feeling clean, healthy and fresh. Will definitely purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> This is an OK Product for the price, but it isn&#x27;t anything special.  It does the job of deep cleaning the hair, but if you are an &amp;#34;all natural&amp;#34; enthusiast, don&#x27;t let the name, HERBAL ESSENCES WILD NATURALS fool you.  This is mostly a chemical product with the first two ingredients being:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Sodium Laureth Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Sodium Laurel Sulfate&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The herbs and other nice things are a very distant afterthought.  This might not be an issue for a lot of people, because  truly NATURAL hair care products are usually pretty expensive, and for less than $6.00, this is OK for what it is.  It cleans the hair and removes residue from styling products to leave everything squeaky clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be aware that you get what you pay for, and this shampoo isn&#x27;t exactly what the name implies.  You might experience dry hair, damage and breakage with constant use, so I would advise using this once every week or 2 unless you have extremely good hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that since I live in a dry climate, products like this one are a bit drying to my hair and so I would use it sparingly.  My hair is waist length,  thin, fine and prone to damage so I have to be careful.  My daughter, on the other hand, has short, thick, heavy hair that stands up to continual dyeing, heat styling and all kinds of products and her hair never seems to suffer from the abuse.  And since she cuts it regularly, it is always pretty neat on the ends and harsh products don&#x27;t bother her.  So whether this will work for you is a matter of what kind of hair you have and how long you like to keep it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it isn&#x27;t really, truly &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;, and it always annoys me when I see a greenwashed product that isn&#x27;t exactly what it says.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;m not a big expert on shampoos, soaps, lotions, creams, etc., but I do know if I like a product or not. This shampoo has a wonderful smell, lathers nicely, leaves my hair looking good, or at least as good as it can look. Based on my purely subjective opinion, I recommend this shampoo highly.</li>
            <li> Whether it&#x27;s from switching shampoos or the ingredients in this shampoo, my hair has been behaving very well, feels better and doesn&#x27;t seem to get dirty as fast. This is a thick shampoo which lathers up very nicely, it doesn&#x27;t take much. The scent is citrus-y, but more in the light orange range than lemon in my opinion, like the artificial orange flavor that hard orange candies had when I was a kid.  It&#x27;s not bad, I don&#x27;t mind it much, but don&#x27;t expect an actual lemon basil scent. Other than patchouli, I have yet to experience a shampoo scent that matches up to what the bottle says, so this isn&#x27;t a surprise.  Otherwise, a very good shampoo for decent price.  Four stars.</li>
            <li> I love the way this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo smells.  The bottle describes the scent as &amp;#34;Thai lemon basil,&amp;#34; though I am not sure that is how I would describe it. It&#x27;s a fresh, vaguely citrusy, and extremely refreshing in the morning without being overpowering. Smell is something I really look for in a shampoo since it fills the shower and helps determine how I start my day. It is worth noting, however, that the fragrance does not linger after my shower, which I consider to be a good thing. Some smells, albeit pleasant smells, are best left behind in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the start I was less interested in the so-called &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; properties, though I ended up being pretty impressed. I have used this for three mornings now, and I can safely say that my hair is softer and feels cleaner in that a comb runs through it smoothly without any clumps or tangles. Whether this is the result of the Cassia seeds that our proudly touted on the bottle or simply the overall quality of this name-brand shampoo, I don&#x27;t know.  But I know I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not usually a picky person when it comes to a shampoo so long as it cleans my hair and smells pleasant. This Herbal Essences variety seems to really work well for me, though I should point out that I generally have healthy hair anyway and would not consider myself someone in need of detoxification. Still, if you are looking for a great-smelling shampoo that delivers on quality, this is a good one to try.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Herbal Essences products and this one is no exception.  It has a very nice, light scent.  It lathers up nice and rinses away easily.&lt;br /&gt;My hair is soft and manageable afterwards.  I like detoxifying products becuase every day i do use hair products and by the end of the week, my hair feels heavy and gunky.  This cleans your hair but gently.  It doesn&#x27;t strip it and make it dry and flyaway.  It does a very nice job of getting the gunk of the products out of the hair yet leaving it fresh, light and clean.  My hair feels fresh washed even 2 days after using this.</li>
            <li> When I purchase shampoo, I am looking for two main things, price and lack of too many unpronounceable chemicals. The Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo actually has less chemicals than the brand I have been using that is supposedly a healthy product purchased from the &amp;#34;health food store&amp;#34;. I had paid about twice as much for my healthy shampoo than the cost would be for the Herbal Essence ( this was a free test product in this case).The Herbal Essence contains some &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; ingredients just as my other shampoo contains and also roughly many of same chemicals as all other shampoos. The price and fewer chemicals would be the reason I will get The Herbal Essence next time.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t really comment on the quality of this shampoo when used with thick, long hair since I have neither. I also do not use conditioner since I don&#x27;t need it. Overall the Herbal Essence lathers well, gets my hair clean and doesn&#x27;t dry it out or have any other negative effects. I like it and the price is very good. The lemon scent smells natural, is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li> Every once in a while, you need to use a shampoo that removes the build-up of hair products and other conditioning shampoos, so I thought I would give this one a shot. The problem for me is that I have very dry, very thin hair and most of the &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; shampoos strip the life out of my hair (although they do remove the residues that build up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Herbal Essences seems to clean my hair without stripping the life out of it, so after using it for two weeks, I feel like I could keep on using it without destroying my hair. I really appreciate that because my hair is so delicate. I also love the light, lemon-basil smell. It is clean and refreshing without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I think this is a terrific choice for a shampoo to get all the past hair product residue out of your hair and leave it clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> This product does the job. It deeply cleans your hair and scalp. It has a nice fragrance while and after you wash your hair. One thing I enjoy is having nice clean and smell good hair!&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free to test and review.</li>
            <li> Like the smell. It is pleasant without being overpowering. My hair is straight, thin, and fine. The shampoo was part of a collection from Influenster that I was sent free to test and review. I used the whole collection with included shampoo, intensive treatment, and conditioner. Often with my hair texture I shy away from heavy conditioners and intensive treatments, but this collection left my hair soft, shiny, and full of body.&lt;br /&gt;My husband has thick, coarse, curly hair. He also used the products. I noticed less frizz with his hair. He did not seem to have as much body as mine, but then his hair is much shorter.&lt;br /&gt;The only con I had with these products is the labeling. The shampoo and conditioner come in similar bottles with the words shampoo and conditioner in small letters. I fixed this with a marker and wrote a big S and C on the correct bottles. Would have been nice if that would have been included with product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used so many Herbal Essences products over the years and have always like them.  I was surprised at how thick this shampoo is but that&#x27;s not meant to be negative at all.  It smells really nice.  My hair is short and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had enough time yet to determine if it&#x27;s made any difference from other shampoos I&#x27;ve used. It lathers nicely and rinses out cleanly.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to leave any buildup since I&#x27;ve used it which is a plus since short hair doesn&#x27;t need anything weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I should probably start off by saying that I have the oiliest hair in the world. Nonetheless, I used to like Herbal Essences&#x27; Drama Clean okay, as far as cheaper shampoos went. So I was really excited when the Wild Naturals line came out, especially since it had a detoxifying shampoo -- it&#x27;s surprisingly difficult to find shampoo for oily hair. I received a free trial from Influenster, and I really wanted to like it. At first, it made my hair look and feel pretty clean. However, that effect went away throughout the day, and my hair was left gaining its old oil back. I&#x27;m sure it would work better on someone whose hair isn&#x27;t quite as bad as mine, but either way, it didn&#x27;t do much for me.</li>
            <li> I received this for free as a trial but this truly is a great product with wonderful results. My hair always feels weighed down everyday from other products. So when I found out about this it really did change the feel and look of my hair. This product along with its 3 step system transforms hair to light weight hair... something my hair really needed. It looks healthier and cleaner. I recommend this to anyone who needs to take out all of the excess products in their hair.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free to test and review. I was anxious to give it a go since I enjoy herbal shampoos and conditioners. As it turns out I was sadly disappointed. The shampoo did a good job of cleaning my hair and rinsed out nicely. I enjoyed the lemony smell at first until I was overtaken by the basil. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I enjoy basil, mainly eating it, not shampooing my hair with it. The conditioner was ok as well. It did its job, but it was nothing spectacular. Next was the final step, the intensive conditioning treatment. This was the worst part. I did not leave it on my hair very long since I have fine texture hair I was afraid it was weigh it down as most intensive conditioners do on me. After I rinsed it out my shower turned into an oil slick. Be careful with this! As I was combing through my hair after towel drying my hair seemed very slippery. Yuk. After styling my hair it seemed like it had an odd residue on it. By midday my hair looked greasy and dull. No shine or bounce at all. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I received the products complimentary to test and review. I really enjoyed this product. The scent was nice and refreshing. It left my hear shiny and soft as well.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Shampoo complementary from influenster.com and I absolutely LOVE the scent of this shampoo!! It lathered up nicely and left my hair feeling clean and fresh! I would definitely recommend this product to EVERYONE!! I am so happy that I was one of the few lucky people who were chosen to test this product!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive herbal essences wild natural detoxifying shampoo for free to test.  The smell is amazing with that lemon grass scent.  All tho it didnt last as long as I would like it too.  I loved how thick and foamy it was when lathering through my hair.  After washing out my hair felt really soft even before brushing.  Even the next morning my hair still felt clean.  Which I love.&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m not really sure about the &amp;#34;detoxifying&amp;#34; or purifies my hair.  I think thats a great way to sell products but I dont really know if it did that to my hair or not.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I just tried the herbal essence natural wild shampoo this week as a sample/tester from Influenster and I am in love! Not only does it perfume your shower with this amazing scent, but your hair feels soft and healthy all day! There isn&#x27;t a huge lather but it is enough to make your hair feel very clean and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too soft that you can&#x27;t style it but it does make it look smooth and voluminous. It is a perfect every day wash. It is the perfect recipe for great a great hair day!</li>
            <li> I got this product free to test and review and I am very pleased! This shampoo smells great and leaves my hair super soft and manageable! I&#x27;m not quite sure how it detoxifies, but it did leave my hair silky smooth and easy to brush after I used it. Overall, I am very pleased with this product and would buy it and recommend it to someone who was looking for a good smelling shampoo that isn&#x27;t too pricey.</li>
            <li> Got the voxbox of Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying collection for free for my review. The shampoo smelled like mint, which for me I like. The conditioner was a little runny but after using the treatment conditioner my hair dried so soft and fluffy. I also used the set of the on my 7 year old son, his hair is long and needs the extra conditioning because it gets knotted up bad, his hair dried to a non tangled softness! The reason I have 4 stars out of 5 is because the conditioner was runny and had to use a little more because it didn&#x27;t apply to wet hair very well.</li>
            <li> I got this product free to review at Influenster.and I have to say I love this product made my hair feel n look healthy and shiny and the smell of this product was amazing</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the 3 herbal essences products. I received them in a free trial from influenster. I used them all in the shower and my hair came out smelling amazing and feeling healthy. The products made it easier to detangle my wet hair out of the shower also. Now that it&#x27;s dry, the hair feels soft and bouncy. These products leave a strong musky citrus smell. I recommend this product to anyone who wants their hair repaired, especially dry hair, like mine.</li>
            <li> It was amazing to try this product it makes you hair beatiful and smooth it makes it look like new hair I love it</li>
            <li> I am very thrilled about the clean sensation of this product,I got this product for free testing for free!, well,  I usually wash my hair twice a week since my hair tends to get dry on the edges and oily on the roots, Basil works great with  that issue , I felt that the hair feel evens up, however, I used plenty of conditioner on the edges to stop dryness. I like the shine results after my hair gets dry, and I didn&#x27;t have any frizz at all after using my curling Iron. I would like they have more good things to come and something more specific for every type of hair, I&#x27;m sure straight hair might have different results from thin or curly hair like mine. I adore the smell, it is like using artisan soap on your hair, and It can&#x27;t beat the price for that feeling and good comments from your close friends!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I have tried quite a few different brands for hair care and really am not loyal to any one particularly so when I was sent a free sample to try and review I was excited. I really enjoyed the scent (I know everyone says that) but it really is rich and lasting. My hair felt great while using the product and also once my hair dried. Most products that say detoxifying or rejuvenating either make my hair oily or dry but my hair felt great with this product. I hope this is helpful.</li>
            <li> I loved Wilde Naturals Detoxifying shampoo and conditioner from Herbal essences! I shampoo and condition my hair almost everyday and it made my hair feel very soft and clean. Even better it smelled very good. The intensive conditioning spray/oil elixir I also highly recommend. You just need to use the conditioning spray on damp hair. I got the product free to test and review.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this stuff! It makes my hair smell so good and clean, the Turkish fig with cassia and the wild smells devine . Also it makes my hair incredibly soft i love having soft hair, my mom also thought it was great  definitely will keep using this more i recommend other people using this product!</li>
            <li> I recieved a sample of this product from VOXBOX for a review and like all Herbal Essence products this smells wonderful !!!! I personally have curly/wavy (WILD) hair and this tames it more than thee occasional shampoo/conditioner</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo complementary from influenster to review. It is amazing , my color treated hair was brittle, fuzzy and breaking off. The very first use of this shampoo, conditioner and intense treatment left my hair was soft and manageable, I would recommend to anyone with damaged hair!!!</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo after a night out, it really strips all of the product and junk out of your hair! My hair feels really clean after using this product. I personally only plan to use it after heavy product use in my hair or once a week, I&#x27;m not sure if my hair could withstand normal use of this.&lt;br /&gt;*i received this product free for testing purposes*</li>
            <li> I received this shampoo as a free sample to test, I actually really liked it, it smelled great if you like really herbal citrus scents.  I like it so it worked for me.  I have very oily fine hair and it did a great job getting it clean but it didn&#x27;t cause rebound oiliness.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the way your hands feel when you wash it off, it was just really weird, not sticky, just weird.  It also took a lot more shampoo per application than others I&#x27;ve tried.  I would buy this.</li>
            <li> I recieved this complimentary from the Influenster team and I must say that it Smells amazing and the product works wonderfully!</li>
            <li> Product smells great and lathers well</li>
            <li> Received the shampoo and conditioner in the mail from influenster.com as a sample I loved how it smelled and I liked that it rinsed easy but I hated how it made my hair feel after I was done washing It felt dry and grainy if that makes any sense!</li>
            <li> Smells great and gets my hear really clean without feeling stripped. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I received a complimentary package from Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying shampoo/conditioner and I loved it.  I have never used the Herbal Essences products before and I found them to be extremely good.  I love the fresh lemon smell it left behind and my hair is shiny and bouncy!  I will definitely use these products again.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it makes me hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Loved the fresh scent and the detoxifying naturals! Great job Herbal Essences.</li>
            <li> Got these products to try for free and I&#x27;m in love!  My hair feels and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I recieved the sample from influencer and Loved it!!!</li>
            <li> I love herbal essences it smelled so good and keeps my hair so soft too. I got mines thanks too #influenstervox</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE the scent of this shampoo.  It smells fresh and crisp, but isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It leaves my hair feeling nice and clean, without feeling stripped and doesn&#x27;t dry out my hair.  I have very thin, fine, and oily hair, and this hasn&#x27;t created a problem with any of my hair concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary as a set in order to rate and review. I am glad I got this because I will definitely be purchasing again in the future!</li>
            <li> Loved it smelled great and very clean feel!</li>
            <li> I actually like it better than I thought I would. I personally don&#x27;t like the scent, and I do find myself choosing shampoos that have a nice scent that&#x27;s on sale. I&#x27;m more into spa scents, but this one has an artificial smell to it. It doesn&#x27;t smell of quality is what I mean. Otherwise, I will still keep using this as I received it free to review. I like it better than the conditioner that it comes with.</li>
            <li> It left my hair feeling wonderfully clean.I love the scent. I will definitely use this product again.</li>
            <li> I received this for free from Influenster in exchange for a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the way this stuff smells! It lathers up great and kind of &amp;#34;tingles&amp;#34; on my scalp in a way I really like. My only complaint about it is I don&#x27;t think the smell lasts as long as it should. I remember the Herbal Essences from my youth leaving my hair smelling like flowers for a whole day!</li>
            <li> Its a gel shampoo not a creamy shampoo which i perfer. I use alot of products on my hair and i definetly felt like this stripped all the residue off of it. Left a good shine and smells amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Shampoo, which is a product I received free to test and review, for a few weeks and it has made my hair feel as clean as it can be! The shampoo feels thick and smells delicious!! It&#x27;s very easy to rinse out too. I don&#x27;t regret testing this product. In fact, I&#x27;m glad because now I finally have discovered a shampoo that works for me. I believe it is a great product to use and I highly recommend it if you want your hair to feel very soft, smooth, clean, and luscious!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo I love it. Must buy I recommend to everyone</li>
            <li> I got this product as a free sample to review from influenster. I have used it a few times and really like the shampoo. It lathers and washes away very easily. It leaves my hair feeling clean. The smell is not my favorite but it is tolerable!!</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a VoxBox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine curly hair. I liked the way this made my hair feel without making it frizzy after it dries. Would purchase again!</li>
            <li> I receved a complimentary shampoo through voxbox. I loved it. Great shampoo, and the smell is awesome!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo.  I love it!  Not only does it smell awesome, it leaves my hair smooth and manageable.  I will definitely be buying it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received my free Influenster VoxBox in the mail with this product! It worked wonders and the end product was incredibly nurished hair! Instead of limp and freyed ends, my hair looked fuller and bouncy! The scent is amazing as well. My boyfriend even asked me to keep using this shampoo because he loved the smell! I will definitely be purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo, conditioner, and intense conditioning treatment thru Influenster. I absolutely love the products! Initially, I was concerned about using the products because I have color-treated hair. However, my concerns were unfounded. The products did not affect my color. In fact, my hair looks better than it has for quite some time-shiny ,silky, and full of volume! The volume had been another concern of mine. I had previously been using volume infusing products. I was satisfied with the results. These products, however, left my hair with more volume than the previous products I was using. In addition, the smell is wonderful!  I will definitely be buying these products in the future.</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo - I received it as a trial product through influenster.  The main thing is that it did not make me break out.  I have sensitive skin and am always worried new products will cause breakouts and this did not. I will definitely be adding this to my haircare regimen!!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this shampoo for review, and I was certainly glad I did. I color my hair, and also shampoo and blow dry every day, so my hair is not always in the best shape. Herbal Essences has proved to be a refreshing break from the harshness I sometimes put my hair through. Oh, and the smell is wonderful! I think I will be using this on a regular basis now.</li>
            <li> Love, love the shampoo! It smells fresh and not like perfume, and cleans my hair just the way I need it to. I received a complimentary sample to try and I&#x27;ll definately be buying it!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of Herbal Essences Wild Natural Detoxifying shampoo. When I tried it I thought it might be like other shampoos. I was right but there was a difference. I have oily hair and this shampoo was good for my type of hair. The scent was light and refreshing and reminded me of the times I have gone to get my hair cut and they wash my hair in the salon sinks. When you lay back the fragrance of the shampoos they use always refreshes you (and make you want to buy their product) and this gave me the same sensation. I had never even heard of Cassia seeds before I tried this so it was good to learn what their purpose is in a shampoo. I&#x27;m all for a more natural product that is gentle for my hair and helps to detox all of the nasties out of it.</li>
            <li> very clean and smells great, received complimentary</li>
            <li> I received this product complimentary for testing purposes only. Definitely a quality shampoo! I think the product smells amazing! The scent is long lasting and the shampoo made my scalp feel super clean. I also really like that it made my curls super defined and shiny. Usually shampoos for curly hair make my scalp feel super greasy and my curls always look flat after but this did the exact opposite! I used it partnered with the conditioner and it is the first time I’ve used Herbal Essences products for naturals. I love how it made my hair so soft as well! The collection is available in most retail stores and I would definitely suggest purchasing the entire collection! I used the oil elixir the next morning and a couple drops did an awesome job of rejuvenating my curls for the rest of the day! It definitely met my expectations for a great collection that does a really good job of making my curls look refreshed, clean and defined! Would definitely suggest these products to another curly headed friend!</li>
            <li> It Wasn&#x27;t horrible the shampoo just made my hair feel very dry until I used the conditioner and treatment</li>
            <li> I got this product complimentary from Influenster and I love it! It makes my hair feel so soft and rejuvenated and the lemon smell makes it feel so clean and fresh!</li>
            <li> I was sent this product to try and sample. I have used this for 3 days now and I can not say that it has done anything different then any other shampoo. Yes it cleans, and yes, it smells very nice. When I first put the product in my hair I was very pleased with the scent and it does last a while in my hair( I can smell it throughout the day). I&#x27;m a little &amp;#34;iffy&amp;#34; on the marketing. It&#x27;s almost as if they try to make it seem that this is more of a natural product when you can clearly read the ingredients and see that it is not. It&#x27;s just OK nothing special other than the pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing and after using it my hair feels so much better</li>
            <li> Received my complimentary box of herbal essences wild natural shampoo, conditioner and deep conditioner to try.  Love it, they smell great.  Fresh, clean scent that wakes me up in the morning, it also gives my thin, flat hair body and shine.  I&#x27;ve been looking for it in the store but no one carries it yet unfortunately.</li>
            <li> It smelled so good and left my hair feeling so clean. I will definitely purchase this item again, as I received a sample in a Vox Box.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair.  I tried this product (shampoo, conditioner and rinse out treatment). I usually use volume building shampoos and conditioners.  After using this product just once my hair feels clean and full of life.  I am very happy that I tried it  instead of trying another volume building shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the clean smell that this product has. It cleans hair well and does not leave hair tangled. When using the shampoo I could almost feel my scalp tingling for a deep clean of my hair! l love the product and will definitely buy it in the store.</li>
            <li> I received these products as a free trial through Influenster. I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo, conditioner, and the intensive treatment. I love the way they smell, it&#x27;s a very pleasant citrusy scent. I&#x27;m not sure if they leave my hair any cleaner or softer than my normal shampoo, but they definitely smell better.  I will definitely continue using my samples and will strongly consider purchasing them from the story when I run out.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I normally have extremely frizzy hair and am very cautious about the types of products I use and this product is perfect for frizzy and dry hair. Also, I noticed after two washes that my hair was softer. The ingredients left my hair smelling good and I felt that the ingredients were not harsh on my hair. My hair is also colored so that was an added benefit.</li>
            <li> I rec&#x27;d the complete set of these as part of my last Vox Box. So far, I&#x27;m really enjoying them. To me, they have a nice citrus scent - almost grapefruit. Its very energizing. I have very dry, straight hair and these made them feel soft - especially the dry oil spray. The only reason I am giving this line 4 stars instead of 5 is b/c I thought the conditioner could have been a little thicker/creamer. I felt like you NEEDED (or at least I needed) the dry oil to supplement the conditioner. I&#x27;d buy these, though.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this shampoo, conditioner and Intense treatment in my VoxBox.  I have fine color treated (highlights, lowlights, color) with violet haircolor.  I was a little concerned about trying it because I am a second day hair girl who wants to keep her color vibrant as long as possible.  As soon as I opened the package the wonderful scent hit me.  Very nice lemony smell. I used all three products and was pleasantly surprised that it did not dry my hair out and my color looked even better.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t like it.It makes my hair feel like straw and it is nasty feeling.</li>
            <li> I was sent a bottle of this shampoo for free to test out, and I loved it! It smells great and the scent stays in my hair which is even better ;) who doesn&#x27;t like receiving compliments about their hair smelling good? It also left my hair soft and manageable (:</li>
            <li> This product line surprised me. I received it as a free product to test, and I have to admit I was less than thrilled to see it was Herbal Essences. I haven&#x27;t liked the brand in the past so I waited to try it. Finally took it for a spin, and I have to say I love the smell and the deep conditioner left my hair silky soft! Thankfully the Herbal Essences people have come a long way since I last used their products.</li>
            <li> Love the summery scent of this new shampoo and conditioner. They are light and lefty hair feeling really clean. My hair was soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I was pretty excited when I learned I would receive this product as well as the conditioner and intensive treatment conditioner in my very first vox box! I couldn&#x27;t wait to try out the intensive treatment conditioner since my hair is color treated and very brittle. I have been testing these products for about a week and a half now and I must say, I love them. I use all three product one after another and they leave my hair feeling squeaky clean and very smooth. They also make flat ironing my hair so much simpler because I do not have near as many fly aways/frizzies. I feel like this product is definitely a great deal for the price!</li>
            <li> Influenster sent me a sample pack containing this product for free to test and review. Since I&#x27;m always looking for products to increase the shine in my hair, I was pretty excited to try it! After the first use, I noticed that my hair seemed soft and shinier than usual. I loved this product and plan to continue using it.</li>
            <li> I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review completely free.  I loved the way it made my hair feel. I have naturally straight hair after using this product no frizz, or anything. Def would recommend an will be buying again!</li>
            <li> Smells great! I like to use this shampoo and conditioner to remove buildup from other products I use. I use a couple of times per week.</li>
            <li> Recieved a free sample and LOVED it. The product smells great and it left my hair very soft!</li>
            <li> I love this product. I was asked to review it for Influenster, and was thrilled to receive it. The shampoo smells wonderful, and it lasts all day. I will be purchasing this product and working it into my routine.</li>
            <li> The shampoo, conditioner &amp; intensive treatment altogether leaves my hair feeling clean &amp; refreshed, with a fresh lemony scent. The shampoo lathers good to clean my hair and freshen it. The conditioner, however is a bit watery. It does make my hair feel soft &amp; smooth, though. But the intensive treatment is definitely needed to make me feel like I&#x27;m really conditioning my hair. I would not use the first two products without it. I received these products for free from Influenster to test and review.</li>
            <li> Happily, I received the Herbal Essences Wild Naturals Detoxifying Collection complimentary. I am very happy with the results.  The shampoo is a nice consistency and cleans well. The conditioners leave my grey hair soft and smooth. The smell us a nice bonus too.</li>
            <li> So i recived this product for reviewing purposes from influenster and i gotta say this shampoo and conditioner left my hair really silky smooth i love the fragrance it has a lemon citrus smell leaves my hair smelling so wonderful also my hair doesnt tangle at all i loved it my hair isntas frizzy as before know ihave to buy the big bottles</li>
            <li> To begin, I was lucky enough to receive a sample of this product to test and review for FREE from Influenster, in a Vox Box. I also received the conditioner and smoothing serum that goes along with this line to complete the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me, I have long (mid-back length) hair, that is dyed blonde. My hair is not thin, but it is fine, if that makes sense. Anyway, I used this shampoo for about three weeks, once every other day (so, every 2 days), and was not thrilled with the overall results. Personally, for me and my fine, color treated hair, I found the shampoo to be a bit harsh as it did its job a little too well. Usually, shampoos that cleanse or strip away excess oils really well tend to leave my hair drier than I&#x27;d like, and that&#x27;s what happened with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would however absolutely recommend this product to men and women who have coarse, thick or virgin hair, as I feel it would be beneficial and useful to them. The scent of the shampoo was also pleasant, and my fiancé did compliment me on how nice my hair smelled.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo as a trial and I really liked it. Using the three  together really work. I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> Does a very good job cleaning and getting the impurities out of my hair!</li>
            <li> I received all three products in this Herbal Essences Wild Naturals system free in order to test and review them. These products worked well and did the job; however, I have thin hair. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend these products for customers who have thin hair because it made it feel heavy and my hair laid fairly flatter than what is typical. Nothing in my routine changed except for the different hair products that I received. Nonetheless, I have confidence that this product works well, as most Herbal Essences products do, with the exception for those who have thin hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It made my hair so soft and light feeling! While giving it a clean shiny look. The smell is very fresh and clean! Love the way it made my hair feel. I have very thick full hair and sometimes product can leave residue, but not this! Love love!!</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo in a Vox Box from Influenster to test and review. I cannot speak to the effect of this shampoo on coarse or curly hair, but for my hair, which is fine and straight, it works very well. My hair is soft, shiny, and voluminous all day. I typically have a hard time keeping volume, but this shampoo has made a big difference. It also smells delicious! It&#x27;s not purfume-y or overly floral, just fresh. I absolutely love it- I bought the full size shampoo even before my tester ran out!</li>
            <li> The smell of this shampoo is amazing. I&#x27;ve tried shampoos where it would dry out my hair when I use it but this does not do that so I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> This really did illuminate my hair, but it also made it really shiny! It was sent to me in a Voxbox, and I am REALLY happy they sent it! I am almost completely finished with it, I love it!</li>
            <li> I really tried to like this product. I tried using it alone, with just the conditioner, with just the intensive treatment, and also with both the conditioner as well as a drop of the intensive treatment. Used alone my hair was like straw and so dry I could not even comb it. Used with either or both of the conditioners my hair always turned out so dull and oily that within a few hours I had to reshampoo with another product. The product did at least smell great in the bottle and also while shampooing, but then the scent quickly faded.</li>
            <li> As a salon manager I&#x27;m constantly trying different, high-end shampoos. This Herbal Essences Wild Naturals shampoo was a wonderful surprise. The scent was refreshing and crisp. My hair smelt incredible. The detoxifying qualities of this shampoo was impressive and definitely on the same level as the expensive salon products. Herbal Essences Wild Naturals detoxifying shampoo left my hair feeling thoroughly clean and naturally nourished. I got the chance to follow it up with the mask and conditioner from the same line, I would highly suggest you do the same! I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but I would definitely purchase them on my own in the future!!</li>
            <li> I got this in my #VoxBox along with the set from  #influenster. This was okay left my hair dry so im not a big fan of it but thanks @influenster</li>
            <li> My family liked this shampoo. It cleaned our hair. It left our scalps fresh and the shampoo smells nice. There was a good lather and it rinsed away cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am unsure how to determine whether or not my hair is &amp;#34;detoxified.&amp;#34; I also am not sure that the shampoo can &amp;#34;Unleash the Pure You&amp;#34; as stated on the label. But it did smell nice and I did merge from the shower clean and happy. So, maybe?</li>
            <li> I like this new line of shampoos and conditioners by Herbal Essences. I tend to use a variety of hair products; so this is a nice one to add to the collection. It&#x27;s a thick shampoo, which is better than the runny kind that pours out of the bottle. It lathered well and smelled mostly of lemons. (not basil) It made my hair shiny, but overall it wasn&#x27;t anything spectacular or new. The scent is refreshing.</li>
            <li> This shampoo does a nice job of gently cleansing my hair, with a mild, lemony fragrance and a very surprisingly rich lather.  After using it, my hair is full and soft, and has a nice luster.</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo. It leaves my hair feeling clean and smooth. In my opinion it has a pretty heavy citrus smell while using it, but it doesnt leave a scent that lasts afterwards. It works up a nice lather without requiring too much shampoo. If citrus is a favorite scent in your household i would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> I  got the product free to test and review.*&lt;br /&gt;I got this and instantly fell for the smell, its wonderful. It lathers nice and rinses clean. I enjoyed the softness of it and ,again, enjoyed the smell. Ill continue to use this. Itreally does clean well</li>
            <li> I received these products complimentary for testing purposes, and honestly they are great! The conditioner was a bit runny for my liking but other than that it worked nicely. The intensive cream is by far my favorite, felt like  it brought my fine hair back to life! The smell is very crisp and clean &amp; the products really do make your hair feel nice.</li>
            <li> This product smelled amazing and left my hair feeling very clean and smooth!</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo and conditioner and the detox cream free to review and test. I love it! The scent was a bit overbearing at first but I loved it once I applied it. I shampooed and conditioned my hair and then went back and shampooed and conditioned my scalp. I also went back over my hair before I got out with the detox cream. This shampoo and conditioner is very thick so doesn&#x27;t take muxh. The cream just takes a slight drop. My hair was so soft after it dried and still is to this moment!</li>
            <li> I received this new product on behalf of influenster to review! I have naturally straight hair and it was a very nice shampoo that left my hair feeling very clean and smelling great!</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of this product to test. I was surprised with how much I like this shampoo. I used it in conjunction with the conditioner and intensive conditioning treatment and my hair came out soft and shiny. And the smell is nice, too!</li>
            <li> I liked the end result.  I even felt I had more volume but the only think I didn&#x27;t like was the smell...</li>
            <li> This shampoo has a nice floral, citrus scent that isn’t overpowering. It cleaned my hair very well. It was a clear, thicker formula that foamed up well. My hair wasn’t dry or covered in a film afterwards. It did seem to “detox” my hair and left it refreshed and cleansed. I used this product for a few days and will definitely be purchasing in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I was given a complimentary sample to test and review. **</li>
            <li> Love the way my hair looks and feels. Definitely has improved the looks and health of my hair.</li>
            <li> I received this to try out and I really liked it. It made my hair really soft and there were very little fly aways. It has a nice smell as well.</li>
            <li> When I learned that I was going to get the shampoo, conditioner, and intensive treatment in my first voxbox, I was very excited. Herbal Essences is a brand I trust and have been using for many years and I was going to be able to try out one of their newest products. After using these products for a few days, I can say that I do, in fact love them. My hair was smooth and less frizzy than normal and felt very clean. My biggest concern lately has been regarding my hair being extremely frizzy all the time. This shampoo did wonders in resolving that. My hair also feels softer and smoother than normal, which is wonderful for me.</li>
            <li> Got my hair very clean</li>
            <li> I received the complimentary herbal essence rejuvenating shampoo, conditioner, and oil from influenster to review! I used it for 2 weeks to see how it changed my hair. It was okay, but I noticed that my hair was getting greasy very quickly. The oil is not sticky or too greasy when I apply it in my hair, and it is noticeably softer the next morning. The shampoo and conditioner package is okay, but I don&#x27;t like how it made my hair smell - it smells too much like chemicals for me.</li>
            <li> I received this complimentary product via Influenster for testing purposes and the first thing I noticed was the smell. It has a delightfully fresh lemon scent. It lathers well and it really seemed to make a difference with my hair. I had been using another Herbal Essences product for a while and the switch to this one really seemed to make a difference. My hair seemed lighter, and not as &amp;#34;weighed down&amp;#34; as it had felt before I used this product. I waited a while to do my review so I could see how the product performed over time, and I have to say that the longer I use it, the better my hair looks and feels. I imagine a &amp;#34;detoxification&amp;#34; would take more than one wash, so perhaps that process explains my results, but no matter, the shampoo smells and works amazing and I would definitely purchase this for continued use.</li>
