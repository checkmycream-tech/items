            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect this to work or look really great on me.  </li>
            <li>I would like to say that this eyeliner works almost as good as Stila</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t know how good it was</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
            <li>THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.</li>
            <li>very good and soft and good quality</li>
            <li>Very easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Very precise pen, but it smear</li>
            <li>I love this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li>OUTSTANDING precision and ultimately the best makeup tool for eyeliner.</li>
            <li>All day eyeliners (w/c is my favorite eyeliner brand, by the way) and is priced...</li>
            <li>Pretty good eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It works and it arrived when it was supposed to, but the tip gets clogged up easily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to use make up remover wipes to clean it....</li>
            <li>its so easy to use</li>
            <li>It dries out quickly.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s totally worth</li>
            <li>Good quality, arrived before expected.</li>
            <li>Funny story, when I was looking for it, I kind of missed it for a second because it looked like a pen.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>Very much like liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li>it works pretty well although it seems like it may run out at some points</li>
            <li>Lashes are amazing just apply shape to my eye cut the ends blend a little with eye makeup and done</li>
            <li>Well, it glides on smooth and stayed for a fairly long time.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering a few more.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I am not saying that I&#x27;m officially changing brands but from now on, I will use this cheapie instead for everyday wear and use my Stila on night outs and special occasions only.</li>
            <li>and I was just so surprised that it actually worked.</li>
            <li>Not waterproof and smugges easily not even black more like gray.</li>

            <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;It shipped very fast. Great price. Exceeded my expectations. I will be ordering a few more.</li>
            <li> Disappointed as it&#x27;s not waterproof and dried ink.</li>
            <li> Not water proof but i like it</li>
            <li> Pretty good eyeliner. Works well and doesn&#x27;t run. Perfect for daily use.</li>
            <li> It works and it arrived when it was supposed to, but the tip gets clogged up easily. I&#x27;ve been able to use make up remover wipes to clean it.... It just such a waste of a wipe. Probably won&#x27;t be getting this again.</li>
            <li> Very easy to put on. Very much like liquid eyeliner</li>
            <li> it works pretty well although it seems like it may run out at some points but it doesn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I have an issue getting it to apply and it cracks and chips throughout the day.</li>
            <li> THIS IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. it&#x27;s totally worth the price and it doesn&#x27;t smear or run off at all. OUTSTANDING precision and ultimately the best makeup tool for eyeliner. its so easy to use it&#x27;s almost unbelievable</li>
            <li> Long lasting takes a while to arrive but as expected.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t like the Dragon Story</li>
            <li> WOW! For the price? I didn&#x27;t expect this to work or look really great on me.  I bought this on a whim because of the price and because I ordered some other big stuff from China. I still tried it when it arrived and I was just so surprised that it actually worked. Funny story, when I was looking for it, I kind of missed it for a second because it looked like a pen. Well, it glides on smooth and stayed for a fairly long time. It doesn&#x27;t smear. I should&#x27;ve ordered more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s seams to be dried out, don&#x27;t like it at all</li>
            <li> I would like to say that this eyeliner works almost as good as Stila All day eyeliners (w/c is my favorite eyeliner brand, by the way) and is priced...gosh. I&#x27;m not good in Math. Let&#x27;s just say that with the price of Stila All Day, you can buy 10 of this. I am not saying that I&#x27;m officially changing brands but from now on, I will use this cheapie instead for everyday wear and use my Stila on night outs and special occasions only. Know those &amp;#34;Splurge vs. Save&amp;#34; magazine articles? This is my &amp;#34;save&amp;#34; counterpart of Stila All Day.</li>
            <li> Dried out so don&#x27;t know how good it was</li>
            <li> Very precise pen, but it smear</li>
            <li> Lashes are amazing just apply shape to my eye cut the ends blend a little with eye makeup and done</li>
            <li> Not waterproof and smugges easily not even black more like gray. I only got it thinking it was waterproof like the name says.</li>
            <li> dry not worth the trouble</li>
            <li> Not great, it stops working while im trying to do my makeup. It dries out quickly.</li>
            <li> Good quality, arrived before expected.</li>
            <li> very good and soft and good quality</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this this .. period.&lt;br /&gt;-ðŸ‘Ž</li>
