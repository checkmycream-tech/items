    <ol>
            <li>I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li>They could be great, but I wouldn&#x27;t know......</li>
            <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean teeth &#x3D; happy dad.</li>
            <li>Great accessories for use with the water-flosser.</li>
            <li>Great tools to help your teeth and gums.</li>
            <li>great product, recommend this item</li>
            <li>the parts fit perfect</li>
            <li>and they have been put to good use already.</li>
            <li>We thought when we ordered the Sonic All-in-one Water Jet System it would be a good idea to have some spares and these were a good price.</li>
            <li>These fit the device perfectly and don&#x27;t leak.</li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Fit my Interplak waterjet perfectly.</li>
            <li>I purchased these two for my daughters, I have the Interplak for myself and needed the attachments for them, they are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Great better than floss</li>
            <li>The System cleans my teeth beyond belief and generally, I am pretty happy but the Vibrating Tooth Brush Attachment needs to be more robust.</li>
            <li>and I hope I will always be able to get more replacements when I need them.</li>
            <li>SOOOO glad we got this ....</li>
            <li>Love this product my teeth feel so clean</li>
            <li>All replacement parts work just fine</li>
            <li>Really like being able to adjust&lt;br /&gt;water flow !</li>
            <li>It does a great job along with your regular flossing...</li>
            <li>Quick and easy installation for water pik</li>
            <li>thanks:)</li>
            <li>Received quickly.</li>
            <li>I have an older water pik and they fit just fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t throw the whole system in the garbage is that it does a pretty good job cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I mostly use only one of them though.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what it they advertised.</li>
            <li>Was exactly what was posted</li>
            <li>My teeth are much cleaner now that I have the Waterpik with the vibrating brush and adjustable jet.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>they are the same as the original product that came with the water jet.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t have used the replacement brush more then a dozen times, when last night it suddenly fell apart while I was brushing with it.  </li>
            <li>New, packed well, just as described.</li>
            <li>At the first of the year I purchased a couple of the Interplak All-in-one Water Jet System and the Five Pack SWJ1 extra Attachments.</li>
            <li>have is I needed to replace the brushes and you have to buy the complete set.</li>
            <li>If you look closely,you will notice a fine seam at the small end of the taper, which means this design uses a two piece fusion process at the time of the manufacturing.</li>
            <li>My mouth was full of little bristles, plastic bits, and tiny squares of gold plastic or metal.  </li>
            <li>I was curious as to why, so I took a very close look at the design</li>

            <li> I purchased these two for my daughters, I have the Interplak for myself and needed the attachments for them, they are very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> the parts fit perfect and I hope I will always be able to get more replacements when I need them.</li>
            <li> The appliance was not compatible with Australian power source so I did not get to use it or these tips.  They could be great, but I wouldn&#x27;t know......</li>
            <li> The only place we could find these replacement attachments.  Thankful for that and they have been put to good use already.</li>
            <li> What can I say, they are O.E.M. attachments with the look and feel of the originals that came with our machine. We thought when we ordered the Sonic All-in-one Water Jet System it would be a good idea to have some spares and these were a good price.</li>
            <li> I bought this replacement kit for my dental water jet. I have not experienced any problems with it and will purchase again if necessary.</li>
            <li> My teeth are much cleaner now that I have the Waterpik with the vibrating brush and adjustable jet.</li>
            <li> Quick and easy installation for water pik</li>
            <li> SOOOO glad we got this .... It does a great job along with your regular flossing... Really like being able to adjust&lt;br /&gt;water flow !</li>
            <li> Great better than floss</li>
            <li> All replacement parts work just fine they are the same as the original product that came with the water jet.</li>
            <li> it fits and works as intended</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t have used the replacement brush more then a dozen times, when last night it suddenly fell apart while I was brushing with it.  I mean disintegrated.  My mouth was full of little bristles, plastic bits, and tiny squares of gold plastic or metal.  What&#x27;s left on the stem is jagged remainders.  I&#x27;m trying to decide whether to risk the other one in the package.</li>
            <li> Just as described...thanks:)</li>
            <li> Love this product my teeth feel so clean just like I&#x27;ve been to the dental hygienist.</li>
            <li> U have to get US to it</li>
            <li> My kid loves her water jet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says it gets the gunk out of her braces nicely&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean teeth &#x3D; happy dad.</li>
            <li> These fit the device perfectly and don&#x27;t leak. I mostly use only one of them though.</li>
            <li> At the first of the year I purchased a couple of the Interplak All-in-one Water Jet System and the Five Pack SWJ1 extra Attachments. The System cleans my teeth beyond belief and generally, I am pretty happy but the Vibrating Tooth Brush Attachment needs to be more robust. I have had several of them Break Off in My Mouth while Brushing my Teeth. They Break off at the Small end of the Taper, just below the Brush Bristles.&lt;br /&gt;  I hope the manufacture reads this and takes action to Beef Up the Tooth Brush Attachment, at the Small end of the Taper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an update to the posting review I did in 2012. I continue to purchase the Conair Interplak Dental Water Jet Tips and the Tooth Brush continues to break off at the small end of the taper. I was curious as to why, so I took a very close look at the design and I now see the the reason for the failures. If you look closely,you will notice a fine seam at the small end of the taper, which means this design uses a two piece fusion process at the time of the manufacturing. Until Conair designs the brush with a one piece process, the problem will continue.&lt;br /&gt;No other attachments supplied in this kit have any problems.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I don&#x27;t throw the whole system in the garbage is that it does a pretty good job cleaning my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that Conair supply a 5 pack of Brushes Only (for Purchase)as this is the only attachment that fails on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> As expected. but would like to have ordered just rubber tips and didn&#x27;t need all the pieces.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what it they advertised. The only complaint  I  have is I needed to replace the brushes and you have to buy the complete set. I&#x27;ve not found any where to buy just brush replacements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy removing the various water jet tips-especially the brush.  It keeps breaking.  It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a different waterjet system, than to constantly be buying replacement parts.</li>
            <li> New, packed well, just as described. Good quality.Received quickly.I have an older water pik and they fit just fine. Thanks</li>
            <li> Fit my Interplak waterjet perfectly. Great accessories for use with the water-flosser.</li>
            <li> Was exactly what was posted</li>
            <li> Great tools to help your teeth and gums. I am very happy with this.</li>
            <li> great product, recommend this item</li>
