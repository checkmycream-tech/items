            <li>This styling creme is by far the best!  </li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE!  </li>
            <li>IT&#x27;S VERY LIGHT WEIGHT ON YOUR HAIR.</li>
            <li>Sure wish it was cheaper though.</li>
            <li>can go without it, but my hair is a bit more frizzed up if I don&#x27;t use this.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t need more that a quarter of a pump.</li>
            <li>My hair has never felt or styled better.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>But I love wen</li>
            <li>I love anything by Wen.</li>
            <li>I still color my hair but with Wen it is in fantastic condition!</li>
            <li>but it does not do any better than items I have used at a fraction of the cost.  </li>
            <li>Other than that I love this system!!! :)</li>
            <li>I find my hair is easy to set and stays soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed hair to natural and this product has been the best thus far.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel really smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about the tea tree smell at first</li>
            <li>Luv the fragrance but the weight of the Styling cream is too much for very fine hair.  </li>
            <li>I love wen styling creme and can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>This stuff makes my hair soft and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li>Fun fact--</li>
            <li>but it ain&#x27;t pretty.</li>
            <li>If you use this product by the directions it is very time consuming.</li>
            <li>I have VERY CURLY hair which frizzes in a snap of the fingers.</li>
            <li>This really does HELP, but does not prevent it all.</li>
            <li>I really like the conditioning cleanser.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t tell any difference.</li>
            <li>Very good, it keeps the frizz down without matting your hair down and looking greasy.</li>
            <li>After you clean your paint brushes you just put the tiny bit of the conditioner on the bristles and work it through.  </li>
            <li>A sure bet that your hair won&#x27;t feell ike a gunky, sticky mess when using either......</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend anyone to get them.</li>
            <li>This product just gets sucked into my hair and makes it very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>It doesnt last terribly long so you might want to combine it with a mouse or gel for long days but still nice.</li>
            <li>After cleansing with my usual Wen using this helps sooth the problem without drying out my scalp more.  </li>
            <li>Seemed like an old product as none of the new ones have the pump anymore.</li>
            <li>That being said, my hair does stay soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>NOT HEAVY AT ALL.</li>
            <li>When I brush my hair out it is soft, shiny and not at all sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>It leaves the hair feeling soft - as if there isn&#x27;t any product on it.</li>
            <li>They won&#x27;t get all dried out and stiff and will apply paint more smoothly the next time you use them.</li>
            <li>It protects your hair and gets rid of frizz like no other.  </li>
            <li>Humidity turns naturally curly hair into frizz and this styling creme turns it back to curls.  </li>

            <li> If you use this product by the directions it is very time consuming. That being said, my hair does stay soft and shiny.</li>

            <li> i have been using wen for a year and i wont&#x27;s go back to regular shampoo. my hair is very thin and fine but this makes all the difference.</li>
            <li> I love wen styling creme and can&#x27;t live without it! Its the best replacement for leave-in conditioner and doesn&#x27;t make my hair oily</li>
            <li> I am in the process of transitioning from relaxed hair to natural and this product has been the best thus far. I has just enough slick to go over the demarcation line of my hair and has definitely reduced shedding.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this product before and I will continue buying it! This stuff makes my hair soft and feels so healthy.</li>
            <li> I really like the conditioning cleanser. When I added this product on my hair I really didn&#x27;t tell any difference. I probably won&#x27;t order it again but will use what I have. Maybe it will add another layer of protection when I blow dry.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE!  WISH I COULD AFFORD TO BUY THE ENTIRE WEN LINE. TEA TREE IS MY FAVORITE! IT&#x27;S VERY LIGHT WEIGHT ON YOUR HAIR. NOT HEAVY AT ALL.</li>
            <li> Very good, it keeps the frizz down without matting your hair down and looking greasy. It smells nice and works well. It doesnt last terribly long so you might want to combine it with a mouse or gel for long days but still nice.</li>
            <li> This styling creme is by far the best!  It protects your hair and gets rid of frizz like no other.  The best part is that your hands will never feel sticky after you apply this to your hair...you will not be compelled to wash your hands!  A sure bet that your hair won&#x27;t feell ike a gunky, sticky mess when using either......my husband and I swear by this stuff!</li>
            <li> I typically don&#x27;t use conditioners or styling products because my hair gets weighed down and greasy. After washing with Wen Cleansing Conditioner, I put on a dime-sized dab of this in my medium length hair and distribute it from ends to mid-strand and then run my fingers through my scalp. I find my hair is easy to set and stays soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can go without it, but my hair is a bit more frizzed up if I don&#x27;t use this. A little goes a long way--I have yet to use up a small pump bottle in over a year.</li>
            <li> The only thing I find wrong with this product is I have to wash my hair more often. Other than that I love this system!!! :)</li>
            <li> I have trouble with dry scalp and treating with this helps me.  After cleansing with my usual Wen using this helps sooth the problem without drying out my scalp more.  Of course, you may not like the smell of tree oil and I don&#x27;t have to use this daily to solve my problem.</li>
            <li> I have wanted to try the Wen products for a long time so when i read that the Tea Tree line helped with itchy scalps i went for it. I like the styling creme a lot. I have very short hair so I don&#x27;t need more that a quarter of a pump. I don&#x27;t use a blow dryer, I just put on the styling creme, brush my hair into place and let it air dry. When I brush my hair out it is soft, shiny and not at all sticky feeling. I hate sticky, so that is a big plus for this product. Although i prefer a firmer hold, this styling creme holds fairly well. On the downside, the Tea Tree styling creme, like the conditioning cleanser, has an unpleasant aroma. It&#x27;s not so bad that I collapsed a lung but it ain&#x27;t pretty. However, once my hair dried I didn&#x27;t notice the smell anymore; everything on the label is so microscopic that even with my glasses on I can&#x27;t read it and I had to look the information up on the Internet; and its expensive.</li>
            <li> This is the styling crème. It is another wonderful product from Wen.  These products cannot can not be beat. I would highly recommend anyone to get them.</li>
            <li> I love all the wen products but hate the expense.  Fun fact-- the daily cleansing conditioner, in addition to doing a good job cleaning your hair also makes an excellent conditioner for paint brushes. After you clean your paint brushes you just put the tiny bit of the conditioner on the bristles and work it through.  They won&#x27;t get all dried out and stiff and will apply paint more smoothly the next time you use them.</li>
            <li> This product just gets sucked into my hair and makes it very soft and manageable. I have very thin straight hair and lately have gotten compliments on how it looks.</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt or styled better.  It even stays in style for&lt;br /&gt;2-3 days.  Great product and you use so little of it.</li>
            <li> My hair is still frizzy with this product&lt;br /&gt;And it seeps down to my face and leaves my face greasie</li>
            <li> Excellent! I am a black woman with natural hair and I use this prior to flat ironing! Amazing product.</li>
            <li> This one has no perfume so I gave it a try after the pomegranate itched me.  This gave me no problems at all.  It&#x27;s great.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about the tea tree smell at first but I don&#x27;t mind it at all.  It feels good on my scalp and my hair feels great and is moisturized.  My wavy curls look great.</li>
            <li> Received on time and the product is great.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat Wen products</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel really smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> I started using WEN about 6 months ago and I have used it exclusively ever since. My hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> YUCK --- WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.  IT STINKS &amp; I&#x27;T&#x27;S LIKE SMEARING THICK GOOEY HAND LOTION IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> This styling creme is so expensive that I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 but that&#x27;s my only complaint. I signed up for shipments from Chaz Dean&#x27;s website but found that I don&#x27;t need the other products as often as they send it and it is cheaper on Amazon.  The prices vary so you have to compare.  I use this styling creme every day and there&#x27;s never any build up.  Humidity turns naturally curly hair into frizz and this styling creme turns it back to curls.  It leaves the hair feeling soft - as if there isn&#x27;t any product on it. I like the Wen cleansing conditioner (i.e. shampoo) also.</li>
            <li> Smells great, makes hair curly and manageable. You can feel it working and the shampoo makes your hair feel like it is breathing</li>
            <li> I tried it as I saw it on TV. It worked on the models but it&#x27;s not working on me. I won&#x27;t buy it anymore. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Seemed like an old product as none of the new ones have the pump anymore. Didn&#x27;t work add well as I&#x27;d have hoped. But I love wen so it gets a 3 from me</li>
            <li> Never used Wen before but I will continue to use. Got my daughter to use. A Little expensive so I watch for sales on Anazon</li>
            <li> I love anything by Wen. His products are amazing and my hair hasn&#x27;t been in this great condition since childhood before I started putting chemicals in my hair. I still color my hair but with Wen it is in fantastic condition!</li>
            <li> Does just what it claims to do.  Could immediately tell a difference on the look and feel of my hair.</li>
            <li> Nice sent helps with frizz</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t get used to the scent of the item.</li>
            <li> I like this but it does not do any better than items I have used at a fraction of the cost.  Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> My hair is very difficult to hold curl, so my experience may not be true for everyone. My curl stayed in only slightly longer than usual which is by the time I get out the door. I don&#x27;t think it lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Luv the fragrance but the weight of the Styling cream is too much for very fine hair.  Not one of my Wen favorites.</li>
