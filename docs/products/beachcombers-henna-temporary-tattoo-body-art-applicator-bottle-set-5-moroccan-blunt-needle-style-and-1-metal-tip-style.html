    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great set for beginers!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t use cones and as a first-time mendhi application, these bottles were perfect.  </li>
            <li>Perfect for the genna</li>
            <li>So we ordered this product to help us with our art work and it works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>Beachcombers is an awesome store and they have great items.</li>
            <li>These bottles work great and do just what they are suppose to.</li>
            <li>The precision tips are wonderful and allow you to do fine lines and great detail, but...</li>
            <li>I wanted to try to duplicate the design they put on my forearm, and with this product I was able to!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I bought it!</li>
            <li>These are the best quality bottles, caps, and tips readily available for dispensing viscous liquids with fine control.</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>Received quickly and as described!!</li>
            <li>They work ok</li>
            <li>I love these bottles and tips to do my henna with.</li>
            <li>The variety of sizes makes sure every artist has what they need.</li>
            <li>The different sizes and the \\&quot;squeezability\\&quot; of the bottles made it easy for a 1st timer like me to figure out how the width of the lines and the flow of the henna perfectly!</li>
            <li>It was good but the bottles were small and I though they should have more bottles!!!</li>
            <li>New to doing henna and these bottles work amazingly!</li>
            <li>Really great when decorating pottery, can use it for the smaller details.</li>
            <li>This is a nice set and works very well for henna.</li>
            <li>The caps and tips fit well.</li>
            <li>It cleaned up really great and paint didn&#x27;t dry up or clog it.</li>
            <li>Their main website also give great tips on how to mix henna and such.</li>
            <li>Used it right away.</li>
            <li>Right now, though, I feel like this set could benefit greatly from a small funnel to help you fill these bottles!!</li>
            <li>but I ended up really preferring to use the rolls of plastic instead of the bottles.  </li>
            <li>I also can see how much of a pain the bottle would be if your not used to it.</li>
            <li>Works really well and works well with the stincels we made for the designs we made.</li>
            <li>Works well...will post more if I find out differently after further use.</li>
            <li>My right hand simply hurts.</li>
            <li>Next time I will try mixing the henna in the bottle instead of mixing it first and then transferring it.  </li>
            <li>This product made using the henna that I mixed up myself so much easier!</li>
            <li>Also because the bottles are small I d&#x3D;found it hard to get a good grip on them.</li>
            <li>Super hard to squeeze henna out of</li>
            <li>Product was fine, but very hard to squeeze.</li>

            <li> Product was fine, but very hard to squeeze.</li>
            <li> We love doing Henna on each other but we are not good designers!</li>
            <li> The neck of the bottle is narrow, so only a tiny bit of henna will go in at a time, so it took me forever to fill the bottle with mixed henna.  </li>
            <li> The small bottles and tips are really hard to clean</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the tip clogging (but this is likely due to the quality of the paste).</li>
            <li> The 20g applicator wasn&#x27;t hollow, and I was rather looking forward to using it.</li>
            <li> I had some henna done at the Renaissance festival here in AZ a few months back.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to squeeze this product until you&#x27;re done with a middle size tattoo.</li>
            <li> and you end up with dried henna stuck in them.</li>
            <li> You end up with dried up henna stuck in the bottom of the bottle and can&#x27;t use it up.</li>
            <li> They work to frost small details.</li>
            <li> and you dont have to squeeze really hard to do designs!</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t use it for henna. I used it for paints. It cleaned up really great and paint didn&#x27;t dry up or clog it. Really great when decorating pottery, can use it for the smaller details.</li>
            <li> Great set for beginers! Just keep in mind, its gonna give ur hand a work out!!!</li>
            <li> New to doing henna and these bottles work amazingly! Simple to work with and you dont have to squeeze really hard to do designs! Will purchase from again!</li>
            <li> The precision tips are wonderful and allow you to do fine lines and great detail, but...filling those bottles with the mixed henna was a huuuuuge pain in the rump.  The neck of the bottle is narrow, so only a tiny bit of henna will go in at a time, so it took me forever to fill the bottle with mixed henna.  Next time I will try mixing the henna in the bottle instead of mixing it first and then transferring it.  Will let you know how that goes.  Right now, though, I feel like this set could benefit greatly from a small funnel to help you fill these bottles!!</li>
            <li> They work ok but I ended up really preferring to use the rolls of plastic instead of the bottles.  The small bottles and tips are really hard to clean and you end up with dried henna stuck in them. You end up with dried up henna stuck in the bottom of the bottle and can&#x27;t use it up. Also because the bottles are small I d&#x3D;found it hard to get a good grip on them. Again, I preferred to use the cones instead.</li>
            <li> This is a nice set and works very well for henna. My daughter loves it!</li>
            <li> ADORE this product. Growing up, I was taught to do henna with a cone but I&#x27;ve started to do it for lots of people at weddings or festivals, and this help me do them faster as I got a bottle for each tip and can switch from tip to tip when designing. I also bought some for baking! They work to frost small details.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use cones and as a first-time mendhi application, these bottles were perfect.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with the tip clogging (but this is likely due to the quality of the paste).</li>
            <li> These are amazing. I just have on problem. The 20g applicator wasn&#x27;t hollow, and I was rather looking forward to using it. I also can see how much of a pain the bottle would be if your not used to it.</li>

            <li> It was good but the bottles were small and I though they should have more bottles!!!</li>
            <li> These are the best quality bottles, caps, and tips readily available for dispensing viscous liquids with fine control. The caps and tips fit well. Wish they were cheaper or offer Supersaver shipping.</li>
            <li> Perfect for the genna</li>
