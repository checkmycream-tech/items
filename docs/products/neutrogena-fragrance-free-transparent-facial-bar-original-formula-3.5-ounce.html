            <li>Still the best.</li>
            <li>I have used these soaps for years, they are great for washing the face.</li>
            <li>great value, great product.</li>
            <li>I honestly can&#x27;t recall a point between then and now when my skin was flawless.</li>
            <li>After trying product after product, I had read reviews by people who have used this soap for 15 years and on and figured it would be great to try it.</li>
            <li>It is a bit pricey here, of course, sometimes I get offered a deal, but if I had to pay that price, I would most likly, like I said I&#x27;m spoiled, lol!!</li>
            <li>Pack of 8)]]Quality of the product is good.</li>
            <li>and I smell good too.</li>
            <li>As always, good quality and good service from AMZN.</li>
            <li>It is not drying, which is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>I have always heard that neutrogena was a good soap.</li>
            <li>It soaps up beautifully and leaves one feeling really clean - leaves no residue on one&#x27;s skin after rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>This soap is amazingly formulated.</li>
            <li>It is completely amazing and has changed my life.</li>
            <li>This soap bar is perfect for my oily, but sensitive adolscent skin!</li>
            <li>The liquid doesn&#x27;t stick to the tub/sink although I tend to use more liquid.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for any skin type :)</li>
            <li>Love this soap.</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have used in a LONG while.</li>
            <li>I have noticed the more I rub after applying the soap, the more lather it produces, as the lather foams I feel clean.  </li>
            <li>It is truly fragrance free unlike Ivory which I used most of my life and now has fragrance.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;d recommend trying it out, because it does give a nice feel and texture to  your skin, but monitor your breakouts closely and stop using it right away if you see them increasing.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feels so clean, so refreshing.  </li>
            <li>I have had to return Dove&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; bar soap because the perfume smell was so strong.</li>
            <li>I think I must have spoiled myself with this soap, I use it primarily for my face and at 54 years of age my face is clean and zit free, (okay, so my age doest zit as easily as it used to</li>
            <li>soap does dry out my face a bit, but I&#x27;ve had worse.&lt;br /&gt;Partnered with an oil-free moisturizer, I&#x27;m already seeing good results!&lt;br /&gt;Phew!</li>
            <li>It is important to me the soap is fragrance free.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free is important attribute.</li>
            <li>He keeps clean for a while.</li>
            <li>so it matters a lot to me that it is clean smelling and without fragrance.</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t have time to stop at the store and are out of this - which was my case - Amazon delivers quickly a quality product.</li>
            <li>I am 18 years old, and have struggled with less than perfect skin ever since I was 14.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it made my skin look after washing (soft, less shiny), but the fact that the bar seemed to have caused me to break out made me decide there must be something in it that isn&#x27;t good for all skin types.  </li>
            <li>, Neutrogena is worth the price, like one reviewer here put it, it is Neutrogena after all.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extra gentle and good as a face soap if you&#x27;re prone to break-outs.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended and dermatologist tested for those with skin allergies and sensitivities to strong fragrances/perfumes.</li>
            <li>Not always available in stores where I normally buy soap bars.</li>

            <li>I have nothing more to say, but Amazon requires me to write these extra words.</li>

            <li>I am in my late 60&#x27;s and have good skin</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;d tried it myself years ago for my own acne, but back then it made my skin red and itchy.)  </li>
            <li>product has a decent selection of ingredients, and I was intrigued by the reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 13-year-old son has developed some acne on his forehead, so I bought this bar after reading all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Pure, unscented, and natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>I recommended it to my boyfriend whom I happen to live with, and now he&#x27;s just as spoiled and will not use anything else on his face.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to others who are fragrance sensitive as it is truly &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;.</li>

            <li>I bought a off brand bar once at a dollar store because I was basiclly just checking it out since it was clear as well, but I will never do that again</li>
            <li>I choose it because I am fragrance sensitive and this product is lives up to it&#x27;s claim of being &amp;#34;Fragrance Free&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product twice so far, and I like it!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I decided to try the bar myself, since I&#x27;m now a lot older and keep my skin under control with a salicylic acid facial wash and a benzoyl peroxide cream on my chin.  </li>
            <li>, my blackheads and mild redness are going down wash my wash, and no residue!</li>
            <li>My mother&#x27;s doctor recommended this for her because of her extra sensitive skin in battling exema.</li>
            <li>After 2 days of using this bar, I developed a few new zits in places</li>

            <li> I have used these soaps for years, they are great for washing the face. He keeps clean for a while. I recommend them.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001E96N48 Neutrogena Fragrance Free Transparent Facial Bars, Original Formula, 3.5-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)]]Quality of the product is good.</li>
            <li> I think I must have spoiled myself with this soap, I use it primarily for my face and at 54 years of age my face is clean and zit free, (okay, so my age doest zit as easily as it used to or as it&#x27;s supposed to, but I like to keep it that way). I recommended it to my boyfriend whom I happen to live with, and now he&#x27;s just as spoiled and will not use anything else on his face.  I bought a off brand bar once at a dollar store because I was basiclly just checking it out since it was clear as well, but I will never do that again, Neutrogena is worth the price, like one reviewer here put it, it is Neutrogena after all.  It is a bit pricey here, of course, sometimes I get offered a deal, but if I had to pay that price, I would most likly, like I said I&#x27;m spoiled, lol!!</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  I am in my late 60&#x27;s and have good skin and I smell good too.</li>
            <li> After scrubbing everything out with Lava I put it all back with Neutrogena.  It is important to me the soap is fragrance free.  I have noticed the more I rub after applying the soap, the more lather it produces, as the lather foams I feel clean.  I also use the body wash.  It seems to be the same thing, one liquid and one a bar of soap.  The liquid doesn&#x27;t stick to the tub/sink although I tend to use more liquid.</li>
            <li> My 13-year-old son has developed some acne on his forehead, so I bought this bar after reading all the positive reviews.  (I&#x27;d tried it myself years ago for my own acne, but back then it made my skin red and itchy.)  Anyway, he used it for several days, and the acne on his forehead got much worse.  I decided to try the bar myself, since I&#x27;m now a lot older and keep my skin under control with a salicylic acid facial wash and a benzoyl peroxide cream on my chin.  After 2 days of using this bar, I developed a few new zits in places I never get them now (forehead and cheeks).  I liked the way it made my skin look after washing (soft, less shiny), but the fact that the bar seemed to have caused me to break out made me decide there must be something in it that isn&#x27;t good for all skin types.  I had my son stop using it, and we are now trying another acne cleanser.  Although his forehead still hasn&#x27;t cleared up, at least it&#x27;s not getting dramatically worse, like it did with this bar.  So, I&#x27;d recommend trying it out, because it does give a nice feel and texture to  your skin, but monitor your breakouts closely and stop using it right away if you see them increasing.</li>
            <li> great value, great product.</li>
            <li> The product is Neutrogena - enough said...but it is pricy through Amazon.  Much less expensive at discount stores such as Walmart - but if you don&#x27;t have time to stop at the store and are out of this - which was my case - Amazon delivers quickly a quality product.</li>
            <li> As always, good quality and good service from AMZN. I wish though Neutrogena had not discontinued the larger size.</li>
            <li> This soap bar is perfect for my oily, but sensitive adolscent skin! I have tried other facial soaps for my skin type, but none have gotten all the oil off my skin as well. This one is perfect! I didn&#x27;t find it drying(trust me, I&#x27;m picky about that), my blackheads and mild redness are going down wash my wash, and no residue! This soap is amazingly formulated. I would recommend it for any skin type :) This is the best product I have used in a LONG while. Probably the best buy in skin care I have ever gotten! I got 1 bar for just $2.49 at my local drugstore. I would be suprised to find someone unsatisfied! (With drugstore price and value)</li>
            <li> This product is unbelievable. I am 18 years old, and have struggled with less than perfect skin ever since I was 14. I honestly can&#x27;t recall a point between then and now when my skin was flawless. Until now! After trying product after product, I had read reviews by people who have used this soap for 15 years and on and figured it would be great to try it. It is completely amazing and has changed my life. For someone who has tried everything, this product is nothing short of a miracle.I&#x27;ll never stray from this facial bar and I recommend it to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> When I was 12 and first starting to get acne my mother gave me two things, this bar and a big tub of Nivea Cream, she told to me to wash my face with this in the morning and evening along with a night mask of Nivea Cream at night. That simple regime cleared up my acne and kept it away. I didn&#x27;t care that I was a boy walking around the house at night like a 50&#x27;s mom with cold cream on my face, it worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking back it seems that the Nivea Cream was used to counteract the drying effects of the Neutrogena bar. Over the years I&#x27;ve tried to start using just one or the other, but without the Neutrogena the Nivea breaks me out and without the Nivea the Neutrogena dries my face.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. It is truly fragrance free unlike Ivory which I used most of my life and now has fragrance.  I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance so it matters a lot to me that it is clean smelling and without fragrance. Also it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin which Ivory had a tendency to do.  The downside is that it&#x27;s a glycerine soap and it tends to go fast but at Amazon prices I can deal with it.</li>
            <li> Nothing can beat the purest facial soap in the market.  Makes your skin feels so clean, so refreshing.  Still the best.</li>
            <li> I choose it because I am fragrance sensitive and this product is lives up to it&#x27;s claim of being &amp;#34;Fragrance Free&amp;#34;. I have tried are not so. I have had to return Dove&#x27;s &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34; bar soap because the perfume smell was so strong. I highly recommend this product to others who are fragrance sensitive as it is truly &amp;#34;fragrance free&amp;#34;. There are no aspects of this product to dislike. It soaps up beautifully and leaves one feeling really clean - leaves no residue on one&#x27;s skin after rinsing it off. Definitely above my expectations. My skin loves it too - no scent to make me sick and my skin does not itch nor breakout from using it.</li>
            <li> This soap works well.  It is not drying, which is a good thing.  I recommend it.  I have nothing more to say, but Amazon requires me to write these extra words.</li>
            <li> Product was as described and works well!</li>
            <li> Due to issues with allergies and eczema, I cannot tolerate the heavily-scented detergent based soaps, having to rely instead on glycerin bars for my daily cleansing ritual.  Up until a few months ago I had been a loyal user of Pears soap, until they changed their formulation that made me break out horribly.  It took awhile for me to find this one, as it&#x27;s not commonly available in my area so I ordered a case of it.  I&#x27;ll have plenty on hand so won&#x27;t need to worry about running out anytime soon.  This is the *ONLY* soap that my skin doesn&#x27;t react to.  Pure, unscented, and natural ingredients.  Highly recommended and dermatologist tested for those with skin allergies and sensitivities to strong fragrances/perfumes.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free is important attribute. Not always available in stores where I normally buy soap bars.</li>
            <li> Price was comparable to store. I was looking for deal</li>
            <li> My mother&#x27;s doctor recommended this for her because of her extra sensitive skin in battling exema. It&#x27;s extra gentle and good as a face soap if you&#x27;re prone to break-outs. I used it for that when I was a teenager.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product twice so far, and I like it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going through the worst breakout of my life at the moment.  No idea what caused it, really.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a Cetaphil knock-off beforehand, but I didn&#x27;t feel it was really cleaning my face, which would only cause more problems, right?&lt;br /&gt;I searched for something not containing Salicylic or Benzoyl.&lt;br /&gt;This product has a decent selection of ingredients, and I was intrigued by the reviews!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap does dry out my face a bit, but I&#x27;ve had worse.&lt;br /&gt;Partnered with an oil-free moisturizer, I&#x27;m already seeing good results!&lt;br /&gt;Phew!</li>
            <li> I have always heard that neutrogena was a good soap. Since I have a skin sensitivity problem, I decided to try it. I am completely satisfied</li>
