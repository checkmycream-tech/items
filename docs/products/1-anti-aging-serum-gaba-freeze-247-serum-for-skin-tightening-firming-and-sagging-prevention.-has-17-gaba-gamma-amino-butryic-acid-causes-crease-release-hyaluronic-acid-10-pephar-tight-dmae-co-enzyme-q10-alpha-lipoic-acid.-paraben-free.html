            <li>Waiting to see the affects of gaba which Dr oz says is awesome.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t seem to find a product that matches that awesome, &amp;#34;Instant&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I am happy with the product .  </li>
            <li>the serum has worked great.</li>
            <li>tightening and firming result I was once experienced.</li>
            <li>Cream feels very nice on skin.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>That wonderful serum product really helped with those dreaded lines from nose to mouth.</li>
            <li>Seller was fantastic, very quick response, mailed ASAP!!</li>
            <li>/&gt; The price is what I consider reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I really love the Gaba Freeze and faithfully used it every evening.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>Seems to agree with my skin, worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The wrinkles are much finer and my skin tone more even.  </li>
            <li>I found that I used it up quickly and won&#x27;t reorder it.</li>
            <li>I really thought Gaba Freeze would work!  </li>
            <li>I have been using Freeze 24/7, but it is very costly.</li>
            <li>I guess I expected more from this</li>
            <li>, it is really sticky when applying to face, It was highly recommended but I will not reorder!</li>
            <li>I cannot really tell until I have I used it for a month</li>
            <li>I decided to try it and it really has made a difference in how my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>Still on the fence, will update later, I haven&#x27;t bern using consistently,  so</li>
            <li>I need to reorder, as I&#x27;ve completely run out!</li>
            <li>because I have another product to compare it to, I absolutely know for a fact that instant tightening and firming CAN happen with noticable results, though not with Gaba Freeze.</li>
            <li>Ihad heard this product advertised on Dr. Oz, not this one directly but a product that contained gaba.  </li>
            <li>Gaba Freeze is not what I truly consider a serum, it was not very thick, which I feel is curcial to an instant firming product, and when it dried, I did not see much firming and tightening.  </li>
            <li>The face serum, while it is very soothing, tends to become a little sticky and when it dries it rubs off rather than soaking into the skin...</li>
            <li>The pump does not allow you to use only a little serum - instead it dispenses way too much for each use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I am fanatic about skin care. I use a wide variety of products and have frequent facials. I know about facial products although I am not a professional.I have been using Freeze 24/7, but it is very costly. In an attempt to find an inexpensive, alternative product, I tried this pump serum. It does not truly compare. The serum is watery and stings upon application. It does tighten after awhile, but not as thoroughly as the cream. Also I could not see the immediate, visible results that I did with the more expensive product. I found that I used it up quickly and won&#x27;t reorder it. Too bad that it didn&#x27;t work as I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I saw no results. I would not purchase this product. I was very disappointed I would not waste your money on this product</li>
            <li> I used the product and could feel a little tingle in my skin and it was soft and felt a little tighter but not a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Waiting to see the affects of gaba which Dr oz says is awesome. I hope so cuz this little bottle is costly</li>
            <li> I guess I expected more from this, it is really sticky when applying to face, It was highly recommended but I will not reorder!</li>
            <li> Product actually does what it claims ti do.&lt;br /&gt;I will reorder soon.&lt;br /&gt; The price is what I consider reasonable.&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Size of container was larger than I thought. Cream feels very nice on skin. No skin reaction. Just received this Monday so too soon to tell</li>
            <li> Still on the fence, will update later, I haven&#x27;t bern using consistently,  so I cannot really tell until I have I used it for a month</li>
            <li> YEAH THIS STUFF WORKS JUST AS ADVERTISED. NEED A LITTLE HELP WITH THE DROOPIES???? APPLY, TIGHTEN UP, AND TAKE OFF 10 YEARS. GO AHEAD TRY IT YOU&#x27;LL LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed with pump. The pump does not allow you to use only a little serum - instead it dispenses way too much for each use. I end up wasting 3/4 of the serum that is dispensed each time I use it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the product .  I have been using it for a few weeks now and I can see a difference.</li>
            <li> Seller was fantastic, very quick response, mailed ASAP!! A+++++++++ I would purchase from this person again. The face serum, while it is very soothing, tends to become a little sticky and when it dries it rubs off rather than soaking into the skin...</li>
            <li> It should be used at least one time daily.  I use it in the morning after a shower...I next apply some moisturizer with sp20 sunscreen</li>
            <li> Love this product! Seems to agree with my skin, worth every penny!</li>
            <li> the serum has worked great. the pump bottle has failed a few times. this is frustrating when getting ready for work.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical, but my pores and fine lines are less noticable, and my skin looks younger too.&lt;br /&gt;would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I really love the Gaba Freeze and faithfully used it every evening. I need to reorder, as I&#x27;ve completely run out!</li>
            <li> Not too crazy about this stuff.... it burns....use it sparingly ....not sure I would buy it again and don&#x27;t see any improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> I really thought Gaba Freeze would work!  I know it is possible as I was given a gift a few years ago, though for the life of me I can&#x27;t remember the product name, and it was a freeze and tightening serum that really worked instantly!  Unfortunately Gaba Freeze was not even close.  I&#x27;ve been looking and I can&#x27;t seem to find a product that matches that awesome, &amp;#34;Instant&amp;#34; tightening and firming result I was once experienced. That wonderful serum product really helped with those dreaded lines from nose to mouth. Gaba Freeze is not what I truly consider a serum, it was not very thick, which I feel is curcial to an instant firming product, and when it dried, I did not see much firming and tightening.  So with that, and because I have another product to compare it to, I absolutely know for a fact that instant tightening and firming CAN happen with noticable results, though not with Gaba Freeze. I can&#x27;t seem to use the word &amp;#34;hate&amp;#34;, but I certainly do not like it.</li>
            <li> Ihad heard this product advertised on Dr. Oz, not this one directly but a product that contained gaba.  I decided to try it and it really has made a difference in how my skin looks and feels. The wrinkles are much finer and my skin tone more even.  I would recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> It definately is a product I will reorder and continue to reorder as I feel it is making a difference in my skin feel and looks.  It appears to tighten the face as well as make it tingle when applied.  I&#x27;m glad I tried it.</li>
