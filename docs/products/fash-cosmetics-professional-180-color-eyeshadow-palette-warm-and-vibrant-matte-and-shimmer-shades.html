            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with $1.99 ones.  </li>
            <li>Besides that i love it.</li>
            <li>Just wish maybe it coulda been packaged better in the box to prevent that happening.</li>
            <li>colors are ok.</li>
            <li>I prefer more mattes.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>but there was just too many to use them all.</li>
            <li>It stayed on and I love the way it goes on.</li>
            <li>but I just couldn&#x27;t use most of the colors.</li>
            <li>I love experimenting with my eye colors.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I got this one.</li>
            <li>Added about 4 bucks more</li>
            <li>:) pictures do not do them justice</li>
            <li>but overall this palette is great!</li>
            <li>Only took 3 days, which was impressive!!</li>
            <li>I get a better presentation from my MAC and Sephora eye shadows.</li>
            <li>I personally love my palettes from Shany.</li>
            <li>My palates were damaged upon receiving, but I do love the product.</li>
            <li>I love it..</li>
            <li>na reperchase :)</li>
            <li>i was very happy and pleased, I definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li>i love..</li>
            <li>Mostly neutral colors</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll watch for more deals like this.</li>
            <li>The neutral colors show up very well and are great to wear to school.</li>
            <li>There are many matte colors and sparkly colors.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Came on good condition and the packaging is very nice almost like coastal scent , would definitely buy of it , so get yourself one would never regret it.</li>
            <li>All of the neutral colors are beautiful and great for everyday use.</li>
            <li>There was a large variety of colors which was good</li>
            <li>There is no chalkiness with the shades I expected it from and the pigmentation is wonderful.</li>
            <li>The second one is my favorite one and has great colors that everyone could use.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice and bright and they stay on for the entire day.</li>
            <li>Perfect, just as expected!!</li>
            <li>The box is fine.  </li>
            <li>The first layer dissapointed me because I thought that it would be more brown tones but its mostly matte orange tones.</li>
            <li>Other than that nice!!</li>
            <li>The quality of the packaging itself is cheaply made but fo the price</li>
            <li>The mattes work very well and give an amazing color pay off.</li>
            <li>Very worth owning im gon</li>
            <li>If you like to experiment with makeup, they are very fun to use.</li>
            <li>So many lovely and vibrant colours.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this.</li>
            <li>This is so worth it!</li>
            <li>and I love this so much!</li>
            <li>Obviously is stays on better with the primer but holds it&#x27;s own by itself</li>
            <li>She loved the matte selection and I even tried some of the colors on my younger girls for halloween make-up....</li>
            <li>i love how much of a variety it brings.</li>
            <li>These shadows are soft, blend able and true color!</li>
            <li>This eyeshadow pallet was delivered on time, the colors were beautiful and vibrant, they was a wide range of colors as well</li>
            <li>I think for the price it is really worth it</li>
            <li>It comes with a large variety of browns, pinks, tans, and other neutral colors that I didn&#x27;t know existed, lol.</li>
            <li>Great shadows highly pigmented some shadows r chalky and light however use an eyeshadow primer then put a little concealer on ur lid or whereever ur purting the shadows</li>
            <li>The bright colors are a little too much for everyday use, but they are very pigmented and beautiful!</li>
            <li>Finally in my hands:)), exelent cuality good price for this product, thanks so much, when finish, I will buy other pallets :))</li>
            <li>Love the colors and the amount of eye shadows is awesome but only thing that I was upset about was about 3 colors on each pallet were broken</li>
            <li>The colors are super pigmented and blend really well.</li>
            <li>you might need to add a few coats for certain colors, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product for an amazing price.</li>
            <li>It most likely broke during shipping .</li>
            <li>Its exactly that the pic show, but one shadow came broke</li>
            <li>Love all the different colors.</li>
            <li>The dramatic colors are great for special occasions.</li>
            <li>the colors are amazing and the shadows are extremely pigmented.</li>
            <li>I recomend this eyeshadow they are really rich in colors And soft to aplay .</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t much so eh...</li>
            <li>They are very powdery &amp; somewhat pigmented .</li>
            <li>These have a much smoother/softer fell to me.  </li>
            <li>I was hesitant to buy from the seller because I don&#x27;t know much about them</li>
            <li>The eyeshadows are very creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li>The color selection is fantastic especially for the price.</li>
            <li>It is very assorted in colors.</li>
            <li>It is better than I expected it to be; the shadow stats on for a while unlike those dollar store eyeshadows.</li>
            <li>I have a darker skin tone (cocoa) and some cheaper made eyeshadows don&#x27;t blend into my tone very well</li>
            <li>but this brand works very well</li>
            <li>thanks alot</li>
            <li>It has every color you can think of and they are all very pigmented.</li>
            <li>They blend very well</li>
            <li>The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li>The colors are very beautiful,  the only problem I had was  that 3 colors were broken.</li>
            <li>It comes with a large variety of neutral colors, fun and bright colors, and dramatic colors.</li>
            <li>It consists of a neutral/brownish layer and two dark/bright colored: one having more shimmer and the other matte.  </li>
            <li>Some of the colors are more pigmented than other colors</li>
            <li>Colors very vivid.</li>
            <li>My eyes are green and I like to use a lot of purple and there are so many shades of purple in this palette and also reds and oranges</li>
            <li>I use these colors almost everyday when dressing to go to work and stays on all day love it .</li>
            <li>but two of my colors were broken but other than that they were very pigmented and very brightly colored</li>
            <li>But since this easily covered the next morning and is gone once you have removed the next days makeup</li>
            <li>Really though, there are so many colors that even if one or two was messed up a little it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know that the palettes weren&#x27;t attached to the case (easy to flip from one to the next), minor annoyance, but for the price couldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I really had high expectations, and now I feel like getting my money back.</li>
            <li>Although a black one was cracked, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I like the different colors but the pigment isn&#x27;t as strong as other palettes I have.</li>
            <li>but wow, so much color, pigment, and will last a while.</li>
            <li>When I get a real palette I will go to an actual store.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it, plain and simple.</li>
            <li>The only thing is the eye shadows are super soft and can get crumbled when using brushes and they almost remind me of loose pigments when I go in with a brush.</li>
            <li>I mainly got it as  a messing around with eye shadow just to get a feel of different colors.</li>
            <li>and I would compare the length of wear to any mid to high end eye shadow brand.</li>
            <li>I personally think it&#x27;s worth every single penny.</li>
            <li>The colors are EXTREMELY pigmented and they&#x27;re really pretty.</li>
            <li>They are fun to just mess around with; with sparkly and matte colors.</li>
            <li>Just got it in the mail and most of them broken.</li>
            <li>Also it came lightening fast and earlier than expected.</li>
            <li>Its disappointing because they look so shimmery in the package, and I saw a lot of good reviews on Amazon and the actual Fash site.</li>
            <li>Some were a bit broken, but other then that I love them!</li>

            <li> The box is fine.  </li>
            <li> The first layer dissapointed me because I thought that it would be more brown tones but its mostly matte orange tones.</li>
            <li> Other than that nice!!</li>
            <li> The quality of the packaging itself is cheaply made but fo the price</li>
            <li> The mattes work very well and give an amazing color pay off.</li>

            <li> The colors are super pigmented and blend really well.</li>
            <li> you might need to add a few coats for certain colors, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> It most likely broke during shipping .</li>
            <li> Its exactly that the pic show, but one shadow came broke</li>
            <li> Love all the different colors.</li>
            <li> The dramatic colors are great for special occasions.</li>
            <li> the colors are amazing and the shadows are extremely pigmented.</li>
            <li> I recomend this eyeshadow they are really rich in colors And soft to aplay .</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t much so eh...</li>
            <li> They are very powdery &amp; somewhat pigmented .</li>
            <li> These have a much smoother/softer fell to me.  </li>
            <li> I was hesitant to buy from the seller because I don&#x27;t know much about them</li>
            <li> The eyeshadows are very creamy and pigmented.</li>
            <li> The color selection is fantastic especially for the price.</li>
            <li> It is very assorted in colors.</li>
            <li> It is better than I expected it to be; the shadow stats on for a while unlike those dollar store eyeshadows.</li>
            <li> I have a darker skin tone (cocoa) and some cheaper made eyeshadows don&#x27;t blend into my tone very well</li>
            <li> but this brand works very well</li>
            <li> thanks alot</li>
            <li> It has every color you can think of and they are all very pigmented.</li>
            <li> They blend very well</li>
            <li> The colors are very pigmented.</li>
            <li> The colors are very beautiful,  the only problem I had was  that 3 colors were broken.</li>
            <li> It comes with a large variety of neutral colors, fun and bright colors, and dramatic colors.</li>
            <li> It consists of a neutral/brownish layer and two dark/bright colored: one having more shimmer and the other matte.  </li>
            <li> Some of the colors are more pigmented than other colors</li>
            <li> Colors very vivid.</li>
            <li> My eyes are green and I like to use a lot of purple and there are so many shades of purple in this palette and also reds and oranges</li>
            <li> I use these colors almost everyday when dressing to go to work and stays on all day love it .</li>
            <li> but two of my colors were broken but other than that they were very pigmented and very brightly colored</li>
            <li> But since this easily covered the next morning and is gone once you have removed the next days makeup</li>
            <li> Really though, there are so many colors that even if one or two was messed up a little it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to me.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know that the palettes weren&#x27;t attached to the case (easy to flip from one to the next), minor annoyance, but for the price couldn&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I really had high expectations, and now I feel like getting my money back.</li>
            <li> Although a black one was cracked, I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> I like the different colors but the pigment isn&#x27;t as strong as other palettes I have.</li>
            <li> but wow, so much color, pigment, and will last a while.</li>
            <li> When I get a real palette I will go to an actual store.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it, plain and simple.</li>
            <li> The only thing is the eye shadows are super soft and can get crumbled when using brushes and they almost remind me of loose pigments when I go in with a brush.</li>
            <li> I mainly got it as  a messing around with eye shadow just to get a feel of different colors.</li>
            <li> and I would compare the length of wear to any mid to high end eye shadow brand.</li>
            <li> I personally think it&#x27;s worth every single penny.</li>
            <li> The colors are EXTREMELY pigmented and they&#x27;re really pretty.</li>
            <li> They are fun to just mess around with; with sparkly and matte colors.</li>
            <li> Just got it in the mail and most of them broken.</li>
            <li> Also it came lightening fast and earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Its disappointing because they look so shimmery in the package, and I saw a lot of good reviews on Amazon and the actual Fash site.</li>
            <li> Some were a bit broken, but other then that I love them!</li>
            <li> You may need a primer though for some pale colours to really pop</li>
            <li> A couple of my shadows were broken but other than that I love this palette.</li>
            <li> love the many color only reason I knock off a star is because a couple of the colors were broken but not as bad as the ones in some of the customers pictures.</li>
            <li> But nothing major, its expected of make-up being shipped. !</li>
            <li> All the colors are very pigmented and so you can create any look you want from subdued color to crazy and fun.</li>
            <li> A few of the colors were completely crumbled and all over the place</li>
            <li> A day earlier than expected.</li>
            <li> Wide variety with several shades.  </li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t be needing to buy eyeshadow for a long while!</li>
            <li> The only warning I have is if you use any of the darker pinks/reds or a red tinted purple you will have a slight pink stain after removing your makeup.</li>
            <li> Came before expected date and in tact.</li>
            <li> i use different colors everyday.</li>
            <li> but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> The looks you can create with the pallet are endless.</li>
            <li> During shipping anything can happen, and each palette has a black as well.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> And for me at least it stayed put for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> The texture of a lot of palettes like this one can be a little chalky or powdery.  </li>
            <li> Waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time , my only complaints would be 2 of the colors were broken a bit but nothing the seller could do .</li>
            <li> Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Who would buy the 88 palette when you can get this 180 for a few bucks less!</li>
            <li> Be careful they&#x27;re very delicate.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t show &amp; it&#x27;s hardly noticable.</li>
            <li> A few colors were broken when I opened it</li>
            <li> Nothing serious.  </li>
            <li> Just received it yesterday and some of the eye shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> 3 eye shadows were broken.</li>
            <li> 4 stars because 3 of them broken</li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m not impressed with is that the eye shadow colors I tried (2 of them) are dusty.</li>
            <li> They weren&#x27;t broken and they were on time!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great buy, i love it&lt;br /&gt;Very good product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Finally in my hands:)), exelent cuality good price for this product, thanks so much, when finish, I will buy other pallets :))</li>
            <li> Just received it yesterday and some of the eye shadows were broken. I was gonna return but it wasn&#x27;t much so eh... I mainly got it as  a messing around with eye shadow just to get a feel of different colors. When I get a real palette I will go to an actual store.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t do anything for a person of colour. It doesn&#x27;t show &amp; it&#x27;s hardly noticable. I&#x27;ve had better luck with $1.99 ones.  Waste of $$$.</li>
            <li> Love the colors and the amount of eye shadows is awesome but only thing that I was upset about was about 3 colors on each pallet were broken n they just so happen to be my fav colors on each of the pallets that are broke. Besides that i love it. Just wish maybe it coulda been packaged better in the box to prevent that happening. But Good eye shadow for sure.</li>
            <li> colors are ok. They are very powdery &amp; somewhat pigmented . they&#x27;re good for beginners</li>
            <li> Too many shimmer colors!  I prefer more mattes.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet! All the colors are very pigmented and so you can create any look you want from subdued color to crazy and fun. The range is beautiful and this really is the perfect pallet if you are looking for color. The only warning I have is if you use any of the darker pinks/reds or a red tinted purple you will have a slight pink stain after removing your makeup. But since this easily covered the next morning and is gone once you have removed the next days makeup I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I love this pallet! It has a variety of beautiful colors. Not as pigmented as I wish they would have been, but still a great pallet.</li>
            <li> Love this!!!! So many colors and good quality. Came before expected date and in tact.</li>
            <li> I recomend this eyeshadow they are really rich in colors And soft to aplay . Was delibery on time, only one was broken.&lt;br /&gt;I use every day. Loved</li>
            <li> This pallet is awesome!  Beautiful pigmented colors!!!!</li>
            <li> It consists of a neutral/brownish layer and two dark/bright colored: one having more shimmer and the other matte.  I like that they did it this way.  I can reach for whatever I&#x27;m in the mood for with each palette.  They all stack into one container.  Saves space.  The texture of a lot of palettes like this one can be a little chalky or powdery.  These have a much smoother/softer fell to me.  Which brings me to the shipping part.  It did have one crack in one of the browns.  Nothing serious.  I just blew it out.  Really though, there are so many colors that even if one or two was messed up a little it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal to me.  For this price it&#x27;s an amazing deal.  I was hesitant to buy from the seller because I don&#x27;t know much about them but I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> There was a large variety of colors which was good so you can pick out what color you want but there was just too many to use them all. It stayed on and I love the way it goes on. Colors very vivid. Over all I would give it four stars for quality but I just couldn&#x27;t use most of the colors.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this. I have been searching for good quality matte shades and this product contained so many plus great shimmer shades. My eyes are green and I like to use a lot of purple and there are so many shades of purple in this palette and also reds and oranges it is just really awesome. The colors are super pigmented and blend really well.</li>
            <li> Lots of colors, great price.  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase, and would buy it again.  The box is fine.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> This seems great. Just got it in the mail and most of them broken. Kinda dissapointed bu tthe colors seem great. Much smaller than I was expecting to.</li>
            <li> This product is very good for the price. The eyeshadows are very creamy and pigmented. The first layer dissapointed me because I thought that it would be more brown tones but its mostly matte orange tones. The second one is my favorite one and has great colors that everyone could use. The quality of the packaging itself is cheaply made but fo the price the actual makeup itself pays off.</li>
            <li> These shadows are soft, blend able and true color! Amazing price for what you get. There is no chalkiness with the shades I expected it from and the pigmentation is wonderful. The only thing is the eye shadows are super soft and can get crumbled when using brushes and they almost remind me of loose pigments when I go in with a brush. Be careful they&#x27;re very delicate.</li>
            <li> A few of the colors were completely crumbled and all over the place so I couldn&#x27;t even add water to salvage them. The color selection is fantastic especially for the price. Also it came lightening fast and earlier than expected. I&#x27;ve worn the colors with and without primer. Obviously is stays on better with the primer but holds it&#x27;s own by itself and I would compare the length of wear to any mid to high end eye shadow brand.</li>
            <li> I love experimenting with my eye colors. Although a black one was cracked, I was not disappointed. During shipping anything can happen, and each palette has a black as well.&lt;br /&gt;For this great price, it is amazing. I was debating between this and the 120 color from Mash I believe, and I&#x27;m glad I got this one. Added about 4 bucks more but wow, so much color, pigment, and will last a while.</li>
            <li> These were GREAT I would have given 5 stars but two of my colors were broken but other than that they were very pigmented and very brightly colored :) pictures do not do them justice</li>
            <li> Some of the colors are more pigmented than other colors but overall this palette is great! Definitely a steal for the price</li>
            <li> Matte and shimmer shades are mixed in everywhere but great pigmentation and great color choices</li>
            <li> The product over all is nice. The colors are very beautiful,  the only problem I had was  that 3 colors were broken. Other than that nice!!</li>
            <li> I received my order in a timely manner. Only took 3 days, which was impressive!! Didn&#x27;t know that the palettes weren&#x27;t attached to the case (easy to flip from one to the next), minor annoyance, but for the price couldn&#x27;t complain. What I&#x27;m not impressed with is that the eye shadow colors I tried (2 of them) are dusty. They did not show up well on my skin whatsoever. They remind me of the brands at the beauty shops that look like baby powder on my eye lids. Its disappointing because they look so shimmery in the package, and I saw a lot of good reviews on Amazon and the actual Fash site. I am not seeing the awe that everyone else is. I get a better presentation from my MAC and Sephora eye shadows. I really had high expectations, and now I feel like getting my money back.</li>
            <li> It is very assorted in colors. I use the brown ones to color in my eyebrow and have no problem with it flaking off.</li>
            <li> This eyeshadow pallet was delivered on time, the colors were beautiful and vibrant, they was a wide range of colors as well and they werent damaged in any way. I was very happy with my purchase</li>
            <li> This is so worth it! It is just as good as BH and Coastal scents! I believe they are all the same! I use this palette ALL THE TIME! It has so many colors for a creative, artist, flower girl like me! It&#x27;s such a deal ($20-ish)! Who would buy the 88 palette when you can get this 180 for a few bucks less! Do it!</li>
            <li> Could not wait to get it and experiment with those beautiful colors. I think for the price it is really worth it and  the amount of colors for  dressing up both for day and night .  I use these colors almost everyday when dressing to go to work and stays on all day love it . Came on good condition and the packaging is very nice almost like coastal scent , would definitely buy of it , so get yourself one would never regret it.</li>
            <li> I like the different colors but the pigment isn&#x27;t as strong as other palettes I have. I personally love my palettes from Shany.</li>
            <li> Got this pallete today. A day earlier than expected. 3 eye shadows were broken. But nothing major, its expected of make-up being shipped. ! Will definitely be buying again!(:</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product, I have had to use water with most of the pallets that I have used but not this one, it goes on smooth and easy without water. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> My palates were damaged upon receiving, but I do love the product. There are a lot of colors to work with, and the look is gorgeous.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughters 18th birthday and it was one of her favorite gifts! She loved the matte selection and I even tried some of the colors on my younger girls for halloween make-up....it wears and removes great!!</li>
            <li> A couple of my shadows were broken but other than that I love this palette. All you need is a good base/primer. The colors blend so well!</li>
            <li> excellent  colors and good quality.</li>
            <li> One if the best and cheapest set of eyeshadows that I have ever purchased. I absolutely love it! It is better than I expected it to be; the shadow stats on for a while unlike those dollar store eyeshadows. It is perfect for someone who wants a variety of colors at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> i love how much of a variety it brings. i use different colors everyday. you might need to add a few coats for certain colors, but other than that it&#x27;s a great product for an amazing price.</li>
            <li> well I say this product is just wonderful, I enjoy doing my make up because I have a variety of choices of colors</li>

            <li> It has every color you can think of. I personally think it&#x27;s worth every single penny. The colors are EXTREMELY pigmented and they&#x27;re really pretty. I absolutely love it, plain and simple.</li>

            <li> It arrived on time , my only complaints would be 2 of the colors were broken a bit but nothing the seller could do . It most likely broke during shipping . The colors only hold its color of you have something under neath it like white pencil liner or waxy stuff or whatever you choose . That&#x27;s my only problems.</li>
            <li> I like the colors and variety. Colors work great! It was delivered before the week was even over! i was very happy and pleased, I definitely recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Its exactly that the pic show, but one shadow came broke but i fix that... the colors r really great... i love.. me encanto lastima q una d las sombras vino dañana pero la arregle de ahi lo demas perfecto, los colores son hermosos</li>
            <li> Love all the different colors. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I LOVE ITTT!!! THEY CAME ON GOOD CONDITION .</li>
            <li> love the many color only reason I knock off a star is because a couple of the colors were broken but not as bad as the ones in some of the customers pictures. I have a darker skin tone (cocoa) and some cheaper made eyeshadows don&#x27;t blend into my tone very well but this brand works very well and it&#x27;s a great price on top of that. yes I would recommend this product, in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Really nice.  Wide variety with several shades.  Mostly neutral colors but there are a variety of brights to mix it up.  And for me at least it stayed put for a long period of time.</li>
            <li> Love it. Use it everyday.</li>
            <li> I liked very much this product, it contains the colors I wanted, and for a great price! I&#x27;ll watch for more deals like this.</li>

            <li> So many lovely and vibrant colours. It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
            <li> I am 15 and I love this so much! It comes with a large variety of neutral colors, fun and bright colors, and dramatic colors.The neutral colors show up very well and are great to wear to school. It comes with a large variety of browns, pinks, tans, and other neutral colors that I didn&#x27;t know existed, lol. There are many matte colors and sparkly colors. The mattes work very well and give an amazing color pay off. All of the neutral colors are beautiful and great for everyday use. The bright colors are a little too much for everyday use, but they are very pigmented and beautiful! They are fun to just mess around with; with sparkly and matte colors. If you like to experiment with makeup, they are very fun to use. The dramatic colors are great for special occasions. Overall, I recommend this item. It is great for any age; it&#x27;s so affordable!
