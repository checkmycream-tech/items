            <li>I completely love this hair piece.</li>
            <li>I really liked this piece very versatile and easy to put on.</li>
            <li>Really light that it does not blend in with my hair at all.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t wear it since it&#x27;s too light.</li>
            <li>I bought for a quick ponytail</li>
            <li>Good price and still not worth the money.</li>
            <li>But It is a good hair piece, the clip is tight hasn&#x27;t broke or anything.</li>
            <li>So nice and you can wear it two different ways I like more fluff.</li>
            <li>Nice looking, pretty color (I ordered light brown), but it is much more red than my natural hair and makes mine look very dull.</li>
            <li>very realist but</li>
            <li>Lasts longer then the longer one&amp;#34;s not much maintain needed love it.</li>
            <li>Looks really fake...too shiny and plastic looking.</li>
            <li>Got light brown &amp; ordering a dark brown next :-)</li>
            <li>It can be worn high or lower it can be glamorous</li>
            <li>You&#x27;d better have pretty thick hair to clamp it to.  </li>
            <li>No where near the color in the picture.</li>

            <li> But expect a long wait to recieve it.</li>
            <li> thing is that for me it was alittle too long (I just cut it)</li>
            <li> The litebrown wasn&#x27;t as dark as they show, it even looks like it has some blonde in it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is the color wasn&#x27;t the same as they show it.</li>
            <li> the clip is just to heavy and big</li>
            <li> Not the length I expected</li>
            <li> LIGHT BROWN. :(</li>
            <li> It sheds a little and you can tell it was just thrown together on the clip.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT !  </li>
            <li> Heavy!  </li>
            <li> I have thin hair</li>
            <li> I just go the wrong color</li>
            <li> Wrong color and took forever to get here</li>
            <li> Disappointed.</li>

            <li> Really light that it does not blend in with my hair at all. Disappointed. I bought for a quick ponytail but I can&#x27;t wear it since it&#x27;s too light. No where near the color in the picture. It sheds a little and you can tell it was just thrown together on the clip. It looks like a clip on. Good price and still not worth the money. Going back to hair stores for pony tail pieces.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great hair piece I just go the wrong color</li>
            <li> Heavy!  You&#x27;d better have pretty thick hair to clamp it to.  Nice looking, pretty color (I ordered light brown), but it is much more red than my natural hair and makes mine look very dull.</li>
            <li> NOT WORTH IT !  A SHORT DOLL HAIR&lt;br /&gt;NOT AS SHOWN AT ALL , COLOR TOO RED&lt;br /&gt;NOT LIGHT BROWN. :(</li>

            <li> So nice and you can wear it two different ways I like more fluff. Lasts longer then the longer one&amp;#34;s not much maintain needed love it.</li>
