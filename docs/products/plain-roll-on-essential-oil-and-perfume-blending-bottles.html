            <li>Easy to use and rolls well!</li>
            <li>These bottles are perfect for mixing your own essential oil blends!</li>
            <li>They are a great size, but the roller balls do not give a consistent application of the oil blends for which I am using them.</li>

            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with leaks and they are easy to use and look nice.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li>Better than Aroma Tools price.</li>
            <li>I like them, they are ok for what I need it.</li>
            <li>I use these for essential oil blends and they are perfect.  </li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I will probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li>Love these roller balls I have no problems popping the roller in and all.</li>
            <li>perfect for what I wanted them for - essential oil blends</li>
            <li>I was able to remove the rollers and refill the bottles without any problems.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>They roll fine and seal fine.  </li>
            <li>I will say that ALL of the rollers roll fine.</li>
            <li>All the rollers roll smoothly and click into place easily.</li>
            <li>These are awesome little bottles.</li>
            <li>They make great gifts to use for my essential oils roller blends.</li>
            <li>They also fit in my carrying case but it is a snug fit.</li>
            <li>great for Essential Oils</li>
            <li>The rollers do not roll smoothly at all.</li>
            <li>Received them super quick!</li>
            <li>Love mixing up my own essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and arrived very quickly.</li>
            <li>They seem like good product so far but one reason why I purchased this over the other options is because it said it came with the 3 free droppers.</li>
            <li>the bottles are clear - so it is easy to see the liquid inside when filling them</li>
            <li>I would recommend ordering smaller droppers because these ones were seriously huge and the tips didn&#x27;t even fit into my oil bottles.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>(The oil doesn&#x27;t consistently roll onto my skim when using it.)</li>
            <li>This is not the first time I ordered from them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li>Packaged very well!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li>At first I was happy with my purchase but soon realized that many of the bottles has tiny pieces of broken glass in them.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected</li>
            <li>Arrived nicely packaged, have used several for essential oil perfumes.</li>
            <li>Other than that everything else was fine!</li>
            <li>These are pretty good rollers but one arrived broken.</li>
            <li>They also seem to leak or not seal properly when you put the roller ball top back on.</li>
            <li>Decent bottles for the price.</li>
            <li>However a different brand if you let the cap sit in very hot water before use fixes this problem.</li>
            <li>Came obviously new with no smell.</li>
            <li>The only thing that bothers me is the plasticky smell of the rollers, but this smell is unnoticeable once the bottle is filled with essential oils and carrier.</li>
            <li>Lids fit tight.</li>
            <li>Unlike other bottles similar to this one, Fortitude assembles fairly easily and does not leak thus far.</li>
            <li>the rollers do not fit securely on the bottles</li>
            <li>These are simple and very inexpensive.  </li>
            <li>So far they seem to be working well.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find the ability to contact the seller directly on this product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted &amp; expected.</li>
            <li>Ive only used 3 so far</li>
            <li>These looked good when they arrived but after using them for a few weeks, all of the plastic rollers have broken except for two.</li>
            <li>Good bottles but a few were broken.</li>

            <li> These looked good when they arrived but after using them for a few weeks, all of the plastic rollers have broken except for two.</li>
            <li> Good bottles but a few were broken.</li>
            <li> In the first package there were at least 3 bottles where the roller ball won&#x27;t sit</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about half the roller balls so far and they all work as they should.</li>
            <li> A bit bigger than expected.</li>
            <li> Every single roller leaks.</li>
            <li> Have not had any leaks or loose tops yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many different rollers from various shops and this is by far the worst quality I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Was carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> and once I did get it to roll, there was really no output.  </li>
            <li> Other than that these rollers work well.</li>
            <li> 9 of the 24 bottles leak, due to the fact that the roller ball attachment doesn&#x27;t sit snug on the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately these do not dispense very well.  </li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is the plastic package they came in spilt on the side</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed that the roller cap didn&#x27;t fit as snug as other bottles, but I&#x27;ve had no leakage problems at all.</li>
            <li> About half the bottle tops (roller) didn&#x27;t snap on tightly causing the rollers to leak.</li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t leak out it just a little oily when you take the cap off.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m afraid to use them and the whole roller fall out and spill oil all over.</li>
            <li> However, one of the rollers was missing a ball and hence not usable.</li>
            <li> Of the 280 bottles,  only threel were broken oe missing parts.  </li>
            <li> , I wish I got the Darker color, and the straws that come with it, not much use when I have a small hole to insert into for my oils, but they will do!</li>
            <li> They are small, 1/3 oz roller bottles....</li>
            <li> When I opened it, at least one bottle was shattered or cracked.</li>
            <li> When I received these at least one bottle was broken and they were all useless, as the rollerball did not fit snuggly into the bottle.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous from the package and am disappointed</li>
            <li> The bottles don&#x27;t seem broken but the glass is still there.</li>
            <li> some of them came broken,</li>
            <li> Some of the bottles arrived broken...</li>
            <li> Two of the bottles were broken in the package.</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was broken when I received the package in the mail.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad batch or what,</li>
            <li> I was afraid they would leak</li>
            <li> a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Of the 280 bottles,  only threel were broken oe missing parts.  I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product. The best price around. I am very pleased. :)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately these do not dispense very well.  They roll fine and seal fine.  They just aren&#x27;t working.  I have tried numerous from the package and am disappointed</li>
            <li> These are awesome little bottles. Arrived nicely packaged, have used several for essential oil perfumes. Have not had any leaks or loose tops yet.</li>
            <li> A bit bigger than expected. Came obviously new with no smell. I haven&#x27;t found any that leak.</li>
            <li> These are perfect size. They make great gifts to use for my essential oils roller blends.</li>
            <li> I use these for essential oil blends. They work great. I use a sharpie to label them but it does wear off over time so need to make some labels for them. They also fit in my carrying case but it is a snug fit.</li>
            <li> Only complaint I have is the plastic package they came in spilt on the side and I almost broke them all five mins after opening!</li>
            <li> I like these bottles - they arrived as promised - the bottles are clear - so it is easy to see the liquid inside when filling them</li>
            <li> Perfect! Exactly what I wanted and arrived very quickly. Was carefully packaged.</li>
            <li> At first I was happy with my purchase but soon realized that many of the bottles has tiny pieces of broken glass in them. The bottles don&#x27;t seem broken but the glass is still there. It also seems like it takes awhile for the oil to come out.</li>
            <li> Great! Fast shipping! Heads are plastic so oils need to be diluted</li>
            <li> Great product they don&#x27;t leak</li>
            <li> very good to fix liquids that can be rolled on</li>
            <li> These are pretty good rollers but one arrived broken. Other than that these rollers work well. Good quality.</li>
            <li> my last review was deleted then I was asked to review again. will do! the rollers do not fit securely on the bottles</li>
            <li> Happy with purchase, but one of the rollers on the bottle did not work. Overall a great buy!</li>
            <li> Great price but the quality is lacking. Every single roller leaks. Every one of them. I&#x27;ve purchased many different rollers from various shops and this is by far the worst quality I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Just as described. Happy with my order.</li>
            <li> These bottles were just what I was looking for!!!</li>
            <li> Great quality! Lids fit tight. Rollers stay in place!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! I just received my glass roller bottles today. When I opened it, at least one bottle was shattered or cracked. As you can see, there is glass &#x27;dust&#x27; all over the lids also.</li>
            <li> Wonderful for blending oils and don&#x27;t leak!</li>
            <li> They work wonderfully with my oil blends. The pipettes they sent were unusable when they got here, but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Solid construction.</li>
            <li> Great price!  Better than Aroma Tools price.</li>
            <li> I like them, they are ok for what I need it.</li>
            <li> I use these for essential oil blends and they are perfect.  No issues with leaking.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m set for a while for these, I wish I got the Darker color, and the straws that come with it, not much use when I have a small hole to insert into for my oils, but they will do! Thanks for an awesome deal!</li>
            <li> great for Essential Oils</li>
            <li> Nice bottles for roller blends at a great price!  Thanks so much!  Cindysessentialoils.com</li>
            <li> The three droppers are really big and DO NOT work well, they are also bent in the package and two of mine had cracks in them so they didn&#x27;t suction anyways. . The rollers do not roll smoothly at all. They also seem to leak or not seal properly when you put the roller ball top back on. Ive only used 3 so far but all three are the same that it seems oil seeps from the insert area when you are using it. I would recommend ordering smaller droppers because these ones were seriously huge and the tips didn&#x27;t even fit into my oil bottles.</li>
            <li> Great roll-on bottles. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> These are great. I was afraid they would leak but I haven&#x27;t had a problem. Great price.</li>
            <li> These we&#x27;re just what I was hoping for. Easy to put together, and work great</li>
            <li> great bottles at a great price. just wish the rollers were metal</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with my purchase however I did not receive the droppers that were to come with the bottles.</li>
            <li> They seem like good product so far but one reason why I purchased this over the other options is because it said it came with the 3 free droppers. My package did not have them. Now I have to find separate droppers and wait to fill the bottles. I&#x27;m a bit bummed.</li>
            <li> These are simple and very inexpensive.  I&#x27;ve purchased this item twice and it&#x27;s been the same quality both times.  Perfect for me!</li>
            <li> They are a great size, but the roller balls do not give a consistent application of the oil blends for which I am using them.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and as expected.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and rolls well!</li>
            <li> Bought these for my doTerra oils....  just love them!  So happy : )</li>
            <li> These worked well for essential oils</li>
            <li> Great packaging &amp; product. The pipettes that came with it were bent a bit but I was pleased with the roll on bottles!</li>
            <li> I had no problems with these bottles.  So far they seem to be working well.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with leaks and they are easy to use and look nice.  I would order again.</li>
            <li> This were great just what I wanted</li>
            <li> These looked good when they arrived but after using them for a few weeks, all of the plastic rollers have broken except for two.</li>
            <li> I tried two of these bottles and neither boll rolled well and once I did get it to roll, there was really no output.  Not sure if I just got a bad batch or what, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product.  Returning.</li>
            <li> 9 of the 24 bottles leak, due to the fact that the roller ball attachment doesn&#x27;t sit snug on the bottle.  One bottle looked like something was growing in it.  I purchased these to use with essential oils and to make travel perfumes.  The leaky ones are usable, they just have to stay upright.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 packages of these rollers as I&#x27;m using them as a promotion for my essential oil business. In the first package there were at least 3 bottles where the roller ball won&#x27;t sit flush And I&#x27;m afraid to use them and the whole roller fall out and spill oil all over. However a different brand if you let the cap sit in very hot water before use fixes this problem. I&#x27;ve not tried that with these but will. I&#x27;ve not opened the second package but hope there are no concerns about any of them. Next time I will probably purchase a different roller bottle. (The oil doesn&#x27;t consistently roll onto my skim when using it.) These bottles do work.</li>
            <li> They are small, 1/3 oz roller bottles....what else can you say?  They arrived packed well and all 24 were in the box.  :)</li>
            <li> some of them came broken,</li>
            <li> When I received these at least one bottle was broken and they were all useless, as the rollerball did not fit snuggly into the bottle.</li>
            <li> This is not the first time I ordered from them and there&#x27;s a reason for that... QUALITY!</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my needs. Received them super quick!</li>
            <li> Love mixing up my own essential oils.  I&#x27;m sure I will probably be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Decent bottles for the price. However, one of the rollers was missing a ball and hence not usable. I couldn&#x27;t find the ability to contact the seller directly on this product. If you are the seller and seeing this, it would be great if you can replace that roller top. Thank you!</li>
            <li> these are perfect for my needs</li>
            <li> These bottles are awesome.  Better than I expected</li>
            <li> Awesome! Great Quality &amp; Fast Shipping! I&#x27;ll be back for more.</li>
            <li> Excellent! Packaged very well! I will definitely buy these again!!</li>
            <li> Good bottles but a few were broken.</li>
            <li> These bottles are perfect for mixing your own essential oil blends!</li>
            <li> Good roller bottles.  Smooth motion with a good disbursement of oil.</li>
            <li> I used these bottle for a skin care oil that I make. Unlike other bottles similar to this one, Fortitude assembles fairly easily and does not leak thus far.</li>
            <li> This is a great value for the product. I was a little disappointed that the roller cap didn&#x27;t fit as snug as other bottles, but I&#x27;ve had no leakage problems at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used about half the roller balls so far and they all work as they should.</li>
            <li> About half the bottle tops (roller) didn&#x27;t snap on tightly causing the rollers to leak.</li>
            <li> Out of the 24 roller bottles in the package, several had issues. 2 had melted/warped Outer caps. 5 had roller assemblies that would not stay properly seated. I will say that ALL of the rollers roll fine. I just can&#x27;t risk using those 5 bottles for fear of leakage. The majority of the botles are great.</li>
            <li> Some of the bottles arrived broken... a bit disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great purchase. Two of the bottles were broken in the package. Other than that everything else was fine!</li>
            <li> One of the bottles was broken when I received the package in the mail.</li>
            <li> Love these roller balls I have no problems popping the roller in and all. The only downfall is that they sort of leak when there not upright. But it doesn&#x27;t leak out it just a little oily when you take the cap off. But these are great rollerballs.</li>
            <li> perfect for what I wanted them for - essential oil blends</li>
            <li> Like them! Exactly what I ordered</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted &amp; expected.</li>
            <li> Same quality I ordered from a company that sells the bottles as  well, use them for my do Terra oils</li>
            <li> I love these bottles!</li>
            <li> All the rollers roll smoothly and click into place easily. I was able to remove the rollers and refill the bottles without any problems. The only thing that bothers me is the plasticky smell of the rollers, but this smell is unnoticeable once the bottle is filled with essential oils and carrier. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Great product at great price thanks!</li>
