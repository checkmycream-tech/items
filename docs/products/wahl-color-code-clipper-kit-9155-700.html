            <li>Works great, and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It works amazing when using it your self.</li>
            <li>it clips nicely to trim beard.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re one that shave your own head and are used to being able to do that on your own.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use and handle.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy!</li>
            <li>Haircut is okay</li>
            <li>79300-400 Color Pro, which Amazon has for $2 more.</li>
            <li>I love the weight, and durability of the clippers.</li>
            <li>Typically I love their clippers.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the measurements as well as the numbers to determine which attachment to use.</li>
            <li>It is quite good for the price and doesn&#x27;t require that much effort to use it.</li>
            <li>great deal.. so easy to use and very nicely made with steel construction and very tight</li>
            <li>This is not as easy to use as the discription phamphlet says.</li>
            <li>The attachments are easy to put on and take off.  </li>
            <li>A very fantastic economical trimmer</li>
            <li>It is really light and precise.</li>
            <li>Fortunately the hair does regrow if you skin it.</li>
            <li>These are great especially for the price!</li>
            <li>have to clean it and oil</li>
            <li>I use the oil and clean them every haircut so this should not be happening.</li>
            <li>It took a while because we had to stop and clean or oil the blades.</li>
            <li>the motor is pretty strong.</li>
            <li>that a lot of noise, that if the Chinese were not served that the best was the American, anyway ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a pair of clippers before, but they were pretty cheap.</li>
            <li>its definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>so this cord model is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li>Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]] is a better value.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Some are bothered by the loud sound they make, but they aren&#x27;t too bothersome coming from someone that is used to the sound of clippers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would suggest someone with a different hair type to definitely buy these clippers&lt;br /&gt;You will be happy</li>
            <li>but the unit runs quite hot in the hand.</li>
            <li>For $2 more the American made Wahl</li>
            <li>no es para nada, de verdad se las recomiendo.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li>I usually interested of the reliability and quality of a product after 12 months.</li>
            <li>I realized it isn&#x27;t the same as the more adjustable model.  </li>
            <li>, is not uncomfortable at all, really is</li>
            <li>They are large dogs and they relaxed during the whole trim.</li>
            <li>You can not beat the price, but it vibrates so much it makes your holding hand shakes</li>
            <li>attachments are very flimsy also.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>do not use water on these as it will rust or tighten up fast.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li>It is a double cut clipper and replacement blades are available through Wahl.  </li>
            <li>Very practical.</li>
            <li>It was very inexpensive and in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>cordless ones are a bumer, the batteries die pretty fast and are not powerrfull enough for a hair cut.</li>
            <li>On top of that there is no lever to adjust to long or short cut on that clip.</li>
            <li>he adquirido un excelente producto, ruido, el normal que hacen todas, pesada sera que son debiles</li>
            <li>normal para una maquina, incomoda</li>
            <li>I am usually a fan of the Wahl cutters and trimmers, this particular model seems very cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>and I have no doubt that I have acquired an excellent product, noise, doing all the normal, heavy will that are weak or do not eat well, normal weight for a machine</li>
            <li>This is quiet enough to use on my easily scared dogs.</li>
            <li>the cord is long enough and does not get tangled that easily.</li>
            <li>After about 3 months now of using them though I wish I had spent the extra money on the more professional set.</li>
            <li>The dogs are large and double coated</li>
            <li>But the sound is a little noisy.</li>
            <li>They also do a great job at cutting.</li>
            <li>Some are made in the USA, this one (Wahl 9155-700 Color Pro 17 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit) is made in China.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product three times so far</li>
            <li>The parts are high quality and we now are (over a year later) in the process of working out which blades it takes as a replacement.  </li>
            <li>Also, the clipper size is smaller than the normal model.  </li>
            <li>Keep an eye on how hot it gets, had to take a 45min brake after hafe of my dog due to it being worm in my hand.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is loud enough to damage the hearing of the person getting hair cut.&lt;br</li>

            <li> Hopefully  it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> How long will it last before it fries?</li>
            <li> but I wonder how long it will last.</li>
            <li> Of course I could just buy a new one, but its a bit of a waste.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well but is a little loud.  </li>
            <li> There are lots of guide combs and other necessary things in the kit.</li>
            <li> It is a different haircutter with the same Color Pro logo markings but missing some features like the adjusting lever.</li>
            <li> It is a single cut clipper.  </li>
            <li> in hand (size)&lt;br /&gt;only negative thing I can think of is that the blade is no adjustable as far as wanting a closer cut.</li>
            <li> The replacement blades from Wahl specify that they are for clippers made in the USA, so the blades that come with this model may be different and the replacement blades may not fit.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this a few months ago and didn&#x27;t open the product.  </li>
            <li> I give it a 4 because it is noisier than some other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> but this version is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I also found that they are already wearing down after 5 haircuts.</li>
            <li> so at less than $20 it pays for itself in a month.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Cons- Size of the guards not good for my hair, can only use the #1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought them to use on my little 4 pound Chihuahua and they don&#x27;t even work well on her!  </li>
            <li> No more barber for my grandson!</li>
            <li> At first I was doubtful for comments he had, which was very heavy, it was uncomfortable,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it was not available when I ordered this model</li>
            <li> Is it broken?</li>
            <li> No need for expensive haircutz!</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday and was disappointed.</li>

            <li> I replaced this all steel corded haircutting shaver with a rechargeable one I had for 3 years unitl it would hold the charge anymore. This shaver looks to be hefty and made with steel.. Hopefully  it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the products that men with lost of beard and mustache should always have at home. You save hundreds of dollars in a year by doing your beard and mustache at home, rather than going to the barber and have it done for you. This is the one product and quality along with it that you should try. It is quite good for the price and doesn&#x27;t require that much effort to use it. It is really light and precise. Good product. Very good delivery range.</li>
            <li> Have used this alot. On my dog and my family (after cleaning with 91% alcohol). Keep an eye on how hot it gets, had to take a 45min brake after hafe of my dog due to it being worm in my hand.</li>
            <li> I bought this product last year and I have been very happy with it.  We cut all the family&#x27;s hair with it (well actually Dad and Boys), so at less than $20 it pays for itself in a month.  The parts are high quality and we now are (over a year later) in the process of working out which blades it takes as a replacement.  Of course I could just buy a new one, but its a bit of a waste.</li>
            <li> You can not beat the price, but it vibrates so much it makes your holding hand shakes too.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is loud enough to damage the hearing of the person getting hair cut.&lt;br /&gt;The attachments are very flimsy also.</li>
            <li> No - don&#x27;t buy these clippers.  Especially of you&#x27;re one that shave your own head and are used to being able to do that on your own.  They tug and pull.  I bought them to use on my little 4 pound Chihuahua and they don&#x27;t even work well on her!  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Received this yesterday and was disappointed. Haircut is okay but the unit runs quite hot in the hand. An electrical device that does that makes me nervous. Is it broken? How long will it last before it fries? As others have said this unit is made in China and is not interchangeable with the US made Color Pro. It is a different haircutter with the same Color Pro logo markings but missing some features like the adjusting lever. I will return this one. I might get the US made Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro, which Amazon has for $2 more. Or I might try another brand, Amazon carries a number of inexpensive haircut kits.</li>
            <li> fast shipping&lt;br /&gt;overall good product&lt;br /&gt;comfortable in hand (size)&lt;br /&gt;only negative thing I can think of is that the blade is no adjustable as far as wanting a closer cut.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I can do it myself now! No need for expensive haircutz! Thats a really great feeling and it&#x27;s easy!</li>
            <li> Left me in shock , the prize is unquestionable.&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason for you to buy this and not like it.</li>
            <li> have been using this model for over a year. its definitely worth the money. the motor is pretty strong. it clips nicely to trim beard. i use these to cut my hair as well. no fuss at all. have to clean it and oil it everytime so as to prolong the life on the product. do not use water on these as it will rust or tighten up fast. oil it every time for longeivity. the cord is long enough and does not get tangled that easily. do not fold the cord and store it as it might break and show up wires. lossely wrap the cord by itself and store it in the box. cordless ones are a bumer, the batteries die pretty fast and are not powerrfull enough for a hair cut. so this cord model is definitely worth the buy.</li>
            <li> This is not as easy to use as the discription phamphlet says. Fortunately the hair does regrow if you skin it.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to cut my husbands hair. They were a great deal. After about 3 months now of using them though I wish I had spent the extra money on the more professional set. There are no 1/2 size clips so I have to scissor his hair from #2 to 1.5. On top of that there is no lever to adjust to long or short cut on that clip. I also found that they are already wearing down after 5 haircuts. I use the oil and clean them every haircut so this should not be happening. Save the hassel and buy the nicer set.</li>
            <li> A very fantastic economical trimmer</li>
            <li> This clipper has payed for itself 10 times over! No more barber for my grandson! Works great, and easy to use. I recommend it highly!</li>
            <li> Wahl makes several models all with the name \\&quot;Color Pro\\&quot;.  Some are made in the USA, this one (Wahl 9155-700 Color Pro 17 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit) is made in China.  It is a single cut clipper.  The replacement blades from Wahl specify that they are for clippers made in the USA, so the blades that come with this model may be different and the replacement blades may not fit.  The guide combs also appear to be different.  For $2 more the American made Wahl [[ASIN:B000JNQSIQ Wahl 79300-400 Color Pro 20 Piece Complete Haircutting Kit]] is a better value.  It is a double cut clipper and replacement blades are available through Wahl.  Unfortunately it was not available when I ordered this model and I was told that the only difference was the number of attachments. I cannot comment on the quality of this model since I will be returning it and buying the USA made model, which has a good reputation.</li>
            <li> A very nice brand at a great price. Perfect for my husband who wanted it for Christmas. Inexpensive and arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Second one of these I&#x27;ve purchased!  Great pair of clippers.</li>
            <li> Product works just fine.&lt;br /&gt;Pros- Price, Ease of Use, The storage Kit&lt;br /&gt;Cons- Size of the guards not good for my hair, can only use the #1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would suggest someone with a different hair type to definitely buy these clippers&lt;br /&gt;You will be happy</li>
            <li> Opened up the package and they wouldn&#x27;t even turn on.</li>
            <li> At first I was doubtful for comments he had, which was very heavy, it was uncomfortable, that a lot of noise, that if the Chinese were not served that the best was the American, anyway ... The purchase and I have no doubt that I have acquired an excellent product, noise, doing all the normal, heavy will that are weak or do not eat well, normal weight for a machine, is not uncomfortable at all, really is I recommend them. (&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Al principio estaba dudoso por los comentarios que tenia, que era muy pesada, que era incomoda, que hacia mucho ruido, que si era la china no servia que la mejor era la americana, en fin... La compre y no me queda la menor duda que he adquirido un excelente producto, ruido, el normal que hacen todas, pesada sera que son debiles o no comen bien, pesa lo normal para una maquina, incomoda no es para nada, de verdad se las recomiendo.&amp;#34;)</li>
            <li> I will update my review after 8 months. I usually interested of the reliability and quality of a product after 12 months.</li>
            <li> great deal.. so easy to use and very nicely made with steel construction and very tight feel to the switch and snap on connectors.</li>
            <li> It works amazing when using it your self. My husband is happy  to be able to cut his hair him self.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a pair of clippers before, but they were pretty cheap. These are great especially for the price! I love the weight, and durability of the clippers. They also do a great job at cutting. My only reason for NOT giving them 5 stars is because they don&#x27;t cut as close as my last clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some are bothered by the loud sound they make, but they aren&#x27;t too bothersome coming from someone that is used to the sound of clippers.</li>
            <li> I have been buying the Wahl product for years.  Typically I love their clippers. I got into the habit of purchasing the colored model because I didn&#x27;t need to think twice about what I was getting. I ordered this a few months ago and didn&#x27;t open the product.  Now that I have I realized it isn&#x27;t the same as the more adjustable model.  Do not get this one unless you do not need the adjustment. Also, the clipper size is smaller than the normal model.  Personally, I will continue to purchase the Wahl brand but this version is not worth the money.</li>
            <li> This product does a good job of trimming hair.  The attachments are easy to put on and take off.  Everything fits neatly into the sturdy case.  I give it a 4 because it is noisier than some other trimmers.  That&#x27;s not a big deal, but it may affect some peoples&#x27; buying decisions.</li>
            <li> There are lots of guide combs and other necessary things in the kit. Very practical. But the sound is a little noisy.</li>
            <li> I Knew I was getting a good brand/product. When I gave the boys haircuts they work wonderfully. Would definitely recommend. for the price you cant beat them</li>
            <li> I have used this product three times so far and I think it is a great price for the quality. I use it for three boys and my husband. I love that it has the measurements as well as the numbers to determine which attachment to use.</li>
            <li> It feels flimsy. Does the job but I wonder how long it will last. Perhaps the newer clippers are lighter than before.</li>
            <li> This is quiet enough to use on my easily scared dogs. They are large dogs and they relaxed during the whole trim. It took a while because we had to stop and clean or oil the blades. It helped to pause and brush the trim area. The dogs are large and double coated so we only trimmed their bellies. This model did start to heat up by the second dog but that was not an issue.</li>
            <li> Works good. Still held up even after a couple years.</li>
            <li> I am usually a fan of the Wahl cutters and trimmers, this particular model seems very cheaply made.  The trimmer works well but is a little loud.  The guards and attachments are thin and do not stay on very well during use unless you really &amp;#34;baby it&amp;#34;.  It was very inexpensive and in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Great price, saves a trip to the barber shop each month. Very easy to use and handle. Would recommend this product to anyone who needs a good pair of clippers.</li>
