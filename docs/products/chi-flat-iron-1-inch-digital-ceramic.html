            <li>I love the product and I am very pleased!!!</li>
            <li>The retailer ironed my hair with a remarkable outcome.  </li>
            <li>Works magic and curls very nice!</li>
            <li>I loved this product until today.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job at straightening my hair.</li>
            <li>That being said it is a good straightener</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m biracial and have fairly course but chemically relaxed hair.</li>
            <li>it works good on my hair and straights</li>
            <li>this chi turned out to be a perfect fit.    </li>
            <li>Seen good reviews for this so bought one</li>
            <li>She loved that it was purple and took it with her when she went home.</li>
            <li>It was shiny and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li>I chose titanium over ceramic because (to me) titanium works just as good as ceramic</li>
            <li>so I will say it is a good buy.</li>
            <li>just do not feel this was a good product for me.  </li>
            <li>THIS ONE WORKED REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li>and she loved it.</li>
            <li>and she just loved it.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s good because she is a Afro-American girl with kinky hair.</li>
            <li>It does not work good on my hair at all.</li>
            <li>It may work good for others</li>
            <li>After 3 years it&#x27;s still going strong!!</li>
            <li>Great seller, fast delivery and great price!</li>

            <li>It heats up fast and does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li>you have to go through amazon who really does not care whether you are happy with your order or not!</li>
            <li>She was thrilled.</li>
            <li>so I could keep my own hair up</li>
            <li>but I always hesitated with the Chi, because it was kind of pricey</li>
            <li>This has nice even heat when it works</li>
            <li>It gives more a bump closer to my root which is good for volume</li>
            <li>straightens my hair just as nice....</li>
            <li>I really liked it however honestly</li>
            <li>I liked the auto shut off feature.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the newer version from QVC and it had some nice features...</li>
            <li>WHAT KIND</li>
            <li>It was good, but I think I might like the ceramic better.</li>
            <li>The color was nice but it didnt do as promised</li>
            <li>the best hair straightener for me so far!!!</li>

            <li>I loved that it heated up quickly and had temperature settings!  </li>
            <li>It heats up fairly quick, straightens very nicely, and you can curl with it.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best straightener i have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing product that has ever been invented.  </li>
            <li>but this is by far the best chi or hair starightner</li>

            <li>The purple is more of a pinkish color</li>
            <li>For the price of this unit...there should have been a much better on/off control panel.</li>
            <li>Great product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>It is however, not an authentic Chi.  </li>

            <li>It heats up fast and works through my hair great.</li>

            <li>The titanium plate does work better than the ceramic.</li>
            <li>This iron is okay</li>
            <li>but I expect better quality from Chi.</li>

            <li>but I loved it soo much</li>
            <li>The adjustable tempurature is great &amp; it heats up super fast</li>
            <li>Very good flat iron.</li>
            <li>The best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some of the other CHI models.</li>
            <li>Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to handle, Settings have option to increase or decrease the heat.</li>
            <li>a super cheap and PURPLE chi - what more could a girl ask for :)</li>
            <li>It makes my wavey hair easily strait.</li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and quality is just as it stated.</li>
            <li>While in use you can easily turn it off without realizing it.</li>
            <li>Bought this for her a couple years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Hands down one of the best straighteners I ever owned</li>
            <li>They get my hair straight fast and it looks very nice and healthy.</li>
            <li>It is a really great product, and I have had several Chi&#x27;s, but this is by far the absolute best!</li>
            <li>I have fine hair for an African-American</li>
            <li>This is a legitamate Chi flat iron and works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny :-)</li>
            <li>A plus is all the controls light up.  </li>
            <li>This CHI does not pull your hair, it glides SMOOTHLY through your hair and it straightens it without having to keep going over it a couple times.</li>
            <li>I must say the deep brilliance titanium is great.</li>
            <li>I do not need a lot of heat to smooth out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>my co-workers (who didn&#x27;t know that I got this for Christmas) made comments on how smooth and shiny my hair looked.</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and it leaves the hair nice and silky looking.</li>
            <li>I am so glad he did, it is much lighter to handle than my old one and works great.</li>
            <li>I have wanted a chi for a while because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li>The pitch says the iron will leave your hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li>The iron is smooth-</li>
            <li>It was great for the price and worked like the one that I had prior to this.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>love love , shipping was fast got here on time .</li>
            <li>We have used it 3 times and so far so good.</li>
            <li>I just love it,its the best flat iron ever,my hair is soft  and silky after i used,i recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks!!!</li>
            <li>This is my first Chi!!</li>
            <li>Very useful purchase.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard/read that these are supposed to be really great flat irons</li>
            <li>They have great flat irons.</li>
            <li>The Chi flat iron is a great product to have.</li>
            <li>Great flat iron of course!</li>
            <li>The adjustable temperature is also nice, so if I don&#x27;t want the high heat, I can set it to a lower temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Enjoying the product very much.  </li>
            <li>I love that it gives me a choice of how hot I want it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am overall very satisfied with the product--and am, of course, thrilled to have straight hair again!</li>
            <li>I have the original CHI</li>
            <li>EXCITING!  </li>
            <li>and since we didnt keep the original reciept we looked to the warranty that was void because it was an online purchase.</li>
            <li>I have always used the original CHI irons and decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter, she finally has her own CHI straightener!</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this flat iron</li>
            <li>My friends, who own authentic Chi straighteners, actually said \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t know a Chi could break!  </li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this CHI flat iron!!!</li>
            <li>It gets hot, it heats up fast, it does what its supposed to and its purple, I love purple. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>It is nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Chi is by far the best brand of flat iron on the market - the fact that this was under $100 is just a bonus!</li>
            <li>I love the quality of the iron and how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li>The Chi Deep Brilliance flat iron works great on all types of hair and i love using it!</li>
            <li>I was thrilled when Farouk introduced the Chi Deep Brilliance Titanium iron at such a great price</li>
            <li>but it wasnt a full refund...</li>
            <li>and since I also need something over 400 degrees figured this would be good since this is the same brand my stylist uses.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cool looking, give it that.</li>
            <li>but I love for it to be straight</li>
            <li>It was not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li>I was so excited about owning a flat iron, and I chose the Chi because I have used their hair products and always loved the results from their serum, shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair nice and smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li>The seller was fabulous about handling the return and refunded my purchase right away, no questions asked.</li>
            <li>It heats up very quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li>The whole process was fast and safe!</li>
            <li>I loved that flat iron and have to admit that I was heartbroken when I dropped it</li>
            <li>I love the digital temperature display and being able to adjust the temperature.  </li>
            <li>RECIEVED QUICKLY,</li>
            <li>Warms quickly and does the job.</li>
            <li>My hair is SUPER curly</li>
            <li>Bought for my daughter and received quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is product arrived promptly from \\&quot;Quick E Mart\\&quot;, which is the Amazon seller for this product.  </li>
            <li>It worked wonderfully for about a month of regular use, then all of a sudden</li>
            <li>To add insult to injury, the warranty is void if not purchased from an authorized dealer (which \\&quot;Quick E Mart\\&quot; is not).  </li>
            <li>Initially I purchased the original Chi which did a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>The chi deep brilliance hair styling flat iron is excellent for my doughter</li>
            <li>, she love this flat iron is a lot better than others.</li>
            <li>My New CHI IRON, is just what most of the reviews says it is.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it was that my original chi was getting older and worn, but I don&#x27;t remember it ever feeling that smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty too!</li>
            <li>Not only did she love it, but I did too!</li>
            <li>This is my 2nd Chi and I love it!</li>
            <li>Is is a better experience to go to a professional hair salon!</li>
            <li>Works well, and straightens curly latina hair pretty well!</li>
            <li>My hair looked pretty good this morning right after I&#x27;d flat ironed it</li>

            <li>I am sooooo happy with my new flat iron!</li>
            <li>I certaintly was missing a great product.  </li>
            <li>So, my fiancé absolutely loves this, and raved about how smooth it was to use.</li>
            <li>as a woman with extra curly hair i found MY CHI AMAZING.</li>
            <li>So I use one just to smooth out the wave to make it completely straight.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would of liked it to come wtih is a stand to rest it on.</li>
            <li>so that was exciting too.  </li>
            <li>Retail price for this jewel is worth over $200.00 and I paid $75...</li>
            <li>worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li>The digital display is a nice addition.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>Considering it works well, it may be worth the price.  </li>
            <li>I love the color the size and how it does my hair because I have a natural</li>
            <li>I have strangers commenting on how great my hair looks and even trying to touch it (which is very odd).  </li>
            <li>Received it in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li>Came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I have straight hair medium length that is pretty fine.</li>
            <li>Even a hair novice like myself can use it and its easy and leaves my hair strait and super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about six months now and I am loving it.  </li>
            <li>She had the other CHI for 7 years and loved it</li>

            <li>HEATED UP FAST, THE SCREEN WAS COOL AND THE SHUTOFF TIMER WAS COOL.AND</li>
            <li>I like the really long cord though and the color is nice.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase it.  </li>
            <li>but this made my little girl smile, and she said I did a good job.</li>
            <li>I have always loved CHI products, so when I saw this new titanium flat iron I didn´t hesitate on buying it.</li>
            <li>worked great on my natural hair, love the timer and the extra long cord.</li>
            <li>Would certainly recommend to anyone considering!  </li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Product came really quick and was very pleases with it.</li>
            <li>leaves hair super straight .</li>

            <li>Heats up very fast, doesn&#x27;t smell burnt.  </li>
            <li>My wife is also thrilled with her new soft straight hair.</li>
            <li>It was cheap but still works better than any other straightner I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the digital display, it makes it very easy to determine how hot the flat iron is</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too thanks!!</li>
            <li>It was brand new, in the original box.</li>
            <li>The digital temp is easy to read and the iron heats up quickly.</li>
            <li>cool blue light that reads temperature status.</li>
            <li>I thought that it would be too hot or damaging to my hair.  </li>
            <li>I love this flatiron ever since I saw it on tv &amp; finally found it on amazon</li>
            <li>Bite the bullet and get a Chi the first time.</li>
            <li>I have pretty curly hair</li>
            <li>This is my first day of using it</li>
            <li>and I really like it!  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s exactly what it does.</li>
            <li>I love the way this iron makes my hair feel, but my fingers constantly hit the power button and it keeps turning off on me!</li>
            <li>and I actually think I like this one better.</li>
            <li>I love my chi deep brilliance..</li>
            <li>the flatiron gets pretty hot but works well on lower setting for her hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better than a regular Chi.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better than a regular Chi.  </li>
            <li>Love the digital setting.</li>
            <li>the description was vague at best.  </li>
            <li>This is designed for a more coarse hair than my wife&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>Has a timer also if you&#x27;re kind of forgetful and don&#x27;t remember to turn it off.  </li>
            <li>Love the digital controls!</li>
            <li>If you try and buy this in any  retail store it would be more than double the price.</li>
            <li>My first day of using it, I went to work and</li>
            <li>It got hot immediately</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I was a believer.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>However I got exactly three uses out of it before it stopped working.  </li>
            <li>;) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li>The section of the iron where the plates are does get hot, but the handle where your hand grips the iron doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>FIRST OFF, I HAVE AN ACUTAL CHI(REAL ONE)</li>
            <li>AT FIRST</li>
            <li>THIS IS THIER EXACT RESPONSE</li>
            <li>I use this product daily and love it.</li>
            <li>I am not a big fan of the color, but I love it.</li>
            <li>My hair is always soft and smooth after using.</li>
            <li>works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Heats up quickly, would highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li>I have purchased different CHI flat iron models over the last 5 years, and this one works the best.</li>
            <li>Too keep the hair healthy only flat iron it twice a month at the most.  </li>
            <li>I only straighten my hair 1 or 2 a year, but with my new Chi, I will be wearing my hair sleek and straight more often!</li>
            <li>bought it for 16yr old daughter who has fine fairly straight hair.</li>
            <li>It was only $5.00 but the point was to fit the hot tool i have!  </li>
            <li>Many hair professionals have suggested a Chi flat iron and I never thought I could afford one.</li>
            <li>I love my chi flat irons.</li>
            <li>My hair smells more burned than it did after flat ironing it with the ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this because my lovely wife asked for a Chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li>The Chi flat iron is just ok.  </li>
            <li>I love the Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>Works ok, doesn&#x27;t seem to flatten as well as my original black Chi with the tan panels.</li>
            <li>When I asked if she liked the new flat iron, she said &amp;#34;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>Not only a great price but also love the fact of changing the temperature which is not possible with other Chi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Love this flat iron!</li>
            <li>I have really curly, dry, frizzy hair and have read several reviews on different websites on which flat iron is best, and all website said different ones, so I just decided to try this one after reading reviews on here, and it amazing!  </li>
            <li>I received my flat iron a day before I was to take a trip to attend a very important function, and I really needed to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is exactly what I wanted!!!</li>
            <li>I have had many brand name very high priced flat irons.</li>
            <li>It hears up really fast and really hot.</li>
            <li>so I just marked the price up a bit and resold it on Swap-Shop for a cool $19 profit...</li>
            <li>Like the digital thermostat, easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>Only reason not 5 stars cuz you do have to reset timer each time and that&#x27;s easy to forget when in a hurry.</li>
            <li>A couple minutes later, when the hair isn&#x27;t becoming straight, I realize the Chi is off.</li>
            <li>It has a digital temperature display so you can easily change the temp to the desired temperature for your hair.</li>
            <li>Other flat irons I have used didn&#x27;t do the job, but this one is great and leaves my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love my new chi deep brilliance!</li>
            <li>i was pretty apprehensive about the \\&quot;deep brilliance\\&quot; aspect of it, because i thought it may be too powerful for my hair or just not the right make for it</li>
            <li>It heats up fine but never fully straightened my hair and left if feeling silky.</li>
            <li>I think if I had purchased a different model it would have been fine as well.  </li>
            <li>I will be trying a different brand the next time I am able to get a straightener!</li>
            <li>in all I would say that it&#x27;s a pretty decent iron...</li>
            <li>I would say that it&#x27;s a pretty decent iron...</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take more than a few passes to make it straight.</li>
            <li>This is the first flat iron that has actually accomplished that!!!</li>
            <li>This little gizmo does a great job with my curls and has finally given me the sleek look that I have wanted.</li>
            <li>This flat iron has easily cut my &amp;#34;styling time&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Love my new flat iron!</li>
            <li>It arrived within a few days from the actual order and in great shape.</li>
            <li>it works really well.</li>
            <li>Heats up really fast.  </li>
            <li>My hair has never been so silky or straight.  </li>
            <li>so we&#x27;ll see how well my hair stays straight throughout the day.</li>
            <li>THANKS</li>
            <li>I doubt this is a real chi by the price and now by the quality.  </li>
            <li>I have very curly hair and wanted to make it straight</li>
            <li>The design of the casing around the titanium plates is very square.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and my hair looks sleek and straight throughout the day...</li>
            <li>but I wish I would have just gone ahead and paid twice the amount and gotten a real one with a warranty.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really curl like I would like it to on Brazilian wavy hair.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair</li>
            <li>&amp; I can get it completely straight in 15 min.</li>
            <li>I REALLY like how it&#x27;s set to shut off automatically.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>straight.</li>
            <li>Way to much money for a crappy product.  </li>
            <li>I have very course and curly hair</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>They really straighten kinky hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast working and leaves a shine</li>
            <li>shipping was fast and it takes about 1 minute for my straightener to heat up to the max</li>
            <li>It is very durable.</li>
            <li>The plates also heat up really fast.</li>
            <li>and I had to put it on the highest settint to even get it straight which can be very damaging.  </li>
            <li>And to get it reasonably straight</li>
            <li>and I thought it was real.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and purchase a REAL Chi from an authorized dealer (check out the Chi product website for that info).  </li>
            <li>Would recommend if you need your hair straight.</li>
            <li>This straightener works really well.</li>
            <li>Many a time with her old straightener, I would find it on,   only to burn a hole on the vanity.</li>
            <li>I purchased my first Chi flat iron--the original Chi--about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>inch flat iron thinking it would take forever, but I was pretty amazed at how fast and effective this flat iron works on my hair.</li>
            <li>The cost was very economical and I will look to AMAZON for future purchases.</li>
            <li>the hot pink colour makes it easy to find....</li>
            <li>This Chi Deep Brilliance heats up pretty quickly...</li>
            <li>At first I sometimes hit the buttons on the side with my thumb when picking it up but only for the first 2 days, now I have it down and love it!</li>
            <li>I have extremely curly hair and have used many different flat irons in attempt to get that nice sleek look without the bumps and frizz.</li>
            <li>I am cheap and my sister wanted a Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>Normal wear and tear!</li>
            <li>I have never had a flat iron that gets this hot, so quickly yet does not burn my hair.</li>
            <li>At first I could not get it to turn on and was ready to send it back, but the always patient hubby turned it right on.</li>
            <li>Spend a few more bucks and purchase a REAL one!</li>
            <li>and if u are not careful or spray the hair with spray guard first it will burn your HAIR!</li>
            <li>and my daughter is very pleased with how well it works and is not as hard on her hair.</li>
            <li>so much better Heats up fast and takes half the time.</li>
            <li>It gets hot quick and the cord is really long</li>
            <li>You can clearly see when the iron is at your desired temperature and you can choose how hot you want the iron to get.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my daughter to replace her CHI original ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li>I have owned 2 chi&#x27;s before this one and this is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Shipping was a little slow, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>This is great, I have very thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my wife, she had the classic 1\\&quot; Chi for YEARS</li>
            <li>LOVE the Chi brand but was REALLY dissapointed to see that it didnt work but a few months</li>
            <li>BOUGHT TO REPLACE AN OLDER CHI</li>
            <li>I was incredibly disappointed because this was the first CHI I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve always heard wonderful things about these straighteners from everyone I know.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get a chi, I had wanted one for a long time.  </li>
            <li>When we got it we thought we were going to have problems because it said \\&quot;for highly textured hair\\</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and using Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if that means that the temperature setting is too high</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t heat up as high as i hoped.</li>
            <li>Heats up Super Fast and cools down Very Fast.  </li>
            <li>This flat iron heats up nicely, however it is really rough on my hair.</li>
            <li>Received it yesterday and wow!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, her hair was more than a little silky afterwards.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at first because many digital flat irons are not as good as they say they are on the box or on the site you buy them on.</li>
            <li>Bought for my wife..not to expensive but works great</li>
            <li>The titanium blades leaves my very curly hair, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised with how fast the product was shipped.</li>
            <li>I bought these flat irons for my little sister for Christmas,and she loves them, they are worth the price I paid for them and more.</li>
            <li>I was able to straighten, curl and volumize my hair in less than 15 minutes!</li>
            <li>Overall a great little product!!!</li>
            <li>bad for a nice and good looking Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li>My d-i-l&#x27;s control panel is not on the actual flat iron, and a much better control system; it is not that soft rubber that sticks.</li>
            <li>The shipping was fast, and the flat iron works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and stays level when you lay it down, so no accidental burns on my vanity.</li>
            <li>Titanium plates don&#x27;t live up to hype.</li>
            <li>I can live with that though.  </li>
            <li>OR A NEW ONE</li>
            <li>the consideration of your safety and beauty, we suggest that you buy a new CHI straightener instead.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a new Chi for my daughter</li>
            <li>I will plug it in and let it warm up but after flat ironing half of my hair it seems cooler.</li>
            <li>Gets really jot quick an stays hot unlike all the other flat irons</li>
            <li>Coming from california to the far east coast!</li>
            <li>and it has completely stopped working!</li>
            <li>People keep commenting on my hair ever since I started using the Chi to complete the look!</li>
            <li>it then will get hot again but it will show that the temperature is actually 20 degrees or so cooler than what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li>AND IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOOO SOFT FOR DAYS!</li>
            <li>Happy customer, will never own anything other than a CHI.</li>
            <li>I purchased it thinking it would be different then the cheap Remington flat iron I bought at Sally Beauty Supply because it said for textured hair.  </li>
            <li>It leaves it soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>I love my Chi Deep Brilliance Digital Flat Iron.</li>
            <li>My CHI straightener was beginning to get old, so I decided i needed a new one.</li>
            <li>And even though it gets pretty hot, I didn&#x27;t burn myself at all, which is a pretty common thing with me.</li>
            <li>It heats up in seconds, gets really hot, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some flat irons do</li>
            <li>The first purchase was last year for my oldest daughter and she loves it so much I bought another one for my younger daughter.  </li>
            <li>It Didnt even get as hot as the inexpensive flat iron I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li>I can flat iron natural hair and weaved hair bone straight !  </li>
            <li>The only drawback: the buttons for adjusting the temperature and timer are on the side as opposed to the lower interior part, so you may have to hold it a certain way to avoid pushing them with your fingers.</li>
            <li>However the plates are not the only thing that gets hot, but the whole flat iron does</li>
            <li>so it isn&#x27;t hard to straighten, but it leaves my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>The only problems with my older one was it started pulling my hair, and that I would forget to turn it of ALL THE TIME!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it burns my hair any more or any less than the ceramic flat irons I&#x27;ve had before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not waste your time buying it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap irons.</li>
            <li>my hair is silky soft</li>
            <li>The only way I could get it straight was when I got my hair cut and styled.</li>
            <li>Let me just say this has never been dropped or near water.  </li>
            <li>ONLY REAL Chi&#x27;s are MADE IN THE U.S.A. -</li>
            <li>This works just as well as any CHI or professional iron.</li>
            <li>The plug of my old chi with ceramic plates cracked after being dropped.</li>
            <li>Was really reluctant to buy a 2nd Chi but did from a authorized STORE nearby.</li>
            <li>I was surprised because it&#x27;s a Chi.</li>
            <li>My professional hair stylist is the one who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised having this happen</li>
            <li>This is my first Chi that has lasted this long (knock on wood).</li>
            <li>I am on a hair journey and growing my natural hair out.</li>
            <li>After some research and asking some friends and professional hair stylist, I decided on this item.</li>
            <li>I have shoulder length hair and is natural curly somewhat and has frizz.</li>
            <li>I had to wash my hair over and use my old straightener.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair shiny and straight and it last for days.</li>
            <li>It was no different and my hair is not as straight as I would like.  </li>
            <li>I JUST WANTED IT FIXED.</li>
            <li>The effect last through rainy weather and intense exercise.  </li>
            <li>with the deep brilliance, the plates are titanium, which I find much smoother than the ceramic plates.</li>
            <li>I have only had it for a few days, but I am absolutely in love.</li>
            <li>This flat iron is not only for ethnic hair, but also great for coarse, hard to manage hair.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight, heats quickly, and has an extra long cord.</li>
            <li>This product did not work and studying other videos about the authenticity of a real Chi, this one did not have the raised words on the inside like a real Chi has.</li>
            <li>I really like flat iron.</li>
            <li>and I have always struggled with flat irons to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li>the flat iron gets her hair really straight</li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li>Before this straightener I had a more expensive Chi that worked really well!</li>
            <li>but overall a decent purchase.</li>
            <li>It can damage your hair if high heat is used too often, especially without product protection for your hair.</li>
            <li>The heat is high enough to straighten out frizz and give your hair the sleek groomed look you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li>I will be more careful in the future and extremely careful about return policies.</li>
            <li>and this gets my hair really straight and doesn&#x27;t take a long time.  </li>
            <li>Be careful with how hot you make this product.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>She also loves the Hot Pink color (It is not purple).</li>
            <li>The styling iron is a hot pink color, not purple as advertised.</li>
            <li>I have really curly hair and live where it is extremely humid but it works</li>
            <li>I spend to much money on my hair and products for my hair to let it get ruined by poor products, and when you spend this kind of money it should last a long time like my solia that I have had for 3 yrs.  </li>
            <li>I recently went natural and this flat iron really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>and they told me that this iron was the new and improved Farouk Deep Brilliance.  </li>
            <li>High quality flat iron.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this flat iron.  </li>
            <li>I mainly have straight hair with a slight wave.</li>
            <li>When I take the time to flat iron my hair in the morning it normally holds up all day...</li>
            <li>When I take the time to flat iron my hair in the morning it normally holds up all day...</li>
            <li>so I was aware how to use it, but the on button (black soft rubber) got stuck and no matter what I did</li>
            <li>I only have to flat iron each section once to achieve a straight look.</li>
            <li>so I pretty much been flat ironing my hair almost everyday since I was 14</li>
            <li>&amp; in a short period of time my long hair is now straight,  </li>
            <li>The description wasn&#x27;t clear enough for me to know this</li>
            <li>I do have to be careful to take small chunks of hair to achieve my goal but it works much better than the Chi.</li>
            <li>When I first bought it i will admit i was a bit reserved; because i have 2 daughters with semi-coarse hair and other flat irons really did not flatten properly; however just one use of this CHI DEEP BRILLIANCE!!!</li>
            <li>I bought this chi to replace my old chi that was starting to damage my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I actually contacted Farouk directly before I purchased the iron</li>
            <li>Barely lasted 4 months.  </li>
            <li>The color is nice but the design is definitely flawed...</li>
            <li>The color is nice but the design is definitely flawed...</li>
            <li>, normally it&#x27;s sort of a guessing game with the slider dials, but this is simple and easy.</li>
            <li>Heats up in less than a minute and stays hot.  </li>
            <li>As I read in some of the other reviews, iron did not function straight out of the box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a heavier flat iron which I was surprised about.</li>
            <li>I suppose but my hair wasn&#x27;t as sleek and straight as it was with my other</li>
            <li>My 13 year old asked for a flat iron.</li>
            <li>(I have normal hair, mid-length, naturally a wavy curl, not thick or thin), so I immediately went on a mission to find a new Chi.  </li>
            <li>and I received a complete diff brand that only fits my 1&#x27;&#x27; flat iron.  </li>
            <li>and I have used it consistently almost everyday since it has arrived.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair- not tight curls, and in less than 10 minutes, this flat iron will leave my hair straight.</li>
            <li>I previously purchased a Chi Smart styling iron from QVC.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it would get too hot, but it is fine on any setting.</li>
            <li>My hair is long, thick, heavy and naturally curly and this product made it have the L.A. smooth, straight look; needless to say I love it.</li>
            <li>Color, temp control, smooth finish, and the little sample that comes with it!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is not course or super thick but it is wavy.</li>
            <li>, i had to learn the hard way this CHI GETS EXTREMELY HOT!</li>
            <li>This product was a little to much for my needs.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> That being said it is a good straightener</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m biracial and have fairly course but chemically relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> it works good on my hair and straights</li>
            <li> this chi turned out to be a perfect fit.    </li>
            <li> Seen good reviews for this so bought one</li>
            <li> She loved that it was purple and took it with her when she went home.</li>
            <li> It was shiny and gorgeous.  </li>
            <li> I chose titanium over ceramic because (to me) titanium works just as good as ceramic</li>
            <li> so I will say it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> just do not feel this was a good product for me.  </li>
            <li> THIS ONE WORKED REALLY GOOD</li>
            <li> and she loved it.</li>
            <li> and she just loved it.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s good because she is a Afro-American girl with kinky hair.</li>
            <li> It does not work good on my hair at all.</li>
            <li> It may work good for others</li>
            <li> After 3 years it&#x27;s still going strong!!</li>
            <li> Great seller, fast delivery and great price!</li>

            <li> This Chi is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Chi has always been an amazing produce.</li>
            <li> I could amazingly see the difference in my hair.  </li>

            <li> It heats up fast and does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> you have to go through amazon who really does not care whether you are happy with your order or not!</li>
            <li> She was thrilled.</li>
            <li> so I could keep my own hair up</li>
            <li> but I always hesitated with the Chi, because it was kind of pricey</li>
            <li> This has nice even heat when it works</li>
            <li> It gives more a bump closer to my root which is good for volume</li>
            <li> straightens my hair just as nice....</li>
            <li> I really liked it however honestly</li>
            <li> I liked the auto shut off feature.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the newer version from QVC and it had some nice features...</li>
            <li> WHAT KIND</li>
            <li> It was good, but I think I might like the ceramic better.</li>
            <li> The color was nice but it didnt do as promised</li>
            <li> the best hair straightener for me so far!!!</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned, heats up within seconds and I greatly recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy one.</li>

            <li> I loved that it heated up quickly and had temperature settings!  </li>

            <li> this is by far the best straightener i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing product that has ever been invented.  </li>
            <li> but this is by far the best chi or hair starightner</li>
            <li> Perfect for natural curly hair.</li>

            <li> My Farouk Deep Brilliance is still working perfectly but</li>

            <li> I love CHI.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying it with out any complaints.</li>
            <li> The purple is more of a pinkish color</li>
            <li> For the price of this unit...there should have been a much better on/off control panel.</li>
            <li> Great product for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> It is however, not an authentic Chi.  </li>
            <li> , I tried every outlet in the house just hoping one of them would be the magic one that got it working again.  </li>
            <li> It heats up fast and works through my hair great.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that with the titanium plates I do not get static.</li>
            <li> they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I am a former hairstylist, and I can say that this is definitely an exceptional tool!!!</li>
            <li> I also love the product sample that came with it;will</li>
            <li> The straightener wouldn&#x27;t stay on for more than 30 seconds.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had fabulous results with each use!</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I needed better flatirons and I&#x27;m glad I chose these after recommendations.</li>
            <li> The titanium plate does work better than the ceramic.</li>
            <li> This iron is okay</li>
            <li> but I expect better quality from Chi.</li>
            <li> Now her family has took it over and they all love it.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> and I have to say its a fabulous deal!</li>
            <li> Plus, I bought it in the purple color and it is really cute.</li>
            <li> I wish I would have bought myself one too. :-)</li>
            <li> I love this straightener.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I got this one.</li>
            <li> Love the on off switch and the option to pick the temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with it.</li>
            <li> Another pro was being able to set a timer so if I forget to turn it off, it does it for me!I</li>

            <li> Very easy to use and very quick.</li>

            <li> And its the best flat iron iv ever had.</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used.</li>
            <li> 4 years since I&#x27;ve purchased this flat iron and it is still in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> It works like a charm and was at a great price considering what most new ones cost.</li>
            <li> It is also very light weight and easy to lift up over your head for extended periods of time.</li>
            <li> But I learned to use it pretty good</li>
            <li> I loved my first one, it wokred for a week.</li>
            <li> Results are great and fast since it gets very HOT!</li>
            <li> The plates are even smoother than the original!</li>
            <li> This warms up fast, is very durable and works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure that the product will work fine.</li>
            <li> this did not turn out to be the ideal product which i bought for my daughter who already has a flat iron she was wanting one that gets hotter.. for better performance</li>
            <li> This straightener is super easy to use and my hair looks amazing.  </li>
            <li> I love the smooth results every time</li>
            <li> It heats up in seconds and leaves my hair smooth shiny and healthy...</li>
            <li> The delivery was swift and of course you have to love free shipping.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this Chi hot iron for my wife and she is very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> It is working exactly as was told in the description, very glad we got it.</li>
            <li> leaves hair straight and looking gorgeous.</li>
            <li> but I loved it soo much</li>
            <li> The adjustable tempurature is great &amp; it heats up super fast</li>
            <li> Very good flat iron.</li>
            <li> The best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some of the other CHI models.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, Settings have option to increase or decrease the heat.</li>
            <li> a super cheap and PURPLE chi - what more could a girl ask for :)</li>
            <li> It makes my wavey hair easily strait.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and quality is just as it stated.</li>
            <li> While in use you can easily turn it off without realizing it.</li>
            <li> Bought this for her a couple years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Hands down one of the best straighteners I ever owned</li>
            <li> They get my hair straight fast and it looks very nice and healthy.</li>
            <li> It is a really great product, and I have had several Chi&#x27;s, but this is by far the absolute best!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair for an African-American</li>
            <li> This is a legitamate Chi flat iron and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny :-)</li>
            <li> A plus is all the controls light up.  </li>
            <li> This CHI does not pull your hair, it glides SMOOTHLY through your hair and it straightens it without having to keep going over it a couple times.</li>
            <li> I must say the deep brilliance titanium is great.</li>
            <li> I do not need a lot of heat to smooth out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> my co-workers (who didn&#x27;t know that I got this for Christmas) made comments on how smooth and shiny my hair looked.</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and it leaves the hair nice and silky looking.</li>
            <li> I am so glad he did, it is much lighter to handle than my old one and works great.</li>
            <li> I have wanted a chi for a while because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about it.</li>
            <li> The pitch says the iron will leave your hair smooth and shiny.  </li>
            <li> The iron is smooth-</li>
            <li> It was great for the price and worked like the one that I had prior to this.</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> love love , shipping was fast got here on time .</li>
            <li> We have used it 3 times and so far so good.</li>
            <li> I just love it,its the best flat iron ever,my hair is soft  and silky after i used,i recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first Chi!!</li>
            <li> Very useful purchase.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard/read that these are supposed to be really great flat irons</li>
            <li> They have great flat irons.</li>
            <li> The Chi flat iron is a great product to have.</li>
            <li> Great flat iron of course!</li>
            <li> The adjustable temperature is also nice, so if I don&#x27;t want the high heat, I can set it to a lower temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Enjoying the product very much.  </li>
            <li> I love that it gives me a choice of how hot I want it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am overall very satisfied with the product--and am, of course, thrilled to have straight hair again!</li>
            <li> I have the original CHI</li>
            <li> EXCITING!  </li>
            <li> and since we didnt keep the original reciept we looked to the warranty that was void because it was an online purchase.</li>
            <li> I have always used the original CHI irons and decided to try this one out.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she finally has her own CHI straightener!</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this flat iron</li>
            <li> My friends, who own authentic Chi straighteners, actually said \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t know a Chi could break!  </li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this CHI flat iron!!!</li>
            <li> It gets hot, it heats up fast, it does what its supposed to and its purple, I love purple. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> It is nothing special.  </li>
            <li> Chi is by far the best brand of flat iron on the market - the fact that this was under $100 is just a bonus!</li>
            <li> I love the quality of the iron and how fast it heats up.</li>
            <li> The Chi Deep Brilliance flat iron works great on all types of hair and i love using it!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled when Farouk introduced the Chi Deep Brilliance Titanium iron at such a great price</li>
            <li> but it wasnt a full refund...</li>
            <li> and since I also need something over 400 degrees figured this would be good since this is the same brand my stylist uses.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool looking, give it that.</li>
            <li> but I love for it to be straight</li>
            <li> It was not a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I was so excited about owning a flat iron, and I chose the Chi because I have used their hair products and always loved the results from their serum, shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair nice and smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> The seller was fabulous about handling the return and refunded my purchase right away, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> It heats up very quickly and stays hot.</li>
            <li> The whole process was fast and safe!</li>
            <li> I loved that flat iron and have to admit that I was heartbroken when I dropped it</li>
            <li> I love the digital temperature display and being able to adjust the temperature.  </li>
            <li> RECIEVED QUICKLY,</li>
            <li> Warms quickly and does the job.</li>
            <li> My hair is SUPER curly</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and received quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is product arrived promptly from \\&quot;Quick E Mart\\&quot;, which is the Amazon seller for this product.  </li>
            <li> It worked wonderfully for about a month of regular use, then all of a sudden</li>
            <li> To add insult to injury, the warranty is void if not purchased from an authorized dealer (which \\&quot;Quick E Mart\\&quot; is not).  </li>
            <li> Initially I purchased the original Chi which did a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> The chi deep brilliance hair styling flat iron is excellent for my doughter</li>
            <li> , she love this flat iron is a lot better than others.</li>
            <li> My New CHI IRON, is just what most of the reviews says it is.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it was that my original chi was getting older and worn, but I don&#x27;t remember it ever feeling that smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty too!</li>
            <li> Not only did she love it, but I did too!</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Chi and I love it!</li>
            <li> Is is a better experience to go to a professional hair salon!</li>
            <li> Works well, and straightens curly latina hair pretty well!</li>
            <li> My hair looked pretty good this morning right after I&#x27;d flat ironed it</li>

            <li> I am sooooo happy with my new flat iron!</li>
            <li> I certaintly was missing a great product.  </li>
            <li> So, my fiancé absolutely loves this, and raved about how smooth it was to use.</li>
            <li> as a woman with extra curly hair i found MY CHI AMAZING.</li>
            <li> So I use one just to smooth out the wave to make it completely straight.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would of liked it to come wtih is a stand to rest it on.</li>
            <li> so that was exciting too.  </li>
            <li> Retail price for this jewel is worth over $200.00 and I paid $75...</li>
            <li> worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li> The digital display is a nice addition.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> Considering it works well, it may be worth the price.  </li>
            <li> I love the color the size and how it does my hair because I have a natural</li>
            <li> I have strangers commenting on how great my hair looks and even trying to touch it (which is very odd).  </li>
            <li> Received it in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li> Came quickly and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I have straight hair medium length that is pretty fine.</li>
            <li> Even a hair novice like myself can use it and its easy and leaves my hair strait and super shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about six months now and I am loving it.  </li>
            <li> She had the other CHI for 7 years and loved it</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly, gets very hot and leaves my hair very shiny&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> The price was definitely right.</li>
            <li> RIGHT ON IT</li>
            <li> and I purchased it right away.  </li>
            <li> and I used it right away.</li>
            <li> This iron worked great for the few days it worked!  </li>
            <li> HEATED UP FAST, THE SCREEN WAS COOL AND THE SHUTOFF TIMER WAS COOL.AND</li>
            <li> I like the really long cord though and the color is nice.</li>
            <li> I honestly don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase it.  </li>
            <li> but this made my little girl smile, and she said I did a good job.</li>
            <li> I have always loved CHI products, so when I saw this new titanium flat iron I didn´t hesitate on buying it.</li>
            <li> worked great on my natural hair, love the timer and the extra long cord.</li>
            <li> Would certainly recommend to anyone considering!  </li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Product came really quick and was very pleases with it.</li>
            <li> leaves hair super straight .</li>
            <li> If the price seems too good to be true, it usually is.</li>
            <li> Heats up very fast, doesn&#x27;t smell burnt.  </li>
            <li> My wife is also thrilled with her new soft straight hair.</li>
            <li> It was cheap but still works better than any other straightner I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the digital display, it makes it very easy to determine how hot the flat iron is</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too thanks!!</li>
            <li> It was brand new, in the original box.</li>
            <li> The digital temp is easy to read and the iron heats up quickly.</li>
            <li> cool blue light that reads temperature status.</li>
            <li> I thought that it would be too hot or damaging to my hair.  </li>
            <li> I love this flatiron ever since I saw it on tv &amp; finally found it on amazon</li>
            <li> Bite the bullet and get a Chi the first time.</li>
            <li> I have pretty curly hair</li>
            <li> This is my first day of using it</li>
            <li> and I really like it!  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s exactly what it does.</li>
            <li> I love the way this iron makes my hair feel, but my fingers constantly hit the power button and it keeps turning off on me!</li>
            <li> and I actually think I like this one better.</li>
            <li> I love my chi deep brilliance..</li>
            <li> the flatiron gets pretty hot but works well on lower setting for her hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better than a regular Chi.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better than a regular Chi.  </li>
            <li> Love the digital setting.</li>
            <li> the description was vague at best.  </li>
            <li> This is designed for a more coarse hair than my wife&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Has a timer also if you&#x27;re kind of forgetful and don&#x27;t remember to turn it off.  </li>
            <li> Love the digital controls!</li>
            <li> If you try and buy this in any  retail store it would be more than double the price.</li>
            <li> My first day of using it, I went to work and</li>
            <li> It got hot immediately</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I was a believer.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> However I got exactly three uses out of it before it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> ;) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> The section of the iron where the plates are does get hot, but the handle where your hand grips the iron doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF, I HAVE AN ACUTAL CHI(REAL ONE)</li>
            <li> AT FIRST</li>
            <li> THIS IS THIER EXACT RESPONSE</li>
            <li> I use this product daily and love it.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of the color, but I love it.</li>
            <li> My hair is always soft and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Heats up quickly, would highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> I have purchased different CHI flat iron models over the last 5 years, and this one works the best.</li>
            <li> Too keep the hair healthy only flat iron it twice a month at the most.  </li>
            <li> I only straighten my hair 1 or 2 a year, but with my new Chi, I will be wearing my hair sleek and straight more often!</li>
            <li> bought it for 16yr old daughter who has fine fairly straight hair.</li>
            <li> It was only $5.00 but the point was to fit the hot tool i have!  </li>
            <li> Many hair professionals have suggested a Chi flat iron and I never thought I could afford one.</li>
            <li> I love my chi flat irons.</li>
            <li> My hair smells more burned than it did after flat ironing it with the ceramic plates.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this because my lovely wife asked for a Chi flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.</li>
            <li> The Chi flat iron is just ok.  </li>
            <li> I love the Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> Works ok, doesn&#x27;t seem to flatten as well as my original black Chi with the tan panels.</li>
            <li> When I asked if she liked the new flat iron, she said &amp;#34;LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Not only a great price but also love the fact of changing the temperature which is not possible with other Chi&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron!</li>
            <li> I have really curly, dry, frizzy hair and have read several reviews on different websites on which flat iron is best, and all website said different ones, so I just decided to try this one after reading reviews on here, and it amazing!  </li>
            <li> I received my flat iron a day before I was to take a trip to attend a very important function, and I really needed to use it on my hair.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is exactly what I wanted!!!</li>
            <li> I have had many brand name very high priced flat irons.</li>
            <li> It hears up really fast and really hot.</li>
            <li> so I just marked the price up a bit and resold it on Swap-Shop for a cool $19 profit...</li>
            <li> Like the digital thermostat, easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li> Only reason not 5 stars cuz you do have to reset timer each time and that&#x27;s easy to forget when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> A couple minutes later, when the hair isn&#x27;t becoming straight, I realize the Chi is off.</li>
            <li> It has a digital temperature display so you can easily change the temp to the desired temperature for your hair.</li>
            <li> Other flat irons I have used didn&#x27;t do the job, but this one is great and leaves my hair shiny.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new chi deep brilliance!</li>
            <li> i was pretty apprehensive about the \\&quot;deep brilliance\\&quot; aspect of it, because i thought it may be too powerful for my hair or just not the right make for it</li>
            <li> It heats up fine but never fully straightened my hair and left if feeling silky.</li>
            <li> I think if I had purchased a different model it would have been fine as well.  </li>
            <li> I will be trying a different brand the next time I am able to get a straightener!</li>
            <li> in all I would say that it&#x27;s a pretty decent iron...</li>
            <li> I would say that it&#x27;s a pretty decent iron...</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take more than a few passes to make it straight.</li>
            <li> This is the first flat iron that has actually accomplished that!!!</li>
            <li> This little gizmo does a great job with my curls and has finally given me the sleek look that I have wanted.</li>
            <li> This flat iron has easily cut my &amp;#34;styling time&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Love my new flat iron!</li>
            <li> It arrived within a few days from the actual order and in great shape.</li>
            <li> it works really well.</li>
            <li> Heats up really fast.  </li>
            <li> My hair has never been so silky or straight.  </li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll see how well my hair stays straight throughout the day.</li>
            <li> THANKS</li>
            <li> I doubt this is a real chi by the price and now by the quality.  </li>
            <li> I have very curly hair and wanted to make it straight</li>
            <li> The design of the casing around the titanium plates is very square.  </li>
            <li> Heats up fast and my hair looks sleek and straight throughout the day...</li>
            <li> but I wish I would have just gone ahead and paid twice the amount and gotten a real one with a warranty.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really curl like I would like it to on Brazilian wavy hair.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair</li>
            <li> &amp; I can get it completely straight in 15 min.</li>
            <li> I REALLY like how it&#x27;s set to shut off automatically.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> straight.</li>
            <li> Way to much money for a crappy product.  </li>
            <li> I have very course and curly hair</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They really straighten kinky hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast working and leaves a shine</li>
            <li> shipping was fast and it takes about 1 minute for my straightener to heat up to the max</li>
            <li> It is very durable.</li>
            <li> The plates also heat up really fast.</li>
            <li> and I had to put it on the highest settint to even get it straight which can be very damaging.  </li>
            <li> And to get it reasonably straight</li>
            <li> and I thought it was real.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and purchase a REAL Chi from an authorized dealer (check out the Chi product website for that info).  </li>
            <li> Would recommend if you need your hair straight.</li>
            <li> This straightener works really well.</li>
            <li> Many a time with her old straightener, I would find it on,   only to burn a hole on the vanity.</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Chi flat iron--the original Chi--about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> inch flat iron thinking it would take forever, but I was pretty amazed at how fast and effective this flat iron works on my hair.</li>
            <li> The cost was very economical and I will look to AMAZON for future purchases.</li>
            <li> the hot pink colour makes it easy to find....</li>
            <li> This Chi Deep Brilliance heats up pretty quickly...</li>
            <li> At first I sometimes hit the buttons on the side with my thumb when picking it up but only for the first 2 days, now I have it down and love it!</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and have used many different flat irons in attempt to get that nice sleek look without the bumps and frizz.</li>
            <li> I am cheap and my sister wanted a Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> Normal wear and tear!</li>
            <li> I have never had a flat iron that gets this hot, so quickly yet does not burn my hair.</li>
            <li> At first I could not get it to turn on and was ready to send it back, but the always patient hubby turned it right on.</li>
            <li> Spend a few more bucks and purchase a REAL one!</li>
            <li> and if u are not careful or spray the hair with spray guard first it will burn your HAIR!</li>
            <li> and my daughter is very pleased with how well it works and is not as hard on her hair.</li>
            <li> so much better Heats up fast and takes half the time.</li>
            <li> It gets hot quick and the cord is really long</li>
            <li> You can clearly see when the iron is at your desired temperature and you can choose how hot you want the iron to get.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to replace her CHI original ceramic flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 chi&#x27;s before this one and this is hands down my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Shipping was a little slow, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> This is great, I have very thick naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she had the classic 1\\&quot; Chi for YEARS</li>
            <li> LOVE the Chi brand but was REALLY dissapointed to see that it didnt work but a few months</li>
            <li> BOUGHT TO REPLACE AN OLDER CHI</li>
            <li> I was incredibly disappointed because this was the first CHI I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve always heard wonderful things about these straighteners from everyone I know.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get a chi, I had wanted one for a long time.  </li>
            <li> When we got it we thought we were going to have problems because it said \\&quot;for highly textured hair\\</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and using Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that means that the temperature setting is too high</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t heat up as high as i hoped.</li>
            <li> Heats up Super Fast and cools down Very Fast.  </li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up nicely, however it is really rough on my hair.</li>
            <li> Received it yesterday and wow!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, her hair was more than a little silky afterwards.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because many digital flat irons are not as good as they say they are on the box or on the site you buy them on.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife..not to expensive but works great</li>
            <li> The titanium blades leaves my very curly hair, soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised with how fast the product was shipped.</li>
            <li> I bought these flat irons for my little sister for Christmas,and she loves them, they are worth the price I paid for them and more.</li>
            <li> I was able to straighten, curl and volumize my hair in less than 15 minutes!</li>
            <li> Overall a great little product!!!</li>
            <li> bad for a nice and good looking Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> My d-i-l&#x27;s control panel is not on the actual flat iron, and a much better control system; it is not that soft rubber that sticks.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and the flat iron works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and stays level when you lay it down, so no accidental burns on my vanity.</li>
            <li> Titanium plates don&#x27;t live up to hype.</li>
            <li> I can live with that though.  </li>
            <li> OR A NEW ONE</li>
            <li> the consideration of your safety and beauty, we suggest that you buy a new CHI straightener instead.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new Chi for my daughter</li>
            <li> I will plug it in and let it warm up but after flat ironing half of my hair it seems cooler.</li>
            <li> Gets really jot quick an stays hot unlike all the other flat irons</li>
            <li> Coming from california to the far east coast!</li>
            <li> and it has completely stopped working!</li>
            <li> People keep commenting on my hair ever since I started using the Chi to complete the look!</li>
            <li> it then will get hot again but it will show that the temperature is actually 20 degrees or so cooler than what it&#x27;s supposed to be.</li>
            <li> AND IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOOO SOFT FOR DAYS!</li>
            <li> Happy customer, will never own anything other than a CHI.</li>
            <li> I purchased it thinking it would be different then the cheap Remington flat iron I bought at Sally Beauty Supply because it said for textured hair.  </li>
            <li> It leaves it soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> I love my Chi Deep Brilliance Digital Flat Iron.</li>
            <li> My CHI straightener was beginning to get old, so I decided i needed a new one.</li>
            <li> And even though it gets pretty hot, I didn&#x27;t burn myself at all, which is a pretty common thing with me.</li>
            <li> It heats up in seconds, gets really hot, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some flat irons do</li>
            <li> The first purchase was last year for my oldest daughter and she loves it so much I bought another one for my younger daughter.  </li>
            <li> It Didnt even get as hot as the inexpensive flat iron I bought at Walmart.</li>
            <li> I can flat iron natural hair and weaved hair bone straight !  </li>
            <li> The only drawback: the buttons for adjusting the temperature and timer are on the side as opposed to the lower interior part, so you may have to hold it a certain way to avoid pushing them with your fingers.</li>
            <li> However the plates are not the only thing that gets hot, but the whole flat iron does</li>
            <li> so it isn&#x27;t hard to straighten, but it leaves my hair feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> The only problems with my older one was it started pulling my hair, and that I would forget to turn it of ALL THE TIME!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it burns my hair any more or any less than the ceramic flat irons I&#x27;ve had before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not waste your time buying it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap irons.</li>
            <li> my hair is silky soft</li>
            <li> The only way I could get it straight was when I got my hair cut and styled.</li>
            <li> Let me just say this has never been dropped or near water.  </li>
            <li> ONLY REAL Chi&#x27;s are MADE IN THE U.S.A. -</li>
            <li> This works just as well as any CHI or professional iron.</li>
            <li> The plug of my old chi with ceramic plates cracked after being dropped.</li>
            <li> Was really reluctant to buy a 2nd Chi but did from a authorized STORE nearby.</li>
            <li> I was surprised because it&#x27;s a Chi.</li>
            <li> My professional hair stylist is the one who recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m surprised having this happen</li>
            <li> This is my first Chi that has lasted this long (knock on wood).</li>
            <li> I am on a hair journey and growing my natural hair out.</li>
            <li> After some research and asking some friends and professional hair stylist, I decided on this item.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair and is natural curly somewhat and has frizz.</li>
            <li> I had to wash my hair over and use my old straightener.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair shiny and straight and it last for days.</li>
            <li> It was no different and my hair is not as straight as I would like.  </li>
            <li> I JUST WANTED IT FIXED.</li>
            <li> The effect last through rainy weather and intense exercise.  </li>
            <li> with the deep brilliance, the plates are titanium, which I find much smoother than the ceramic plates.</li>
            <li> I have only had it for a few days, but I am absolutely in love.</li>
            <li> This flat iron is not only for ethnic hair, but also great for coarse, hard to manage hair.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight, heats quickly, and has an extra long cord.</li>
            <li> This product did not work and studying other videos about the authenticity of a real Chi, this one did not have the raised words on the inside like a real Chi has.</li>
            <li> I really like flat iron.</li>
            <li> and I have always struggled with flat irons to get my hair straight.  </li>
            <li> the flat iron gets her hair really straight</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.</li>
            <li> Before this straightener I had a more expensive Chi that worked really well!</li>
            <li> but overall a decent purchase.</li>
            <li> It can damage your hair if high heat is used too often, especially without product protection for your hair.</li>
            <li> The heat is high enough to straighten out frizz and give your hair the sleek groomed look you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> I will be more careful in the future and extremely careful about return policies.</li>
            <li> and this gets my hair really straight and doesn&#x27;t take a long time.  </li>
            <li> Be careful with how hot you make this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> She also loves the Hot Pink color (It is not purple).</li>
            <li> The styling iron is a hot pink color, not purple as advertised.</li>
            <li> I have really curly hair and live where it is extremely humid but it works</li>
            <li> I spend to much money on my hair and products for my hair to let it get ruined by poor products, and when you spend this kind of money it should last a long time like my solia that I have had for 3 yrs.  </li>
            <li> I recently went natural and this flat iron really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> and they told me that this iron was the new and improved Farouk Deep Brilliance.  </li>
            <li> High quality flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I mainly have straight hair with a slight wave.</li>
            <li> When I take the time to flat iron my hair in the morning it normally holds up all day...</li>
            <li> When I take the time to flat iron my hair in the morning it normally holds up all day...</li>
            <li> so I was aware how to use it, but the on button (black soft rubber) got stuck and no matter what I did</li>
            <li> I only have to flat iron each section once to achieve a straight look.</li>
            <li> so I pretty much been flat ironing my hair almost everyday since I was 14</li>
            <li> &amp; in a short period of time my long hair is now straight,  </li>
            <li> The description wasn&#x27;t clear enough for me to know this</li>
            <li> I do have to be careful to take small chunks of hair to achieve my goal but it works much better than the Chi.</li>
            <li> When I first bought it i will admit i was a bit reserved; because i have 2 daughters with semi-coarse hair and other flat irons really did not flatten properly; however just one use of this CHI DEEP BRILLIANCE!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this chi to replace my old chi that was starting to damage my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I actually contacted Farouk directly before I purchased the iron</li>
            <li> Barely lasted 4 months.  </li>
            <li> The color is nice but the design is definitely flawed...</li>
            <li> The color is nice but the design is definitely flawed...</li>
            <li> , normally it&#x27;s sort of a guessing game with the slider dials, but this is simple and easy.</li>
            <li> Heats up in less than a minute and stays hot.  </li>
            <li> As I read in some of the other reviews, iron did not function straight out of the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a heavier flat iron which I was surprised about.</li>
            <li> I suppose but my hair wasn&#x27;t as sleek and straight as it was with my other</li>
            <li> My 13 year old asked for a flat iron.</li>
            <li> (I have normal hair, mid-length, naturally a wavy curl, not thick or thin), so I immediately went on a mission to find a new Chi.  </li>
            <li> and I received a complete diff brand that only fits my 1&#x27;&#x27; flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and I have used it consistently almost everyday since it has arrived.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair- not tight curls, and in less than 10 minutes, this flat iron will leave my hair straight.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a Chi Smart styling iron from QVC.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would get too hot, but it is fine on any setting.</li>
            <li> My hair is long, thick, heavy and naturally curly and this product made it have the L.A. smooth, straight look; needless to say I love it.</li>
            <li> Color, temp control, smooth finish, and the little sample that comes with it!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is not course or super thick but it is wavy.</li>
            <li> , i had to learn the hard way this CHI GETS EXTREMELY HOT!</li>
            <li> This product was a little to much for my needs.</li>
            <li> I did take it on my trip...and after very carefully putting my fingernail in the small opening, I was able to get the button to lift up....and ever since, I have been very, very careful when I start the iron up...</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxer to natural, 4b hair, and let me tell you, my hair is straight, silky, and does not feel dried out at all!!</li>
            <li> B004HFGLOI Chi Deep Brilliance Digital Titanium Hair Styling Flat Iron 1\\&quot; Purple]]</li>
            <li> I purchased a Farouk Deep Brilliance Ceramic flat iron from Amazon a few years ago and was absolutely blown away by the quality of the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> It took me several years to decide to purchase the CHI hair Flat Iron.  </li>
            <li> I thought all flat irons were the same.  </li>
            <li> The flat iron arrived at home a day earlier to my surprise</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my wife several months ago.</li>
            <li> I always felt like I had &amp;#34;helmet head.&amp;#34; However, I recently purchased a Croc flat iron ($99) from Walmart</li>
            <li> She is a daily user of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> My daughter-in-law owns the Chi flat iron, but a different model as she got hers a couple of years ago.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was at the mall recently and stopped at a kiask selling flat irons.  </li>
            <li> CHI deep brilliance flat iron.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> Yes, the teen boys are now using flat irons!</li>
            <li> Now I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I didn&#x27;t understand why this got so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> She has very thick, long, slightly wavy hair and needs a flat iron that is very hot to make her hair stay straight.</li>
            <li> My sister had the same problem with her Chi flat iron, and also less than a year old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this wasn&#x27;t a real Chi flat iron that was being sold.</li>
            <li> and I have been on a search for a flat iron to straighten it out with no luck for years.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Sally&#x27;s brand flat iron stand that holds up to 2&#x27;&#x27; flat iron</li>
            <li> I like the flat iron.  </li>
            <li> Would recommend chi flat irons to anyone.</li>
            <li> It has a swivel cord that allows you to flat iron your hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Two weeks after I used this the plug blow up and shorted out the flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have always used an inexpensive flat iron.</li>
            <li> I had no idea which flat iron to go with</li>
            <li> I bought this after using my Revlon Ceramic Flat Iron this is</li>
            <li> My hairdresser uses a flat iron on me...</li>
            <li> Would not purchase a Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> All of their friends are jealous of their flat iron.</li>
            <li> do wish the &#x27;Automatic off&#x27; setting would work as soon as you turn on the flat iron, but I&#x27;ve just gotten used to setting the timer when I know I&#x27;m in a hurry</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the beat one I&#x27;ve ever had.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still looking for my \\&quot;dream\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li> It is durable and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This flat Iron arrived on time</li>
            <li> 3 different obstacles that alot of people don&#x27;t have all together!  </li>
            <li> While it is easy to glide down it&#x27;s not as slick as my previous $30 REVLON titanium straightener which broke.      </li>
            <li> I would highly urge you to get this if your hair is thick, coarse or curly.</li>
            <li> She has very long and thick hair and this flat iron makes her hair straight and silky</li>
            <li> However, I have to use the hottest setting which has blistered my fingers a few times and it takes twice as long to straighten vs my old cheapo iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my daughter that has long curly hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fun times to have an expensive heating coil with two plates on it not be able to last even a few years.</li>
            <li> And WOW within few mins i was done.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long cord.</li>
            <li> I order my chi a few months back and barely received it about two weeks ago</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d wanted a chi for a long time, but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that i finally decided to break down and buy one.</li>
            <li> It has a well lit digital display and a TIMER for those of us who are forgetful about turning it off after, as long as you get in the habit of turning the timer on!</li>
            <li> I know that I&#x27;ve accidentally left my other iron on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The company was extremely cooperative about the return, however it cost me $12.15 to ship back.</li>
            <li> CHI and other Farouk Systems products are only sold through authorized salon retailers, and Amazon is not one of them.</li>
            <li> and we both have very long hair..</li>
            <li> flat iron is sleek (it does feel a little bit bigger in the hand, but nothing that I can&#x27;t adjust to), and literally feels like glass when it runs through my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am a single dad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot easier on my hair than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> They are nice colors but highly disappointed in the quality.  </li>
            <li> My old iron, a Walmart cheapo did the job in half the time with half the heat, but it snagged and broke my hair off.</li>
            <li> Three weeks into using it she reached down to get it, grabbed the hand grip, and squeezed to open it when the plastic handle broke off.</li>
            <li> The only down fall is</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and live in humid Florida.  </li>
            <li> I have black coarse medium lenght hair.</li>
            <li> the arms are pretty thick and heavy so it hurts after a while of using.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using hand me down flat irons for</li>
            <li> No good luck with this particular model.</li>
            <li> After using this flat iron for only a few months, it conked out!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a little bit disappointed.seem to be lasting throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> I previously purchased the HSI flat iron and returned it and wanted to give this one a shot.</li>
            <li> I have all natural hair so its hard to straightened the curl out of my hair.</li>
            <li> I like it, although  I&#x27;ve had better chis but for the in expensiveness of it, it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> So be careful when ordering gifts and the return policy</li>
            <li> Can use on slightly wet hair and doesn&#x27;t fry.</li>
            <li> My hair is not really course but frizzy.</li>
            <li> You can tell this is not a real Chi, it states which company makes it.</li>
            <li> Expected it to work way longer than that.</li>
            <li> it was minus $20.</li>
            <li> but not what I expected from the Chi brand.</li>
            <li> This is not a real Chi product.</li>
            <li> When no other flat iron would get my ponytail hump out in the past, this one almost did!!</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, with slight curl and professionally colored.  </li>
            <li> My wife had wanted one of these for years but never got one due to the cost.</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way!  </li>
            <li> Amazon won&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s been a few days too long.</li>
            <li> but this product makes smoother...easier than any other that I have used.</li>
            <li> Money well spent!</li>
            <li> It has an automatic shut off which is extremely helpful...</li>
            <li> Not sure what I&#x27;ll buy next.</li>
            <li> then any other straightener I have ever had.</li>
            <li> She hasn&#x27;t used it yet due to it</li>
            <li> I see no difference in this product than any other I&#x27;ve had.  </li>
            <li> Does not work like any other Chi I have owned.</li>
            <li> $45 well spent!</li>
            <li> and I had paid $140 for it (and some other accessories).</li>
            <li> I also noticed that this flat iron isn&#x27;t as heavy as my previous ones which makes me doubt the quality of the product</li>
            <li> She uses it a few times every single day.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair, natural hair</li>
            <li> so she doesn&#x27;t burn our house down.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few other straightners</li>
            <li> I have very thick natural red hair that is hard to straighten!</li>
            <li> I am not a girly-girl, and I typically know nothing about hair.  </li>
            <li> This is one seller ill definitely shop with in the future!</li>
            <li> Decided to look on amazon and found this one for less than $60.</li>
            <li> It even took less time than what I&#x27;m used to.</li>
            <li> I saw this for half the price and jumped at it.</li>
            <li> I must agree with a previous reviewer that this is for courser hair.</li>
            <li> in half.</li>
            <li> I have loooooong hair and my fixing time was cut in half.</li>
            <li> There was nothing odd about the packaging</li>
            <li> When that one met an untimely demise far too soon due to an unfortunate accident, I found this one when looking to replace it.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick hair</li>
            <li> I have really tight curls</li>
            <li> This is a must have for anyone who needs a little help getting their hair to cooperate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a month now and don&#x27;t have any complaints at this point.</li>
            <li> I should have looked a  little closer at the product description before I ordered because I didn&#x27;t notice it was for course hair</li>
            <li> I find it a little fat too hold.  </li>
            <li> and I was a little worried about getting a 1&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with thick or course hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length very thick hair and can iron it in about ten minutes.</li>
            <li> However, a few days after I received, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times).  </li>
            <li> but after a few hours my ends look frizzy and that has never happened to me before.  </li>
            <li> but after a few hours my ends look frizzy and that has never happened to me before.  </li>
            <li> I use mine everyday</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s lasted for a few years.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> To me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> And I got it for less than in stores!  </li>
            <li> and it was plain</li>
            <li> Her hair is very, very thick and long, and curly....</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall that the product description said this product was made especially for African American hair, so I was very disappointed when I received it</li>
            <li> I was not satisfied</li>
            <li> Let me just say this is a waste of time!</li>
            <li> SO basically i wasted my money on this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually rushing in the morning and haven&#x27;t found myself waiting around for this iron to get</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money and time with this!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was real or fake, since I know there are plenty of fake Chi straighteners out there.  </li>
            <li> which makes it sometimes hard to get a grip of.</li>
            <li> It is a little oily so use sparingly!!</li>
            <li> and I wish I&#x27;d read all the negative reviews for spending my hard earned money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> At least when you purchase a HAI</li>
            <li> I was late in ordering the product but it arrived in record time.  </li>
            <li> I was concerned when it arrived since the box said for \\&quot;course, thick hair\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> My hair is curly and thick.  </li>
            <li> Not like my hair is thick and unruly.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> and i have really thick curly hair.</li>
            <li> Got it in less that 5 days!!!</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> which is way bad for hair (especially if you are making 3 to 4 passes through it)!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sorry I wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> (my hair is thick, but only slightly wavy and not too terrible to manage), but, thank goodness,</li>
            <li> The settings are pretty neat but it did a terrible job on my hair.</li>
            <li> , I have poofy, thick, frizzy, wavey hair!</li>
            <li> My hair is VERY THICK AND COURSE AND CURLY</li>
            <li> I have thin semi-wavy hair</li>
            <li> This CHI made it worse.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so annoyed by this</li>
            <li> She has now used it for approximately 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m actually a little bit disappointed.</li>
            <li> FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE   </li>
            <li> Holy moly, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> this deep brilliance chi was the cheapest chi i could find online ANYWHERE (barring others with terrible reviews that i wouldn&#x27;t even consider).</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Chi.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong!  </li>
            <li> I am so mad by the lack of customer service on this website.</li>

            <li> The item is very expensive otherwise.</li>
            <li> Like it but the problem with is the on and off button is in a bad location.  </li>
            <li> But the person that I gave it to did not say anything bad about it</li>

            <li> I was so disappointed</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> thing that I am very disappointed with is the control panel.</li>
            <li> I was Very disappointed in the chi.</li>
            <li> I had a instyler straightner  which i hated!!!</li>
            <li> Terrible product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely terrible product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted one, but wasn&#x27;t going to pay those outrageous prices for one.</li>
            <li> This was awful!.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Wife was recommended this product by her hair stylist and was glad to get one. Works great and price was right. Product as described and recommend to everyone to try.</li>
            <li> I loved this product until today. After three months of it working perfectly, I turned it on this morning and all it would tell me was the temperature in the room. I&#x27;ve tried it several times since and it still does the same thing. The heating mechanism decided to just stop working. Now it&#x27;s just a thermometer!</li>
            <li> this is by far the best straightener i have ever used. hair is transformed to silk.</li>
            <li> Works excellent!  Love the controls.  Heats up Super Fast and cools down Very Fast.  The only thing I would of liked it to come wtih is a stand to rest it on.</li>
            <li> Great deal. I love temperature options and how you dont burn your hand holding it. cool blue light that reads temperature status.</li>
            <li> Great deal for the price.  I love it.  the hot pink colour makes it easy to find....it works really well.&amp; in a short period of time my long hair is now straight,  Use w. Moroccan Oil</li>
            <li> It took me several years to decide to purchase the CHI hair Flat Iron.  I thought all flat irons were the same.  I certaintly was missing a great product.  The flat iron arrived at home a day earlier to my surprise so that was exciting too.  You need to get one!  Mady</li>
            <li> My daughter asked for this.  She uses it all the time  Loves it</li>
            <li> This flat iron works great! Like the digital thermostat, easy to adjust.  Heats up really fast.  Received it in the mail super fast!</li>
            <li> Initially I purchased the original Chi which did a pretty good job.  When that one met an untimely demise far too soon due to an unfortunate accident, I found this one when looking to replace it.  I have straight hair medium length that is pretty fine. I was concerned when it arrived since the box said for \\&quot;course, thick hair\\&quot;.  I thought that it would be too hot or damaging to my hair.  Boy was I wrong!  My hair has never been so silky or straight.  I have strangers commenting on how great my hair looks and even trying to touch it (which is very odd).  It has an adjustable heat setting and the option to set a timer to turn it off.  That is one thing to note.  It seems that you actually have to set the timer or it does not self shut off. Love, love, love this flat iron</li>
            <li> love CHI product.  great color</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair</li>
            <li> I dropped it once and it broke. Not waste your time buying it.</li>
            <li> I am not a girly-girl, and I typically know nothing about hair.  I never realized all hair straiteners weren&#x27;t created equal, until I bought this one.  This thing is awesome!  Even a hair novice like myself can use it and its easy and leaves my hair strait and super shiny and soft.  This is a must have for anyone who needs a little help getting their hair to cooperate.  I love it!  And for the price?  You can&#x27;t beat it.  Worth every penny :-)</li>
            <li> I love this flatiron.  It has a selection of heat temps to use and it has an on and off button.  A plus is all the controls light up.  It heats up fast and does the job perfectly.</li>
            <li> My wife had wanted one of these for years but never got one due to the cost. I found this deal and decided decided to give it a try. It works perfectly and she is very satisfied. Great buy and good price.</li>
            <li> I love this flatiron ever since I saw it on tv &amp; finally found it on amazon I had to get it.</li>
            <li> Love that I have control over the temperature and can set the timer</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, she had the classic 1\\&quot; Chi for YEARS but it finally gave up on her. When we got it we thought we were going to have problems because it said \\&quot;for highly textured hair\\&quot; but the wife and her friend said it was the best flatiron she had ever used. She has worked in salons and has her cosmo license so that tells you she&#x27;s not used to the $20 Wal-mart junk.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for someone not knowing it did not work and not realizing the 30 day return policy. So be careful when ordering gifts and the return policy</li>
            <li> Love this flat iron! It is lightweight, heats quickly, and has an extra long cord. The price was definitely right. My hairdresser said she couldn&#x27;t get it at the price I paid even with her beauty supply discount. It was about 1/2 of what the Chi was priced at in the stores. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the cheap irons. Bite the bullet and get a Chi the first time.</li>
            <li> Luv it n my hair is silky soft</li>
            <li> Very good flat iron. Takes no time to heat up! Temperature is displayed. It glides smoothly through hair without pulling!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is exactly what I wanted!!! Color, temp control, smooth finish, and the little sample that comes with it!!! This is one seller ill definitely shop with in the future!</li>
            <li> I bought this chi to replace my old chi that was starting to damage my hair.  I love the digital temperature display and being able to adjust the temperature.  I&#x27;ve had it for a little over a month now and don&#x27;t have any complaints at this point.</li>
            <li> This is my third Chi.  I purchased it for my daughter that has long curly hair. It works great on her hair.  I love the adjustable temperature setting.  I have shoulder length very thick hair and can iron it in about ten minutes. I would highly urge you to get this if your hair is thick, coarse or curly.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product which I found on Amazon for a GREAT price!  I highly recommend this product and using Amazon.  Great seller also!</li>
            <li> Before this straightener I had a more expensive Chi that worked really well! I was hesitant about a hair straightener that was so well priced, but it has been great! I have really curly hair and live where it is extremely humid but it works so well neither are an issue! I would definitely recommend this product. It has a well lit digital display and a TIMER for those of us who are forgetful about turning it off after, as long as you get in the habit of turning the timer on! Titanium straighteners are not recommended for every day use, but this product works so well you won&#x27;t need to straighten your hair every day! I LOVE LOVE LOVE it!  I would also recommend using the following product before straightening your hair. It helps your hair to look and feel healthier. It is a little oily so use sparingly!! A little goes a LONG way!

            <li> I have pretty curly hair and I have been on a search for a flat iron to straighten it out with no luck for years. The only way I could get it straight was when I got my hair cut and styled. Many hair professionals have suggested a Chi flat iron and I never thought I could afford one. Decided to look on amazon and found this one for less than $60. Received it yesterday and wow!! People aren&#x27;t kidding when they recommend this brand. It&#x27;s awesome! I didn&#x27;t even set it at the highest setting of 410 degrees. I straightened it at 360 degrees. It even took less time than what I&#x27;m used to. I&#x27;m so in love with this thing. And even though it gets pretty hot, I didn&#x27;t burn myself at all, which is a pretty common thing with me. This is my first day of using it so we&#x27;ll see how well my hair stays straight throughout the day. I&#x27;m usually straight for a few hours and then back to curly again. And I forgot to mention how this makes your hair so shiny and smoothe. I feel like my hair has some texture again and you can see highlights in it. Can you tell I love this product??</li>
            <li> I ordered a Sally&#x27;s brand flat iron stand that holds up to 2&#x27;&#x27; flat iron and I received a complete diff brand that only fits my 1&#x27;&#x27; flat iron.  It was only $5.00 but the point was to fit the hot tool i have!  I was not satisfied</li>
            <li> This flat iron is not only for ethnic hair, but also great for coarse, hard to manage hair.  Glides smoothly!  Very satisfied with my purchase, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and it has exceeded my expectations. I love the quality of the iron and how fast it heats up. It works with my hair type and provides great shine. I love the smooth results every time and I have used it consistently almost everyday since it has arrived.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly and thick.  This straightener works well with my type of hair and I assume it&#x27;ll work wonders with hair that is easier to managage.    While it is easy to glide down it&#x27;s not as slick as my previous $30 REVLON titanium straightener which broke.      Results are great and fast since it gets very HOT! However the plates are not the only thing that gets hot, but the whole flat iron does which makes it sometimes hard to get a grip of. I also noticed that this flat iron isn&#x27;t as heavy as my previous ones which makes me doubt the quality of the product but so far so good.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!!!! Got it in less that 5 days!!! Coming from california to the far east coast! My hair looks AMAZING!!!! THANKS SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!! Because of this product I look great!!!!</li>
            <li> Ordered this product the week before Christmas on a Thursday and received item the following Monday!  Was very pleased!! Item was perfect and the price was amazing.  Thanks!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent for my hair.  Heats up very fast, doesn&#x27;t smell burnt.  Can use on slightly wet hair and doesn&#x27;t fry.</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use. I appreciate the temperature control, the timer, and the automatic shutoff.  The band of Velcro for keeping the cord folded is helpful when I travel.  Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought for my wife..not to expensive but works great</li>
            <li> As I read in some of the other reviews, iron did not function straight out of the box. Unreliable product - Needed to be returned.</li>
            <li> I have been using this straigtner for about 3 weeks now and I really like it!  I have thin semi-wavy hair so it isn&#x27;t hard to straighten, but it leaves my hair feeling healthy. At this point i&#x27;d totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Let me just say this is a waste of time! I doubt this is a real chi by the price and now by the quality.  I have had my &#x60;&#x60;CHI&#x60;&#x60; for 3 months and it has completely stopped working! Let me just say this has never been dropped or near water.  Before i bought this chi i was using a HAI and had it for over 5 years, and it still works.  I just wanted to upgrade to a chi and this is the result i get.  At least when you purchase a HAI you get a year warranty on it.  But when you purchase anything from amazon you only get 30 days to return anything and it cant even be opened.  SO basically i wasted my money on this product! The digital screen does not even work on it anymore and it doesnt heat up at all! It worked for three months then stops working! I am so mad by the lack of customer service on this website. I cant even find a seller email to contact them because it is confidential you have to go through amazon who really does not care whether you are happy with your order or not! I would say go to an actual salon and purchase a straightner this way you get what you pay for! If its to good to be true, it probably is!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004HFGLOI Chi Deep Brilliance Digital Titanium Hair Styling Flat Iron 1\\&quot; Purple]]</li>
            <li> I really like flat iron. Just didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t ceramic until purchase got here. But I learned to use it pretty good and it does a good job at straightening my hair. I know it says titanium but I over looked it and just missed that part. It&#x27;s ok tho over all I&#x27;m happy with product</li>
            <li> Perfect. I love that it gives me a choice of how hot I want it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best flat iron i&#x27;d ever had. I love it!  I recommend this product 100%  The shopping experiencie Was also great... The whole process was fast and safe!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love my new chi deep brilliance! I&#x27;ve had this product for about one month and I&#x27;ve received so many compliments! My hair is softer and bouncier than its ever been! I love the you can set a timer to automatically shut off when not in use which is a big plus because my daughter uses it and almost always forgets to turn it off. I would recommend this product to my friends over and over and I would by it again if I need to!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  She is very happy with it and I am very happy when I found out  it has a timer which automatically shuts the unit off.  Many a time with her old straightener, I would find it on,   only to burn a hole on the vanity.</li>
            <li> I have always loved CHI products, so when I saw this new titanium flat iron I didn´t hesitate on buying it. Very good product indeed.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A FAKE CHI!  DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!  I purchased from Discount Jungle 6 months ago, and about 6 months ago my hair started breaking off like crazy! The refuse to respond to any of my e-mails!!!!  ONLY REAL Chi&#x27;s are MADE IN THE U.S.A. - THIS CHI SAYS RIGHT ON IT, MADE IN CHINA!  FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE FAKE   You are a FOOL if you buy this thing! Spend a few more bucks and purchase a REAL one!</li>
            <li> The product does what it says it is supposed to do. I have very curly hair and wanted to make it straight and that&#x27;s exactly what it does.</li>
            <li> I like the flat iron.  I should have looked a  little closer at the product description before I ordered because I didn&#x27;t notice it was for course hair but I use a lot of protection spray and it hasn&#x27;t damaged my hair so I&#x27;m happy.  Plus it was a great price!!!</li>
            <li> This CHI does not pull your hair, it glides SMOOTHLY through your hair and it straightens it without having to keep going over it a couple times. It is pretty too! I would recommend this to all of my friends. You won&#x27;t be upset that you purchased this CHI!</li>
            <li> I purchased my first Chi flat iron--the original Chi--about 5 years ago.  I loved that flat iron and have to admit that I was heartbroken when I dropped it and it finally gave out on me.  I straigten my hair most days (I have normal hair, mid-length, naturally a wavy curl, not thick or thin), so I immediately went on a mission to find a new Chi.  I read the reviews of this iron and all seemed great, but I was concered about the plates being titanium, as I have always used ceramic.  With the price, though, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flat iron is sleek (it does feel a little bit bigger in the hand, but nothing that I can&#x27;t adjust to), and literally feels like glass when it runs through my hair.  Perhaps it was that my original chi was getting older and worn, but I don&#x27;t remember it ever feeling that smooth.  The adjustable temperature is also nice, so if I don&#x27;t want the high heat, I can set it to a lower temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am overall very satisfied with the product--and am, of course, thrilled to have straight hair again!</li>
            <li> I love the way this iron makes my hair feel, but my fingers constantly hit the power button and it keeps turning off on me!</li>
            <li> My daughter just turned 12 and begged for a Chi. They are well over $90 here so I found this one for her. She was thrilled. She posted about it on her Facebook. Three weeks into using it she reached down to get it, grabbed the hand grip, and squeezed to open it when the plastic handle broke off. Amazon won&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s been a few days too long. So I ordered another one for her to use while I ship it internationally back to Chi for a replacement. That will be $27 and about 8-10 weeks.  And I only paid $40.  Let&#x27;s hope the second one doesn&#x27;t do this</li>
            <li> I love the product and I am very pleased!!! I would recommend this product to anyone who inquires. The cost was very economical and I will look to AMAZON for future purchases.</li>
            <li> In order to activate the auto shut off feature, each time you turn the straightener on you have to press the mode button twice, then increase the time by minutes.  And you have to do this each time you turn it on.  Not convenient which means that you won&#x27;t utilize it cause you can just turn it on and go.  The description wasn&#x27;t clear enough for me to know this so now I&#x27;ve had to pay to ship it back.</li>
            <li> I bought this flat iron for my wife several months ago. It has a very nice design and worked perfectly for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly it stopped working in just about 5 uses. She never let it fall or anything.. It just wont turn on.&lt;br /&gt;Very bad for a nice and good looking Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have seen the chi displayed at several malls and wanted one forever... but they retail at like $120. I saw this for half the price and jumped at it. I love my chi!</li>
            <li> Works ok, doesn&#x27;t seem to flatten as well as my original black Chi with the tan panels. I like the digital controls.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister for Christmas. Not only did she love it, but I did too! I have the original CHI and I actually think I like this one better.</li>
            <li> These are the best product out there. I will buy from them again. Super fast shipping. I will tell my friends.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I ordered this straightener! My hair is VERY THICK AND COURSE AND CURLY but this product makes smoother...easier than any other that I have used. Only reason not 5 stars cuz you do have to reset timer each time and that&#x27;s easy to forget when in a hurry.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love my chi! Money well spent! Shipping was a little slow, but I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! Would recommend chi flat irons to anyone.</li>
            <li> My beautician uses this product so I wanted one so I could keep my own hair up so I would not have to return just to get my hair curled. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have really curly, dry, frizzy hair and have read several reviews on different websites on which flat iron is best, and all website said different ones, so I just decided to try this one after reading reviews on here, and it amazing!  It heats up in seconds, gets really hot, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some flat irons do and it straightens it so well, to where you don&#x27;t have to go back over it a bunch of times!  I would definitely recommend this flat iron to anyone!</li>
            <li> This iron worked great for the few days it worked!  However, a few days after I received, it stopped working.  It just would not turn on anymore.  I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is sold at places like Sephora for a reason!  Retail price for this jewel is worth over $200.00 and I paid $75...EXCITING!  It came within 3 business just like the suppliers said it would and it works perfectly.  My hair is long, thick, heavy and naturally curly and this product made it have the L.A. smooth, straight look; needless to say I love it.</li>
            <li> I have all natural hair so its hard to straightened the curl out of my hair. But this flat iron was amazing!!!.. I am so glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This  is my second Chi. I must say the deep brilliance titanium is great. My hair is not really course but frizzy. I only have to flat iron each section once to achieve a straight look. I must agree with a previous reviewer that this is for courser hair. I just use a lower setting and go through only once. You just need to know what you are doing so you dont damage your hair. I have been doing my hair for 20 years and dont go to salons so I know my hair.. that is key!</li>
            <li> This iron is perfect. I&#x27;ve worked in salons before (as an esthetician) and have borrowed the stylists&#x27; irons. This works just as well as any CHI or professional iron. And how can you beat the price? Seriously. Buy this.</li>
            <li> I love my chi flat irons. They get my hair straight fast and it looks very nice and healthy. The product came very fast in great condition and for a great price. I tell everyone where to get them....</li>
            <li> I love my chi deep brilliance..it is a great addition to my hair product collection..It heats up in seconds and leaves my hair smooth shiny and healthy...I dont have that cooked hair smell after using it..</li>
            <li> The plug of my old chi with ceramic plates cracked after being dropped. Should have gotten the same one. Titanium plates don&#x27;t live up to hype. Not like my hair is thick and unruly. 400 degrees should be able to straighten wit one pass and not leave frizz</li>
            <li> LOVE the Chi brand but was REALLY dissapointed to see that it didnt work but a few months and since we didnt keep the original reciept we looked to the warranty that was void because it was an online purchase. Was really reluctant to buy a 2nd Chi but did from a authorized STORE nearby.</li>
            <li> I have no problem spending money on health and beauty items but I always hesitated with the Chi, because it was kind of pricey and I didn&#x27;t think I needed it.  Holy moly, was I wrong.  This is the most amazing product that has ever been invented.  My hair is straight/wavy but I have a frizz problem.  This straightener is super easy to use and my hair looks amazing.  People keep commenting on my hair ever since I started using the Chi to complete the look! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> bought it for 16yr old daughter who has fine fairly straight hair. the flatiron gets pretty hot but works well on lower setting for her hair. worth the price i paid.</li>
            <li> This flat iron heats up nicely, however it is really rough on my hair. It actually feels like it is tearing it, if that makes sense. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. I was surprised because it&#x27;s a Chi.</li>
            <li> Love this, it works wondeful. I will purchase another. I have had many brand name very high priced flat irons. And this is the best one I have ever had</li>
            <li> The Chi Deep Brilliance flat iron works great on all types of hair and i love using it! it heats up fast and works amazingly!!</li>
            <li> BOUGHT TO REPLACE AN OLDER CHI FOR MY DAUGHTER, SHE LOVES, LOVES, LOVES IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO RECIEVED QUICKLY, NO PROBLEMS AT ALL</li>
            <li> This has nice even heat when it works but I have found that it looses heat after time. I will plug it in and let it warm up but after flat ironing half of my hair it seems cooler. If I turn up the heat it then will get hot again but it will show that the temperature is actually 20 degrees or so cooler than what it&#x27;s supposed to be. It&#x27;s a heavier flat iron which I was surprised about.</li>
            <li> so I pretty much been flat ironing my hair almost everyday since I was 14, I have poofy, thick, frizzy, wavey hair! I am now 20 and have ownd a chi before but this is by far the best chi or hair starightner I have ever owned! can you tell that i love this thing!</li>
            <li> I purchased a Farouk Deep Brilliance Ceramic flat iron from Amazon a few years ago and was absolutely blown away by the quality of the flat iron.  My Farouk Deep Brilliance is still working perfectly but recently I felt that I needed a backup iron in case something happened to mine (I&#x27;ve dropped it a few times).  I was thrilled when Farouk introduced the Chi Deep Brilliance Titanium iron at such a great price and I purchased it right away.  I was concerned about the titanium plates (I&#x27;ve only used ceramic plates) but I actually contacted Farouk directly before I purchased the iron and they told me that this iron was the new and improved Farouk Deep Brilliance.  The Deep Brilliance is a Farouk line made especially for ethnic hair (I&#x27;m African American).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with the pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This Chi Deep Brilliance heats up pretty quickly...in just under two minutes.  I&#x27;m usually rushing in the morning and haven&#x27;t found myself waiting around for this iron to get hot.&lt;br /&gt;2. The digital display is a nice addition.  You can clearly see when the iron is at your desired temperature and you can choose how hot you want the iron to get.&lt;br /&gt;3. It has a swivel cord that allows you to flat iron your hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;4. It has an automatic shut off which is extremely helpful...I know that I&#x27;ve accidentally left my other iron on all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My hair smells more burned than it did after flat ironing it with the ceramic plates.  I don&#x27;t know if that means that the temperature setting is too high but I don&#x27;t love having my hair smell burned.&lt;br /&gt;2. The design of the casing around the titanium plates is very square.  I don&#x27;t know if this is something that I&#x27;ll get used to in time but it does affect the way my hair curls.  My Farouk Deep Brilliance had sleek rounded edges and this iron is decidedly bulkier and squared.  It gives more a bump closer to my root which is good for volume I suppose but my hair wasn&#x27;t as sleek and straight as it was with my other iron.&lt;br /&gt;3. My style doesn&#x27;t seem to be lasting throughout the day.  My hair looked pretty good this morning right after I&#x27;d flat ironed it but after a few hours my ends look frizzy and that has never happened to me before.  When I take the time to flat iron my hair in the morning it normally holds up all day...even in the humidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I would say that it&#x27;s a pretty decent iron...I don&#x27;t know that it&#x27;s better than a regular Chi.  The color is nice but the design is definitely flawed...I&#x27;m actually a little bit disappointed.seem to be lasting throughout the day.

            <li> The product is great and priced very inexpensively. My professional hair stylist is the one who recommended it to me. She used the one she had purchased on my hair during my salon visit.</li>
            <li> I order my chi a few months back and barely received it about two weeks ago and when I went to use it the digital screen was fuzzy then I tried to use it the next day and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on I feel like I&#x27;ve wasted my money and time with this!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! Heats up fast and my hair looks sleek and straight throughout the day...the best hair straightener for me so far!!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this iron! I was able to straighten, curl and volumize my hair in less than 15 minutes! Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it, is there is not an automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall that the product description said this product was made especially for African American hair, so I was very disappointed when I received it and it was plain it was.  The delivery was swift and of course you have to love free shipping.  The company was extremely cooperative about the return, however it cost me $12.15 to ship back. I will be more careful in the future and extremely careful about return policies.</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple of years ago. Works perfectly. My only problem with it, is that it doesn&#x27;t have an automatic shut off. So, if you leave for work or out on the town, and forget to turn it off, it will still be on when you get back.</li>
            <li> Great product. Be careful with how hot you make this product. It can damage your hair if high heat is used too often, especially without product protection for your hair.</li>
            <li> Warms quickly and does the job. I like the auto turn off feature so if I forget to unplug there are no worries</li>
            <li> One of the BEST FLAT IRONS I ever bought. I&#x27;m in love with it. Works great, heats up nice and quick!! GRAET PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> love the temperature control - I do not need a lot of heat to smooth out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have traveled with it 2 or 3 times and it travels well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for her a couple years ago, and it&#x27;s still going strong. She uses it a few times every single day. Worth every penny!!!!!</li>
            <li> You can tell this is not a real Chi, it states which company makes it. That being said it is a good straightener, I&#x27;ve had it about a month and it still works unlike what some people say about it not turning on. Worth the money but I wish I would have just gone ahead and paid twice the amount and gotten a real one with a warranty.</li>
            <li> Love it! Came in when promised, a great product at an awesome price! Would certainly recommend to anyone considering!  I use mine everyday</li>
            <li> This flat-iron works well on my daughter&#x27;s Asian hair. It heats up quickly and doesn&#x27;t take more than a few passes to make it straight. It also minimizes frizz throughout the day.</li>
            <li> Chi is by far the best brand of flat iron on the market - the fact that this was under $100 is just a bonus!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do with out this! Hands down one of the best straighteners I ever owned and it&#x27;s lasted for a few years.</li>
            <li> After using this flat iron for only a few months, it conked out!  I&#x27;m surprised having this happen w/a Chi product, as they are supposed to be the best.  Will probably buy a cheaper name next time, as this cost me just under $100.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> worked great on my natural hair, love the timer and the extra long cord.</li>
            <li> Got this a while back and im still learning how to use it. I&#x27;ve always used a curling iron and it&#x27;s not quite the same. Great product.</li>
            <li> This applies to my wife not me.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Exactly what I expected. Still using.</li>
            <li> I just bought one for my nephew in the orange. Yes, the teen boys are now using flat irons! I looked around and this is still the best quality and price for a titanium. I purchased mine in the purple almost 2 years ago and it still works great. This is my first Chi that has lasted this long (knock on wood). Love the digital setting. Set it and whenever you turn it on it goes to that temp. And the cord does not get tangled because it swivels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard/read that these are supposed to be really great flat irons but this one was just OK. I&#x27;ve wondered if it is an actual Chi or just a knock-off. It heats up fine but never fully straightened my hair and left if feeling silky. I&#x27;m biracial and have fairly course but chemically relaxed hair. I always felt like I had &amp;#34;helmet head.&amp;#34; However, I recently purchased a Croc flat iron ($99) from Walmart online and it does the trick! I do have to be careful to take small chunks of hair to achieve my goal but it works much better than the Chi. Sorry I wasted my money on it.</li>
            <li> Dont like where the adjust button is but love it nonetheless!</li>
            <li> Great product love all the things I buy on here it works good on my hair and straights I have thick hair.</li>
            <li> Two weeks after I used this the plug blow up and shorted out the flat iron. What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really curl like I would like it to on Brazilian wavy hair. I like the really long cord though and the color is nice.</li>
            <li> Had one for about 5 + yrs worked great, one day plugged it it and it decided to not work. Wouldnt turnon , nothing.&lt;br /&gt;bought another one identical becuase I loved my first one, it wokred for a week. In the process of returning it to the seller on Amazon. Not sure what I&#x27;ll buy next. No good luck with this particular model.</li>
            <li> My hair is SUPER curly and I have always struggled with flat irons to get my hair straight.  I only straighten my hair 1 or 2 a year, but with my new Chi, I will be wearing my hair sleek and straight more often!</li>
            <li> I have always used the original CHI irons and decided to try this one out. I love it! The plates are even smoother than the original!</li>
            <li> This works great on my hair and i have really thick curly hair. It gets hot quick and the cord is really long</li>
            <li> So, my fiancé absolutely loves this, and raved about how smooth it was to use. I&#x27;ll admit, her hair was more than a little silky afterwards. Then, about two months out of the one year warranty, it stopped turning on, done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fun times to have an expensive heating coil with two plates on it not be able to last even a few years.</li>
            <li> This is great, I have very thick naturally curly hair. It works so much better on my hair then any other straightener I have ever had. Would recommend! I have had for almost a year and still love it!</li>
            <li> This is not a knock off but the brand name Chi. Excellent hair iron. Perfect for natural curly hair.</li>
            <li> The chi deep brilliance hair styling flat iron is excellent for my doughter, she love this flat iron is a lot better than others.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my lovely wife asked for a Chi flat iron.  I didn&#x27;t know there was any difference in them and the description was vague at best.  This is designed for a more coarse hair than my wife&#x27;s.  They wanted to charge me a \\&quot;restocking fee\\&quot; for the refund so I just marked the price up a bit and resold it on Swap-Shop for a cool $19 profit... GO ME!!!!</li>
            <li> It was a great purchase.I can flat iron natural hair and weaved hair bone straight !  I will be buying again</li>
            <li> Easy to handle, Settings have option to increase or decrease the heat. Works perfect &amp; pleased with the professional look.</li>
            <li> I am on a hair journey and growing my natural hair out. These flat irons are great for course hair!! and my hair is course! no longer need perms with these irons....straightens my hair just as nice....love them</li>
            <li> i&#x27;d wanted a chi for a long time, but it wasn&#x27;t until recently that i finally decided to break down and buy one. this deep brilliance chi was the cheapest chi i could find online ANYWHERE (barring others with terrible reviews that i wouldn&#x27;t even consider). i was pretty apprehensive about the \\&quot;deep brilliance\\&quot; aspect of it, because i thought it may be too powerful for my hair or just not the right make for it (my hair is thick, but only slightly wavy and not too terrible to manage), but, thank goodness, this chi turned out to be a perfect fit.    a super cheap and PURPLE chi - what more could a girl ask for :)</li>
            <li> Great flat iron of course! Heats up in less than a minute and stays hot.  Has a timer also if you&#x27;re kind of forgetful and don&#x27;t remember to turn it off.  Love the digital controls!</li>
            <li> Works magic and curls very nice! A great investment. I recently went natural and this flat iron really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my teenage daughter and she loves it. I love the auto turnoff   feature so she doesn&#x27;t burn our house down.  If you try and buy this in any  retail store it would be more than double the price.</li>
            <li> I have extremely curly hair and have used many different flat irons in attempt to get that nice sleek look without the bumps and frizz. This is the first flat iron that has actually accomplished that!!! I have only had it for a few days, but I am absolutely in love. This little gizmo does a great job with my curls and has finally given me the sleek look that I have wanted. Also, I love the digital display, it makes it very easy to determine how hot the flat iron is, normally it&#x27;s sort of a guessing game with the slider dials, but this is simple and easy. Overall a great little product!!!</li>
            <li> CHI and other Farouk Systems products are only sold through authorized salon retailers, and Amazon is not one of them. (This also includes CHI products sold at places like Target.) The warranty will be INVALID, meaning there is no guarantee on this product should it break, etc. Many make this mistake and think they can buy CHI products and styling tools online, but they are WRONG. If the price seems too good to be true, it usually is. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> as a woman with extra curly hair i found MY CHI AMAZING. leaves hair straight and looking gorgeous. not everything works on mixed girls  this does the trick</li>
            <li> By far the best straightner out there. My daughter and I use this straightner daily and we both have very long hair.. After 3 years it&#x27;s still going strong!! Love it!</li>
            <li> It worked great on your hair, but stopped working after just a year. Expected it to work way longer than that.</li>
            <li> The Chi irons are the best. i can control the temperature and they dont burn my hair. this was my best purchase yet.</li>
            <li> I had a instyler straightner  which i hated!!! Seen good reviews for this so bought one just likethis but in the orange. And its the best flat iron iv ever had. I have black coarse medium lenght hair. And WOW within few mins i was done. Gets really jot quick an stays hot unlike all the other flat irons gtta constantly reheat them. Get this you wont regret!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love the chi. I have very curly hair &amp; I can get it completely straight in 15 min. The adjustable tempurature is great &amp; it heats up super fast</li>
            <li> When I first bought it i will admit i was a bit reserved; because i have 2 daughters with semi-coarse hair and other flat irons really did not flatten properly; however just one use of this CHI DEEP BRILLIANCE!!! IT FLATTENED LIKE SILK! AND IT LEAVES YOUR HAIR SOOO SOFT FOR DAYS! WORD OF CAUTION***PLEASE PLEASE whatever u do also get the CHI SPRAY GUARD , i had to learn the hard way this CHI GETS EXTREMELY HOT! and if u are not careful or spray the hair with spray guard first it will burn your HAIR!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron.  The titanium blades leaves my very curly hair, soft and shiny.  Works great!  Heats up quickly, would highly recommend this iron.</li>
            <li> It was not a bad purchase. The product works well. The only problem I have is while holding &amp; using the Chi,  my hand sometimes presses the button &amp; it gets turned off. A couple minutes later, when the hair isn&#x27;t becoming straight, I realize the Chi is off.</li>
            <li> I gave this out a gift to by best friend. She is completely in love with it. She is a daily user of this flat iron.</li>
            <li> I received this as a Christmas gift. I have always used an inexpensive flat iron. I mainly have straight hair with a slight wave. So I use one just to smooth out the wave to make it completely straight. This flat iron has easily cut my &amp;#34;styling time&amp;#34; in half. It heats up very quickly and stays hot. It takes the wave out of my hair in no time! My first day of using it, I went to work and my co-workers (who didn&#x27;t know that I got this for Christmas) made comments on how smooth and shiny my hair looked. I have already recommended it to others. A great purchase!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, glad the on/off switch is not on the inside.  The last one I had the on/off switch broke off.  The only down fall is I find it a little fat too hold.  I can live with that though.  Product came really quick and was very pleases with it.</li>
            <li> This is a legitamate Chi flat iron and works beautifully. The heat distributes evenly, and the reset button works just like a hair dryer does. The timer is helpful if you&#x27;re prone to forgetting you&#x27;ve left it on. The only drawback: the buttons for adjusting the temperature and timer are on the side as opposed to the lower interior part, so you may have to hold it a certain way to avoid pushing them with your fingers.</li>
            <li> Love my new flat iron! I like how I can set the temp. I&#x27;m also notorious for leaving my straightener on, so I REALLY like how it&#x27;s set to shut off automatically.</li>
            <li> Bought for my daughter and received quickly.  She hasn&#x27;t used it yet due to it is a christmas present.  I&#x27;m sure that the product will work fine.</li>
            <li> This chi iron is the best purchase i have made so far, i bought this as a christmas gift for my aunt , the highest degree it goes to is 410 . leaves hair super straight . love love , shipping was fast got here on time . awesome</li>
            <li> I am a single dad. My 13 year old asked for a flat iron. After some research and asking some friends and professional hair stylist, I decided on this item. I was very pleased. My daughter loves it. She has very long and thick hair and this flat iron makes her hair straight and silky (that&#x27;s what she says). I had no idea which flat iron to go with and I know there are a lot of them out there. I would recommend this to anyone. I&#x27;m sure there are those out there with more options and settings but this made my little girl smile, and she said I did a good job.</li>
            <li> This product did not work and studying other videos about the authenticity of a real Chi, this one did not have the raised words on the inside like a real Chi has. I did return the item and a refund was issued but it wasnt a full refund...it was minus $20. Bummer!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, she finally has her own CHI straightener! It was brand new, in the original box. Thanks</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this item on Amazin but I loved it soo much, I&#x27;m still writing a review. I have very thick hair, natural hair and this thing got my hair &amp;#34;relaxer&amp;#34; straight. I have never had a flat iron that gets this hot, so quickly yet does not burn my hair. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I am cheap and my sister wanted a Chi flat iron. It heats up fast and it leaves the hair nice and silky looking.</li>
            <li> My girl love this Chi. It was a great purchase and arrived fast. This is awesome product. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I love CHI. They have great flat irons. It makes my wavey hair easily strait. I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> this did not turn out to be the ideal product which i bought for my daughter who already has a flat iron she was wanting one that gets hotter.. for better performance</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a whim and it got here with in days! It was cheap but still works better than any other straightner I have ever had. It is great quality!</li>
            <li> My New CHI IRON, is just what most of the reviews says it is. I&#x27;m enjoying it with out any complaints. I would recommend this CHI to anyone!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this about a year ago along with the matching blow dryer.  They are nice colors but highly disappointed in the quality.  The silver around the LED temp. is peeling off, and the edges around the plates are discolored almost a scorched look.  Way to much money for a crappy product.  I am defently second guessing the AUTHENTICITY of the product.  My hair dresser has had hers for more then 3 years and it is in great shape.  Please second guess buying this purchase from Folica.com or buy from a repitable dealer.  I spend to much money on my hair and products for my hair to let it get ruined by poor products, and when you spend this kind of money it should last a long time like my solia that I have had for 3 yrs.  I purchased this bec I wanted a 1 inch and since I also need something over 400 degrees figured this would be good since this is the same brand my stylist uses. UGH! It embarrasses me to show friends.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and quality is just as it stated. I love how it works on my hairs! Great service.</li>
            <li> This Chi is amazing.  My friend got it for her mother and it is excellent.  She has coarser hair and it smooths it perfectly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my step-daughter for Christmas.  She loved that it was purple and took it with her when she went home.</li>
            <li> Love this chi! Does great with my hair. I have very course and curly hair and this is the best one i&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li> I bought this after using my Revlon Ceramic Flat Iron this is so much better Heats up fast and takes half the time. Awesome product. Can&#x27;t go wrong with Chi.</li>
            <li> I bought it for my daughter and she loves it. She likes that it is digital and has a auto shut off.</li>
            <li> this is a perfect grooming aid for hair that tends to be a bit frizzy and frazzled. The heat is high enough to straighten out frizz and give your hair the sleek groomed look you&#x27;re looking for. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> At first I could not get it to turn on and was ready to send it back, but the always patient hubby turned it right on. I am so glad he did, it is much lighter to handle than my old one and works great.</li>
            <li> I really liked it however honestly I think if I had purchased a different model it would have been fine as well.  This product was a little to much for my needs. It got hot immediately so I would unplug it and then proceed to use it.</li>
            <li> It heats up fairly quick, straightens very nicely, and you can curl with it. The purple is more of a pinkish color but I like it nonetheless.</li>
            <li> High quality flat iron. Works great and my daughter is very pleased with how well it works and is not as hard on her hair.</li>
            <li> The item was just as decribed and it arrived on time.  Very useful purchase.  The item is very expensive otherwise.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for my daughter for Christmas.  I was late in ordering the product but it arrived in record time.  It works great and I would definitely recommend ordering from this company in the future!</li>
            <li> I have wanted a chi for a while because I&#x27;ve heard such great things about it. I&#x27;ve been using hand me down flat irons for I don&#x27;t know how long. The first time I used it I was a believer. I have loooooong hair and my fixing time was cut in half. And I got it for less than in stores!  Thanks!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about owning a flat iron, and I chose the Chi because I have used their hair products and always loved the results from their serum, shampoo and conditioner. My daughter-in-law owns the Chi flat iron, but a different model as she got hers a couple of years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thing that I am very disappointed with is the control panel. I received my flat iron a day before I was to take a trip to attend a very important function, and I really needed to use it on my hair. My hairdresser uses a flat iron on me...so I was aware how to use it, but the on button (black soft rubber) got stuck and no matter what I did, I couldn&#x27;t unstick it. I did take it on my trip...and after very carefully putting my fingernail in the small opening, I was able to get the button to lift up....and ever since, I have been very, very careful when I start the iron up...trying to prevent the button from sticking....but there is no guarantee that it won&#x27;t stick to the bottom again. My d-i-l&#x27;s control panel is not on the actual flat iron, and a much better control system; it is not that soft rubber that sticks. For the price of this unit...there should have been a much better on/off control panel.</li>
            <li> Received my Chi 10 months ago as a gift.  It no longer turns on.  My sister had the same problem with her Chi flat iron, and also less than a year old.  Would not purchase a Chi flat iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my teenaged granddaughter and she loved it!  I liked the auto shut off feature.  Great product for a reasonable price.  It was packaged well and it arrived earlier than the projected delivery date--that was a BIG plus with my granddaughter!</li>
            <li> I bought these flat irons for my little sister for Christmas,and she loves them, they are worth the price I paid for them and more. They really straighten kinky hair.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast, and the flat iron works pretty well.  It is however, not an authentic Chi.  It has a Made in China label on the box, and according to Chi, all products are Made in America.  Considering it works well, it may be worth the price.  We have used it 3 times and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Like it but the problem with is the on and off button is in a bad location.  While in use you can easily turn it off without realizing it.</li>
            <li> Chi has always been an amazing produce. It&#x27;s fast working and leaves a shine and im happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get a chi, I had wanted one for a long time.  I loved that it heated up quickly and had temperature settings!  However I got exactly three uses out of it before it stopped working.  I was so disappointed, I tried every outlet in the house just hoping one of them would be the magic one that got it working again.  With a family of 6 this was a lot to spend on something that didn&#x27;t last.  I will be trying a different brand the next time I am able to get a straightener!</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this CHI flat iron!!! I honestly don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase it.  It was a great deal on Amazon, and well worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard Chi is one of the best procucts on the market so I bought one.  The pitch says the iron will leave your hair smooth and shiny.  I see no difference in this product than any other I&#x27;ve had.  Was at the mall recently and stopped at a kiask selling flat irons.  The retailer ironed my hair with a remarkable outcome.  I could amazingly see the difference in my hair.  It was shiny and gorgeous.  I will never buy another Chi</li>
            <li> It gets hot, it heats up fast, it does what its supposed to and its purple, I love purple. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> This is the second time I have bought one of these for my daughters.  The first purchase was last year for my oldest daughter and she loves it so much I bought another one for my younger daughter.  Great seller, fast delivery and great price!</li>
            <li> I love this flat iron. It heats up fast and works through my hair great. It leaves my hair nice and smooth and not dry.</li>
            <li> Because her hair is so curly, she likes to change it up once in a while and this was the product for her! I received bonus points from her and kudos go out to all Chi products!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cool looking, give it that. The settings are pretty neat but it did a terrible job on my hair. I have shoulder length hair and is natural curly somewhat and has frizz. This CHI made it worse. I had to wash my hair over and use my old straightener. Terrible product for my hair.</li>
            <li> Works great, better than I even imagined. Came quickly and was exactly as described. At first I sometimes hit the buttons on the side with my thumb when picking it up but only for the first 2 days, now I have it down and love it!</li>
            <li> I have owned 2 chi&#x27;s before this one and this is hands down my favorite.  I have noticed that with the titanium plates I do not get static. I have recommended to all my friends!</li>
            <li> I have purchased different CHI flat iron models over the last 5 years, and this one works the best. I have curly hair- not tight curls, and in less than 10 minutes, this flat iron will leave my hair straight. I bought one for my each of my daughters- they love it as well. All of their friends are jealous of their flat iron. The best thing is that it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair like some of the other CHI models. I give it a 10+</li>
            <li> I just recieved my Chi today (came overnight) and I used it right away. This is the best flat iron I have ever used. I am a former hairstylist, and I can say that this is definitely an exceptional tool!!! I am transitioning from relaxer to natural, 4b hair, and let me tell you, my hair is straight, silky, and does not feel dried out at all!! Thank you CHI! I will never buy another brand again. I also love the product sample that came with it;will be ordering that soon!!!</li>
            <li> The straightener wouldn&#x27;t stay on for more than 30 seconds. I was incredibly disappointed because this was the first CHI I&#x27;ve ever purchased, and I&#x27;ve always heard wonderful things about these straighteners from everyone I know. The seller was fabulous about handling the return and refunded my purchase right away, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> I have thick wavy hair and live in humid Florida.  The iron is smooth-no hair snagging.  It leaves my hair shiny and straight and it last for days.</li>
            <li> I like it, although  I&#x27;ve had better chis but for the in expensiveness of it, it wasn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this straightener!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a great price for a great product!&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was fast and it takes about 1 minute for my straightener to heat up to the max temp.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it for around 9 months or so and I&#x27;ve had fabulous results with each use! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with thick or course hair like mine!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for about six months now and I am loving it.  It works great, does the job great and my hair stays flat even the day after.  I have long, thick hair and I was a little worried about getting a 1&amp;#34; inch flat iron thinking it would take forever, but I was pretty amazed at how fast and effective this flat iron works on my hair. I chose titanium over ceramic because (to me) titanium works just as good as ceramic and I don&#x27;t think it burns my hair any more or any less than the ceramic flat irons I&#x27;ve had before.&lt;br /&gt;I do wish the &#x27;Automatic off&#x27; setting would work as soon as you turn on the flat iron, but I&#x27;ve just gotten used to setting the timer when I know I&#x27;m in a hurry and I may forget to turn it off.  Happy customer, will never own anything other than a CHI. ;) &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd Chi and I love it! It was great for the price and worked like the one that I had prior to this.</li>
            <li> Leaves me hair silky &amp; shiny  I love it my mother loves hers it heats up real fast &amp; leaves wonderful results</li>
            <li> I was so surprised with how fast the product was shipped. It arrived within a few days from the actual order and in great shape. No problems with the packaging. I purchased this Chi hot iron for my wife and she is very pleased with it. The digital temp is easy to read and the iron heats up quickly. The section of the iron where the plates are does get hot, but the handle where your hand grips the iron doesn&#x27;t. It is also very light weight and easy to lift up over your head for extended periods of time. My wife is also thrilled with her new soft straight hair. She also loves the Hot Pink color (It is not purple). I recommend both the product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I am sooooo happy with my new flat iron! It is very durable. I was skeptical at first because many digital flat irons are not as good as they say they are on the box or on the site you buy them on. This warms up fast, is very durable and works wonderfully. I am very happy! Works on all types of hair!</li>
            <li> This flat iron is the beat one I&#x27;ve ever had.  I have really tight curls and this gets my hair really straight and doesn&#x27;t take a long time.  The plates also heat up really fast.</li>
            <li> Barely lasted 4 months.  Absolutely terrible product.  I&#x27;m not sure if this wasn&#x27;t a real Chi flat iron that was being sold.</li>
            <li> CHI deep brilliance flat iron.  i bought this as a bday gift.  She only got 3 months use and then it broke.  i will now have to send it back to manufacturer for repair.  Not happy.</li>
            <li> The Chi flat iron is just ok.  It is nothing special.  I have fine hair for an African-American and I had to put it on the highest settint to even get it straight which can be very damaging.  I purchased it thinking it would be different then the cheap Remington flat iron I bought at Sally Beauty Supply because it said for textured hair.  It was no different and my hair is not as straight as I would like.  Too keep the hair healthy only flat iron it twice a month at the most.  Is is a better experience to go to a professional hair salon!</li>
            <li> The Item was as described in the description.  Enjoying the product very much.  It is working exactly as was told in the description, very glad we got it. Very easy transaction. Would definitely use this company again.</li>
            <li> This was not for me as this was a gift for someone else. But the person that I gave it to did not say anything bad about it so I will say it is a good buy.</li>
            <li> I needed better flatirons and I&#x27;m glad I chose these after recommendations. The titanium plate does work better than the ceramic. Fast shipping too thanks!!</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this flat iron.  I ordered the newer version from QVC and it had some nice features... I have wavy coarse frizzy hair and thought this could work.&lt;br /&gt;I did not have any luck with this product.  It did not straighten my hair in one pass... let alone three.  And to get it reasonably straight I had to have the heat set at its max which is way bad for hair (especially if you are making 3 to 4 passes through it)!&lt;br /&gt;They say this will help hair retain moisture but i did not notice any of that happening.&lt;br /&gt;I just do not feel this was a good product for me.  I have been using Helen of Troy hair appliances for about 10 years now and I feel I should just stick to those.</li>
            <li> FIRST OFF, I HAVE AN ACUTAL CHI(REAL ONE) BUT THIS WAS THE ONLY WEBSITE I COULD LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT NO MATTER WHAT KIND U GET CHI SUCK AFTER A COUPLE MONTHS OF USE!  I HAD THE FIST CHI THEY CAME OUT WITH (THE ALL BLACK)AND HAD THAT FOR 3 YEARS UNTIL THE WIRES WENT OUT FROM BEING TANGLED)SO I WANTED TO UPGRADED TO A REALLY GOOD ONE THAT I THOUGHT WOULD WORK THE BEST! THIS ONE WORKED REALLY GOOD AT FIRST HEATED UP FAST, THE SCREEN WAS COOL AND THE SHUTOFF TIMER WAS COOL.AND THE LOOP WAS GREAT TO HANG IT UP SO THE CORD DONT GET TANGLED!BUT.....I GOT THIS STRAIGHTNER FROM MY SISTER FOR CHRISTMAS 2011 ..SO IT HASNT BEEN A YEAR JUST YET. ( I DIDNT KNOW ABOUT THE WARRANTY&#x27;S)AND IT JUST STOPPED WORKING. I PLUGGED IT IN AND WOULDNT TURN ON.I TRIED ALL THE WALL SOCKETS... WASNT THE WALL SOCKET. SO I WENT INTO DEPRESSION. I WROTE CHI&#x27;S CUSTOMER SERVICE AN EMAIL TELLING THEM I WOULD SEND THE STRAIGHTNER TO THEM SO THEY CAN SEE ITS IN GREAT CONDITION AND IF THEY CAN FIX IT FOR ME. I DIDNT WANT MONEY BACK OR A NEW ONE I JUST WANTED IT FIXED. THIS IS THIER EXACT RESPONSE I COPYED AND PASTED\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the consideration of your safety and beauty, we suggest that you buy a new CHI straightener instead. We will offer you $5 discounts then.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br /&gt;David&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAN U BELIEVE THIS CUSTOMER SERVICE? THE MILLIONS THEY MAKE AND THEY CANT FIX IT FOR ME?  SO I WILL NOT SPEND MY MONEY ON CHI AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE LACK IN LOYALTY AND CONSIDERATION IN THEIR CUSTOMERS.</li>
            <li> This iron is okay but not what I expected from the Chi brand. It smooths and straightens my hair without snagging it or breaking it off which are qualities I like in this iron. However, I have to use the hottest setting which has blistered my fingers a few times and it takes twice as long to straighten vs my old cheapo iron. My hair is not course or super thick but it is wavy. This iron works me to death! It was deeply discounted so I can&#x27;t complain about the price but I expect better quality from Chi. My old iron, a Walmart cheapo did the job in half the time with half the heat, but it snagged and broke my hair off. I&#x27;m still looking for my \\&quot;dream\\&quot; flat iron.</li>
            <li> This is product arrived promptly from \\&quot;Quick E Mart\\&quot;, which is the Amazon seller for this product.  I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was real or fake, since I know there are plenty of fake Chi straighteners out there.  There was nothing odd about the packaging and I thought it was real.  It worked wonderfully for about a month of regular use, then all of a sudden it stopped working entirely!  To add insult to injury, the warranty is void if not purchased from an authorized dealer (which \\&quot;Quick E Mart\\&quot; is not).  I can&#x27;t afford to keep buying this every month!  My friends, who own authentic Chi straighteners, actually said \\&quot;I didn&#x27;t know a Chi could break!  Sounds fake.\\&quot;  Save your money and purchase a REAL Chi from an authorized dealer (check out the Chi product website for that info).  I&#x27;m so annoyed by this and I wish I&#x27;d read all the negative reviews for spending my hard earned money on this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Now I will admit; I was told what to purchase by my niece...a hairdresser.  I got this for my great niece...age 10; and it is perfect for her hair.  Her hair is very, very thick and long, and curly....3 different obstacles that alot of people don&#x27;t have all together!  It works perfectly for her hair; and I&#x27;m sure if it works for hers it would be great if you even have 1 or 2 of these things to contend with!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my gf and she loved it. Now her family has took it over and they all love it.</li>
            <li> my daughter is in college and she just loved it.  I also purchase the matching blow dryer too. the flat iron gets her hair really straight and that&#x27;s good because she is a Afro-American girl with kinky hair.</li>
            <li> I just love it,its the best flat iron ever,my hair is soft  and silky after i used,i recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE my Chi! It is a really great product, and I have had several Chi&#x27;s, but this is by far the absolute best!</li>
            <li> Love this item. I use this product daily and love it. Would recommend if you need your hair straight. Works in seconds and makes it looks great.</li>
            <li> The Chi flat iron is a great product to have. I recommend it to EVERYONE!!!! Definitely purchase this item either for yourself or as a gift.</li>
            <li> I love my Chi Deep Brilliance Digital Flat Iron. I&#x27;ve always wanted one, but wasn&#x27;t going to pay those outrageous prices for one. I found this one and I have to say its a fabulous deal! It works like a charm and was at a great price considering what most new ones cost. It has a digital temperature display so you can easily change the temp to the desired temperature for your hair. Great product. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve owned, heats up within seconds and I greatly recommend it to anyone who is looking to buy one.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter to replace her CHI original ceramic flat iron. She had the other CHI for 7 years and loved it so I was nervous to get a different type. She has now used it for approximately 3 weeks. When I asked if she liked the new flat iron, she said &amp;#34;LOVE IT! It heats up quickly, gets very hot and leaves my hair very shiny&amp;#34;. She has very thick, long, slightly wavy hair and needs a flat iron that is very hot to make her hair stay straight. Plus, I bought it in the purple color and it is really cute. I am very pleased with this purchase and the price was excellent.</li>
            <li> This straightener works really well. I am not a big fan of the color, but I love it. It heats up extremely fast and straightens your hair very nicely. It is durable and will last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is amazing. I had no idea the Chi made such a difference. My daughter kept telling me to try it, and now I&#x27;ll never use anything else! Super fast shipping, EXCELLENT product!</li>
            <li> Very good quality hair straightener! Works well, and straightens curly latina hair pretty well! It takes me about 20 minutes to straighten my hair</li>
            <li> I love the Chi flat iron. It&#x27;s a lot easier on my hair than any other flat iron I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would get too hot, but it is fine on any setting. Easy to use and stays level when you lay it down, so no accidental burns on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I got this for my daughter for Christmas and she loves it. It was a great price and a great buy! I wish I would have bought myself one too. :-)</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, with slight curl and professionally colored.  Other flat irons I have used didn&#x27;t do the job, but this one is great and leaves my hair shiny.  The effect last through rainy weather and intense exercise.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I love this straightener. I have always wanted a Chi and I am glad I got this one. Love it!</li>
            <li> This works great on my super curly hair!  It leaves it soft and shiny!  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> It was good, but I think I might like the ceramic better. Titanium is definitely for really coarse hair. It hears up really fast and really hot. Wouldn&#x27;t necessarily recommend for relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I was Very disappointed in the chi. It Didnt even get as hot as the inexpensive flat iron I bought at Walmart. The color was nice but it didnt do as promised</li>
            <li> I was looking for a new Chi for my daughter and I came upon this product, looked at the reviews and decided to buy  it and I have been happy with this product every since we got. Not only a great price but also love the fact of changing the temperature which is not possible with other Chi&#x27;s. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This flat Iron arrived on time and I think it works great for the money that it cost. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the on off switch and the option to pick the temp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few other straightners but this one tops the cake. My hair is always soft and smooth after using.</li>
            <li> Being wanting one for the longest. I&#x27;m in love with it. I love the color the size and how it does my hair because I have a natural but I love for it to be straight and this works perfect.</li>
            <li> works pretty well. doesn&#x27;t heat up as high as i hoped. the arms are pretty thick and heavy so it hurts after a while of using. but overall a decent purchase.</li>
            <li> 4 years since I&#x27;ve purchased this flat iron and it is still in perfect condition!</li>
            <li> I have owned multiple Chi&#x27;s. This was awful!. It fried my hair and my daughter&#x27;s. Does not work like any other Chi I have owned. Definitely do NOT buy!</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron.  I like that you can change the temperature and that it has an automatic  cut off</li>
            <li> This is my first Chi!! I love it!! I have very thick natural red hair that is hard to straighten! When no other flat iron would get my ponytail hump out in the past, this one almost did!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> My CHI straightener was beginning to get old, so I decided i needed a new one. The only problems with my older one was it started pulling my hair, and that I would forget to turn it of ALL THE TIME! with the deep brilliance, the plates are titanium, which I find much smoother than the ceramic plates. Another pro was being able to set a timer so if I forget to turn it off, it does it for me!I would recommend this to anyone. My hair isn&#x27;t necessarily &#x27;course&#x27; but it does have some curl. $45 well spent!</li>
            <li> I have fine hair! My last chi died and was not under warranty still! So I ordered this one! Was worried because this was for textured hair! Works wonderful on my hair&lt;br /&gt;Love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this item!!! When I thought that I would have to pay 100 dollars plus for a CHI I came across this item for sale!!! It&#x27;s cute and it straightens my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair straightener. I love the fact you can adjust the temperatures. Very easy to use and very quick.</li>
            <li> I previously purchased a Chi Smart styling iron from QVC. The iron quit working after 3 months and I had paid $140 for it (and some other accessories). I was skeptical about ordering another Chi iron, but I&#x27;m so glad I got it. After almost 3 months, this iron has proven to be of superior quality and curls my hair perfectly. I have had no problems with it at all. The styling iron is a hot pink color, not purple as advertised. Still a great hair styling tool.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves her Chi!  It was a great price.  Her last Chi died after 6 years of using it. Normal wear and tear!</li>
            <li> This is not a real Chi product. It does not work good on my hair at all. It may work good for others but I would not recommend it. To me it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I really like this flat iron. I love the color and design and it&#x27;s long cord. Now I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but I didn&#x27;t understand why this got so many bad reviews. I previously purchased the HSI flat iron and returned it and wanted to give this one a shot. I&#x27;m definitely keeping it.</li>
