            <li>I am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it top reviews.</li>

            <li>I definitely love it.  </li>
            <li>is that the pump distributes much more product than needed.</li>
            <li>The gel smells really nice, mostly like fresh cucumbers, which happen to be a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and I would purchase item because I enjoyed the feel of its application.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not certain how well this works for eye wrinkles since I don&#x27;t have any of those yet thankfully, but I do have a lot of puffiness under my eyes caused from seasonal allergies and this is perfect for that!  </li>
            <li>anyway I appreciate that they did give me that voucher I was excited to be able to try the item even though it did not work on my end of her if you want how it looks and</li>
            <li>Once on the eye area, the cream soaks in and disappears very, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>There is a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed in the ingredients, and while cucumber hydrosol is an ingredient, that wouldn&#x27;t be as strong as what I&#x27;m smelling.</li>
            <li>It does not have any strong scent or anything.</li>
            <li>though, this is amazing the first day after putting it on my bags got lighter in color</li>
            <li>My bathroom is full of serums and this became one of my favorite,</li>
            <li>I CAN ALREADY SEE MY FINE LINES DIMINISHING.  </li>
            <li>pretty sure people are being paid to rate this product a 5 and writing an outstanding review.</li>
            <li>It appears that my fine lines are finer.</li>
            <li>Fine lines and wrinkles have drastically improved.</li>
            <li>ingredients are those that have created results for beautiful, healthy skin – none of the unpronounceable chemicals here, just natural products with a gentle aroma.  </li>
            <li>I loved the feel of the eye wrinkle cream and the fact that it is all natural and absorbs into the skin area easily.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very light and fresh.</li>

            <li>My remarks are sincere and my own.gation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>This does not seem light any of the other products ive tested &amp; that makes me really happy.</li>
            <li>I really needed a good eye care product that is good to use in summer when the weather is hot, dry and lot of sun damage.</li>
            <li>Turned the skin it touched bright red.  </li>
            <li>Boy is that amazing because I have tried everything that is natural and they never work.</li>
            <li>Great product and minimal scent.</li>
            <li>I love the pump because you wont pull out to much product out</li>
            <li>what&#x27;s in the product it sounds like a really really good product hopefully next time the voucher will work</li>
            <li>but I will continue to use it just because it does such a good job of eliminating the puffiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Your Eye Wrinkle Cream / Gel doesn&#x27;t get a fair chance to be properly reviewed when it takes one month or longer to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li>When you put it on it feels cool on your skin.  </li>
            <li>I love how much I got in this bottle.</li>
            <li>It feels cool going on.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You get quite a bit with one full pump.  </li>
            <li>It is a great to help keep your skin tight and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li>Unlike other skin care products - this one has a great smell and dries quickly.</li>
            <li>It is a bit like a quick spa treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It applies easily and dries quickly, leaving your skin smooth I highly recommend it and this seller.</li>
            <li>I love my new eyes wrinkle</li>
            <li>I love the way this feels on my skin and that its full of natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helped my under eye puffiness</li>
            <li>I know many people want to look younger &amp; hip because they see they are getting fine lines.</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive to alot of facial products but this one is great</li>
            <li>Such a nice brake from medicinal smelling serums.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t leave a shiny or sticky look &amp; didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, So far so good.</li>
            <li>LOVE THE TEXTURE OF THIS CREAM GEL, IT&#x27;S CLEAR TEXTURE.</li>
            <li>I have not noticed a whole lot of improvement yet, but I know most things take a whole lot longer than a week to work.</li>
            <li>Feel great on my skin - not sure if I&#x27;ve noticed much reduction in fine lines and wrinkles though.</li>
            <li>so I bought this and used it for few times in a day on my whole face and it feels so great and cool  </li>
            <li>It goes on the skin very easily and spreads great, so a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li>It is clear and goes on easy.</li>
            <li>, This is the first eye cream that I&#x27;ve gotten that has not smelt like pickles.</li>
            <li>I really like this!</li>
            <li>This is my first day trying this eye cream.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light which I like, not heavy, so I can use it under makeup.  </li>
            <li>This eye gel from ArtNaturals feels great on the skin and keeps delicate eye-tissue hydrated.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much of it at all!</li>
            <li>This also contains 30ml of products as most eye creams are only 10-15ml.</li>
            <li>But it still wants a review!</li>
            <li>It has really helped with my bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li>You will feel a bit of a tingle first few uses, but take that as a good thing since it means its working!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>unfortunately no results.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;d recommend only using 1/4 to 1/2 a pump at first and add more if needed.  </li>
            <li>It not only feels like its really penetrating the layers of my skin but putting a barrier between the world and my precious skin.</li>
            <li>I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure for long term results-I&#x27;ll need quite a while.</li>
            <li>I noticed that fine lines were disappearing and the wrinkles around my eyes are not as deep!  </li>
            <li>Since it is in such a nice and compact container I can throw it in my purse and use it again later in the day if I&#x27;ve been outside a lot and need a quick touch up!</li>
            <li>I really think this product may achieve that.</li>
            <li>You do not need a whole lot when applying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thank you so much for allowing me to review this product.</li>
            <li>IT IS REASONABLY PRICED.  </li>
            <li>I -really-</li>
            <li>Seems to really help my moisturizer absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li>How ever this product really works.</li>
            <li>If you apply foundation or eye concealer, I would recommend to let the eye gel really set before you put foundation on, otherwise, the makeup will look a bit cakey under the eyes.</li>
            <li>I received this free product to try out and to share my personal experience.</li>
            <li>I noticed a discount code for this and ordered it quickly as I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>I really like this eye gel</li>
            <li>Very soothing and moisturizing around the eyes.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the texture</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It has a cooling effect when applied and feels very moisturizing to that area.  </li>
            <li>A few things I love is that the youth eye gel protects aging from uv rays, restores the glow in your face, and feels 100% fresh after putting it on.</li>
            <li>So many times I have tried eye creams that claim to reduce fine lines and firm the skin around your eyes, making them to appear younger.</li>
            <li>I put it on 1st thing in the morning before my moisterizer and daily makeup routine which isn&#x27;t much at all anymore because my face feels so much better with my new daily routine from artnaturals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like this one better than the The Body Shop eye gel that is slightly more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clear gel witch is good because i wouldn&#x27;t want to put anything other then clear on my face, It helps with other things beside the puffiness under the eye, I like that it helps with many different things besides that.</li>
            <li>Highly Recommended&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Left my eyes feeling young and fresh!</li>
            <li>It ok, A little sitcky</li>
            <li>impressed with the activity of natural products and the lack of unpleasant side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I look young in the face, but I feel that my neck wrinkles tell my real age.  </li>
            <li>This is a reasonable price, and I like that it&#x27;s mostly natural and partly organic.</li>
            <li>The ingredients is 98% natural so as it is gently to my skin, no irritation occur or any sign of redness.</li>
            <li>&amp; It also adds to use with ur normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li>, that should happen in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li>i actually feel like i cut some fresh cucumber from my fridge and stuck them around my eyes.</li>
            <li>pump gives me a little more than I need at one time, so I suggest starting with a very gentle pump.  </li>
            <li>I have had people ask me what I am using, if it was a new make up or</li>
            <li>The label has a typo: &amp;#34;....delicate area around they eyes.&amp;#34; The overall impression is that of a product that did not get any detailed  development work, but was simply bottled up and thrown on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This eye wrinkle cream is very soft and moist.</li>
            <li>This is my go-to daily eye gel for hot weather.</li>
            <li>I like it because it is made 98% natural and out of this 72% organic!</li>
            <li>&amp; WOW did it not disappoint!  </li>
            <li>the cucumber scent of art naturals and cold feeling when you are on the highest level of stress and worn eyes from long day at work is so AWESOME.</li>
            <li>It goes on clear and you can immediately feel a firming sensation on your skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin feels really soft, and so far I am please but cannot say I&#x27;ve had results in one day.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s early in use</li>
            <li>but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li>I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li>(Soft?</li>
            <li>Non greasy and soft and silky.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this eye gel for a couple of weeks; so far I can identify no noticeable changes.  </li>
            <li>but overall it worked very well</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m in my early 30s.</li>
            <li>but I have no dark circles under my eye!</li>
            <li>Although I barely started using this product, it makes my skin feel soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>It works really to me when I applied it on my face and not conscious about</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s totally non-irritating (and I have really sensitive skin) and it absorbs completely leaving no residue.</li>
            <li>I applied it as the instructions indicated and it dried rather quickly with no residue or dryness...</li>
            <li>When you apply it around the delicate areas of your eyes, just use your ring finger to gently tap in the cream very gently.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too clear about were the instructions for using the product.</li>
            <li>It sinks in fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li>Which for how much product You only use It well last me for a long time.</li>
            <li>I personally prefer gel texture over cream form in summer because I like something that is light weight and does not feel thick under makeup.</li>
            <li>The first time I used this eye cream, I was expecting it to be sticky and flaky once it dried but to my surprise it was not.</li>
            <li>It is super thick</li>
            <li>* I can&#x27;t really see any except for a slight moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential for long-term effectiveness:</li>

            <li> I am so in love with this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it top reviews.</li>
            <li> It relieved my under eye puffiness and the wrinkles are already much better.</li>

            <li> I definitely love it.  </li>
            <li> is that the pump distributes much more product than needed.</li>
            <li> The gel smells really nice, mostly like fresh cucumbers, which happen to be a favorite of mine.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to apply and I would purchase item because I enjoyed the feel of its application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain how well this works for eye wrinkles since I don&#x27;t have any of those yet thankfully, but I do have a lot of puffiness under my eyes caused from seasonal allergies and this is perfect for that!  </li>
            <li> anyway I appreciate that they did give me that voucher I was excited to be able to try the item even though it did not work on my end of her if you want how it looks and</li>
            <li> Once on the eye area, the cream soaks in and disappears very, very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> There is a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed in the ingredients, and while cucumber hydrosol is an ingredient, that wouldn&#x27;t be as strong as what I&#x27;m smelling.</li>
            <li> It does not have any strong scent or anything.</li>
            <li> though, this is amazing the first day after putting it on my bags got lighter in color</li>
            <li> My bathroom is full of serums and this became one of my favorite,</li>
            <li> I CAN ALREADY SEE MY FINE LINES DIMINISHING.  </li>
            <li> pretty sure people are being paid to rate this product a 5 and writing an outstanding review.</li>
            <li> It appears that my fine lines are finer.</li>
            <li> Fine lines and wrinkles have drastically improved.</li>
            <li> ingredients are those that have created results for beautiful, healthy skin – none of the unpronounceable chemicals here, just natural products with a gentle aroma.  </li>
            <li> I loved the feel of the eye wrinkle cream and the fact that it is all natural and absorbs into the skin area easily.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very light and fresh.</li>

            <li> I received it as a complimentary item for honest and unbiased feedback, but I will surely be purchasing more in future.</li>

            <li> My remarks are sincere and my own.gation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> This does not seem light any of the other products ive tested &amp; that makes me really happy.</li>
            <li> I really needed a good eye care product that is good to use in summer when the weather is hot, dry and lot of sun damage.</li>
            <li> Turned the skin it touched bright red.  </li>
            <li> Boy is that amazing because I have tried everything that is natural and they never work.</li>
            <li> Great product and minimal scent.</li>
            <li> I love the pump because you wont pull out to much product out</li>
            <li> what&#x27;s in the product it sounds like a really really good product hopefully next time the voucher will work</li>
            <li> but I will continue to use it just because it does such a good job of eliminating the puffiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Your Eye Wrinkle Cream / Gel doesn&#x27;t get a fair chance to be properly reviewed when it takes one month or longer to notice a difference.  </li>
            <li> When you put it on it feels cool on your skin.  </li>
            <li> I love how much I got in this bottle.</li>
            <li> It feels cool going on.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You get quite a bit with one full pump.  </li>
            <li> It is a great to help keep your skin tight and wrinkle free.</li>
            <li> Unlike other skin care products - this one has a great smell and dries quickly.</li>
            <li> It is a bit like a quick spa treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It applies easily and dries quickly, leaving your skin smooth I highly recommend it and this seller.</li>
            <li> I love my new eyes wrinkle</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my skin and that its full of natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helped my under eye puffiness</li>
            <li> I know many people want to look younger &amp; hip because they see they are getting fine lines.</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive to alot of facial products but this one is great</li>
            <li> Such a nice brake from medicinal smelling serums.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t leave a shiny or sticky look &amp; didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, So far so good.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE TEXTURE OF THIS CREAM GEL, IT&#x27;S CLEAR TEXTURE.</li>
            <li> I have not noticed a whole lot of improvement yet, but I know most things take a whole lot longer than a week to work.</li>
            <li> Feel great on my skin - not sure if I&#x27;ve noticed much reduction in fine lines and wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> so I bought this and used it for few times in a day on my whole face and it feels so great and cool  </li>
            <li> It goes on the skin very easily and spreads great, so a little goes a long ways.  </li>
            <li> It is clear and goes on easy.</li>
            <li> , This is the first eye cream that I&#x27;ve gotten that has not smelt like pickles.</li>
            <li> I really like this!</li>
            <li> This is my first day trying this eye cream.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light which I like, not heavy, so I can use it under makeup.  </li>
            <li> This eye gel from ArtNaturals feels great on the skin and keeps delicate eye-tissue hydrated.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much of it at all!</li>
            <li> This also contains 30ml of products as most eye creams are only 10-15ml.</li>
            <li> But it still wants a review!</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my bags under my eyes!</li>
            <li> You will feel a bit of a tingle first few uses, but take that as a good thing since it means its working!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> unfortunately no results.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;d recommend only using 1/4 to 1/2 a pump at first and add more if needed.  </li>
            <li> It not only feels like its really penetrating the layers of my skin but putting a barrier between the world and my precious skin.</li>
            <li> I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure for long term results-I&#x27;ll need quite a while.</li>
            <li> I noticed that fine lines were disappearing and the wrinkles around my eyes are not as deep!  </li>
            <li> Since it is in such a nice and compact container I can throw it in my purse and use it again later in the day if I&#x27;ve been outside a lot and need a quick touch up!</li>
            <li> I really think this product may achieve that.</li>
            <li> You do not need a whole lot when applying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thank you so much for allowing me to review this product.</li>
            <li> IT IS REASONABLY PRICED.  </li>
            <li> I -really-</li>
            <li> Seems to really help my moisturizer absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> How ever this product really works.</li>
            <li> If you apply foundation or eye concealer, I would recommend to let the eye gel really set before you put foundation on, otherwise, the makeup will look a bit cakey under the eyes.</li>
            <li> I received this free product to try out and to share my personal experience.</li>
            <li> I noticed a discount code for this and ordered it quickly as I really wanted to try it.</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel</li>
            <li> Very soothing and moisturizing around the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the texture</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It has a cooling effect when applied and feels very moisturizing to that area.  </li>
            <li> A few things I love is that the youth eye gel protects aging from uv rays, restores the glow in your face, and feels 100% fresh after putting it on.</li>
            <li> So many times I have tried eye creams that claim to reduce fine lines and firm the skin around your eyes, making them to appear younger.</li>
            <li> I put it on 1st thing in the morning before my moisterizer and daily makeup routine which isn&#x27;t much at all anymore because my face feels so much better with my new daily routine from artnaturals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like this one better than the The Body Shop eye gel that is slightly more expensive than this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a clear gel witch is good because i wouldn&#x27;t want to put anything other then clear on my face, It helps with other things beside the puffiness under the eye, I like that it helps with many different things besides that.</li>
            <li> Highly Recommended&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Left my eyes feeling young and fresh!</li>
            <li> It ok, A little sitcky</li>
            <li> impressed with the activity of natural products and the lack of unpleasant side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I look young in the face, but I feel that my neck wrinkles tell my real age.  </li>
            <li> This is a reasonable price, and I like that it&#x27;s mostly natural and partly organic.</li>
            <li> The ingredients is 98% natural so as it is gently to my skin, no irritation occur or any sign of redness.</li>
            <li> &amp; It also adds to use with ur normal moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , that should happen in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> i actually feel like i cut some fresh cucumber from my fridge and stuck them around my eyes.</li>
            <li> pump gives me a little more than I need at one time, so I suggest starting with a very gentle pump.  </li>
            <li> I have had people ask me what I am using, if it was a new make up or</li>
            <li> The label has a typo: &amp;#34;....delicate area around they eyes.&amp;#34; The overall impression is that of a product that did not get any detailed  development work, but was simply bottled up and thrown on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This eye wrinkle cream is very soft and moist.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to daily eye gel for hot weather.</li>
            <li> I like it because it is made 98% natural and out of this 72% organic!</li>
            <li> &amp; WOW did it not disappoint!  </li>
            <li> the cucumber scent of art naturals and cold feeling when you are on the highest level of stress and worn eyes from long day at work is so AWESOME.</li>
            <li> It goes on clear and you can immediately feel a firming sensation on your skin.  </li>
            <li> My skin feels really soft, and so far I am please but cannot say I&#x27;ve had results in one day.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s early in use</li>
            <li> but I do like it so far.</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  </li>
            <li> (Soft?</li>
            <li> Non greasy and soft and silky.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye gel for a couple of weeks; so far I can identify no noticeable changes.  </li>
            <li> but overall it worked very well</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m in my early 30s.</li>
            <li> but I have no dark circles under my eye!</li>
            <li> Although I barely started using this product, it makes my skin feel soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> It works really to me when I applied it on my face and not conscious about</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s totally non-irritating (and I have really sensitive skin) and it absorbs completely leaving no residue.</li>
            <li> I applied it as the instructions indicated and it dried rather quickly with no residue or dryness...</li>
            <li> When you apply it around the delicate areas of your eyes, just use your ring finger to gently tap in the cream very gently.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too clear about were the instructions for using the product.</li>
            <li> It sinks in fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> Which for how much product You only use It well last me for a long time.</li>
            <li> I personally prefer gel texture over cream form in summer because I like something that is light weight and does not feel thick under makeup.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this eye cream, I was expecting it to be sticky and flaky once it dried but to my surprise it was not.</li>
            <li> It is super thick</li>
            <li> * I can&#x27;t really see any except for a slight moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential for long-term effectiveness:</li>
            <li> You only need a tiny amount, so the bottle will last for&lt;br /&gt;a long time.</li>
            <li> This eye gel has a cool effect when applying and a thin layer is all you need.</li>
            <li> I tried a moisturizing serum by ArtNaturals before, so when I saw similar looking bottle, I expected similar gel.</li>
            <li> , THE INGREDIENTS IN THE BOTTLE ARE NOT VERY CLEAR TO SEE.</li>
            <li> It gently moisturizes the delicate eye area</li>
            <li> I plan to use this for a month since that is how long they state</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real found of the sticky feeling I&#x27;m left with from this product either...</li>
            <li> Having to constantly wear makeup to hide the circles is a pain, and if I forget its extremely embarrassing to me.</li>
            <li> its such a nice feeling looking in the mirror and not seeing my black eyes(mine were so bad they looked like I was punched in both eyes).</li>
            <li> After 65 years of wind, dry air, smog, air pollutants etc.</li>
            <li> I have been using another product to reduce puffy eyes and dark circles by Oz naturals and this product feels like it gives me the same results</li>
            <li> I already am seeing a big difference in my dark circles under my eyes,</li>
            <li> I know that signficant changes take a long time to be seen on my skin, so having no apparent changes so far is not surprising for me, nor is it a reason to declare defeat.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has dramatically reduced my dark circles, and keeps my delicate eye area very hydrated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Application is simple; it&#x27;s just a pump -- and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I could tell a little difference in only the 1st day.  </li>
            <li> I woke up with what looked like pink eye in both eyes and oozing mucous from them.  </li>
            <li> I will come back in a few days to update.</li>
            <li> , it sinks in and does not feel oily or greasy.</li>
            <li> which is minimal-</li>
            <li> I feel like I waste the product when wiping away the extra from one pump.</li>
            <li> I recently received my new eye cream and from the beginning I was skeptical about ordering it because I&#x27;ve used several products that promised to do certain things but failed to give me the results.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way, just a pea-size can cover both eyes or whatever area that you are targeting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other ones and i haven&#x27;t seen any improvement.</li>
            <li> I have been using this daily now for the past month now</li>
            <li> after application just let it dry for a few seconds then you will feel the softness.</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t yet seen improvements in dark circles or wrinkles</li>
            <li> I felt my skin tighten under my eye on my dark circles immediately.  </li>
            <li> were the dark circles create</li>
            <li> I have always had dark circles under my eyes since I was in my teens.</li>
            <li> My only complaint-</li>
            <li> but ArtNaturals is twice as much in a bottle and less expensive than Oz.</li>
            <li> so you won&#x27;t be getting Botox down the road.  </li>
            <li> and i apply this product on my eye area down</li>
            <li> The ingredient list is odd.</li>
            <li> Due to use of heavy contact lenses, my eyes do look little stressed.</li>
            <li> Tight?)</li>
            <li> and i can see it looks a little bit firmer .</li>
            <li> i wish they would give a little longer to review on products like this</li>
            <li> post another review in a few weeks after use.</li>
            <li> : Neutral feeling, but when I rubbed my skin after the product dried, it balled up and rubbed off.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a sticky annoying texture, instead it is smooth and moisturizes the skin under my eyes.</li>
            <li> I literally had to wipe it off the second after it was so irritating.  </li>
            <li> This gel makes your eyes feel firm and hydrated.</li>
            <li> The ingredients in this product don&#x27;t usually affect me at all - as in an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I was not able to get this deal.</li>
            <li> and I feel that it is time for me to start correcting small issues before they get worse and trying to prevent other signs of aging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed dark circles and wrinkles under my eyes getting worse over the years now</li>
            <li> I took awhile to review this hoping for results (I try so hard to be optimistic)</li>
            <li> sorry I&#x27;m simply not impressed....</li>
            <li> this brand has yet to fail me</li>
            <li> Nothing is worse than a face product that stinks!</li>
            <li> Are there artificial fragrances?):  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I got this Item For Reviewing &amp; At A discounted price. I&#x27;m in love with this, This is the first eye cream that I&#x27;ve gotten that has not smelt like pickles. It has a good Oder &amp; also seems to help with a ton of things. It&#x27;s a clear gel witch is good because i wouldn&#x27;t want to put anything other then clear on my face, It helps with other things beside the puffiness under the eye, I like that it helps with many different things besides that. It also asked you to use after the shower so it could give you better moisture &amp; It also adds to use with ur normal moisturizer. This does not seem light any of the other products ive tested &amp; that makes me really happy. I&#x27;ve tried other ones and i haven&#x27;t seen any improvement. I&#x27;m hoping this product will give me that.  I know many people want to look younger &amp; hip because they see they are getting fine lines. I really think this product may achieve that. I love the pump because you wont pull out to much product out you&#x27;ll only get what you pump. All it all this product seems like it&#x27;ll do what i want it to do.</li>
            <li> I really like this! It is super thick so I know where I have already applied. It sinks in fast and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin greasy. I also like that it has a REALLY nice smell! Nothing is worse than a face product that stinks!</li>
            <li> I received the product on time.  I look young in the face, but I feel that my neck wrinkles tell my real age.  I used this on my face and neck and even on the top of my hands.  I could tell a little difference in only the 1st day.  Smells good, like cucumber.  You are supposed to use this with your daily moisturizer.  The serum helps your skin to absorb your moisturizer deeper, therefore making skin tighter and reducing wrinkles.  I did not have any moisturizer, so I just used this by itself.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Burned my eyes.  Turned the skin it touched bright red.  I woke up with what looked like pink eye in both eyes and oozing mucous from them.  The bottle I received was not safety sealed in any way.  I don&#x27;t know if it was tampered with or the product was unsafe or what.  The ingredients in this product don&#x27;t usually affect me at all - as in an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> A few things I love is that the youth eye gel protects aging from uv rays, restores the glow in your face, and feels 100% fresh after putting it on. I put it on 1st thing in the morning before my moisterizer and daily makeup routine which isn&#x27;t much at all anymore because my face feels so much better with my new daily routine from artnaturals.&lt;br /&gt;I recieved this product for free to review and give my unbiased opinion and review.</li>
            <li> do not use under make up. it rolls off</li>
            <li> I got this for a deal I was given a voucher to try the item but the voucher didn&#x27;t work but I wanted to write a review anyway I appreciate that they did give me that voucher I was excited to be able to try the item even though it did not work on my end of her if you want how it looks and what I thought about it anyway I like the quantity I like what&#x27;s in the product it sounds like a really really good product hopefully next time the voucher will work and I hope you could do it to me again but I want I would by it honestly</li>
            <li> Just received this eye wrinkle cream. I was suppose to get 2 day shipping but it did not get here in 2 days, but more like 4 days. No biggie though. This eye cream has a pleasant smell to it. You do not need a whole lot when applying. My skin feels really soft, and so far I am please but cannot say I&#x27;ve had results in one day. I will come back in a few days to update.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonable price, and I like that it&#x27;s mostly natural and partly organic. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. It helps with hydration but I haven&#x27;t yet seen improvements in dark circles or wrinkles, that should happen in a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. It&#x27;s totally non-irritating (and I have really sensitive skin) and it absorbs completely leaving no residue. I find that it helps a lot with puffiness also. Too soon to tell if it gets rid of the wrinkles or not, but I will continue to use it just because it does such a good job of eliminating the puffiness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for allowing me to review this product.</li>
            <li> I received this order as a promotion to test and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s early in use but I do like it so far. goes on light and cool. Goes well under makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will post another review in a few weeks after use.</li>
            <li> I received these product at discount to review and give my honest opinion. Diffently buying these at reg price when I run out. Which for how much product You only use It well last me for a long time. My skin is sensitive to alot of facial products but this one is great I had no reaction or burning from it.</li>
            <li> This is my first day trying this eye cream.  Its not greasy it has a nice smell.  I felt my skin tighten under my eye on my dark circles immediately.  I would recommend it.  I ordered this product through a discount/promo amount.</li>
            <li> I genuinely lIke thus prduct</li>
            <li> I like this product so far.  It&#x27;s light which I like, not heavy, so I can use it under makeup.  I did receive a discount for this review, but this did not affect my rating.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this product, great for applying before your moisturizer, looking forward to trying more products.</li>
            <li> I GOT THIS IN EXCHANGE FOR AN HONEST REVIEW.  IT IS REASONABLY PRICED.  IT DOESN&#x27;T GO ON STICKY OR GREASY.  I USE IT AT NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING UNDER MY MAKE UP.  I CAN ALREADY SEE MY FINE LINES DIMINISHING.  MY EYES AREN&#x27;T PUFFY IN THE MORNINGS ANY MORE.  LOVE IT.</li>
            <li> Your Eye Wrinkle Cream / Gel doesn&#x27;t get a fair chance to be properly reviewed when it takes one month or longer to notice a difference.  I have been using this daily now for the past month now and I can now give it a proper review it deserves. A little of this goes a long way, just a pea-size can cover both eyes or whatever area that you are targeting. When you apply it around the delicate areas of your eyes, just use your ring finger to gently tap in the cream very gently.  I cringe when I see people just rub or abuse their eye area!  I noticed that fine lines were disappearing and the wrinkles around my eyes are not as deep!  I do love that it is 98% organic!  The ingredients are perfect for promoting water retention in your eye area where fine line and wrinkles start to smooth out.  I found that exfoliating weekly before you apply this product works the best.  After you exfoliate and apply toner, this product can get in there and do what it is made to do.  Skin Care should be the #1 makeup!  Society has so many products to cover it up, but take care of your face with products like ArtNaturals Best Eye Wrinkle Cream/Gel so you won&#x27;t be getting Botox down the road.  I am now also using this to work on my frown lines on my forehead.  I will keep you informed!</li>
            <li> the cucumber scent of art naturals and cold feeling when you are on the highest level of stress and worn eyes from long day at work is so AWESOME. I am so in-love with this eye wrinkle helps a lot to maintain my puffiness and sometimes eye bags.  once applied under and around your eye you will feel the coldness and the great scent of cucumber i actually feel like i cut some fresh cucumber from my fridge and stuck them around my eyes. I love it and a must to try to relax your tires eyes. after application just let it dry for a few seconds then you will feel the softness. The ingredients is 98% natural so as it is gently to my skin, no irritation occur or any sign of redness. Highly Recommended&lt;br /&gt;I received Art naturals Best Eye Wrinkle Gel on a discount price in exchange of my unbiased and honest own opinion review.</li>
            <li> I tried a moisturizing serum by ArtNaturals before, so when I saw similar looking bottle, I expected similar gel. What a surprise, this does smell like a cucumber with a tone of melon. The consistence is also thicker. My bathroom is full of serums and this became one of my favorite, just because the scent of it, that is refreshing and pleasant. Such a nice brake from medicinal smelling serums.  I was provided this for evaluation.</li>
            <li> This eye gel from ArtNaturals feels great on the skin and keeps delicate eye-tissue hydrated. I like that the smell is not overpowering; it&#x27;s a very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; aroma and dissipates after just a few minutes. Also, the post-application feeling of the skin is silky smoothness... I -really- like that it&#x27;s not oily or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application is simple; it&#x27;s just a pump -- and a little goes a long way! Should last us quite a while. I received a sample bottle for evaluation purposes to write this review.</li>
            <li> smells okay.. been using for a month now and i don&#x27;t see a difference. pretty sure people are being paid to rate this product a 5 and writing an outstanding review.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love the product.</li>
            <li> How do you compare the hundreds of skin care products? I&#x27;m a regular tester, so I&#x27;ve arrived at a list of key considerations. I hope these help you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Fragrance (does it smell good? Are there artificial fragrances?):  Cucumber scent. There is a &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; listed in the ingredients, and while cucumber hydrosol is an ingredient, that wouldn&#x27;t be as strong as what I&#x27;m smelling. I&#x27;m guessing there is cucumber fragrance oil in this.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel during application: Slippery, gel-like.&lt;br /&gt;~ Feel after absorption (Soft? Oily? Sticky? Moist? Tight?): Neutral feeling, but when I rubbed my skin after the product dried, it balled up and rubbed off. This means you can forget applying makeup over it.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it best for a certain skin type?: Should work for all types, it&#x27;s not oily or drying - quite neutral.&lt;br /&gt;~ Is it tested on animals?: No - listed as cruelty free and vegan~&lt;br /&gt;~ Cosmetic effects:* I can&#x27;t really see any except for a slight moisturizing effect.&lt;br /&gt;~ Potential for long-term effectiveness:*  It contains some good herbal extracts, hyaluronic acid, and antioxidants, but it&#x27;s not the most power-packed ingredient list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Know the difference between cosmetic and long-term effects: Cosmetic effects are immediate and only present when the product has been applied recently - just like makeup. Long-term effects take longer to see and should remain when you stop using the product (but don&#x27;t when you find something effective - your skin needs continuing support). The ideal product would be both cosmetically and long-term effective, but it&#x27;s more realistic to expect a formula to tilt towards one or the other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not one of the best eye creams I&#x27;ve tested. The ingredient list is odd. The label has a typo: &amp;#34;....delicate area around they eyes.&amp;#34; The overall impression is that of a product that did not get any detailed  development work, but was simply bottled up and thrown on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this free or virtually so for product testing and review. I am under no obligation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so. My aim is to highlight features and drawbacks that I would want to know about as a buyer, not hype the product for the manufacturer. My remarks are sincere and my own.gation to provide a positive review and receive no incentives or rewards for doing so.

            <li> Although I barely started using this product, it makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. It doesn&#x27;t have a sticky annoying texture, instead it is smooth and moisturizes the skin under my eyes. I like how it makes my eyes feel.</li>
            <li> This product is very good.  I tested this product out and found it to do a good job of tightening the skin around my eyes and eyelids.  When you put it on it feels cool on your skin.  It goes on clear and you can immediately feel a firming sensation on your skin.  I have been using another product to reduce puffy eyes and dark circles by Oz naturals and this product feels like it gives me the same results but ArtNaturals is twice as much in a bottle and less expensive than Oz.</li>
            <li> I Really love the way this gel feels on my skin. It not only feels like its really penetrating the layers of my skin but putting a barrier between the world and my precious skin. It almost makes my skin feel like silk. I love how much I got in this bottle. Which I got for free by being an amazon reviewer!! I&#x27;ve only tried it a couple nights but i can see a difference under my eyes for sure.</li>
            <li> Seems to really help my moisturizer absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> I love the way this feels on my skin and that its full of natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely helped my under eye puffiness</li>
            <li> This eye gel feels so refreshing. It immediately moisturized my undereye dryness,  It didn&#x27;t leave a shiny or sticky look &amp; didn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive eyes, So far so good. I&#x27;m sure for long term results-I&#x27;ll need quite a while. After 65 years of wind, dry air, smog, air pollutants etc. -It might take forever!  But I think I&#x27;ll put this in the fridge for the summer so I can be refreshed immediately!  I did receive this ArtNaturals for a reduced cost for an honest opinion. Thank You!</li>
            <li> Heard about item from a friend, ordered and now I&#x27;m in love.  Nongreasy formula is prefect for my skin. Def will be a lifetime customer from now.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Just received this morning and put on under my eyes.  Non greasy and soft and silky.  Love that it moisturizes without that greasy feeling.  Great item.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this product. So many times I have tried eye creams that claim to reduce fine lines and firm the skin around your eyes, making them to appear younger. How ever this product really works. It feels cool going on. You don&#x27;t need much of it at all! It is clear and goes on easy. Since I started using it I have had people ask me what I am using, if it was a new make up or what. I tell them it is ArtNaturals eye cream. And I send them the link to Amazon so they can order it for themselves to try.  I was fortunate to receive this free to try so I could give my honest opinion and review on it. I am so glad I was. I have sensitive eyes, and I have to be so careful what I put on them. I can&#x27;t even wear any type of eye shadow on them. How ever this product does not cause me any probs at all.</li>
            <li> LOVE THE TEXTURE OF THIS CREAM GEL, IT&#x27;S CLEAR TEXTURE. IT&#x27;S VERY COMFORTABLE AND MAKE YOUR EYES FEEL WAKE UP.I GOT A FREE SAMPLE OF THIS PRODUCT, THE INGREDIENTS IN THE BOTTLE ARE NOT VERY CLEAR TO SEE.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been testing this product two weeks ago, since i pick this product to review so in this case i dont have wrinkles,but i use this every night ,i use glasses and stay almost all day on my cellphone and i apply this product on my eye area down were the dark circles create and it&#x27;s feels so refreshing omg i love it and i can see it looks a little bit firmer .</li>
            <li> Product received for my review and opinion.  I will definitely purchase this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product! I use it alone or under makeup. It has helped reduce some of the the puffiness around my eyes  I&#x27;ve also noticed that the tiny lines are being minimized.  It applies easily and dries quickly, leaving your skin smooth I highly recommend it and this seller.</li>
            <li> This lightweight, fragrance eye gel contains some excellent anti-aging ingredients for all skin types. It works really to me when I applied it on my face and not conscious about, it feels all wrinkles is gone ***disclaimer***</li>
            <li> I really needed a good eye care product that is good to use in summer when the weather is hot, dry and lot of sun damage. I personally prefer gel texture over cream form in summer because I like something that is light weight and does not feel thick under makeup. This is my go-to daily eye gel for hot weather. This eye gel has a cool effect when applying and a thin layer is all you need. I like this one better than the The Body Shop eye gel that is slightly more expensive than this one. It does not have any strong scent or anything. I like it because it is made 98% natural and out of this 72% organic! I apply this eye gel before I apply any facial moisturizer and after applying toner. If you apply foundation or eye concealer, I would recommend to let the eye gel really set before you put foundation on, otherwise, the makeup will look a bit cakey under the eyes. This also contains 30ml of products as most eye creams are only 10-15ml. Plus, the expiration dates is July 2018. Even if you don&#x27;t use it on regular basis, it will not expire till three years later. I received this free product to try out and to share my personal experience. My review is honest and unbiased. As people have different skin types, my opinion may differ from yours.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smoothly and is extremely light. Which is a plus in my mind. It has a very light refreshing scent. I am 26 about to turn 27 and I feel that it is time for me to start correcting small issues before they get worse and trying to prevent other signs of aging. I have been using this product for about a week. I have not noticed a whole lot of improvement yet, but I know most things take a whole lot longer than a week to work. I plan to use this for a month since that is how long they state it takes to begin seeing results. If I have any results I will come back and update my review. Crossing fingers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#60;&amp;#60;I RECEIVED THIS PRODUCT AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE FOR MY HONEST UNBIASED REVIEW&amp;#62;&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> Nice eye cream. I can see a big differnce in my skin.</li>
            <li> What A cool way to get rid of your  Wrinkle is to use - The Best Eye Wrinkle Cream / Gel...</li>
            <li> As I age, I now realize the sensitivity of the eye area so I was stoked to be able to recieve such a great offer at a great discounted rate. Love it!</li>
            <li> I received the product  free of charge and wish give my honest and unbiased opinion.  I loved the feel of the eye wrinkle cream and the fact that it is all natural and absorbs into the skin area easily.  I am hoping that it will help me keep any additional wrinkles from forming around the eye.  It is easy to apply and I would purchase item because I enjoyed the feel of its application.</li>
            <li> I recently received my new eye cream and from the beginning I was skeptical about ordering it because I&#x27;ve used several products that promised to do certain things but failed to give me the results. The first time I used this eye cream, I was expecting it to be sticky and flaky once it dried but to my surprise it was not. I applied it as the instructions indicated and it dried rather quickly with no residue or dryness...that alone was a plus for me. The cream is lightwieght and only a dab will do the job. The only thing I wasn&#x27;t too clear about were the instructions for using the product. The instruction stated to &amp;#34;use daily&amp;#34; but it did not specify whether I am to use it twice a day; morning and night or once a day. Since receiving the product, I&#x27;ve used it twice a day. I will definitely order this product again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this eye gel for a couple of weeks; so far I can identify no noticeable changes.  I know that signficant changes take a long time to be seen on my skin, so having no apparent changes so far is not surprising for me, nor is it a reason to declare defeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump gives me a little more than I need at one time, so I suggest starting with a very gentle pump.  Once on the eye area, the cream soaks in and disappears very, very quickly.  Unlike makeup, no one will be able to tell you’ve put anything on the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are those that have created results for beautiful, healthy skin – none of the unpronounceable chemicals here, just natural products with a gentle aroma.  I’m impressed with the activity of natural products and the lack of unpleasant side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOUR STARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> This eye wrinkle cream is very soft and moist. I have been using it at night and morning. It appears that my fine lines are finer. Also, the smell is not overbearing. I noticed a discount code for this and ordered it quickly as I really wanted to try it. I would recommend this eye cream!</li>
            <li> It ok, A little sitcky</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVED the smoothness this product brought to my eyes! Left my eyes feeling young and fresh! I recommend this product!&lt;br /&gt;I RECEIVED THIS item in Exchange FOR MY UNBIASED HONEST REVIEW.</li>
            <li> Feel great on my skin - not sure if I&#x27;ve noticed much reduction in fine lines and wrinkles though.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product. I&#x27;m giving it top reviews. I noticed the changes after just a couple applications. I had a lot of wrinkles in between my eyes and on my forehead. It relieved my under eye puffiness and the wrinkles are already much better. Thank you for this amazing product to review. Yes definitely big thumbs up. Try it!</li>
            <li> I just received this product today.  I will update this review at a later date as it is too soon for any results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Received this in 2 days; item was packaged properly for shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initial impressions:  Smells good.  Light consistency.  I am very excited!</li>
            <li> i wish they would give a little longer to review on products like this but overall it worked very well I liked it</li>
            <li> I was not able to get this deal. But it still wants a review! Hopefully it will get sorted out and I can leave an actual review.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to try out and review.  After using for 3 days now, I love how it works!  It gently moisturizes the delicate eye area&lt;br /&gt;without burning or irritation, and makes under-eye wrinkles appear smoother.  You only need a tiny amount, so the bottle will last for&lt;br /&gt;a long time.</li>
            <li> Well I waited about 5 das after getting this product to make any kind of review for it.. hoping that it would make me notice some kinda change ... however I notice nothing... nothing has changed ..... I&#x27;m not real found of the sticky feeling I&#x27;m left with from this product either... however the item was received promptly.... sorry I&#x27;m simply not impressed....</li>
            <li> I really like this eye gel</li>
            <li> Very soothing and moisturizing around the eyes.  Fine lines and wrinkles have drastically improved.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It is a great to help keep your skin tight and wrinkle free. It has really helped with my bags under my eyes! Boy is that amazing because I have tried everything that is natural and they never work. This stuff though, this is amazing the first day after putting it on my bags got lighter in color and they are improving with every day that I use it. this brand has yet to fail me I really enjoy their products!</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t have wrinkle around my eyes, I choose to try this product to see if it can make the skin around my eyes smoother. Due to use of heavy contact lenses, my eyes do look little stressed. I have used it regularly for a while and I like it. It doesn&#x27;t make any overnight changes but after using it over time, I have seen some improvement in the skin around my eyes. Unlike other skin care products - this one has a great smell and dries quickly. I received it as a complimentary item for honest and unbiased feedback, but I will surely be purchasing more in future.</li>
            <li> I got this product for free and it BURNED my eyes.  I literally had to wipe it off the second after it was so irritating.  I will not be using this product.</li>
            <li> I love my new eyes wrinkle cream!!1 I use this at night after I shower before bed and love the results I am seeing!! I have always had dark circles under my eyes since I was in my teens. Having to constantly wear makeup to hide the circles is a pain, and if I forget its extremely embarrassing to me. I already am seeing a big difference in my dark circles under my eyes, its such a nice feeling looking in the mirror and not seeing my black eyes(mine were so bad they looked like I was punched in both eyes). I am so happy to see these results already, I can only imagine in  a few more weeks time what the difference will be!!! I only use about a dime size amount between  my two eyes, applying in a circular direction. The smell is very light and fresh. You will feel a bit of a tingle first few uses, but take that as a good thing since it means its working!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I recieved this eye cream at discount for my Honest review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed dark circles and wrinkles under my eyes getting worse over the years now that I&#x27;m in my early 30s. I got the opportunity to Received this Great product in Exchange for my Honest and Unbiased Opinion and I decided to give it a try &amp; WOW did it not disappoint!  It goes on easily and feels great. I have been using this over a week and it has dramatically reduced my dark circles, and keeps my delicate eye area very hydrated. I love the cucumber fragrance like scent. Feels refreshing! I also really like the texture, it sinks in and does not feel oily or greasy. Leaves my eyes looking smoother and looking healthier. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I took awhile to review this hoping for results (I try so hard to be optimistic) unfortunately no results.</li>
            <li> I got the free trial.very very good product.i can recommend this to everyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not certain how well this works for eye wrinkles since I don&#x27;t have any of those yet thankfully, but I do have a lot of puffiness under my eyes caused from seasonal allergies and this is perfect for that!  The cooling feeling upon application feels so good on my irritated and puffy undereye area.  Five to ten minutes after I apply it the puffiness is mostly gone.  The gel smells really nice, mostly like fresh cucumbers, which happen to be a favorite of mine.  It has a cooling effect when applied and feels very moisturizing to that area.  It is a bit like a quick spa treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get quite a bit with one full pump.  It was much more than I needed so I&#x27;d recommend only using 1/4 to 1/2 a pump at first and add more if needed.  It goes on the skin very easily and spreads great, so a little goes a long ways.  Since it is in such a nice and compact container I can throw it in my purse and use it again later in the day if I&#x27;ve been outside a lot and need a quick touch up! Very easy and refreshing.  I definitely love it.  I received​ this item for free for review purposes.</li>
            <li> Smooths out the wrinkles. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> paid a reduced price for a review of this product. Seemed to make the eye area softer and younger looking.</li>
            <li> This product has great reviews so I bought this and used it for few times in a day on my whole face and it feels so great and cool  feeling. I saw instant brightness in my face. I will use it daily and will update additional result after a use. So far very good.</li>
            <li> Only used for a couple days but I have no dark circles under my eye! Definitely will be buying again!</li>
            <li> This gel makes your eyes feel firm and hydrated. My only complaint- which is minimal- is that the pump distributes much more product than needed. I feel like I waste the product when wiping away the extra from one pump. Great product and minimal scent. Great undereye product!</li>
