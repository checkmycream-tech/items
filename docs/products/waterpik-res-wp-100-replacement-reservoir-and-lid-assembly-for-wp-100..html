            <li>I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone.  </li>
            <li>Perfect!!!</li>
            <li>A great replacement</li>
            <li>but I am happy with what I received.</li>
            <li>Prompt, good value.  </li>
            <li>Fit perfectly.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Fits perfecty I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>It was a perfect replacement, the waterpik is just like new.</li>
            <li>the rest of my old reservoir was perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this reservoir.  </li>
            <li>I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASE</li>
            <li>Would like to have had one that included the accessories for the top but</li>
            <li>It is actually better than the reservoir provided because it is more sturdier and it seems like it is better quality.</li>
            <li>The product itself is awesome- oral hygiene is necessary.</li>
            <li>Most states are tax free on the Waterpik site.</li>
            <li>This is a factory original, so what more can I say?  </li>
            <li>The original tank started leaking within the warranty period- but having read what a joy it is to get anything fixed as a warranty repair, we just opted to buy another tank as a backup.</li>
            <li>worked and now my waterpik is as good as new.</li>
            <li>Fits fine and does the job.</li>
            <li>Works fine with our water pik machine.</li>
            <li>Sooo happy with this; my original one was old and awful-just wouldn&#x27;t get clean anymore...</li>
            <li>Replaced a leaking reservoir and this fit just fine.</li>
            <li>but you will have to leave the reservoir in place when filled with water.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>I bought it because the original was leaking from the rubber plug at the bottom; couldn&#x27;t find just the plug so for this cheap price</li>
            <li>Looks and fits just like the original.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the original one was cloudy and worn out from use, so I replaced it anyway</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and everything was satisfying.</li>
            <li>Go to the Waterpik site on the Internet and you can order this exact part for $14.94 SHIPPED!</li>
            <li>but it was worth a try since it is a lot cheaper to buy just the replacement part.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If leakage occurs from the reservoir, ensure the valve is right side up or contact Water Pik Inc. customer service for a replacement valve.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Exactly like the original except for one thing:  The color is a more pleasing blue, something like tropical waters.</li>
            <li>You can just remove the old gasket in the bottom and it will seal up fine</li>
            <li>Better than replacing the entire unit!</li>
            <li>therefore $12 for a new reservoir was worth it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The price was much lower than anywhere else.  </li>
            <li>I went for the whole assembly.</li>
            <li>But I cannot give 5 stars because Waterpik should sell just the rubber plug and not the whole tank</li>
            <li>Worked out great to replace a broken hinge on the cover.</li>
            <li>As one person already said, this is actually an improvement over the original that came with my Water Pik.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s as if I have a whole new waterpik!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s not fair, but who said waterpic was ever fair?</li>
            <li>I, too, would appreciate being able to purchase the little rubber washer in stead of purchasing a whole new unit...</li>
            <li>By replacing just the reservoir, I had a brand new waterpik.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone to do the replacement over buying a new unit.</li>
            <li>, My Waterpik looks like new.</li>
            <li>Make my system like new.</li>
            <li>was going to buy a new one and then thought about just replacing the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Saved me from buying a new Water Pik.</li>
            <li>to clean than Oral-B and have several tips for specific uses</li>
            <li>The reservoir does not leak like my old one did.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully the old one can be fully recycled</li>
            <li>It is kind of illogical and expensive to replace the whole reservoir because of this.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a sturdy product and I am glad I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new Waterpik, but it is still expensive for just being a reservoir, hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li>This is a real OEM replacement for Waterpik WP-100, it is actually an improvement over the original that came with my almost 3 year old Waterpik, nicer plastic and design and built with the same quality as the original, you cannot go wrong with it.</li>
            <li>I guess I will be a little more careful and not knock it off my counter..</li>
            <li>Had to buy a new one because the old o-ring at the bottom got loose after use and each time I tried to use the Waterpik the bath got flooded</li>
            <li>Just what i needed to replace my old gross one.  </li>
            <li>I think it is unreasonable to be forced to buy the top, which holds extra tools, when one only needs a reservoir.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this reservoir.  A great replacement and it fit snuggly into my base unit.  I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anyone.  I, too, would appreciate being able to purchase the little rubber washer in stead of purchasing a whole new unit...but I am happy with what I received.</li>
            <li> What an inexpensive way to keep using my Waterpik! Perfect!!!</li>
            <li> This is a little expensive just to replace the gasket in the bottom.  You can just remove the old gasket in the bottom and it will seal up fine but you will have to leave the reservoir in place when filled with water.</li>
            <li> It was just what I ordered. Thankd</li>
            <li> As desired.  Prompt, good value.  Compete.  Just what i needed to replace my old gross one.  I use it every day.  Thanks</li>
            <li> The rubber valve in reservoir has already beginning to fail.  It leaks and we have to push it down with our finger to get it to stop.</li>
            <li> I WAS PLEASED WITH THE PURCHASE</li>
            <li> By replacing just the reservoir, I had a brand new waterpik.  The price was much lower than anywhere else.  I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> The minimal cost to correct a small irritation far out weighed the purchase of buying a new unit.  I would recommend to anyone to do the replacement over buying a new unit.</li>
            <li> Looks and fits just like the original.  Would like to have had one that included the accessories for the top but did order them separately.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It is actually better than the reservoir provided because it is more sturdier and it seems like it is better quality. There is a latch on the back that the default reservoir doesn&#x27;t have. That means it is a little harder to take off and you need to use your nails. The initial reason I purchased a replacement was because with my factory reservoir there was residue leftover- if you left mouthwash in the waterpik over night(BTW lesson learned) do not leave liquid in the reservoir overnight. i tried bleach, scrubbing, etc- it is impossible to get the residue off! therefore $12 for a new reservoir was worth it.  The product itself is awesome- oral hygiene is necessary. Just be careful with your reservoir, if you don&#x27;t want to spend an extra $12 then do not leave liquid in the container overnight. that is all</li>
            <li> As one person already said, this is actually an improvement over the original that came with my Water Pik. Unfortunately, the original was leaking from the rubber valve or grommet that controls water flow from the reservoir to the flosser. It is kind of illogical and expensive to replace the whole reservoir because of this. However, I should have read the manual. It says, \\&quot;If leaking due to a damaged hose, replacement hoses and handles can be purchased at www.waterpik.com or contact Water Pik Inc. customer service for a self service repair kit. If leakage occurs from the reservoir, ensure the valve is right side up or contact Water Pik Inc. customer service for a replacement valve.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This price is outrageous. Go to the Waterpik site on the Internet and you can order this exact part for $14.94 SHIPPED! Most states are tax free on the Waterpik site.</li>
            <li> My tank got damaged, and I needed a replacement.  This is a factory original, so what more can I say?  It was a perfect replacement, the waterpik is just like new.</li>
            <li> Was the same as I had previously.  Fit perfectly.</li>
            <li> Replaced a leaking reservoir and this fit just fine.</li>
            <li> The black plastic valve on my old reservoir was disintegrating so I bought this as a replacement.  I wish they had replacement valves--the rest of my old reservoir was perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a sturdy product and I am glad I don&#x27;t have to buy a whole new Waterpik, but it is still expensive for just being a reservoir, hence the 4 star rating.</li>
            <li> I have literally nothing to complain about. It&#x27;s as if I have a whole new waterpik! I would definitely purchase it again if need be.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the original except for one thing:  The color is a more pleasing blue, something like tropical waters. Delivery was fast and everything was satisfying.</li>
            <li> The reservoir does not leak like my old one did.  I think it is unreasonable to be forced to buy the top, which holds extra tools, when one only needs a reservoir.  It merely increases the price. Probably that&#x27;s the idea.  That&#x27;s not fair, but who said waterpic was ever fair?</li>
            <li> Sooo happy with this; my original one was old and awful-just wouldn&#x27;t get clean anymore...</li>
            <li> Had to buy a new one because the old o-ring at the bottom got loose after use and each time I tried to use the Waterpik the bath got flooded</li>
            <li> Just like the one that I dropped and broke. I guess I will be a little more careful and not knock it off my counter..</li>
            <li> This is a real OEM replacement for Waterpik WP-100, it is actually an improvement over the original that came with my almost 3 year old Waterpik, nicer plastic and design and built with the same quality as the original, you cannot go wrong with it. I bought it because the original was leaking from the rubber plug at the bottom; couldn&#x27;t find just the plug so for this cheap price I went for the whole assembly. Anyway, the original one was cloudy and worn out from use, so I replaced it anyway, My Waterpik looks like new. But I cannot give 5 stars because Waterpik should sell just the rubber plug and not the whole tank (it was impossible to find just the plug), this is a waste of resources. Hopefully the old one can be fully recycled</li>
            <li> My old reservoir was nasty after several years. I think I got the last one of these on amazon. Make my system like new.</li>
            <li> Just bought this one because we lost the black plastic under reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean than Oral-B and have several tips for specific uses</li>
            <li> Fits perfecty I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> My waterpik started leaking after several years of wear.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy a new one and then thought about just replacing the reservoir.&lt;br /&gt;I did not know if it would work but it was worth a try since it is a lot cheaper to buy just the replacement part.&lt;br /&gt;It worked and now my waterpik is as good as new.</li>
            <li> My reservoir was leaking and this part saved my Water Pik. I was looking for the little part in the resistor that was leaking in mine but this is all I could find. Saved me from buying a new Water Pik.</li>
            <li> Fits fine and does the job. No more leaking around the seal. Better than replacing the entire unit!</li>
            <li> The bottom gasket appears to be a planned failure point in an otherwise durable unit. The original tank started leaking within the warranty period- but having read what a joy it is to get anything fixed as a warranty repair, we just opted to buy another tank as a backup. Our solution: we took the first tank off and applied silicone aquarium adhesive in a thick bead around the lip of the mate point between tank and base. It no longer comes off, but it will still be possible to use a putty knife to lift it off if the tank ever actually breaks- and we now have a spare.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for the existing reservoir that started to leak.</li>
            <li> Worked out great to replace a broken hinge on the cover. Saved money by not having to buy an entire unit.</li>
            <li> This is bad! I don&#x27;t know if I should return it?!? It has been used. The package were open, the bag was open. There has some finger print and water marks in the reservoir and the lid to it. Disgusting!</li>
            <li> Works fine with our water pik machine.</li>
