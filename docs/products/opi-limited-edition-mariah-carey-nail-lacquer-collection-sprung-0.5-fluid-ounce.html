            <li> A lovely shimmery copper color.</li>
            <li> This color OPI polish does not really look like it does in the picture. It&#x27;s definitely brassier than I expected. You MUST use two coats since it does not apply evenly on the nail. It has what I&#x27;ll call &amp;#34;bald spots.&amp;#34; The brush is fine - perfect length and thickness.&lt;br /&gt;OPI polishes are normally terrific. I will not however, buy this color or the others in the same category, again.</li>
            <li> Nice color and have gotten a lot of compliments on the polish</li>
            <li> Love this polish!  The glitter covers fully in two coats.  Covers evenly and is not lumpy.  It has red/garnet and gold sparkle.  Amazing.</li>
            <li> My favorite fall color and goes with almost everything</li>
