            <li>A makeup artist used it on my face, with nothing else, for a video shoot and my face looked soooo cool</li>
            <li>I purchased from this company before I really was satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>The shine is under control with True Ebony Q865.</li>
            <li>Perfect for African American skin.</li>
            <li>This is the only oil absorbing blocking powder that significantly reduced shine on my face for good length of time.</li>
            <li>I was looking at a YouTube video and the woman strongly recommended getting this oil absorbing powder (does it&#x27;s job and inexpensive).</li>
            <li>This product is really smooth on your skin, and blends in very well.</li>
            <li>favorite part of reviewing on Amazon is updating my old reviews with useful information for my fellow Amazonians!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely oily and I was looking for a good quality powder that would blot the oil during the day without having to reapply every hour or so.</li>
            <li>I love it and only use this to control my oily skin all day (</li>
            <li>many $ later.. this is THE product to keep your face matt.</li>
            <li>I gave them another try and purchased Black Opal Oil absorbing blocking powder and was very satisfied it works.</li>
            <li>It does work very well, almost too well</li>
            <li>It absorbs the oil very well</li>
            <li>and since is color free i dont look gray or too white.</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to apply much.</li>
            <li>Did not do much for me</li>
            <li>Big difference from my face staying oil free for 45 mins after application.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>, I do not have to apply it as much as I did with the Mary Kay Foundation.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much for taking time out to read my review.</li>
            <li>I am a professional makeup artist and this really works!</li>
            <li>I purchased this with high hopes.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and i thought i give it a try since i have oily skin and live in the caribbean</li>
            <li>switched to a new foundation.</li>
            <li>Even though it states &#x27;Invisible&#x27; - its quite white in color, so be aware.</li>
            <li>It was hard to find in local drugstores so was glad that it was here at Amazon!</li>
            <li>In the few instances that I tried it, it seems like I would break out in huge cystic acne in where I applied it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this in December 2012, and I still have a reasonable supply left--from using it daily.</li>
            <li>It does not cut the shine out completely.</li>
            <li>I also recommend Black Opal Even True Cleanse &amp; Prevent Complexion Clearing Bar.</li>
            <li>As compared to drug store oil absorbing powders, they are comparable in price, and have about the same capacity for absorbing oil, which is nil[[ASIN:B005N6G4QA Black Opal Oil Absorbing Pressed Powder Invisible]].</li>
            <li>I am not very happy with this product,It only keeps me oil free for a while I have to reapply like four times a day and that&#x27;s depending how hot it is outside.</li>
            <li>Finally I&#x27;ve found an oil absorbing product that actually does what it says it does.</li>
            <li>It keeps me matte for at least 4 hours and then I blot every 2 - 3 hours after that instead of applying more powder because i don&#x27;t like to apply extra makeup at the end of my workday unless I have to.</li>
            <li>I purchased this at a local store because I have the tendency to get ridiculously oily, even in the winter time, I need something that will absorb most of the oil.  </li>
            <li>Be careful not to put too much on can have a white cast.</li>

            <li> I have extremely oily skin, and I&#x27;m so surprised that i can find a product that works for me.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s long lasting.</li>
            <li> It holds back oil and shine all day long!</li>

            <li> I apply the powder once a day over the Black Opal Invisible Oil Blocking Mattifier and under my regular powder foundation.</li>
            <li> However, the compact is difficult to open with a surprisingly small amount of the product, and its oil absorbing formula just isn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> help face not to look too shine, tone down the shine</li>
            <li> Wish it was not so tightly pressed</li>
            <li> Might have to mist a little.</li>
            <li> I am keeping this secret in my profession but sharing it with the public!</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t made me breakout or have any other negative side effects.</li>
            <li> There is NO magical powder.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, and usually an hour after I apply my makeup</li>
            <li> but at least my face doesn&#x27;t look like I slathered my face in bacon grease.  </li>
            <li> VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this product....very transparent and does the job well. its the powder i will be using for now. love it</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this product can claim it is INVISIBLE!  I am a guy, and DON&#x27;T wear makeup, but have oily skin.  As soon as you open it, you can see it is brownish.  As soon as you touch the pad to it, it turns brown.  When you put it on your face and if it touches anything white, it comes off onto it.  VERY DISAPPOINTED!</li>
            <li> My face secreted oil like an oil field. But that stopped when I stumbled across this powder. A makeup artist used it on my face, with nothing else, for a video shoot and my face looked soooo cool I had to get the name and wallah I found it on Amazon :) It hasn&#x27;t made me breakout or have any other negative side effects.</li>
            <li> I was looking at a YouTube video and the woman strongly recommended getting this oil absorbing powder (does it&#x27;s job and inexpensive). It was hard to find in local drugstores so was glad that it was here at Amazon! It does work very well, almost too well so be advised that if you use to much might look a little too mat or flat in apperance. Might have to mist a little. But bottom line does it&#x27;s job!</li>
            <li> I purchased this at a local store because I have the tendency to get ridiculously oily, even in the winter time, I need something that will absorb most of the oil.  I purchased this with high hopes.  In the few instances that I tried it, it seems like I would break out in huge cystic acne in where I applied it.  I am planning to give it one more try and if I break out, in the garbage it goes.  In the matters of its effectiveness, I would say it does a respectable job of keeping the oiliness at bay.  It does not keep me totally matte but at least my face doesn&#x27;t look like I slathered my face in bacon grease.  But I must warn those who have a deep complexion, do not load it on or else you will have an ashy cast to your face.  Just lightly blot it on or dust it on the oilier sections of your face and you are good to go.  BTW just to err on the side of caution, do not use if you are planning to be photographed.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! It works great alone with no makeup. It absorbs the oil very well and it&#x27;s long lasting. Glad to have found something to combat my oily skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased from this company before I really was satisfied with the product. I gave them another try and purchased Black Opal Oil absorbing blocking powder and was very satisfied it works. The products are always received in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my daughter and she is ever so pleased by the product.  Even her mom tried it and is placing an order.</li>
            <li> I bought this in December 2012, and I still have a reasonable supply left--from using it daily. As one who deals with an oily T-zone, this is a great fix. It goes on white, but with buffering it disappears. I do find that on the hotter days I have reapply, but i find this product great overall</li>
            <li> I saw this Youtube Guru talking about this face powder and how it kept her skin matte and out oil all day and i thought i give it a try since i have oily skin and live in the caribbean , i have to say im very pleased with this product it does help to keep the oil and shine out of my face and since is color free i dont look gray or too white.For me it works very good .</li>
            <li> I purchased this to compact my oily skin. It works very well. Would buy it again in the future</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily and I was looking for a good quality powder that would blot the oil during the day without having to reapply every hour or so. I does what it says it will do.</li>
            <li> This is the only powder that I use. I use it in all my videos (if you would like to see it on my face). I is the best powder I have ever tried and it does not break me out or make my face look white and chalky. [...]</li>
            <li> I was hopeful about this product when I read the favorable reviews.  However, the compact is difficult to open with a surprisingly small amount of the product, and its oil absorbing formula just isn&#x27;t.  As compared to drug store oil absorbing powders, they are comparable in price, and have about the same capacity for absorbing oil, which is nil[[ASIN:B005N6G4QA Black Opal Oil Absorbing Pressed Powder Invisible]].</li>
            <li> Not invisible. Has a chemical odor.</li>
            <li> Good oil control powder, but cheaper to buy direct from blackopalbeauty.com</li>
            <li> Perfect for African American skin. Doesn&#x27;t leave you pasty or chalky looking. You don&#x27;t need to apply much. I also recommend Black Opal Even True Cleanse &amp; Prevent Complexion Clearing Bar. Oily skin issues are gone</li>
            <li> Great product...works amazing!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product!  Can&#x27;t find it on the store shelves anymore.  Very happy I was able to find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Did not do much for me</li>
            <li> Great! Oily skin relief!</li>
            <li> Controls oil and has no color so you dont look like you have makeup on your face</li>
            <li> I use this product under my foundation and mattifying powder and my face will stay oil free for hours. Big difference from my face staying oil free for 45 mins after application. Be careful not to put too much on can have a white cast.</li>
            <li> Amazing and absorbs the oil. Just reapply throughout the day and pores look oil free. This product was perfect and couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
            <li> Finally I&#x27;ve found an oil absorbing product that actually does what it says it does. I apply the powder once a day over the Black Opal Invisible Oil Blocking Mattifier and under my regular powder foundation. It keeps me matte for at least 4 hours and then I blot every 2 - 3 hours after that instead of applying more powder because i don&#x27;t like to apply extra makeup at the end of my workday unless I have to. I love it and only use this to control my oily skin all day (before the powder and mattifier I had to blot every 1 hr / 1.5 hrs every day).</li>
            <li> I am not very happy with this product,It only keeps me oil free for a while I have to reapply like four times a day and that&#x27;s depending how hot it is outside.</li>
            <li> Very easy to apply. Even though it states &#x27;Invisible&#x27; - its quite white in color, so be aware. Doesn&#x27;t appear white after spread out.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using makeup sponge/triangle spread over foundation.</li>
            <li> This product is the best because it does the job and there is no ashiness!!!  It last and I don&#x27;t mind reapplying throughout the day because it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts for me.</li>
            <li> I guess like anything if you have oily skin it is going to be oily. There is NO magical powder.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and this product is like every other one I have purchased, blocks oil only for a short time</li>
            <li> This pressed powder does a really good job at controlling oil.  I have oily skin, and usually an hour after I apply my makeup, I start to look shiny.  I was surpriesed when I used this powder, because my face stayed matt for hours.  I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  3/17  I had to stop wearing this after a couple of days, because even though it says translucent (it&#x27;s white in color), my skin also looked white, and ashy.  Maybe this will work for some people with lighter skin tones, but it&#x27;s not for me.</li>
            <li> This is the only oil absorbing blocking powder that significantly reduced shine on my face for good length of time.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. I have extremely oily skin, and I&#x27;m so surprised that i can find a product that works for me.  This product is really smooth on your skin, and blends in very well. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It does not cut the shine out completely. It does decrease most of the shine that I was having before I started using this product.</li>
            <li> This product controls the oil on my African-American skin perfectly. Works best when I apply it over my Mary Kay bronze 708 foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Update August 6,2016**&lt;br /&gt;My favorite part of reviewing on Amazon is updating my old reviews with useful information for my fellow Amazonians!&lt;br /&gt;I switched to a new foundation. I now use this Oil Absorbing Blocking Powder with Covergirl Queen Collection All Day Flawless Foundation, True Ebony Q865, I do not have to apply it as much as I did with the Mary Kay Foundation. The shine is under control with True Ebony Q865. Thank you so much for taking time out to read my review. I hope you found it helpful. If so please select helpful.</li>
            <li> Wish it was not so tightly pressed but it works as it should.</li>
            <li> this product is just okay..sometimes it make my face white, so i still use my cover girl powder to cover it up.</li>
            <li> help face not to look too shine, tone down the shine</li>
            <li> I knew this product would be another &amp;#34;snake oil&amp;#34; product just like the Iman oil absorbing pressed powder, Palladio rice powder and the Neutrogena rice protein shine control powder that I wasted money on ordering; none of these products helped with my oily, shiny t-zone/combination skin problem; shortly after applying the product the shine/oil is noticeable; I will not throw away another cent on any oil blocking products.</li>
            <li> the hunt is over! many $ later.. this is THE product to keep your face matt. I am a professional makeup artist and this really works! I am keeping this secret in my profession but sharing it with the public! lol! get it!</li>
            <li> This is the best setting powder. It holds back oil and shine all day long! I am in love.</li>
