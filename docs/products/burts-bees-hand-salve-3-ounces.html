            <li>I picked up a can of Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve on a whim in the hopes that it would be as good as their amazing beeswax lip balm.</li>
            <li>will be getting more!</li>

            <li>It felt good when I put it on, and it made my fingers look moisturized, but they never got any better.  </li>
            <li>Sure, BBHS is organic and smells good, and Burt is a tree-hugger . . .</li>

            <li>The ecalyptus smell is lovely -</li>
            <li>I love their products.</li>
            <li>I love to cook with rosemary, but I thought the rosemary smell of this salve was overwhelming.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite hand, feet, cuticle ointment of all times.</li>
            <li>I find that it works even better than vaseline.</li>
            <li>Might be better barter tool than booze and cigarettes post apocalypse.</li>
            <li>Yes, this product is greasy, but I love it.</li>
            <li>Of hand cremes that I&#x27;ve tried, this one has to be my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always been a lotion addict but in the winter I find I need a bit more.  </li>
            <li>My hands have been more hydrated since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li>I love it; my daughter loves it; everyone love it;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>love it; my daughter loves it; everyone love it;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad that applying it to her hands doesn&#x27;t make her</li>
            <li>Stuff smells pretty good to me, too.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent moisturizer for hands and or dry elbows.  </li>
            <li>I got a free sample of this and applied it to my hands because I love most Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li>they loved it so much that every driver would come to me and ask for it.</li>
            <li>He loved the product so much</li>
            <li>Easy to stow in a drawer or even a jeans pocket.</li>
            <li>consistency is somewhat greasy but the product spreads easily over hands.  </li>
            <li>As for the scent, it is STRONG.</li>
            <li>The lavender combined with the rosemary smells strongly medicinal to me.</li>
            <li>The soap at my work was so strong it smelt like ammonia.</li>
            <li>Stuff works great in summer and even better in the winter when my hands are really dry.  </li>
            <li>Great product, heals skin and extra moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>, i did it again last year and will do it again this year, and since the price is so great here for 2 i will have no problem.</li>
            <li>apply once a week for crack free feet during the summer.</li>
            <li>This is important to note.</li>
            <li>This is the best product when your hands have been dried out/chapped/ ragged and bleeding cuticles.</li>
            <li>I like the price point, light lemon scent and quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li>He even uses it on his feet they leave your hands and feet smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li>Great product, heals skin and extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This product works wonders, lasts through handwashing, smells good (no chemical smell) and uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It would probably be a good salve for men - it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell girly.</li>
            <li>It is greasy but it is so good I only need to put it on at night when I am not doing anything with my hands.</li>
            <li>She love it so much.</li>
            <li>When I first started working at this locations it was so strong</li>
            <li>At first the smell was kinds strong</li>
            <li>Mild Eucalyptus like the steam room at the gym - no girly girl aroma on these manly paws.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from petroleum jelly immediate after bath to super duper prescription stuff.</li>
            <li>I work in a profession where hand washing is necessary, often many, MANY times per day.</li>
            <li>But absorbs super quick and</li>
            <li>It can provide moisture and can keep water for a long time and good smell.</li>
            <li>It lasts, is great for cuticles, and one tin will last a normal person a year.</li>
            <li>It also works extremely fast and washes off easily if needed.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really comment on the quality of the product because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li>clean hands,and do it work very well,very useful,wo had bought three times ,and i will buy it in te future more and more</li>
            <li>No need for gloves because the lotion kind of brings it all together and more or less keeps everything in place.  </li>
            <li>Great switch from petroleum jelly, ordered this for my husband and he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li>but I think it smells amazing and fills the entire room with the eucalyptus--y fragrance.</li>
            <li>The following day, the results were amazing.</li>
            <li>I used Gold Bond for three days so far, and my skin looks much better already.  </li>
            <li>it was well worth it.</li>
            <li>It does not seem to get absorbed in my skin to provide a benefit except at onset of application.</li>
            <li>but aren&#x27;t that effective to keep the problem from coming back.</li>
            <li>The product is absorbed within five minutes of application.  </li>
            <li>Nice protection for hands especially in winter.</li>
            <li>Feels greasy going on and within seconds is absorbed and non-greasy.</li>
            <li>stuff&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li>applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% natural, yes if you can read the ingredients it is usually better for you.</li>
            <li>Putting it on right before bed works wonders.</li>
            <li>so I can keep one at work and one at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product that is highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Left to my own devices, I slathered this stuff on my hands the first time, and used WAY too much.</li>
            <li>This morning my hands are very very close to fully healed.</li>
            <li>I would recommend, initial smell is alittle strong but fades quickly.</li>
            <li>I would recommend, initial smell is alittle strong but fades quickly.</li>
            <li>this stuff cured that after the first use.</li>
            <li>Some people probably buy this, expecting more of a white hand lotion, so if that is what you are after, don&#x27;t go with this.  </li>
            <li>well I don&#x27;t mind the higher price.</li>
            <li>But my hands are much happier!  </li>
            <li>I tried this for the first time, yes it was greasy and had a &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li>This product is great and the tin last a long time.</li>
            <li>BTW, I recently bought two more for me and ...</li>
            <li>I love lavendar, rosemary but not a big fan of eucalyptus.</li>
            <li>this stuff is a little to greasy for my hands, however, i cant feel the grease on my feet, so it&#x27;s perfect for the dry heels i get from wearing thong sandals.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve switched to Gold Bond Ultimate Concentrated Therapy, which is unscented and is far more effective on my rough hands.</li>
            <li>My home is where hand moisturizers come to die, as most of them don&#x27;t work that well on my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li>after day three you probly wont even need it any more you hands will be back or close to normal.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t that strong and medicated smelling, but it is somewhat similar.  </li>
            <li>: The merchandise in the foto looked the same, however now the tin container is cheapened - no longer painted metal all over, the ingredient list has changed some and the smell is no longer as strong.</li>
            <li>container is the size of a large shoe polish can.</li>
            <li>unless I really rub it off, which largely defeats the use of it.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm all the time, and really like it.  </li>
            <li>While I will admit it&#x27;s very oily, when you&#x27;re in this much pain</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it quite as much, but won&#x27;t even consider stopping my use of it.  </li>
            <li>This hand salve has a distinctive scent but one that is very herbal in nature.  </li>
            <li>When I use this on my hands at night it really heals the damage done throughout the day and keeps them from having problems.</li>
            <li>This balm is quite greasy, but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>One tin lasted our family of three a whole winter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very sensitive to heavy perfumes, and this salve has a pleasant smell like natural honey-beeswax.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for tattoos that look blue when they should be black (you know the old sailor tattoos, etc).</li>
            <li>I think with this stuff, less is more.</li>
            <li>A classic.</li>
            <li>While Burt&#x27;s Bees works well on hands chapped after a day of outside work, it works even better if you treat your hands before you go outside (as per the directions).  </li>
            <li>This product made my hands very soft, but it was very greasy.</li>
            <li>Believe me, I have tried them ALL without success, and some even burn if you have an open crack that has been bleeding.</li>
            <li>The person I gave it to loves this product and has not complained about the greasiness.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s not crazy about the smell of BB&#x27;s hand salve as it does have a strong eucalyptus odor but agrees to put up with it because the other drugstore brand hand lotions hurt her hands when they&#x27;re that dry.  </li>
            <li>I definitely thought I would get more for the money I spent, but it works so</li>
            <li>Anyways, after I let my hands absorb the salve for a few minutes they were REALLY SOFT AND SMOOTH!</li>
            <li>I wash my hands a ton and as a result, they are super dry and can get cracked.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li>This is a fantastic product for trouble hands or keeping them trouble free in the first place.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, with my hands rough, scraggly, and bleeding from hot water and strong dish soap, hand sanitizer, and six months of wintry dry air and washing baby bottles.</li>
            <li>We tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees hand salve for the first time and she applied it several times yesterday, and a couple today, and her hands are almost healed.   </li>
            <li>I use this mostly at bedtime because it does leave your hands a bit slick.  </li>
            <li>My hands are actually soft again!</li>
            <li>a generally don&#x27;t use any lotions or really had the need to, until I started working in retail sales.</li>
            <li>Excellent for dry hands if you&#x27;re willing to work around the grease factor (which isn&#x27;t even that bad).</li>
            <li>The aroma is slightly different as well, maybe a bit more eucalyptus and a bit less rosemary odor.  </li>
            <li>I like that Amazon offers the two pack</li>
            <li>and my cuticles soft.</li>
            <li>I used bag balm for years to protect my hand at the start of the day, but this product keeps my cuticles soft.</li>
            <li>Even if I am wrong about that, healing in 36 hours instead of a week or more is worth it.</li>
            <li>In fact, they often crack and bleed, particularly in the winter and because her elementary school educators are a little overzealous about the use of hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li>The texture is still the same as far as I can tell, a bit goopy and sticky when first applied in the evening, but by the next morning no residue is noticable.</li>
            <li>But I would still recommend this to anyone, especially someone new to the concept of salve!</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it to people who wash their hands and live in colder climate!</li>
            <li>Yeah, this stuff it more expensive than most lotion, but you use much less of it</li>
            <li>My purchase in Jan 2012 still came in a metal container, though it is now a silver background rather than all yellow like the older ones.  </li>
            <li>In the morning, there&#x27;s enough left on my hands to rub in before the first hand washing of the day.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this for years and as old person it really protects and heals dry hands.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x60;t do much for split dry fingers</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to really help heal my extremely dry hands.  </li>
            <li>Not as soft as my baby&#x27;s bottom, but soft enough to not snag my tee shirt when I put it on.</li>
            <li>Then, he said order more for her, as she complained about NOT getting it back.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t generally use it during the day, as it will make my fingers mark objects I touch,</li>
            <li>i used it in the winter and though it can leave a slight greasiness at first</li>
            <li>One other problem i had was, I had no idea how much to apply.</li>
            <li>It does take a moment for the product to sink in and it&#x27;s a little greasy feeling at first.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the right balance of lasting long enough to help my hands, but not too long so that I feel sweaty/greasy the next morning.  </li>
            <li>If you have an open crack or super dry skin, applying this liberally gives immediate relief and helps over the next few hours until you should re-apply.</li>

            <li> Yes, this product is greasy, but I love it.</li>
            <li> Of hand cremes that I&#x27;ve tried, this one has to be my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a lotion addict but in the winter I find I need a bit more.  </li>
            <li> My hands have been more hydrated since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> I love it; my daughter loves it; everyone love it;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> love it; my daughter loves it; everyone love it;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just glad that applying it to her hands doesn&#x27;t make her</li>
            <li> Stuff smells pretty good to me, too.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for hands and or dry elbows.  </li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this and applied it to my hands because I love most Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
            <li> they loved it so much that every driver would come to me and ask for it.</li>
            <li> He loved the product so much</li>
            <li> Easy to stow in a drawer or even a jeans pocket.</li>
            <li> consistency is somewhat greasy but the product spreads easily over hands.  </li>
            <li> As for the scent, it is STRONG.</li>
            <li> The lavender combined with the rosemary smells strongly medicinal to me.</li>
            <li> The soap at my work was so strong it smelt like ammonia.</li>
            <li> Stuff works great in summer and even better in the winter when my hands are really dry.  </li>
            <li> Great product, heals skin and extra moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> , i did it again last year and will do it again this year, and since the price is so great here for 2 i will have no problem.</li>
            <li> apply once a week for crack free feet during the summer.</li>
            <li> This is important to note.</li>
            <li> This is the best product when your hands have been dried out/chapped/ ragged and bleeding cuticles.</li>
            <li> I like the price point, light lemon scent and quality of ingredients.</li>
            <li> He even uses it on his feet they leave your hands and feet smooth and nourished.</li>
            <li> Great product, heals skin and extra moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This product works wonders, lasts through handwashing, smells good (no chemical smell) and uses natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> It would probably be a good salve for men - it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell girly.</li>
            <li> It is greasy but it is so good I only need to put it on at night when I am not doing anything with my hands.</li>
            <li> She love it so much.</li>
            <li> When I first started working at this locations it was so strong</li>
            <li> At first the smell was kinds strong</li>
            <li> Mild Eucalyptus like the steam room at the gym - no girly girl aroma on these manly paws.&lt;br</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from petroleum jelly immediate after bath to super duper prescription stuff.</li>
            <li> I work in a profession where hand washing is necessary, often many, MANY times per day.</li>
            <li> But absorbs super quick and</li>
            <li> It can provide moisture and can keep water for a long time and good smell.</li>
            <li> It lasts, is great for cuticles, and one tin will last a normal person a year.</li>
            <li> It also works extremely fast and washes off easily if needed.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really comment on the quality of the product because of the strong smell.</li>
            <li> clean hands,and do it work very well,very useful,wo had bought three times ,and i will buy it in te future more and more</li>
            <li> No need for gloves because the lotion kind of brings it all together and more or less keeps everything in place.  </li>
            <li> Great switch from petroleum jelly, ordered this for my husband and he uses it everyday.</li>
            <li> but I think it smells amazing and fills the entire room with the eucalyptus--y fragrance.</li>
            <li> The following day, the results were amazing.</li>
            <li> I used Gold Bond for three days so far, and my skin looks much better already.  </li>
            <li> it was well worth it.</li>
            <li> It does not seem to get absorbed in my skin to provide a benefit except at onset of application.</li>
            <li> but aren&#x27;t that effective to keep the problem from coming back.</li>
            <li> The product is absorbed within five minutes of application.  </li>
            <li> Nice protection for hands especially in winter.</li>
            <li> Feels greasy going on and within seconds is absorbed and non-greasy.</li>
            <li> stuff&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  </li>
            <li> applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% natural, yes if you can read the ingredients it is usually better for you.</li>
            <li> Putting it on right before bed works wonders.</li>
            <li> so I can keep one at work and one at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product that is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Left to my own devices, I slathered this stuff on my hands the first time, and used WAY too much.</li>
            <li> This morning my hands are very very close to fully healed.</li>
            <li> I would recommend, initial smell is alittle strong but fades quickly.</li>
            <li> I would recommend, initial smell is alittle strong but fades quickly.</li>
            <li> this stuff cured that after the first use.</li>
            <li> Some people probably buy this, expecting more of a white hand lotion, so if that is what you are after, don&#x27;t go with this.  </li>
            <li> well I don&#x27;t mind the higher price.</li>
            <li> But my hands are much happier!  </li>
            <li> I tried this for the first time, yes it was greasy and had a &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; smell.</li>
            <li> This product is great and the tin last a long time.</li>
            <li> BTW, I recently bought two more for me and ...</li>
            <li> I love lavendar, rosemary but not a big fan of eucalyptus.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a little to greasy for my hands, however, i cant feel the grease on my feet, so it&#x27;s perfect for the dry heels i get from wearing thong sandals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve switched to Gold Bond Ultimate Concentrated Therapy, which is unscented and is far more effective on my rough hands.</li>
            <li> My home is where hand moisturizers come to die, as most of them don&#x27;t work that well on my extremely dry skin.</li>
            <li> after day three you probly wont even need it any more you hands will be back or close to normal.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that strong and medicated smelling, but it is somewhat similar.  </li>
            <li> : The merchandise in the foto looked the same, however now the tin container is cheapened - no longer painted metal all over, the ingredient list has changed some and the smell is no longer as strong.</li>
            <li> container is the size of a large shoe polish can.</li>
            <li> unless I really rub it off, which largely defeats the use of it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm all the time, and really like it.  </li>
            <li> While I will admit it&#x27;s very oily, when you&#x27;re in this much pain</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it quite as much, but won&#x27;t even consider stopping my use of it.  </li>
            <li> This hand salve has a distinctive scent but one that is very herbal in nature.  </li>
            <li> When I use this on my hands at night it really heals the damage done throughout the day and keeps them from having problems.</li>
            <li> This balm is quite greasy, but it is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> One tin lasted our family of three a whole winter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very sensitive to heavy perfumes, and this salve has a pleasant smell like natural honey-beeswax.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great for tattoos that look blue when they should be black (you know the old sailor tattoos, etc).</li>
            <li> I think with this stuff, less is more.</li>
            <li> A classic.</li>
            <li> While Burt&#x27;s Bees works well on hands chapped after a day of outside work, it works even better if you treat your hands before you go outside (as per the directions).  </li>
            <li> This product made my hands very soft, but it was very greasy.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried them ALL without success, and some even burn if you have an open crack that has been bleeding.</li>
            <li> The person I gave it to loves this product and has not complained about the greasiness.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s not crazy about the smell of BB&#x27;s hand salve as it does have a strong eucalyptus odor but agrees to put up with it because the other drugstore brand hand lotions hurt her hands when they&#x27;re that dry.  </li>
            <li> I definitely thought I would get more for the money I spent, but it works so</li>
            <li> Anyways, after I let my hands absorb the salve for a few minutes they were REALLY SOFT AND SMOOTH!</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a ton and as a result, they are super dry and can get cracked.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to perfumes.  </li>
            <li> This is a fantastic product for trouble hands or keeping them trouble free in the first place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, with my hands rough, scraggly, and bleeding from hot water and strong dish soap, hand sanitizer, and six months of wintry dry air and washing baby bottles.</li>
            <li> We tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees hand salve for the first time and she applied it several times yesterday, and a couple today, and her hands are almost healed.   </li>
            <li> I use this mostly at bedtime because it does leave your hands a bit slick.  </li>
            <li> My hands are actually soft again!</li>
            <li> a generally don&#x27;t use any lotions or really had the need to, until I started working in retail sales.</li>
            <li> Excellent for dry hands if you&#x27;re willing to work around the grease factor (which isn&#x27;t even that bad).</li>
            <li> The aroma is slightly different as well, maybe a bit more eucalyptus and a bit less rosemary odor.  </li>
            <li> I like that Amazon offers the two pack</li>
            <li> and my cuticles soft.</li>
            <li> I used bag balm for years to protect my hand at the start of the day, but this product keeps my cuticles soft.</li>
            <li> Even if I am wrong about that, healing in 36 hours instead of a week or more is worth it.</li>
            <li> In fact, they often crack and bleed, particularly in the winter and because her elementary school educators are a little overzealous about the use of hand sanitizer.  </li>
            <li> The texture is still the same as far as I can tell, a bit goopy and sticky when first applied in the evening, but by the next morning no residue is noticable.</li>
            <li> But I would still recommend this to anyone, especially someone new to the concept of salve!</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it to people who wash their hands and live in colder climate!</li>
            <li> Yeah, this stuff it more expensive than most lotion, but you use much less of it</li>
            <li> My purchase in Jan 2012 still came in a metal container, though it is now a silver background rather than all yellow like the older ones.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, there&#x27;s enough left on my hands to rub in before the first hand washing of the day.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for years and as old person it really protects and heals dry hands.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x60;t do much for split dry fingers</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to really help heal my extremely dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Not as soft as my baby&#x27;s bottom, but soft enough to not snag my tee shirt when I put it on.</li>
            <li> Then, he said order more for her, as she complained about NOT getting it back.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t generally use it during the day, as it will make my fingers mark objects I touch,</li>
            <li> i used it in the winter and though it can leave a slight greasiness at first</li>
            <li> One other problem i had was, I had no idea how much to apply.</li>
            <li> It does take a moment for the product to sink in and it&#x27;s a little greasy feeling at first.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the right balance of lasting long enough to help my hands, but not too long so that I feel sweaty/greasy the next morning.  </li>
            <li> If you have an open crack or super dry skin, applying this liberally gives immediate relief and helps over the next few hours until you should re-apply.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin, and live in a place where the air gets VERY dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> one is the medicinal smell, which annoys some sensitive people including me, and the other one is the greasiness.</li>
            <li> This hand salve made my hands silky soft, without the greasy feel of other hand creams.  </li>
            <li> I have constant dry hands, probably from washing them too often and using hand sanitizer.</li>
            <li> This is a little rich so few of you may have found it a bit greasy/oily compared to other products out there</li>
            <li> When that happens it takes weeks to get them back to normal, applying lotion several times a day,  even soaking them in a thick layer of lotion overnight.  </li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve is the only widely distributed salve I have ever seen that works.  </li>
            <li> Tried several of my wife&#x27;s skin creams to no real effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only other Burt&#x27;s Bees I have tried was the lip balm</li>
            <li> work in the healthcare field and am constantly using hand sanitizer and other stuff that notoriously makes my hands dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used Burt&#x27;s Bees for over a month on the dry, cracked skin on my fingers.  </li>
            <li> My daughter always has really dry hands.   </li>
            <li> Yesterday her hands were as dry as I have ever seen them.   </li>
            <li> and I have naturally dry skin anyway,</li>
            <li> so during the winter, my cuticles and fingertips will often crack from being so dry.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dry hands and elbows, and my daughter uses it for her legs which are alway dry and chapped.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hands are always dry.  </li>
            <li> so I think it actually will cost us less in the long run.  </li>
            <li> Less greasy than bag balm, but similar level of protection.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t open the little container.</li>
            <li> It is messy, a hassle, but until now the only thing that worked.         </li>
            <li> Then after my hands kept getting worse I picked it up again and really rubbed the stuff in.</li>
            <li> This has completely eliminated cracked and broken skin as well as stopped any severe chapping even while working in humidities in the low teens.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way; I apply this salve a couple of times a week, and I&#x27;ve had my tin of it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for some years now, and I agree with other reviewers that it has been changed.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful with the shipping that could be tacked on, because otherwise it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> little bit of this product goes a long way and a three ounce tin typically takes me through winter and spring.  </li>
            <li> After a few months my hands started cracking, drying up, and turning into scaly rough patches on the tops and between my fingers.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried it one time and put it down for a couple weeks.</li>
            <li> That is to say, it is the consistency of an ointment instead of a typical hand lotion.</li>
            <li> Unlike an typical bottle of hand lotion, there is no \\&quot;pump\\&quot; which gives you the intended dose.</li>
            <li> I typically apply at night and in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Typically, the scent dissipates in twenty minutes.  </li>
            <li> Just takes a little practice not to over apply, and if I do I just run my hands under the sink.</li>
            <li> i revived this product as a gift, in a little tin about 5 years ago.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, and buying it online made made it a little cheaper.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend applying just enough to cover the affected areas with a thin film.  </li>
            <li> (Think harsh work - gardening  or cleaning or painting without gloves.)</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this when she gets blisters from practicing on the uneven bars at gymnastics.  </li>
            <li> so I can have the smoothness all day everyday.</li>
            <li> so I used it at night, but it also seems tedious to apply because of its solid nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> night I ripped open the box from Amazon and applied this not-very-greasy mixture to my sorry skin three times.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this product I used it immediately as my hands and fingers were painfully chipped and cracked due to the extreme cold weather in which I live.</li>
            <li> It definitely leaves you smelling for a little bit, but it isn&#x27;t an unpleasant smell (at least IMO).  </li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong in my limited experience giving a gift of a Burt&#x27;s Bees product.</li>
            <li> I hardly use this also because, although I do not intentionally get it in my eyes, it causes allergic reactions on my eyes.</li>
            <li> I try really hard</li>
            <li> Winter is so hard on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not loving it either.</li>
            <li> The tin is about the size of a coaster, and an inch thick.</li>
            <li> It is thick and it smells of lavender and herbs.</li>
            <li> Our hands were dry but not anymore, the winter in the high desert is especially cruel on my hands.</li>
            <li> My hubby &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; by college daughter&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve, as his hands were incredibly dry from working outdoors in cold weather.  </li>
            <li> I likened it a little like what you smell when you rub Vick&#x27;s on your chest when your ill.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who is very hard on her hands.  </li>
            <li> If I forget to make her use lotion all the time they get rough, scaly, and painful.   </li>
            <li> But I apply this to my hands a couple times a day, and no more painful cracking and dryness.  </li>
            <li> During the winter my hands dry out very badly and tend to bleed from washing my hands.</li>
            <li> so it makes it difficult to use this product because anything I touch becomes greasy.</li>
            <li> Sorry Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> You can;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> i also work at a pizza shop, all of the drivers get terribly cracked skin and when they would ask for lotion from every one i started giving them this.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I used Burt&#x27;s Bees for over a month on the dry, cracked skin on my fingers.  It felt good when I put it on, and it made my fingers look moisturized, but they never got any better.  I used Gold Bond for three days so far, and my skin looks much better already.  Sure, BBHS is organic and smells good, and Burt is a tree-hugger . . . but it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it calls for an explanation.  Stuff works great in summer and even better in the winter when my hands are really dry.  Just takes a little practice not to over apply, and if I do I just run my hands under the sink.</li>
            <li> Great product, heals skin and extra moisturizing.  Nice cooling feeling when applied.  I would recommend, initial smell is alittle strong but fades quickly.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well</li>
            <li> i revived this product as a gift, in a little tin about 5 years ago. i used it in the winter and though it can leave a slight greasiness at first it was well worth it. i also work at a pizza shop, all of the drivers get terribly cracked skin and when they would ask for lotion from every one i started giving them this. THEY LOVED IT!!! they loved it so much that every driver would come to me and ask for it. I then had to buy this bigger tin of it for around $9.00 at a drug store. at our Christmas party 3 years ago we would have to bring 3 gifts in for under $10.00 a piece and i bought 3 of these big tins, i did it again last year and will do it again this year, and since the price is so great here for 2 i will have no problem. lets just say the drivers hope they get my gift every Christmas party!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if you wash your hands a lot and/or you are out side a lot i recommend this!!</li>
            <li> This is the product that made me realize I&#x27;d never go back to lotions again. Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve is the only widely distributed salve I have ever seen that works.  There are two reasons I don&#x27;t give this 5 stars- one is the medicinal smell, which annoys some sensitive people including me, and the other one is the greasiness. You cannot use this and then type, for example. It&#x27;s a good night cream.   The smell and the feel are what inspired me to make my own products that don&#x27;t have that problem. But I would still recommend this to anyone, especially someone new to the concept of salve! A classic.</li>
            <li> this stuff is a little to greasy for my hands, however, i cant feel the grease on my feet, so it&#x27;s perfect for the dry heels i get from wearing thong sandals. my heels were starting to turn white from drying. this stuff cured that after the first use. apply once a week for crack free feet during the summer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because I use the Burt&#x27;s Bees lip balm all the time, and really like it.  This hand salve has the same \\&quot;consistency\\&quot; as the lip balm. That is to say, it is the consistency of an ointment instead of a typical hand lotion. This is important to note. Some people probably buy this, expecting more of a white hand lotion, so if that is what you are after, don&#x27;t go with this.  One other problem i had was, I had no idea how much to apply. Unlike an typical bottle of hand lotion, there is no \\&quot;pump\\&quot; which gives you the intended dose. Left to my own devices, I slathered this stuff on my hands the first time, and used WAY too much. I think with this stuff, less is more. I would recommend applying just enough to cover the affected areas with a thin film.  As for the scent, it is STRONG. It definitely leaves you smelling for a little bit, but it isn&#x27;t an unpleasant smell (at least IMO).  I likened it a little like what you smell when you rub Vick&#x27;s on your chest when your ill. It isn&#x27;t that strong and medicated smelling, but it is somewhat similar.  It does the job though. I have dry skin, and live in a place where the air gets VERY dry in the winter. But I apply this to my hands a couple times a day, and no more painful cracking and dryness.  The tin is about the size of a coaster, and an inch thick. I definitely thought I would get more for the money I spent, but it works so well I don&#x27;t mind the higher price.</li>
            <li> this is very good hand salve! i use it on my arms back legs and feet too. it&#x27;s really good stuff!!! will be getting more!</li>
            <li> I work with my hands a lot so it makes it difficult to use this product because anything I touch becomes greasy. It does not seem to get absorbed in my skin to provide a benefit except at onset of application. I hardly use this also because, although I do not intentionally get it in my eyes, it causes allergic reactions on my eyes. The only other Burt&#x27;s Bees I have tried was the lip balm and I do not have complaints about that.</li>
            <li> My home is where hand moisturizers come to die, as most of them don&#x27;t work that well on my extremely dry skin. This salve will be relegated to the heap with the Aveeno, Barielle, Neutrogena, and the like that provide me some temporary relief from scaly fingertips but aren&#x27;t that effective to keep the problem from coming back. It&#x27;s greasy so I used it at night, but it also seems tedious to apply because of its solid nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought the tin, I missed seeing in the ingredients that it has lavender oil in it. The lavender combined with the rosemary smells strongly medicinal to me. I&#x27;ve switched to Gold Bond Ultimate Concentrated Therapy, which is unscented and is far more effective on my rough hands.</li>
            <li> I have used a lot of products-- dozens if not hundreds. As a chronic hand washer, I have struggled to find a product that will heal my hands and make them feel good in the winter. Washing overdries my skin, big time. I chronically have had cracking and bleeding from Thanksgiving through Easter.     Burt&#x27;s Bees hand salve is the best-- better than vaseline products, olay, avon, neutrogena, and the likes. Believe me, I have tried them ALL without success, and some even burn if you have an open crack that has been bleeding. If you have an open crack or super dry skin, applying this liberally gives immediate relief and helps over the next few hours until you should re-apply. While I will admit it&#x27;s very oily, when you&#x27;re in this much pain it doesn&#x27;t matter. It also works extremely fast and washes off easily if needed. It smells good to me, some don&#x27;t like the smell. It smells like it&#x27;s name, a combination of a beeswax and honey or something.     After a week or so, your hands will be cleared up, silky smooth and feel great. It&#x27;s also great for tattoos that look blue when they should be black (you know the old sailor tattoos, etc). Putting it on right before bed works wonders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, with my hands rough, scraggly, and bleeding from hot water and strong dish soap, hand sanitizer, and six months of wintry dry air and washing baby bottles. Tried several of my wife&#x27;s skin creams to no real effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night I ripped open the box from Amazon and applied this not-very-greasy mixture to my sorry skin three times. This morning my hands are very very close to fully healed. Not as soft as my baby&#x27;s bottom, but soft enough to not snag my tee shirt when I put it on. Stuff smells pretty good to me, too. Mild Eucalyptus like the steam room at the gym - no girly girl aroma on these manly paws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is the size of a large shoe polish can. Easy to stow in a drawer or even a jeans pocket. They label this stuff \\&quot;a farmer&#x27;s friend.\\&quot; Now it&#x27;s my friend, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you, Burt, whoever you are.</li>
            <li> My daughter always has really dry hands.   If I forget to make her use lotion all the time they get rough, scaly, and painful.   When that happens it takes weeks to get them back to normal, applying lotion several times a day,  even soaking them in a thick layer of lotion overnight.  I put socks on her hands so it doesn&#x27;t get all over everything.  It is messy, a hassle, but until now the only thing that worked.         Yesterday her hands were as dry as I have ever seen them.   They felt like reptile skin.  We tried the Burt&#x27;s Bees hand salve for the first time and she applied it several times yesterday, and a couple today, and her hands are almost healed.   I wouldn&#x27;t believe it if I hadn&#x27;t seen it myself.  Yeah, this stuff it more expensive than most lotion, but you use much less of it so I think it actually will cost us less in the long run.  Even if I am wrong about that, healing in 36 hours instead of a week or more is worth it.</li>
            <li> This is the best product when your hands have been dried out/chapped/ ragged and bleeding cuticles. (Think harsh work - gardening  or cleaning or painting without gloves.) Just wash up and apply - instant transformation; trim up your cuticles and you will be amazed the difference one application makes. The ecalyptus smell is lovely - I guess not for you if you love the fake floral/fruity lotions which for me, aggravate allergies and give me a headache. The tin is convenient to drop in your purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a fan of this product for some years now, and I agree with other reviewers that it has been changed.  My purchase in Jan 2012 still came in a metal container, though it is now a silver background rather than all yellow like the older ones.  The texture is still the same as far as I can tell, a bit goopy and sticky when first applied in the evening, but by the next morning no residue is noticable. But my hands are much happier!  The aroma is slightly different as well, maybe a bit more eucalyptus and a bit less rosemary odor.  I don&#x27;t like it quite as much, but won&#x27;t even consider stopping my use of it.  It&#x27;s the right balance of lasting long enough to help my hands, but not too long so that I feel sweaty/greasy the next morning.  I don&#x27;t generally use it during the day, as it will make my fingers mark objects I touch, unless I really rub it off, which largely defeats the use of it.</li>
            <li> Every November my hands begin to crack.  I found Burt&#x27;s Bees hand salve about four years ago and have faithfully purchased a tin each fall because it is the only product that I have found that can assuage the discomfort and help my hands heal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is somewhat greasy but the product spreads easily over hands.  The product is absorbed within five minutes of application.  I typically apply at night and in the morning.  This routine keeps my hands moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very sensitive to perfumes.  This hand salve has a distinctive scent but one that is very herbal in nature.  The smell can fill a room or work office but I don&#x27;t think the scent rises to the level of being obnoxious.  I regularly apply it at work and have had no complaints.  Typically, the scent dissipates in twenty minutes.  If you are worried about the stares of colleagues, try to apply it after a nighttime shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of this product goes a long way and a three ounce tin typically takes me through winter and spring.  I like that Amazon offers the two pack so I can keep one at work and one at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a fantastic product that is highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees products are the greatest.  This hand salve made my hands silky soft, without the greasy feel of other hand creams.  Will use this until the day I die...I love their products.</li>
            <li> as almost everything in this day and age, products are not the same anymore. I hoped this would not be the case with Burts Bees.  Hand Salve: The merchandise in the foto looked the same, however now the tin container is cheapened - no longer painted metal all over, the ingredient list has changed some and the smell is no longer as strong. I am embarrassed to gift this \\&quot;tin\\&quot; now to my friends.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT.  IT HELPS MY HANDS AND HELPS TO KEEP THEM FROM CRACKING.  IT EVEN SMELLS GOOD.</li>
            <li> I got a free sample of this and applied it to my hands because I love most Burt&#x27;s Bees products. After sitting there with it on my hands for a couple of minutes, I had to run to the bathroom and scrub it off. I love to cook with rosemary, but I thought the rosemary smell of this salve was overwhelming. Sorry Burt&#x27;s Bees. It would probably be a good salve for men - it definitely doesn&#x27;t smell girly.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x60;t do much for split dry fingers</li>
            <li> For now the quality is still good. It smells pleasant and keeps my fingers from cracking. Less greasy than bag balm, but similar level of protection.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hand, feet, cuticle ointment of all times. It is thick and it smells of lavender and herbs. It keeps my hads well moisturized and my cuticles soft.</li>
            <li> I got this for my mother who is very hard on her hands.  She loves it and it leaves a nice nongreasy feel to the skin.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff. I find the fragrance pleasant but she is the user. You can&#x27;t go wrong in my limited experience giving a gift of a Burt&#x27;s Bees product.</li>
            <li> This is a quality product, and buying it online made made it a little cheaper.  Just be careful with the shipping that could be tacked on, because otherwise it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a lot (kids, chores, cleaning, etc) and I have naturally dry skin anyway, so during the winter, my cuticles and fingertips will often crack from being so dry. This product works wonders, lasts through handwashing, smells good (no chemical smell) and uses natural ingredients. I&#x27;m very sensitive to heavy perfumes, and this salve has a pleasant smell like natural honey-beeswax.     If you have cracked hands, give this one a try. I find that it works even better than vaseline.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t open the little container. I try really hard but I just can&#x27;t seem to get the lid off.</li>
            <li> Cured my flaky skin issues that I&#x27;ve had for longer than I care to remember. And I&#x27;ve tried just about everything from petroleum jelly immediate after bath to super duper prescription stuff. The prescription stuff would sort of work but topical steroids is not the sort of thing you want to keep using unless you want to grow a horn or something. But this stuff did it! Use it religiously for 3 months and voila!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stockpile this stuff. Might be better barter tool than booze and cigarettes post apocalypse.</li>
            <li> i have been using this stuff for years. burt&#x27;s bees rock... they offer a lot of good for you items..</li>
            <li> Yes, this product is greasy, but I love it. I apply this hand salve before bedtime, and in the morning my hands feel great. Excellent for dry hands if you&#x27;re willing to work around the grease factor (which isn&#x27;t even that bad). A little goes a long way; I apply this salve a couple of times a week, and I&#x27;ve had my tin of it for over a year.</li>
            <li> I work in a profession where hand washing is necessary, often many, MANY times per day. The bees wax based hand products seem to work best bc they can stand up to a soap/hot water washing or two. Of hand cremes that I&#x27;ve tried, this one has to be my favorite. I like the price point, light lemon scent and quality of ingredients. I haven&#x27;t purchased from Amazon, so this review is only for the product.  It does take a moment for the product to sink in and it&#x27;s a little greasy feeling at first. After that you&#x27;re good-to-go. It lasts, is great for cuticles, and one tin will last a normal person a year. I would definitely purchase this again and recommend it to people who wash their hands and live in colder climate!</li>
            <li> I gave it to my girlfriend for a gift and she uses it daily. Burt&#x27;s Bees is known for quality product and this lives up to the reputation.</li>
            <li> During the winter my hands dry out very badly and tend to bleed from washing my hands. When I use this on my hands at night it really heals the damage done throughout the day and keeps them from having problems.</li>
            <li> Great switch from petroleum jelly, ordered this for my husband and he uses it everyday. He even uses it on his feet they leave your hands and feet smooth and nourished. I would definitely recommend this product,</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to really help heal my extremely dry hands.  This salve is greasy and does not absorb into the skin.  I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> Winter is so hard on my hands.  I&#x27;ve always been a lotion addict but in the winter I find I need a bit more.  I use this mostly at bedtime because it does leave your hands a bit slick.  It&#x27;s part of the bedtime routine for me.  I flick each nail through the pot and rub that in before applying to the rest of my hands.  I follow up with the lemon butter cuticle cream and then Curel hand lotion.  No need for gloves because the lotion kind of brings it all together and more or less keeps everything in place.  In the morning, there&#x27;s enough left on my hands to rub in before the first hand washing of the day.  My hands have been more hydrated since I&#x27;ve been using this.</li>
            <li> Our hands were dry but not anymore, the winter in the high desert is especially cruel on my hands. I share this with friends and they buy it too.</li>
            <li> My daughter uses this when she gets blisters from practicing on the uneven bars at gymnastics.  Seems to help out.</li>
            <li> I use this for my dry hands and elbows, and my daughter uses it for her legs which are alway dry and chapped. It doesn&#x27;t sting her like lotions do so she is very happy to use it.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin. This product made my hands very soft, but it was very greasy. I had to wash my hands after I put on the salve to lessen the greasy feeling. I ended up giving it away. The person I gave it to loves this product and has not complained about the greasiness.</li>
            <li> clean hands,and do it work very well,very useful,wo had bought three times ,and i will buy it in te future more and more</li>
            <li> greasy but soaks in well. The best in desert environs.</li>
            <li> This is a little rich so few of you may have found it a bit greasy/oily compared to other products out there but I think it smells amazing and fills the entire room with the eucalyptus--y fragrance. Makes my hand so soft and supple, perfect moisturizer for winter, i use it on my elbows too.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer for hands and or dry elbows.  It softens without feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it, especially for use during the winter months.</li>
            <li> This balm is quite greasy, but it is very moisturizing. I use it for my cuticles, and it is very deeply moisturizing. It also has a very nice lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees products, this is one of my favorites!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I work in the healthcare field and am constantly using hand sanitizer and other stuff that notoriously makes my hands dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried this for the first time, yes it was greasy and had a &amp;#34;mediciney&amp;#34; smell. Not a &amp;#34;chemical&amp;#34; smell, but kind of like vapor rub or something. Anyways, after I let my hands absorb the salve for a few minutes they were REALLY SOFT AND SMOOTH! Even after washing my hands they stayed the same and the smoothness continued throughout the entire day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply every night so I can have the smoothness all day everyday. This product is great and the tin last a long time. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I work with my hands all day, and this lotion is the only thing that holds them together. It is my friend.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really comment on the quality of the product because of the strong smell. I put this on and my wife made me go wash my hands, she hates the smell. I&#x27;m not loving it either.</li>
            <li> I picked up a can of Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve on a whim in the hopes that it would be as good as their amazing beeswax lip balm. I have constant dry hands, probably from washing them too often and using hand sanitizer. I am forever putting on lotion but that doesn&#x27;t do much good. After a couple of days using the Hand Salve, the difference is night and day. My hands are actually soft again! Once a day before bedtime and I no longer have to worry about applying lotion five to six times a day. Burt&#x27;s Bees nailed it with this one!</li>
            <li> I used bag balm for years to protect my hand at the start of the day, but this product keeps my cuticles soft. and no lanolin.</li>
            <li> My hubby &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; by college daughter&#x27;s Burt&#x27;s Bees Hand Salve, as his hands were incredibly dry from working outdoors in cold weather.  Then, he said order more for her, as she complained about NOT getting it back. Ha Ha!  He loved the product so much so I bought the 2-pack.  My hubby gave one to his best friend and fellow co-worker and now everyone&#x27;s hands are all doing well.  This is a fantastic product for trouble hands or keeping them trouble free in the first place.  BTW, I recently bought two more for me and ...</li>
            <li> I love lavendar, rosemary but not a big fan of eucalyptus. Still, the fragrance is soothing and calming. My hubby likes the smell  when I wear it just before going to bed. I guess it puts us to sleep :-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels a bit oily when applying. But absorbs super quick and it isn&#x27;t greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Nice protection for hands especially in winter. It can provide moisture and can keep water for a long time and good smell.</li>
            <li> I love it; my daughter loves it; everyone love it;&lt;br /&gt;I love it; my daughter loves it; everyone love it;</li>
            <li> Feels greasy going on and within seconds is absorbed and non-greasy. I have been using this for years and as old person it really protects and heals dry hands.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product</li>
            <li> I wash my hands a ton and as a result, they are super dry and can get cracked.  This hand salve is the best product i&#x27;ve ever tried and I have tried many!  It is quite greasy so I only use it at night before I go to bed.  Even my husband loves it!</li>
            <li> Upon receiving this product I used it immediately as my hands and fingers were painfully chipped and cracked due to the extreme cold weather in which I live. Within two hours I felt a sense of relief. The following day, the results were amazing. Good price as well!</li>
            <li> We are always happy with the hand salve, it&#x27;s a great product and your hands will feel great after usuing.</li>
            <li> Great product, heals skin and extra moisturizing. Nice cooling feeling when applied. I would recommend, initial smell is alittle strong but fades quickly.</li>
            <li> My daughter&#x27;s hands are always dry.  In fact, they often crack and bleed, particularly in the winter and because her elementary school educators are a little overzealous about the use of hand sanitizer.  She&#x27;s not crazy about the smell of BB&#x27;s hand salve as it does have a strong eucalyptus odor but agrees to put up with it because the other drugstore brand hand lotions hurt her hands when they&#x27;re that dry.  I&#x27;m just glad that applying it to her hands doesn&#x27;t make her cry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stuff&#x27;s pricey but worth it.  You don&#x27;t need a lot for it to be effective.  One tin lasted our family of three a whole winter.</li>
            <li> being a guy a generally don&#x27;t use any lotions or really had the need to, until I started working in retail sales. Constantly shaking strangers hands in the winter meant constantly washing my hands and using hand sanatizer. The soap at my work was so strong it smelt like ammonia. When I first started working at this locations it was so strong I thought I had gotten cat piss on my hands from cleaning the litter box. After a few months my hands started cracking, drying up, and turning into scaly rough patches on the tops and between my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife bought this stuff for me when my hands started cracking. At first the smell was kinds strong and I didn&#x27;t like the greasiness of it. I tried it one time and put it down for a couple weeks. Then after my hands kept getting worse I picked it up again and really rubbed the stuff in. My hands are almost 90% healed after a couple of applications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% natural, yes if you can read the ingredients it is usually better for you. It smells like lavender(not the best but not bad), and not like strawberry melon kiwi chemical stew lotion(Usually smells good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a man I don&#x27;t like my hands smelling like girl lotion, this is a great product for men. Any of the lavender smell goes away with in 30 minutes. It is greasy but it is so good I only need to put it on at night when I am not doing anything with my hands. Honstly after day three you probly wont even need it any more you hands will be back or close to normal.</li>
            <li> You can;t go wrong with Burt&#x27;s Bees!  I buy this brand for my daughter-in-law on a regular basis. She likes the purity of the product.</li>
            <li> I buy it for my wife. She love it so much. I think she will be happy when receive these items.</li>
            <li> While Burt&#x27;s Bees works well on hands chapped after a day of outside work, it works even better if you treat your hands before you go outside (as per the directions).  This has completely eliminated cracked and broken skin as well as stopped any severe chapping even while working in humidities in the low teens.</li>
