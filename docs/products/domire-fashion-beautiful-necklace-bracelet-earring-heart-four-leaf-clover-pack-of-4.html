            <li>Cute necklace, inexpensive</li>
            <li>The price is great, but the quality, not so much.</li>
            <li>These necklaces are okay, they look very very costume.  </li>
            <li>Yes, they look cheap and are from China but a good purchase if you like hearts of different colors that you won&#x27;t fear to lose if they fall off your neck.</li>
            <li>Not bad as gifts.</li>

            <li>Something small and dainty.</li>
            <li>but the white one was broke, and then the charms fell off the chain too easily, so I lost the hearts rather quickly, because they just fell off the chain.</li>
            <li>I can usually wait when I find a good deal, but these weren&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Exactly what we ordered only trouble is the chains quickly turn black.</li>
