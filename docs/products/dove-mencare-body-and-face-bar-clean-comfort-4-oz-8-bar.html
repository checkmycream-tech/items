    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Dove Men&#x27;s products are the best!</li>
            <li>What is it with all these wonderful fragranced soaps for men these days?  </li>
            <li>excellent product and meet what we buy.</li>
            <li>great addition to the Men + Care line of products.</li>
            <li>it is marketed to men, I think this is a great choice for both men and women.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is very nice.  </li>
            <li>Good price and product.</li>
            <li>Once in use, the smell does not linger on the skin so that is a good thing from my point of view.  </li>
            <li>They smell nice and work great.</li>
            <li>Dove Men+Care Bar, &amp;#34;Clean Comfort&amp;#34; is a very good soap that has a moderately strong scent for a Dove product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;So--for its anti-drying properties, effective cleaning, and pleasant scent: 5 stars</li>
            <li>for man, woman, or undefined, it&#x27;s a good soap that moisturizes and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>this soap is amazing on my skin</li>
            <li>great product, great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li>It has a nice pleasing scent to it.</li>
            <li>It was a nice color.</li>
            <li>She liked it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort bars appear to work just as great.</li>
            <li>Although the scent is strong, it is pleasant and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The scent is light and pleasant and not at all feminine.  </li>
            <li>The girls in the office liked the smell more than the guys.  </li>
            <li>Nice and smooth and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li>The first thing I always check with soaps is the smell and this one has a great smell that lasts hours after using in the shower.</li>
            <li>The second best thing is that it lathers up great without having to use the whole bar of soap to use in your washcloth to wash your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think many ladies would probably like it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, many will still say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;, so another possibility is to use two bars.</li>
            <li>Maybe up to 2x if I was in a pampering mood :)</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this soap.</li>
            <li>what the scent is, but I LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I have always liked Dove bar soaps and the Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort is now my favorite.</li>
            <li>soap is very smooth, the smell is good, slightly masculine in it&#x27;s scent, but</li>
            <li>The soap cleans well, and rinses easily.</li>
            <li>Mostly, it just smells clean.  </li>
            <li>It’ glides across the skin easily.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Instead, I felt clean, my skin felt moisturized, and I enjoyed the scent of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They lathers well, cleans well and rinses off easily.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>How many people would feel comfortable using the bar on their face after it went through a full body wash?</li>
            <li>The scent is mild, more musky than floral, hence the appropriateness as a &amp;</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t too strong or too light.</li>
            <li>advertised, it is nice and gentle on the face (avoid contact with eyes)</li>
            <li>Like all Dove products, this soap is effective but also gentle on your skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s primary job.  </li>
            <li>These bars have an intriguing fresh scent that is neither perfumy nor floral, but more masculine and pleasant.</li>
            <li>My older son, Duckboy, liked it.  </li>
            <li>This is a high quality product - just not something I liked.</li>
            <li>He tells me that he feels really clean after using this with no sort of film or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This Men + Care soap has a clean smell and rinses with ease.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin feeling clean but not stripped of oils.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a clean smell that can go either way.  </li>
            <li>I went ahead and tried it myself and it did give me a clean feeling.  </li>
            <li>It’s called “Clean Comfort”.  </li>
            <li>Overall, these are great soap bars at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The bar is solid in the hand, with a good grip, and maintains rigidity.</li>
            <li>It was soft and silky and gave a nice lather.</li>
            <li>It almost feels like it desperately wants to smell fresh and clean, but it not quite sure how to do it.</li>
            <li>I felt clean and fresh after using this soap.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, clean scent that is not too overpowering and does not smell like aftershave.</li>
            <li>It also lathered a bit better and left my skin feeling a bit more moisturized.</li>
            <li>It also has a nice curve to it with no rough edges.  </li>
            <li>I’ve always liked Dove soap, but I really like it now that they make new varieties for men.  </li>
            <li>Only reason to give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it gets kind of soggy and leaves a lot of soap residue on the shelf.</li>
            <li>It is slightly masculine, and not &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; like many Dove products.</li>
            <li>really nice clean smell and does&#x27;nt dry my skin out.</li>
            <li>The color, while nice enough, seems a bit of a stretch.  </li>
            <li>It is not singularly masculine or feminine it is rather more of a strong clean scent reminiscent of vanilla and fabric softener which dissipates quickly after bathing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Clean Comfort bar has a bit more “perfumey” smell to it that the Deep Clean Bar – I did not like it all that much.</li>
            <li>Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Clean Comfort fragrance has a very fresh scent that is similar to lemongrass and sandalwood, with just a hint of spice.  </li>
            <li>The bar did last more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More so with this bar, with the extra moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Unlike other soaps I have purchased with a &amp;#34;fresh and clean&amp;#34; scent, this one came off as more perfume-like than simply clean.  </li>
            <li>, I will continue to use the Deep Clean soap, but will not buy the Clean Comfort bar</li>
            <li>The soap itself lathers up nicely and rinses away cleanly (although, like nearly every other bar soap, it does leave a bit of a residue on the bathtub).  </li>
            <li>Nice big bars that smell nice and last a long time.</li>
            <li>Dove has long been a favorite of consumer magazines because of its moisturizing qualities, and I have to agree.  </li>
            <li>So I found it odd that this soap has a strong floral scent that filled the bathroom (and some of the hallway) upon opening it.  </li>
            <li>But if you take it easy and keep it elevated in the soap dish, or use a wire grid type shower caddy, it will last as long as most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It’s strong enough, but not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>It cleaned very well without residue.</li>
            <li>I really like Dove&#x27;s Bar soap, specifically the ones that are marketed at Men.  </li>
            <li>I also like that they are gentle and moisturizing on the face.</li>
            <li>Both the male and female in the household tried the soap and liked it.</li>
            <li>The shape is nice enough, but not that big a deal since we are washcloth people (we soap the cloth and then our bodies), but it does give a decent grip.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the appearance was nice enough and it seemed to do a decent job in the soap department -</li>
            <li>Sure, one could use one side for the face, and the other for the body.</li>
            <li>Deep Clean 4 ounce,</li>
            <li>If you’re a man, you’re allowed to simply smell clean.  </li>
            <li>It is curved to make it easy to handle with wet hands and to help keep it from getting waterlogged.</li>
            <li>But this adds more bathing complications or perhaps not enough space for multiple bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing I can think of that would make me like it even better is if the bars were larger.  </li>
            <li>This brand’s moisturizing body wash is a product we regularly use, and other than the stronger fragrance and the bar format it seems to be equally effective as the liquid.</li>
            <li>The shape of this bar is an oval squared off rather than oval with round edges, I guess this is more manly.</li>
            <li>daughter took a little convincing because the soap does say the word &#x27;men&#x27; right on the bar, but she finally braved herself to try washing her hands with it.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap, as it has a very subtle fragrance, and leaves me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>The bar itself is small enough to fit comfortably in my smallish hand, unlike some “men’s” soaps.  </li>
            <li>light blue bar is the usual curved Dove shape that fits well in your hand and leaves your skin feeling clean without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>This makes it a more universal and gender neutral scent than other soaps marketed to men.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>The Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort Bar is the second bar soap I’ve recently tried from Dove.</li>
            <li>I also recently tried the Dove Men+Care Body + Face Bar Deep Clean soap.</li>
            <li>It seems to be lasting every bit as long as his previous soaps, so it is definitely a good value.</li>
            <li>Perhaps of the most importance to us, they don&#x27;t dry the skin excessively like other soap bars, including premium bars that cost much more.</li>
            <li>However, my skin almost felt irritated by the Clean Comfort bar, and I was not happy with the results as much as the Deep Clean bar.</li>
            <li>He has been pleased with the formula in this soap for men as opposed to my regular Dove, which is a little too moisturizing for him.  </li>
            <li>My sensitive skin had no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin soft and refreshed after each use.  </li>
            <li>So far, no one has mistaken me for</li>
            <li>After showering, my skin feels lady soft with no dryness.  </li>
            <li>, I couldn&#x27;t really notice a difference between it and a basic facewash.</li>
            <li>Going back to the Extra Fresh Dove for Men.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts about as long as other 4oz to 5oz bar soaps that I previously used, so perhaps a mild advantage when comparing to 5oz bars, but then again, most people buy soap by the number of bars or the package, not by weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; soaps I have tried have been subtle and nondescript.  </li>
            <li>One other thing I have noticed in other men&#x27;s soap is most of them now have those smell microbeads things, but this Dove Soap does not have those, so</li>
            <li>At some point, you can always transition the Face to the Body (so it doesn&#x27;t linger around for too long) and open a fresh bar for the face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a pale blue color and a more angular shape than the regular Dove bars.  </li>
            <li>It is masculine, but in a natural, inoffensive way that women will appreciate, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar produces a moderate lather and cleans well.  </li>
            <li>Clean Comfort is more expensive than the other styles.</li>
            <li>Has no fragrance at all like the Extra Fresh, leave it on the shelf and get any other variety of Dove Men&#x27;s Care bar soap.  </li>
            <li>While I didn&#x27;t like the soap that much, I generally reserve a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Previously I had been using the Deep Clean ones (red package,</li>
            <li>Despite this weird thing that manufacturers do nowadays of marketing gender neutral products only to specific genders, the Dove Men+Care soap is also good for women.  </li>
            <li>This variety has a rich and thick lather and the added cream in the bar</li>
            <li>Dove soaps in general are smoother than say something like Irish Spring.</li>
            <li>I have been using Dove for sensitive skin for a long time.</li>
            <li>It has 25% moisturizing cream, so it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling dry, just soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>all moisturizing soaps, it does tend to get soft, and if rubbed hard with a terrycloth washcloth, can wear away fairly fast.  </li>

            <li> The shape is nice enough, but not that big a deal since we are washcloth people (we soap the cloth and then our bodies), but it does give a decent grip.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the appearance was nice enough and it seemed to do a decent job in the soap department -</li>
            <li> Sure, one could use one side for the face, and the other for the body.</li>
            <li> Deep Clean 4 ounce,</li>
            <li> If you’re a man, you’re allowed to simply smell clean.  </li>
            <li> It is curved to make it easy to handle with wet hands and to help keep it from getting waterlogged.</li>
            <li> But this adds more bathing complications or perhaps not enough space for multiple bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing I can think of that would make me like it even better is if the bars were larger.  </li>
            <li> This brand’s moisturizing body wash is a product we regularly use, and other than the stronger fragrance and the bar format it seems to be equally effective as the liquid.</li>
            <li> The shape of this bar is an oval squared off rather than oval with round edges, I guess this is more manly.</li>
            <li> daughter took a little convincing because the soap does say the word &#x27;men&#x27; right on the bar, but she finally braved herself to try washing her hands with it.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap, as it has a very subtle fragrance, and leaves me feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> The bar itself is small enough to fit comfortably in my smallish hand, unlike some “men’s” soaps.  </li>
            <li> light blue bar is the usual curved Dove shape that fits well in your hand and leaves your skin feeling clean without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> This makes it a more universal and gender neutral scent than other soaps marketed to men.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort Bar is the second bar soap I’ve recently tried from Dove.</li>
            <li> I also recently tried the Dove Men+Care Body + Face Bar Deep Clean soap.</li>
            <li> It seems to be lasting every bit as long as his previous soaps, so it is definitely a good value.</li>
            <li> Perhaps of the most importance to us, they don&#x27;t dry the skin excessively like other soap bars, including premium bars that cost much more.</li>
            <li> However, my skin almost felt irritated by the Clean Comfort bar, and I was not happy with the results as much as the Deep Clean bar.</li>
            <li> He has been pleased with the formula in this soap for men as opposed to my regular Dove, which is a little too moisturizing for him.  </li>
            <li> My sensitive skin had no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin soft and refreshed after each use.  </li>
            <li> So far, no one has mistaken me for</li>
            <li> After showering, my skin feels lady soft with no dryness.  </li>
            <li> , I couldn&#x27;t really notice a difference between it and a basic facewash.</li>
            <li> Going back to the Extra Fresh Dove for Men.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts about as long as other 4oz to 5oz bar soaps that I previously used, so perhaps a mild advantage when comparing to 5oz bars, but then again, most people buy soap by the number of bars or the package, not by weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; soaps I have tried have been subtle and nondescript.  </li>
            <li> One other thing I have noticed in other men&#x27;s soap is most of them now have those smell microbeads things, but this Dove Soap does not have those, so</li>
            <li> At some point, you can always transition the Face to the Body (so it doesn&#x27;t linger around for too long) and open a fresh bar for the face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a pale blue color and a more angular shape than the regular Dove bars.  </li>
            <li> It is masculine, but in a natural, inoffensive way that women will appreciate, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar produces a moderate lather and cleans well.  </li>
            <li> Clean Comfort is more expensive than the other styles.</li>
            <li> Has no fragrance at all like the Extra Fresh, leave it on the shelf and get any other variety of Dove Men&#x27;s Care bar soap.  </li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t like the soap that much, I generally reserve a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Previously I had been using the Deep Clean ones (red package,</li>
            <li> Despite this weird thing that manufacturers do nowadays of marketing gender neutral products only to specific genders, the Dove Men+Care soap is also good for women.  </li>
            <li> This variety has a rich and thick lather and the added cream in the bar</li>
            <li> Dove soaps in general are smoother than say something like Irish Spring.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dove for sensitive skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> It has 25% moisturizing cream, so it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling dry, just soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> all moisturizing soaps, it does tend to get soft, and if rubbed hard with a terrycloth washcloth, can wear away fairly fast.  </li>

            <li> /&gt;There is a long list of ingredients printed on the outer wrapper but not on the individual soap boxes.</li>
            <li> Likewise, their were no negative skin-reactions to this product in our family (which is a small miracle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have been a Dove family for bar soap for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps it is because we typically use unscented as a family, but my personal soaps are scented and they are not similar to this.  </li>
            <li> Typically we purchase unscented and sensitive due to some skin issues that run in the family, but we thought that we might give this a try.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is just a run of the mill average bar of soap.</li>
            <li> We has been using Dove white bars for years and they cleans well without leaving the skin feeling dry and tight.</li>
            <li> Personally I am not picky on soaps, so if I was out of soap and had to buy an 8 pack, I would probably buy this if it was within 1.5x or less of the price of the typical brands (Irish Spring, etc).</li>

            <li> It isn&#x27;t harsh, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> and promotions go up and down, so I can&#x27;t compare those.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a particularly strong or lingering scent in any way.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s the usual avoid contact with eyes warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although saturated with fragrance it is hard to pinpoint its components.</li>
            <li> No good.</li>

            <li> if you hate those things, you will like this soap (though I feel cleaner with those little exfoliates included in the soap).  </li>
            <li> Sorry, but I’m not buying it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make me itch like the crap at Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It&#x27;s about damn time they started making this.</li>
            <li> Good price and product.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, as it has a very subtle fragrance, and leaves me feeling clean.  Only reason to give it 4 instead of 5 stars is that it gets kind of soggy and leaves a lot of soap residue on the shelf.</li>
            <li> great product, great price and fast delivery</li>
            <li> The Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort Bar is the second bar soap I’ve recently tried from Dove. I also recently tried the Dove Men+Care Body + Face Bar Deep Clean soap. [[ASIN:B00OMXW9HS Dove Men+care Body + Face Bar, Deep Clean 4 ounce, Pack of 10]] The Clean Comfort bar has a bit more “perfumey” smell to it that the Deep Clean Bar – I did not like it all that much. It also lathered a bit better and left my skin feeling a bit more moisturized. However, my skin almost felt irritated by the Clean Comfort bar, and I was not happy with the results as much as the Deep Clean bar. The bar did last more than a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end result, I will continue to use the Deep Clean soap, but will not buy the Clean Comfort bar again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** I upgraded the review to three stars from two. While I didn&#x27;t like the soap that much, I generally reserve a &amp;#34;2&amp;#34; rating for something poorly made. This is a high quality product - just not something I liked. Consequently I&#x27;m changing the rating to a &amp;#34;3&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> this soap is amazing on my skin</li>
            <li> Quotes from the man in my house follow...I have been using Dove for sensitive skin for a long time. The shape of this bar is an oval squared off rather than oval with round edges, I guess this is more manly. The scent is spicy and definitely not feminine so Dove nailed it in this area.I felt clean and fresh after using this soap. My sensitive skin had no adverse reaction.</li>
            <li> For me, the biggest difference between soaps marketed to men as opposed to the fairer sex is the scent.  Most &amp;#34;men&#x27;s&amp;#34; soaps I have tried have been subtle and nondescript.  So I found it odd that this soap has a strong floral scent that filled the bathroom (and some of the hallway) upon opening it.  Once in use, the smell does not linger on the skin so that is a good thing from my point of view.  If have sensitivities to smells, you probably will not want to try this scent un-smelled off the internet.  But as a soap, it does its job well.  It leaves my skin soft and refreshed after each use.  One other thing I have noticed in other men&#x27;s soap is most of them now have those smell microbeads things, but this Dove Soap does not have those, so if you hate those things, you will like this soap (though I feel cleaner with those little exfoliates included in the soap).  Overall, this is just a run of the mill average bar of soap.</li>
            <li> My husband likes to use bar soap for his shower when he has a choice.  He has been pleased with the formula in this soap for men as opposed to my regular Dove, which is a little too moisturizing for him.  He tells me that he feels really clean after using this with no sort of film or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; feeling afterwards.  The scent is light and pleasant and not at all feminine.  It seems to be lasting every bit as long as his previous soaps, so it is definitely a good value.</li>
            <li> Dove has long been a favorite of consumer magazines because of its moisturizing qualities, and I have to agree.  Your skin does not feel dry after using Dove Men+ and the scent is agreeable and not too floral, which is my only objection to standard Dove soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all moisturizing soaps, it does tend to get soft, and if rubbed hard with a terrycloth washcloth, can wear away fairly fast.  But if you take it easy and keep it elevated in the soap dish, or use a wire grid type shower caddy, it will last as long as most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So--for its anti-drying properties, effective cleaning, and pleasant scent: 5 stars</li>
            <li> Dove Men + Care Body and Face Bar in Clean Comfort fragrance has a very fresh scent that is similar to lemongrass and sandalwood, with just a hint of spice.  It is masculine, but in a natural, inoffensive way that women will appreciate, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar produces a moderate lather and cleans well.  It has 25% moisturizing cream, so it doesn&#x27;t leave the skin feeling dry, just soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a pale blue color and a more angular shape than the regular Dove bars.  It is curved to make it easy to handle with wet hands and to help keep it from getting waterlogged.</li>
            <li> Dove Men&#x27;s products are the best! The first thing I always check with soaps is the smell and this one has a great smell that lasts hours after using in the shower. The second best thing is that it lathers up great without having to use the whole bar of soap to use in your washcloth to wash your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great soap-would buy if you are thinking about it!</li>
            <li> Nice big bars that smell nice and last a long time. We&#x27;ve been using a bar for over a week and it&#x27;s still going strong. Nice and smooth and lathers nicely.</li>
            <li> Dove Men+Care Bar, &amp;#34;Clean Comfort&amp;#34; is a very good soap that has a moderately strong scent for a Dove product. Although the scent is strong, it is pleasant and not overpowering. It is slightly masculine, and not &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; like many Dove products. The soap cleans well, and rinses easily. It isn&#x27;t harsh, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. At about $1.15 a bar, it&#x27;s inexpensive too. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> What is it with all these wonderful fragranced soaps for men these days?  If you’re a women, I guess you have to smell like a flower or a fruit.  If you’re a man, you’re allowed to simply smell clean.  Sorry, but I’m not buying it.  I’m female and I use and like this soap.  So far, no one has mistaken me for a man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this soap reminds me of a milder version of Irish Spring with a hint of cologne in it.  Mostly, it just smells clean.  The soap itself lathers up nicely and rinses away cleanly (although, like nearly every other bar soap, it does leave a bit of a residue on the bathtub).  The bar itself is small enough to fit comfortably in my smallish hand, unlike some “men’s” soaps.  It also has a nice curve to it with no rough edges.  After showering, my skin feels lady soft with no dryness.  Recommended, regardless of gender.</li>
            <li> excellent product and meet what we buy. thanks</li>
            <li> really nice clean smell and does&#x27;nt dry my skin out.</li>
            <li> Dove soaps in general are smoother than say something like Irish Spring. More so with this bar, with the extra moisturizers. The bar is solid in the hand, with a good grip, and maintains rigidity. It has a distinctive non-subtle smell, but it is neither obnoxious nor objectionable, nor one of those marketing-inspired &amp;#34;man smells&amp;#34; (think Axe and such). I think many ladies would probably like it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts about as long as other 4oz to 5oz bar soaps that I previously used, so perhaps a mild advantage when comparing to 5oz bars, but then again, most people buy soap by the number of bars or the package, not by weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As advertised, it is nice and gentle on the face (avoid contact with eyes), I couldn&#x27;t really notice a difference between it and a basic facewash. The issue with face washing is on subsequent baths. How many people would feel comfortable using the bar on their face after it went through a full body wash? Sure, one could use one side for the face, and the other for the body. Still, many will still say &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;, so another possibility is to use two bars. One designated for the face, and one designated for the body. At some point, you can always transition the Face to the Body (so it doesn&#x27;t linger around for too long) and open a fresh bar for the face. But this adds more bathing complications or perhaps not enough space for multiple bars of soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a long list of ingredients printed on the outer wrapper but not on the individual soap boxes. There&#x27;s the usual avoid contact with eyes warning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prices and promotions go up and down, so I can&#x27;t compare those. Personally I am not picky on soaps, so if I was out of soap and had to buy an 8 pack, I would probably buy this if it was within 1.5x or less of the price of the typical brands (Irish Spring, etc). Maybe up to 2x if I was in a pampering mood :)</li>
            <li> Clean Comfort is more expensive than the other styles. Stick with the other styles.</li>
            <li> This Men + Care soap has a clean smell and rinses with ease. It leaves skin feeling clean but not stripped of oils. Likewise, their were no negative skin-reactions to this product in our family (which is a small miracle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who are keeping Kosher or those who are vegan/vegetarian, Dove does not promise that these bars are either. So, do purchase accordingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great addition to the Men + Care line of products.</li>
            <li> Like all Dove products, this soap is effective but also gentle on your skin. The scent is mild, more musky than floral, hence the appropriateness as a &amp;#34;man&#x27;s soap&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s not a particularly strong or lingering scent in any way.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this soap. I got it for my husband, but all of us have been using it. It has a nice pleasing scent to it. It wasn&#x27;t too strong or too light. It was soft and silky and gave a nice lather. It cleaned very well without residue. It was a nice color. I have no complaints about it at all and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> The girls in the office liked the smell more than the guys.  It&#x27;s a clean smell that can go either way.  I went ahead and tried it myself and it did give me a clean feeling.  My older son, Duckboy, liked it.  My younger son is a soap bar snob and would rather do the body wash; anti-barite.  It didn&#x27;t make me itch like the crap at Bath &amp; Body Works.</li>
            <li> I have no idea what the scent is, but I LOVE it.  It’s called “Clean Comfort”.  It’s strong enough, but not overpowering.  The soap itself is very nice.  It’ glides across the skin easily.  It’s “creamy”, for lack of another way to explain it.  I’ve always liked Dove soap, but I really like it now that they make new varieties for men.  The only thing I can think of that would make me like it even better is if the bars were larger.  If they doubled the size, I’d be even happier.</li>
            <li> I really like Dove&#x27;s Bar soap, specifically the ones that are marketed at Men.  Previously I had been using the Deep Clean ones (red package, has grain/beads in the soap as well).  These soap bars are about the same, 1/4 moisturizing cream, etc, but no exfoliating beads in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is very smooth, the smell is good, slightly masculine in it&#x27;s scent, but not enough scent to prevent your lady friend from using it.  Soap cleans well and does not irritate my skin or leave any residue.</li>
            <li> No good. Going back to the Extra Fresh Dove for Men.  This soap doesn&#x27;t make you feel like you even took a shower.  Has no fragrance at all like the Extra Fresh, leave it on the shelf and get any other variety of Dove Men&#x27;s Care bar soap.  Have no idea why Dove even made this soap, terrible.</li>
            <li> I have always liked Dove bar soaps and the Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort is now my favorite. It has a fresh, clean scent that is not too overpowering and does not smell like aftershave. This makes it a more universal and gender neutral scent than other soaps marketed to men.&lt;br /&gt;The light blue bar is the usual curved Dove shape that fits well in your hand and leaves your skin feeling clean without drying it out.&lt;br /&gt;While it is marketed to men, I think this is a great choice for both men and women.</li>
            <li> Both the male and female in the household tried the soap and liked it. Although saturated with fragrance it is hard to pinpoint its components. It is not singularly masculine or feminine it is rather more of a strong clean scent reminiscent of vanilla and fabric softener which dissipates quickly after bathing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The climate here, whether summer or winter is very dry so soap with added moisturizers is needed to maintain comfort. This variety has a rich and thick lather and the added cream in the bar helps prevent the skin from feeling tight and dry. This brand’s moisturizing body wash is a product we regularly use, and other than the stronger fragrance and the bar format it seems to be equally effective as the liquid.</li>
            <li> We have been a Dove family for bar soap for a long time.  Typically we purchase unscented and sensitive due to some skin issues that run in the family, but we thought that we might give this a try.  The shape is nice enough, but not that big a deal since we are washcloth people (we soap the cloth and then our bodies), but it does give a decent grip.  The color, while nice enough, seems a bit of a stretch.  Blue does not always equal boy.  Overall, the appearance was nice enough and it seemed to do a decent job in the soap department - it&#x27;s primary job.  Where it fell apart for us was the scent.  Unlike other soaps I have purchased with a &amp;#34;fresh and clean&amp;#34; scent, this one came off as more perfume-like than simply clean.  Perhaps it is because we typically use unscented as a family, but my personal soaps are scented and they are not similar to this.  It almost feels like it desperately wants to smell fresh and clean, but it not quite sure how to do it.</li>
            <li> Despite this weird thing that manufacturers do nowadays of marketing gender neutral products only to specific genders, the Dove Men+Care soap is also good for women.  I used it and was not struck by lightning.  Nor did I grow a beard or begin speaking like Barry White.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I felt clean, my skin felt moisturized, and I enjoyed the scent of the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter took a little convincing because the soap does say the word &#x27;men&#x27; right on the bar, but she finally braved herself to try washing her hands with it.  She liked it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for man, woman, or undefined, it&#x27;s a good soap that moisturizes and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> We has been using Dove white bars for years and they cleans well without leaving the skin feeling dry and tight. These Dove Men+Care Clean Comfort bars appear to work just as great. They lathers well, cleans well and rinses off easily. Perhaps of the most importance to us, they don&#x27;t dry the skin excessively like other soap bars, including premium bars that cost much more. These bars have an intriguing fresh scent that is neither perfumy nor floral, but more masculine and pleasant. I also like that they are gentle and moisturizing on the face. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dry and tight. Overall, these are great soap bars at a very reasonable price. They smell nice and work great.</li>
