            <li>I love I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the smooth look....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; as the Magic Smooth Souffle</li>
            <li>I love how quick to apply and smooth this blush is!  </li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly and stays on.</li>
            <li>It gives me the look of having taken a light jog.</li>
            <li>But I like how smooth it glides when I apply it on my cheeks</li>
            <li>I would recommend it for day or light wear.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t available)</li>
            <li>Love this so much, it&#x27;s light, creamy, and glides on exactly where you&lt;</li>
            <li>i absolutely love this blush, it works really well with my mousse foundation!</li>
            <li>I really like the light easy to blend texture.</li>
            <li>The number on the bottom that I originally ordered was 842, I love it, then I wanted similar color and ordered 2 others which came and are more of a whipped consistency which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
            <li>very nice pink</li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>This product goes on smooth and easy and it blends in to give that natural</li>

            <li>I was so glad to find this product still available since my local drugstore no longer carried it.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t seem to get just the right amount on my cheeks</li>
            <li>I should have picked a different color (the more plum one</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and fluffy and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This is a very light, rosy, glowing pink.</li>
            <li>It arrived before the expected date and was very securely packaged.</li>
            <li>This color won&#x27;t show up on really tan skin or darker complexion.</li>
            <li>and they came and are not the same as the original one I ordered</li>
            <li>recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I applied it this morning and it gives a very soft light pink glow.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, and you hardly need any at all; a dab of it is too much!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how to get the same consistency of the first one I ordered with the number 842 on the bottom which is a little heavier, not so light and shipped ?</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this to acne prone or sensitive skin though because it is quite greasy.  </li>
            <li>It goes on smoothe, natural and honeslty lasts all day.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and takes very little to do the job!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years prior to it becoming non-existent and it really beats expensive high end blush</li>

            <li> Flaky and strange consistency.</li>
            <li> It was just as expected.</li>
            <li> I previously had a Nars blush that cost $40, but this one works just as well.</li>
            <li> She loves this cream blush and had trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> It stays on for hours and gives my naturally pale skin the color I need</li>
            <li> It is like all container and very little product.</li>
            <li> It works, but it&#x27;s really no better than brush-on blush.</li>
            <li> I am sorry to see that it is not sold in our local stores any longer.</li>
            <li> Also the bottle is ridiculously small.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a cream blush anymore</li>
            <li> Hard to remove.</li>
            <li> (as always happens in the cosmetic game).  </li>
            <li> Product appeared to have been outdated as it was pulling away from the sides of the jar like it had lost moisture.</li>
            <li> so people won&#x27;t tell me I look ill.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed when it was discontinued</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seem to get just the right amount on my cheeks so I end up adding and/or wiping.  Also not as creamy as I thought it would be.  It works, but it&#x27;s really no better than brush-on blush.</li>
            <li> Bought this for Mom. She loves this cream blush and had trouble finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> I love how quick to apply and smooth this blush is!  It is easy to use, and you hardly need any at all; a dab of it is too much!</li>
            <li> The number on the bottom that I originally ordered was 842, I love it, then I wanted similar color and ordered 2 others which came and are more of a whipped consistency which I don&#x27;t like. So I ordered this one again, same number on bottom and 842 and they came and are not the same as the original one I ordered so now I have 4 of these creamy whipped blushes that I don&#x27;t like. I don&#x27;t know how to get the same consistency of the first one I ordered with the number 842 on the bottom which is a little heavier, not so light and shipped ? Any clue as to why the difference?  Anyone else noticed this?</li>
            <li> Product appeared to have been outdated as it was pulling away from the sides of the jar like it had lost moisture.</li>
            <li> I love this cream blush. Goes on smoothly and stays on.</li>
            <li> Love this creamy application.  Great color.  Stays all day.</li>
            <li> So beautiful! This is a very light, rosy, glowing pink. It goes on smooth and blends perfectly. It gives me the look of having taken a light jog. I think the texture and pigment is perfect.</li>
            <li> Color was too orange for my skin, but thats what happens when you buy makeup on line!</li>
            <li> I previously had a Nars blush that cost $40, but this one works just as well. It stays on for hours and gives my naturally pale skin the color I need so people won&#x27;t tell me I look ill.</li>
            <li> very nice pink,i use it as eyeshadow as well</li>
            <li> Seemed like it doesnt show everytime I put it on. But I like how smooth it glides when I apply it on my cheeks</li>
            <li> Love this so much, it&#x27;s light, creamy, and glides on exactly where you&lt;br /&gt;want to add blush. I&#x27;m fair skinned and the Cherubic Rose is the&lt;br /&gt;perfect shade for me. I will definitely stay with this product and&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Love the smooth look....</li>
            <li> Since Loreal stopped making this, I got it on Amazon. It was just as expected. However I found a similar product that Revlon makes in the shade Charmed Enchantment #150 that I like so I&#x27;m going to get that. It&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; as the Magic Smooth Souffle but it works. Why did they stop making this??</li>
            <li> This is a great product. When I gave up looking for it in stores, I was very pleased to find it on Amazon--at a fraction of the original price! And the product was still &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34; Yay!</li>
            <li> This product is great. I am sorry to see that it is not sold in our local stores any longer.</li>
            <li> I like the color and the texture.  It is very easy to apply.  I would not recommend this to acne prone or sensitive skin though because it is quite greasy.  Also the bottle is ridiculously small. It is like all container and very little product.</li>
            <li> It is so hard to find a cream blush anymore and I just love this one.  I was so disappointed when it was discontinued (as always happens in the cosmetic game).  It&#x27;s light and fluffy and I&#x27;m so glad to have found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Best blush I have ever used! I have been hunting and trying creme blushes for more than 50 years. Bingo!!!</li>
            <li> Flaky and strange consistency. Hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I really like the light easy to blend texture.</li>
            <li> This blush came in very good condition, exactly as described. It arrived before the expected date and was very securely packaged. I applied it this morning and it gives a very soft light pink glow. I would recommend both this product and the seller to anyone looking for inexpensive, but quality makeup products.</li>
            <li> I like it, has some shimmer to it btw, but it looks good on tan skin :)</li>
            <li> i absolutely love this blush, it works really well with my mousse foundation!</li>
            <li> Great item.  Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> Love the creamy feel.</li>
            <li> The texture of the blush is so soft and leaves a light &amp; smooth feeling on the cheeks. I would recommend it for day or light wear.</li>
            <li> This product goes on smooth and easy and it blends in to give that natural blushed look. The look that all women want!</li>
            <li> purchased it self where but had to go to amazon to find it again.  this is my second purchase.  i like it because it does not break up when traveling</li>
            <li> I was so bummed when I went searching for this product at drug stores--why do all the good things get discontinued??? I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years prior to it becoming non-existent and it really beats expensive high end blush you&#x27;d otherwise break your bank at Sephora or Ulta. I love I love this stuff. It goes on smoothe, natural and honeslty lasts all day. I think I ordered three of these. This color won&#x27;t show up on really tan skin or darker complexion.</li>
            <li> I like it. I should have picked a different color (the more plum one but it wasn&#x27;t available), still I like how this applies.</li>
            <li> I was so glad to find this product still available since my local drugstore no longer carried it.  It goes on smooth and takes very little to do the job!  Thanks!</li>
