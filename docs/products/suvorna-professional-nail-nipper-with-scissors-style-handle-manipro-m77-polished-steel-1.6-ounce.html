            <li> I had been search high and low for this type of cuticle \\&quot;nipper\\&quot;.  This one is perfect.  I got the shorter model too.  I recommend the 4\\&quot; over the 3\\&quot;...just easier to use.</li>

            <li> I was looking for a new cuticle clipper. I was never a fan of the typical style. When I saw this scissor style one I was very excited. I was even more thrilled after I used it for the first time. It is very well made!!! It is extremely sharp and cuts extremely well all those hard to grasp and reach pieces of skin with ease!!! I would definitely recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Love the scissor handles.</li>

            <li> Great workmanship. Highly recommend these. I plan on buying a second pair!&lt;br /&gt;These are the best nail nippers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> These are worth every penny.  The shape is perfect for managing those cuticles.  You will not be disappointed.  Everyone in my family uses them now.</li>
            <li> I think it is a good product. Thanks</li>
            <li> I owned a pair of these &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; cuticle scissors years ago and could not longer find them in stores.  I found them here, and they are the best!!  They are made EXTREMELY well and work just as good as they look!!! and a big bonus... they come in a box (if your gifting) and they have a great leather keeper for them!!! Ordered a second pair to give as a gift...</li>
            <li> I ordered this pair of nippers and another at the same time.  These are much better and offer a smoother scissor action.  I like the longer neck as it makes it easier to see the cuticle.  These are very comfortable in the hand</li>
            <li> Best ever! Very sharp and easy to control. Nice clean cut with no effort. Comes in a little faux leather cover. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> These arrived on time.  They do not work on my finger or toe nails.  They just don&#x27;t cut at all.  I will probably take them to Good will.</li>
            <li> They are very, very sharp, so a steady hand is needed to use these.  They are a really good product, if you have a steady hand.</li>
            <li> These are just like the Revlon ones my mom bought years ago. I&#x27;m so glad I found them! They are perfect!</li>

They come in a nice little case that keeps them protected. I use them daily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thinking of getting a second pair for back-up, though I don&#x27;t doubt these will last me for the rest of my days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I swear, if I want it, Amazon has it. I&#x27;m a very happy customer.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this would stand up against other clippers -- this is actually the only one I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  Very sharp, &amp; after a slight learning curve, LOVE it.</li>
