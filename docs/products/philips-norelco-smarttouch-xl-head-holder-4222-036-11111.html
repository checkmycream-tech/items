            <li>Be aware that there is a difference between the SmartTouch and SmartTouch XL shavers so parts for these models are not interchangeable.</li>

            <li>and I doubt new razors use them)</li>
            <li>so I thought I&#x27;d chance this new head so as to maybe use up the 4 sets remaining.</li>
            <li>Saved the cost of a new razor.</li>
            <li>My razor was getting very old and instead of the expense of buying a new one, I replaced the head holder and also purchased a set of blade sharpeners.</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell, this is OEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My old one was worn out after 4 years of use.</li>

            <li> Works really well.  Previously one cracked so one razor head would fall out occasionally.  Pricey, but replaced with this part and as good as new.</li>
            <li> First time replacing the heads and what a great surprise. Easy to install and the shave is better then the first time I ever used it. If you have your shaver over a year, do yourself a favor and replace your blades. It&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> I like it. It fits and works find with my Phillips Norelco Smart Touch . I would tell my friends to buy it if they need one.</li>
            <li> This replacement fit my 9160XL perfectly. As far as I can tell, this is OEM.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a great way to bring new life to my old razor. Replacement is easy and went smoothly. I&#x27;ve been using this now for a few weeks and its holding up great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Glad I was able to find this. Seems to be a weak point for Norelco shavers as at least one of the three floating head holders within the frame have failed over time on 3 different norelco shavers. I still like the Norelco design and was relieved to find a replacement VS tossing the shaver. The frame fit perfectly and works great!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!!!&lt;br /&gt;JS</li>
            <li> I was about to buy a new razor when I ran across this replacement part on Amazon.com.  After finding out it was what I needed for my model, I ordered it and it was perfect.  I love my older Norelco and this just extended the life of it.</li>
            <li> Made my razor just like new</li>
            <li> Just received and installed this new head for my Norelco shaver. The part fits perfectly since it appears to be an OEM part. Within 3 mins, my shaver was back up and working! Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> It was the exact match for my Norelco 9160XL Razor.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The construction was solid, and a good fit. My old one was worn out after 4 years of use. This replacement made it like new again.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and a quality OEM product. What more can I say? I struggled with buying a new shaver but this part was 20% of the cost of a new shaver</li>
            <li> I Like that because that part is fit for my shave and that order is accept where I love that :)</li>
            <li> This piece finally broke on me and I figured it was time to buy a new Norelco.  After researching the new models, I convinced myself that the old models were actually of better quality.  Thats when I went on Amazon and found this replacement part.  It fit right into my older Norelco and I haven&#x27;t looked back.  I am thrilled not to have to spend $200 on a new Norelco when it would offer me no new features to speak of.</li>
            <li> The piece arrived broken in 2 places. Since it&#x27;s plastic, the one that came with the shaver didn&#x27;t last that long. The little cylindrical rods that allow the heads to swivel/pivot wear out. Good for about a year if it doesn&#x27;t arrive broken.</li>
            <li> It was perfect for what i needed. The only negative aspect is it took about a month to receive the item.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a replacement for my aging holder. It is great and performed as expected. Highly recommended as being reliable and durable</li>
            <li> My razor was getting very old and instead of the expense of buying a new one, I replaced the head holder and also purchased a set of blade sharpeners. The battery was still taking a good charge so, it was like having a new electric razor!</li>
            <li> The head holder on my SmartTouch XL model 9190XL wore out after many years of use. This is an exact replacement part and while a bit expensive it adds life to my shaver which still works well and is cheaper than buying a new shaver.  Be aware that there is a difference between the SmartTouch and SmartTouch XL shavers so parts for these models are not interchangeable.</li>
            <li> The replacement part fits well and performs well. The OEM part lasted about ten years or so, and four years ago I bought 8-years worth of replacement HQ9 cutter heads at less than $20/set (they are now $40/set and I doubt new razors use them) so I thought I&#x27;d chance this new head so as to maybe use up the 4 sets remaining. Time will tell, but I think I have reason to be hopeful! I also just ordered the $11 retaining plate (locks the cutters within the head) while it&#x27;s still available, just in case.</li>
            <li> Perfect replacement for my old one.</li>
            <li> My Norelco razor slipped off the shelf onto the floor and broke the holder for the razor head. I wasn&#x27;t sure if I could find an exact replacement since the razor was over 8 years old. Checked on the internet and found the replacement holder available on several sites. Amazon was the cheapest and it shipped right away and I was back in business in 5 days from the time I dropped it. Saved the cost of a new razor.</li>
