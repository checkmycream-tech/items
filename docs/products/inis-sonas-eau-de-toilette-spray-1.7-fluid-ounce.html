            <li> My only complaint is Eau de Toilette only lasts a few hours.  </li>
            <li> It is just not a pleasant scent at all</li>
            <li> It stinks.  </li>

            <li> I did like this fragrance, and I thought for Eau de Toilette it had a good bit of staying power.  In the beginning the Lavender smell is rather strong but it soon powers down to a soft floral fragrance that I would not be afraid to wear in a crowd without offending anyone.  When I remove my clothes in the evening I can still smell the lingering floral smell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in love with this scent! Best purchase ever</li>
            <li> I enjoy all the fragrances of Ireland.  I had not known of this one.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I have just added another favorite to my collection.</li>
            <li> It has taken me years to find a perfume I could wear that would not aggravate my migraines but this is it! Lavender is of course it&#x27;s key ingredient and the fragrance is extremely soothing.  My only issue with the product is that the spraying mechanism did not work after a few pumps and the company would not exchange it. The bottle will not spray but I can still get the fragrance out so I&#x27;m content with the purchase and will reorder.</li>
            <li> Compliments, if you like lavender  this is the perfume for you! When I wear this perfume, I always get you smell good, what are you wearing!! I say its lavender, I wear it when going to the gym, because the scent gives me a lot energy..&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer&lt;br /&gt;Tamara</li>
            <li> Save yourself from trying this fragrance.  I love Connemara so I thought this would be along the same line.  It stinks.  It is just not a pleasant scent at all</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  Quick delivery. Great price.</li>
            <li> I am absolutely in love with this scent.  I get whiffs of it during the day when I am sitting at my desk.  It is a pure and clean lavender scent.  Love it !!</li>
            <li> I  went to Ireland a couple of years ago and I found the perfume INIS. I am so happy to have found this perfume and other fragrances available thru Amazon. These scents are light scented and not overwhelming to others!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this fresh Irish fragrance.  It is very unique! I dont have to worry about someone else wearing my signature scent as it is not found at the local mall.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, very original and fresh.  My only complaint is Eau de Toilette only lasts a few hours.  I would love this in a parfume.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of the lavender.</li>
            <li> My new favorite scent!!! I discovered Sonas while on vacation and stopped into an Irish shop. The 40.00 price tag led me immediately to amazon, where I found it for half price and free shipping. It arrived quickly, and I immediately tested it. It has such a subtle yet fragrantly relaxing scent, I already ordered a second bottle, which I might leave at work for a quick refresher. I dont find the lavender to be too over powering. My husband usually tells me straight away that he hates lavender and he actually thinks this smells pretty good. enough said!</li>
            <li> was not, what I had expected. smells more like astringent.  has no staying power within an hour no scent left. will use it around the house maybe.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product&lt;br /&gt;This is my fourth bottle.  Light fragrance not at all heavy and perfect for everyday</li>
            <li> When I first sprayed this perfume I wasn&#x27;t sure.  The first smell is a very strong lavender.  After a couple minutes, less than five, it smells like a soft floral fragrance like many of the other Garden of Ireland fragrances.  I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this perfume based on the description that it smelled like lavender.  I love lavender and have many items that smell like lavender, and this perfume is not one of them.  It smells overwhelming powdery and reminds me of an some discount perfume I can buy at a corner drugstore for a few dollars.  I sprayed it on my wrist and couldn&#x27;t wait to take a shower to scrub the smell off.  It also gave me a terrible headache.  I would not recommend anyone buy this, it smells bad.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it was Sold by Celtic Croft Dot Com llc they are fantastic I will be purchaseing my perfume from them for now on.</li>
