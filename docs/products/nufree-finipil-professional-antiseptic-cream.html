    <ol>
            <li> Absolute favorite product ever. Use it on the pubic region to fight off ingrown hairs.  I have also found use for it on my face with pimples. It seems to work instantly, starting with a cooling tingle. It is a cream so it can be a bit messy but a great overall product once a normal regiment is worked out. This product is a no brainer so the two tubes for the price only made sense as it is a great value. Will continue to use this product for any skin bumps or raises.</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;m glad I took a shot even when I initially thought two bottles this size at the great price I paid was almost too good to be true.  Normally I was paying more for a single smaller bottle at a beauty supply store than what I did here.  Fast shipping, great communication, great price.  A real steal.  As for the product itself, I&#x27;ve used Finipil for years and I continue to purchase it because it is just that effective.  It stunts the growth of all unwanted hair including the thick, dark hormonal kind, and, having many other uses, it is quite versatile.  I apply this to target areas with my night lotion and after I wax.</li>
            <li> I love this product after waxing!  I wish it would come in larger tubes, however.</li>
            <li> Perfect for after waxing to ensure no rash or ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> I am still on my first tube, but this product has exceeded my expectations.  It worked from the very first application.  No more razor irritation at all.  It even worked on a blemish.  I would definitely recommend this product and plan to purchase again.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it everytime after my waxing.</li>
            <li> Great product and awesome price from my seller! This product is awesome to help keep your bikini area smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> This cream is magical I higly recomend it.</li>
            <li> bought this but not for what it is intended for and it works great.</li>
            <li> I had to buy this after I had my eyebrows waxed. The esthetician dabbed some on an inflamed blemish and it immediately improved.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It worked for me, no problems at all. I will deff keep buying this. It helped with shaving bumps, within mins and it was my first time using it.</li>
            <li> Great product and excellent service</li>
            <li> Does what it says. Calmed my skin after using hard wax.&lt;br /&gt;(That stripless wax that&#x27;s like pulling melted plastic.) Was extremely red til I used my lotion stuff.</li>
            <li> Doesnt seem to work for me</li>
            <li> This was recommended by the spa after my wife&#x27;s bikini wax.  It really calmed her skin down after the waxing and provided her instant relief.  She says it is a great product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF! As others have stated, it does exactly what it claims to do. I have mild Rosacea and some adult acne. This product calms my skin and make it look smooth.</li>

            <li> This really helps with reducing ingrown hair, but not completely for me.</li>
            <li> Use it after waxing and slows hair growth. Was recommended by esthetician for antibacterial purposes and slowing if hair growth. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Used to luv this stuff, but seems more I use it, the less it works.</li>
            <li> excellent product!  quick shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff does exactly what it says it does. It is my new can&#x27;t live without product. Razor bumps...no more, ingrown hairs....a thing of the past.  I even use it on pimples and they disappear in 2 days. I highly recommend this if you experience any of these issues, totally worth the money.</li>
