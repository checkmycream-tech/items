            <li>:-D</li>
            <li>Gradual self Tanner is one of the best self tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>but it was very pleasant and</li>
            <li>A very good product, no orange-tones anymore.</li>
            <li>I am very fair.</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I am a very fair skinned bodybuilder.</li>
            <li>a very fair person-</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very fair and have a rosy undertone to my skin</li>
            <li>Beautiful beachy scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great product for the spring and summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Suave gradual self tanner is a great way to get sun kissed skin without overdoing it and looking like an orange.</li>
            <li>This worked great.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so happy with this sunless tanner.</li>
            <li>I am more than happy with this self tanner!</li>
            <li>I am very light skin so this fair medium is perfect for me.</li>
            <li>It did smell good though</li>
            <li>This lotion is really a good product.  </li>
            <li>To start Suave Professionals Gradual Self Tanner has a delightful light scent.</li>
            <li>But I thought it was a good consistency for applying on my skin.</li>
            <li>and I had the option of FAIR TO MEDIUM, and MEDIUM TO TAN.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely fair and after just one application I looked tan and healthier.</li>
            <li>If you have fair skin</li>
            <li>Sensational product for the value;</li>
            <li>It just isn&#x27;t a credible color for very fair skin.</li>
            <li>Price is right and product is perfect.</li>
            <li>I waited and then used the darker shade and was much more successful in obtaining the tan I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>By the way, I use the lotion for fair-medium skin, and it&#x27;s perfect for a tan that exactly matches my tanned skin color.  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>so i was pretty impressed it worked.</li>
            <li>- I am quite pleased with it!</li>
            <li>The smell of this is much better!</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I was pretty impressed with Suave&#x27;s gradual self-tanner here.</li>
            <li>Maybe this Summer Suave will help me turn a color darker than vanilla (healthily, of course)!</li>
            <li>The first thing that I liked was the scent, it&#x27;s very pleasant</li>
            <li>They honestly can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a very gradual tanning lotion, so you don&#x27;t need to be quite as perfect with your application as you might need to be with an overnight tanner.</li>
            <li>As good or better than as any bronzerand cheaper</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a nice gradual color from this</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;T apply in your steamy bathroom, or when you are warm from the shower/bath, or when perspiring, the self tanner will streak.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;</li>
            <li>It goes on smoothly and leaves a nice pleasant glow when used sparingly.</li>
            <li>Salt and sugar scrubs work the best, being sure to scrub really well around the knees, ankles and elbows.</li>
            <li>The gradual tanning is nice, because I can control it better, both color-wise and application-wise.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and plan to use it throughout the summer for a nice glow.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>You can easily see why I wanted a product that would even out my skin tone and give my legs a healthy-looking glow!  </li>
            <li>The scent is fine - and I&#x27;m not one to tolerate anything to smelly!  </li>
            <li>VERY light on foot ankles and kness.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>From then on, I make sure I am not going to need socks on the days when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had better luck with the medium -tan product.</li>
            <li>I love this Suave self tanner -</li>
            <li>color is also really nice, and looks like a light, glow-y tan.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried the top shelf self tanners.</li>
            <li>product has some upsides-&lt;br /&gt;It smells better than the Jergens.</li>
            <li>This helps moisturize those areas since they tend to absorb the tanner even more than the rest of the skin, and helps prevent from them getting darker than the areas around them, which can happen with self tanning</li>
            <li>Every spring I try a self-tanner, hoping it will work better than the dozens I have tried before.  </li>
            <li>Self tanner, especially this one, is a redhead&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li>, it didn&#x27;t discolor my palms or and my knees looked ok.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve been able to find it</li>
            <li>and I must say I love it</li>
            <li>Theres better.</li>
            <li>Forget any preconceived ideas about Suave being an inexpensive brand, because this Suave self-tanning lotion is pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li>but I also have pretty fair skin.</li>
            <li>It was not gradual enough on a very fair person.  </li>
            <li>Great moisturizer as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li>Both colors do a great job of covering the blemishes on my legs and leaving me feeling healthy, pretty and ready for my summer clothes!  </li>
            <li>Both colors do a great job of covering the blemishes on my legs and leaving me feeling healthy, pretty and ready for my summer clothes!  </li>
            <li>My skin is fair, but this did not darken it that much.</li>
            <li>lotion is pleasant, and the best part is, the self-tan just kind of shows up throughout the day, as if you were a film negative just gently turning gold.</li>
            <li>As with most self tanners, I get the best results by being sure to exfoliate really well before starting.</li>
            <li>I easily tan on shoulders and arms, and noticeably do not tan on my legs.  </li>
            <li>This may be good for someone who already has some color, but for a person that&#x27;s pale, beware, because every imperfection shows up with great detail.</li>
            <li>This is the stuff:  goes on smoothly, has a pleasant scent, leaves you a shade darker (a normal shade) than before.  </li>
            <li>You receive a generous amount, in an easy to dispense tube, and the product goes on lightly and silkily, not greasily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I am just fine with that.</li>
            <li>so I have light to medium skin color.</li>
            <li>Please note, it is important to rinse hands thoroughly after applying to keep them from having residual coloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li>This really feels nice on the skin and keeps you moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It always looks smooth and tan.  </li>
            <li>Lightly apply to knees, ankles and elbows - these areas tend to concentrate the tanner and will look darker if you don&#x27;t use less.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still have to apply  lightly or end up with orange steaky spots.</li>
            <li>B001UTK76C Jergens Natural Glow Firming Moisturizer, Fair to Medium</li>
            <li>The tan color is pretty and believable, and</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far my most favorite self tanner, and I will be using it all summer.  </li>
            <li>The scent wasn&#x27;t too strong, and it was absorbed into my skin evenly.  </li>
            <li>Plus the price is right!</li>
            <li>/&gt;While this didn&#x27;t work well for me because of the uneven tanning, it could be because of my skin type, which is very fair.</li>
            <li>I am seeing a lovely gentle tan from four days of use.</li>
            <li>For anyone who wants a healthy glow without looking orange.</li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t expect the tan to look like you just came off a weeks vacation at the beach, you will look better than your pallid current self, but no product can give you a fabulous tan better than the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li>skin is fair white with a cool undertone.</li>
            <li>Felt pretty good, dried quickly, and made my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing the nice tan tone you receive when applying everyday.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>and then super tan</li>
            <li>All self-tanners have a scent but this one was mild and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this sunless tanner and will continue to use this in the future.</li>
            <li>I will totally be getting more of this!</li>
            <li>It gives you an amazing tan that looks like you been outside tanning or in the tanning bed, no one will know you got it from a bottle.</li>
            <li>Anyhow my upper arms and legs are getting a nice tan color with no lines or streaks along with lower legs and arms.</li>
            <li>This is far better.</li>
            <li>Once it is absorbed it does not rub off.</li>
            <li>I liked the color, but it rubbed off on sheets and clothes, even several days after you applied it.  </li>
            <li>Worth every nickel.</li>
            <li>I did wash my hands good after use &amp; was careful of my knees and elbows..</li>
            <li>But with a change in my daily transportation, I decided that it would be nice to even out my arms</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and works right into the skin.</li>
            <li>The MEDIUM TO TAN leg is a warm but light tan, while the LIGHT TO MEDIUM leg is a just a subtle touch darker than my natural skin tone, and mostly serves to create the illusion of a nice, even color on my entire leg.  </li>
            <li>The MEDIUM TO TAN leg is a warm but light tan, while the LIGHT TO MEDIUM leg is a just a subtle touch darker than my natural skin tone, and mostly serves to create the illusion of a nice, even color on my entire leg.  </li>
            <li>I can definitely see a darker result when using more product or more frequently.</li>
            <li>Friends asked if I had escaped for a long warm weather holiday.</li>
            <li>Tans nicely but still leaves that characteristic self-tanning smell.</li>
            <li>And it was TWO WEEKS before I was able to see the difference between my right and my left leg.  </li>
            <li>As a pale chick of Celtic extraction, every once in awhile I&#x27;ll go on a tear in search of the perfect self-tanner products, and they almost always turn me a gentle orange or are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Hard to accomplish living in the great Northeast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a self tanner that I was willing to use in the long term, but Suave seems to have addressed the most troubling issues of streaking and unnatural color, giving us a first rate product!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a self tanner that I was willing to use in the long term, but Suave seems to have addressed the most troubling issues of streaking and unnatural color, giving us a first rate product!  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a self tanner.</li>
            <li>I noticed color the first day.</li>
            <li>The most recent one that I used was [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I really like the color!  </li>
            <li>I bought the fair-medium and tried it on one lower leg first.  </li>
            <li>At first I didn&#x27;t feel like it was working</li>
            <li>The color was a bit peachy but it was ok, but I was definitely splotchy</li>
            <li>put more one the next night but awoke to find myself downright</li>
            <li>I have never had any luck at all with ANY self tanner, but I hoped this one might be different as they are getting better as  the years pass.  </li>
            <li>This is my first experience with tanning lotion - I have witnessed horror-experiences of others over the years (orange, streaky skin, ruined bedsheets and clothing, etc).</li>
            <li>I have been using self tanners for many years and have tried multiple brands.</li>
            <li>The only sensible thing  was to order both colors and try the Fair on my right leg and the Medium on my left leg.  </li>
            <li>While pale skin is gorgeous, sometimes you want to color up just a notch or two.  </li>
            <li>time I applied this, but didn&#x27;t really think about the fact that I had to leave right away.</li>
            <li>It goes on nice and evenly and does not have a funky smell like some other self tanners.</li>
            <li>When the tan first starts to appear, you will be able to see very light areas of imperfection, but it will be so subtle that it isn&#x27;t noticeable to people who aren&#x27;t looking for it.  </li>
            <li>a positive note</li>
            <li>Sadly, most self tanners that I&#x27;ve tried leave streaks, dark-and-light spots and aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like the smell much.</li>
            <li>I put on socks &amp; sneakers and was gone the whole day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This just never did darken as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First, this product tans VERY GRADUALLY.  </li>
            <li>With patience, you can fashion your tan one day at a time and end up with really even toned skin that gives no clue the color isn&#x27;t natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However, I was just amazed by how fast it faded away when not applying for a day or two.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know all the chemical processes but it would be even nicer if it didn&#x27;t fade so fast.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s a tanning lotion that creates a gentle tan not unlike the tans you get from the sun.  </li>
            <li>I really scrubbed and had no problems with staining this time.</li>
            <li>unless the occasion calls for it, it&#x27;s just too much and 2)</li>
            <li>This color was just too intense for me.  </li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>It built up gradually and the color was a nice shade, but there were a few streaky areas.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since I&#x27;m so fair, I applied it every other day until I got a light tan look and then have applied it every few days or so as my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; started to fade</li>
            <li>I have seen these new gradual tanning lotions for a while and was interested to give one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Price is better than some other brands of gradual tanners.</li>
            <li>It was a full week of regular use before I could tell that anything at all had been applied to my legs.  </li>
            <li>It is gradual, which I liked, since I don&#x27;t usually use this type of product.  </li>
            <li>Cool, the only problem is I look like I got out of the sauna and rolled around in the infield of a baseball field in the desert.</li>
            <li>I think it is more of a &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; problem and less of a Suave problem.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have the typical offensive odor that most sunless tanners have.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, but the texture is a bit thin if you are looking for something to moisturize with -</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>I had at one time purchased a high priced tanner that I don&#x27;t remember the name brand of.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li>I am pale, and it has given me a nice glow in a pretty short amount of time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>It also helps make it look a bit more natural with other people.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the color on my legs, after just a few times of use.</li>
            <li>This felt food enough going on, and I thought I&#x27;d really like it when I first used it.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product mostly on my legs, since they are so incredibly pale after the winter, as I transition into summer</li>
            <li>Had her wash my back to be sure I removed every bit of dry skin.</li>
            <li>like the gradual tanning feature because this has helped me avoid the most major drawback of self tanners, which is streaks, &amp;#34;missed spots&amp;#34; and areas that are too dark.  </li>
            <li>Although I liked this product because it has a nice moisturizer as a base, at the same time, it does take awhile for you to get the color right.</li>
            <li>I tried all the tricks - exfoliate first, let lotion dry completely for about 15 minutes before getting dressed, apply extra to the area that remained light -</li>
            <li>Therefore I was eager to try something new</li>
            <li>No streaking, no Jersey Shore cast orange, just a nice, subtle glow.  </li>
            <li>far I have been happier with this than those older sunless tanners I tried.</li>
            <li>What is also nice about it, is there is a subtle shimmer to the lotion that I have noticed in the sunlight.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is very little streaking and the color is not orange like most self Tanners.  </li>
            <li>I apply it the next morning, and 2 more mornings after that, until I get a color that I like, then I go to every other day, or every 2 days depending on how it looks.  </li>
            <li>It takes some time of using consistently to work, but once you do you will notice a definite glow.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and came back to this one after being satisfied last summer.</li>
            <li>No matter how expensive or how cheap, each made me some shade of orange, stained my hands/fingernails, and had a pretty distinct odor.</li>
            <li>It certainly helps when summer comes and your legs look like 2 white appendages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply with gloves, but the final effect is worth the extra trouble.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply with gloves, but the final effect is worth the extra trouble.  </li>
            <li>And although the color was darker and fairly natural looking (not orange), it was streaky.</li>
            <li>Also, it doesn&#x27;t fade as  naturally like jergens on  hands and feet.</li>
            <li>It has a soft feel on the skin.</li>
            <li>I use a big dollop about the size of a half-dollar coin for one whole leg.</li>
            <li>I like both the fragrance and the soft feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li>When I took them off that night, I noticed a sock line had developed around my ankle, as well as a bit of the texture pattern of the sock, in the color of the lotion.</li>
            <li>this can give you a relatively natural colour.</li>
            <li>It is gentle enough that I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li>The tan color that resulted was natural looking, not at all &#x27;orangey&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It really helped disguise some of the scrapes I had on my legs from a recent hike too.  </li>
            <li>it makes my legs feel very itchy the next day after I&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li>I also have sensitive skin on my legs (eczema) and have had no adverse reactions.</li>
            <li>It is very gradual, it took several days for me to notice a difference</li>
            <li>, that distinct odor is still present, but it&#x27;s not necessarily &amp;#34;bad.&amp;#34; Just odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That being said, this self tanner looked good, and didn&#x27;t make me look fake when I used it.  </li>
            <li>The second thing that I liked is that this is a lotion that gradually builds up to the desired results and it doesn&#x27;t cause streaking because of the subtle buildup.</li>
            <li>It takes a long while before the results show up on your skin, but when my legs finally started to &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; it was worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Several hours later I showed my lovely winter white legs to a co-worker, and she definitely noticed a difference, and said she also did not see the typical orange color present in many other</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t decided which I like better, but might end up using the lighter color since I don&#x27;t necessarily want a deep tan, just a little glow and even skin</li>

            <li>Lastly, the tan looks like a natural color and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>like the way the lotion feels when applying - not too thick, spreading easily.</li>
            <li>It also dried quickly, allowing me to use it before work when I am rushed.</li>
            <li>I have super pale skin, so I tried using the Fair-Medium version of this Suave self tanner.</li>
            <li>This will take practice to make the look fade in a natural way, leaving the soles of your feet and toenails clean and pink without an abrupt stop-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This will take practice to make the look fade in a natural way, leaving the soles of your feet and toenails clean and pink without an abrupt stop-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m noticing a difference in general.</li>
            <li>so I have generally steered away.</li>
            <li>you follow directions and are careful in smoothing it out and not trying to put too much on at once</li>
            <li>but I wouldn&#x27;t have spent that much again.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Such a bummer, but not worth the headache from powerful scent.</li>
            <li>the color is lighter than usual sunless tanners, it fades rather quickly, but about the time I&#x27;m noticing a fade, I am applying again anyway.</li>
            <li>, it is crucial to know that I am super pale.</li>
            <li>This has a nice &#x60;beachy&#x27; smell to it and does not give that awful orange tan that so many products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Suave self tanner is a nice, faintly scented lotion that will give your skin a sun kissed look after only a couple applications.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this a few mornings a week and really like it!</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong on tanned/olive skin but does look natural, especially in small doses.</li>
            <li>And though I did not notice an immediate change, after a few weeks of applying the lotion once every other day (on average - some days I was better about remembering it than others), they are about even.</li>
            <li>I have used several different self tanners, and have had good results, and bad results.  </li>

            <li> Gradual self Tanner is one of the best self tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> but it was very pleasant and</li>
            <li> A very good product, no orange-tones anymore.</li>
            <li> I am very fair.</li>
            <li> I have very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned bodybuilder.</li>
            <li> a very fair person-</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and have a rosy undertone to my skin</li>
            <li> Beautiful beachy scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product for the spring and summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Suave gradual self tanner is a great way to get sun kissed skin without overdoing it and looking like an orange.</li>
            <li> This worked great.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so happy with this sunless tanner.</li>
            <li> I am more than happy with this self tanner!</li>
            <li> I am very light skin so this fair medium is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> It did smell good though</li>
            <li> This lotion is really a good product.  </li>
            <li> To start Suave Professionals Gradual Self Tanner has a delightful light scent.</li>
            <li> But I thought it was a good consistency for applying on my skin.</li>
            <li> and I had the option of FAIR TO MEDIUM, and MEDIUM TO TAN.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely fair and after just one application I looked tan and healthier.</li>
            <li> If you have fair skin</li>
            <li> Sensational product for the value;</li>
            <li> It just isn&#x27;t a credible color for very fair skin.</li>
            <li> Price is right and product is perfect.</li>
            <li> I waited and then used the darker shade and was much more successful in obtaining the tan I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> By the way, I use the lotion for fair-medium skin, and it&#x27;s perfect for a tan that exactly matches my tanned skin color.  </li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> so i was pretty impressed it worked.</li>
            <li> - I am quite pleased with it!</li>
            <li> The smell of this is much better!</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I was pretty impressed with Suave&#x27;s gradual self-tanner here.</li>
            <li> Maybe this Summer Suave will help me turn a color darker than vanilla (healthily, of course)!</li>
            <li> The first thing that I liked was the scent, it&#x27;s very pleasant</li>
            <li> They honestly can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a very gradual tanning lotion, so you don&#x27;t need to be quite as perfect with your application as you might need to be with an overnight tanner.</li>
            <li> As good or better than as any bronzerand cheaper</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a nice gradual color from this</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;T apply in your steamy bathroom, or when you are warm from the shower/bath, or when perspiring, the self tanner will streak.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;</li>
            <li> It goes on smoothly and leaves a nice pleasant glow when used sparingly.</li>
            <li> Salt and sugar scrubs work the best, being sure to scrub really well around the knees, ankles and elbows.</li>
            <li> The gradual tanning is nice, because I can control it better, both color-wise and application-wise.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and plan to use it throughout the summer for a nice glow.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> You can easily see why I wanted a product that would even out my skin tone and give my legs a healthy-looking glow!  </li>
            <li> The scent is fine - and I&#x27;m not one to tolerate anything to smelly!  </li>
            <li> VERY light on foot ankles and kness.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> From then on, I make sure I am not going to need socks on the days when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had better luck with the medium -tan product.</li>
            <li> I love this Suave self tanner -</li>
            <li> color is also really nice, and looks like a light, glow-y tan.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried the top shelf self tanners.</li>
            <li> product has some upsides-&lt;br /&gt;It smells better than the Jergens.</li>
            <li> This helps moisturize those areas since they tend to absorb the tanner even more than the rest of the skin, and helps prevent from them getting darker than the areas around them, which can happen with self tanning</li>
            <li> Every spring I try a self-tanner, hoping it will work better than the dozens I have tried before.  </li>
            <li> Self tanner, especially this one, is a redhead&#x27;s best friend.</li>
            <li> , it didn&#x27;t discolor my palms or and my knees looked ok.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been able to find it</li>
            <li> and I must say I love it</li>
            <li> Theres better.</li>
            <li> Forget any preconceived ideas about Suave being an inexpensive brand, because this Suave self-tanning lotion is pretty good stuff.</li>
            <li> but I also have pretty fair skin.</li>
            <li> It was not gradual enough on a very fair person.  </li>
            <li> Great moisturizer as far as I am concerned.</li>
            <li> Both colors do a great job of covering the blemishes on my legs and leaving me feeling healthy, pretty and ready for my summer clothes!  </li>
            <li> Both colors do a great job of covering the blemishes on my legs and leaving me feeling healthy, pretty and ready for my summer clothes!  </li>
            <li> My skin is fair, but this did not darken it that much.</li>
            <li> lotion is pleasant, and the best part is, the self-tan just kind of shows up throughout the day, as if you were a film negative just gently turning gold.</li>
            <li> As with most self tanners, I get the best results by being sure to exfoliate really well before starting.</li>
            <li> I easily tan on shoulders and arms, and noticeably do not tan on my legs.  </li>
            <li> This may be good for someone who already has some color, but for a person that&#x27;s pale, beware, because every imperfection shows up with great detail.</li>
            <li> This is the stuff:  goes on smoothly, has a pleasant scent, leaves you a shade darker (a normal shade) than before.  </li>
            <li> You receive a generous amount, in an easy to dispense tube, and the product goes on lightly and silkily, not greasily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I am just fine with that.</li>
            <li> so I have light to medium skin color.</li>
            <li> Please note, it is important to rinse hands thoroughly after applying to keep them from having residual coloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because</li>
            <li> This really feels nice on the skin and keeps you moisturized.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It always looks smooth and tan.  </li>
            <li> Lightly apply to knees, ankles and elbows - these areas tend to concentrate the tanner and will look darker if you don&#x27;t use less.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still have to apply  lightly or end up with orange steaky spots.</li>
            <li> B001UTK76C Jergens Natural Glow Firming Moisturizer, Fair to Medium</li>
            <li> The tan color is pretty and believable, and</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far my most favorite self tanner, and I will be using it all summer.  </li>
            <li> The scent wasn&#x27;t too strong, and it was absorbed into my skin evenly.  </li>
            <li> Plus the price is right!</li>
            <li> /&gt;While this didn&#x27;t work well for me because of the uneven tanning, it could be because of my skin type, which is very fair.</li>
            <li> I am seeing a lovely gentle tan from four days of use.</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants a healthy glow without looking orange.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t expect the tan to look like you just came off a weeks vacation at the beach, you will look better than your pallid current self, but no product can give you a fabulous tan better than the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> skin is fair white with a cool undertone.</li>
            <li> Felt pretty good, dried quickly, and made my skin feel nice.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing the nice tan tone you receive when applying everyday.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> and then super tan</li>
            <li> All self-tanners have a scent but this one was mild and not unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this sunless tanner and will continue to use this in the future.</li>
            <li> I will totally be getting more of this!</li>
            <li> It gives you an amazing tan that looks like you been outside tanning or in the tanning bed, no one will know you got it from a bottle.</li>
            <li> Anyhow my upper arms and legs are getting a nice tan color with no lines or streaks along with lower legs and arms.</li>
            <li> This is far better.</li>
            <li> Once it is absorbed it does not rub off.</li>
            <li> I liked the color, but it rubbed off on sheets and clothes, even several days after you applied it.  </li>
            <li> Worth every nickel.</li>
            <li> I did wash my hands good after use &amp; was careful of my knees and elbows..</li>
            <li> But with a change in my daily transportation, I decided that it would be nice to even out my arms</li>
            <li> It is not greasy and works right into the skin.</li>
            <li> The MEDIUM TO TAN leg is a warm but light tan, while the LIGHT TO MEDIUM leg is a just a subtle touch darker than my natural skin tone, and mostly serves to create the illusion of a nice, even color on my entire leg.  </li>
            <li> The MEDIUM TO TAN leg is a warm but light tan, while the LIGHT TO MEDIUM leg is a just a subtle touch darker than my natural skin tone, and mostly serves to create the illusion of a nice, even color on my entire leg.  </li>
            <li> I can definitely see a darker result when using more product or more frequently.</li>
            <li> Friends asked if I had escaped for a long warm weather holiday.</li>
            <li> Tans nicely but still leaves that characteristic self-tanning smell.</li>
            <li> And it was TWO WEEKS before I was able to see the difference between my right and my left leg.  </li>
            <li> As a pale chick of Celtic extraction, every once in awhile I&#x27;ll go on a tear in search of the perfect self-tanner products, and they almost always turn me a gentle orange or are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to accomplish living in the great Northeast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a self tanner that I was willing to use in the long term, but Suave seems to have addressed the most troubling issues of streaking and unnatural color, giving us a first rate product!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a self tanner that I was willing to use in the long term, but Suave seems to have addressed the most troubling issues of streaking and unnatural color, giving us a first rate product!  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a self tanner.</li>
            <li> I noticed color the first day.</li>
            <li> The most recent one that I used was [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I really like the color!  </li>
            <li> I bought the fair-medium and tried it on one lower leg first.  </li>
            <li> At first I didn&#x27;t feel like it was working</li>
            <li> The color was a bit peachy but it was ok, but I was definitely splotchy</li>
            <li> put more one the next night but awoke to find myself downright</li>
            <li> I have never had any luck at all with ANY self tanner, but I hoped this one might be different as they are getting better as  the years pass.  </li>
            <li> This is my first experience with tanning lotion - I have witnessed horror-experiences of others over the years (orange, streaky skin, ruined bedsheets and clothing, etc).</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanners for many years and have tried multiple brands.</li>
            <li> The only sensible thing  was to order both colors and try the Fair on my right leg and the Medium on my left leg.  </li>
            <li> While pale skin is gorgeous, sometimes you want to color up just a notch or two.  </li>
            <li> time I applied this, but didn&#x27;t really think about the fact that I had to leave right away.</li>
            <li> It goes on nice and evenly and does not have a funky smell like some other self tanners.</li>
            <li> When the tan first starts to appear, you will be able to see very light areas of imperfection, but it will be so subtle that it isn&#x27;t noticeable to people who aren&#x27;t looking for it.  </li>
            <li> a positive note</li>
            <li> Sadly, most self tanners that I&#x27;ve tried leave streaks, dark-and-light spots and aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like the smell much.</li>
            <li> I put on socks &amp; sneakers and was gone the whole day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This just never did darken as much as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, this product tans VERY GRADUALLY.  </li>
            <li> With patience, you can fashion your tan one day at a time and end up with really even toned skin that gives no clue the color isn&#x27;t natural.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, I was just amazed by how fast it faded away when not applying for a day or two.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know all the chemical processes but it would be even nicer if it didn&#x27;t fade so fast.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tanning lotion that creates a gentle tan not unlike the tans you get from the sun.  </li>
            <li> I really scrubbed and had no problems with staining this time.</li>
            <li> unless the occasion calls for it, it&#x27;s just too much and 2)</li>
            <li> This color was just too intense for me.  </li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> It built up gradually and the color was a nice shade, but there were a few streaky areas.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since I&#x27;m so fair, I applied it every other day until I got a light tan look and then have applied it every few days or so as my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; started to fade</li>
            <li> I have seen these new gradual tanning lotions for a while and was interested to give one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Price is better than some other brands of gradual tanners.</li>
            <li> It was a full week of regular use before I could tell that anything at all had been applied to my legs.  </li>
            <li> It is gradual, which I liked, since I don&#x27;t usually use this type of product.  </li>
            <li> Cool, the only problem is I look like I got out of the sauna and rolled around in the infield of a baseball field in the desert.</li>
            <li> I think it is more of a &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; problem and less of a Suave problem.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have the typical offensive odor that most sunless tanners have.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, but the texture is a bit thin if you are looking for something to moisturize with -</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I had at one time purchased a high priced tanner that I don&#x27;t remember the name brand of.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> I am pale, and it has given me a nice glow in a pretty short amount of time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It also helps make it look a bit more natural with other people.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the color on my legs, after just a few times of use.</li>
            <li> This felt food enough going on, and I thought I&#x27;d really like it when I first used it.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product mostly on my legs, since they are so incredibly pale after the winter, as I transition into summer</li>
            <li> Had her wash my back to be sure I removed every bit of dry skin.</li>
            <li> like the gradual tanning feature because this has helped me avoid the most major drawback of self tanners, which is streaks, &amp;#34;missed spots&amp;#34; and areas that are too dark.  </li>
            <li> Although I liked this product because it has a nice moisturizer as a base, at the same time, it does take awhile for you to get the color right.</li>
            <li> I tried all the tricks - exfoliate first, let lotion dry completely for about 15 minutes before getting dressed, apply extra to the area that remained light -</li>
            <li> Therefore I was eager to try something new</li>
            <li> No streaking, no Jersey Shore cast orange, just a nice, subtle glow.  </li>
            <li> far I have been happier with this than those older sunless tanners I tried.</li>
            <li> What is also nice about it, is there is a subtle shimmer to the lotion that I have noticed in the sunlight.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is very little streaking and the color is not orange like most self Tanners.  </li>
            <li> I apply it the next morning, and 2 more mornings after that, until I get a color that I like, then I go to every other day, or every 2 days depending on how it looks.  </li>
            <li> It takes some time of using consistently to work, but once you do you will notice a definite glow.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and came back to this one after being satisfied last summer.</li>
            <li> No matter how expensive or how cheap, each made me some shade of orange, stained my hands/fingernails, and had a pretty distinct odor.</li>
            <li> It certainly helps when summer comes and your legs look like 2 white appendages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply with gloves, but the final effect is worth the extra trouble.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply with gloves, but the final effect is worth the extra trouble.  </li>
            <li> And although the color was darker and fairly natural looking (not orange), it was streaky.</li>
            <li> Also, it doesn&#x27;t fade as  naturally like jergens on  hands and feet.</li>
            <li> It has a soft feel on the skin.</li>
            <li> I use a big dollop about the size of a half-dollar coin for one whole leg.</li>
            <li> I like both the fragrance and the soft feel of this lotion.</li>
            <li> When I took them off that night, I noticed a sock line had developed around my ankle, as well as a bit of the texture pattern of the sock, in the color of the lotion.</li>
            <li> this can give you a relatively natural colour.</li>
            <li> It is gentle enough that I even use it on my face.</li>
            <li> The tan color that resulted was natural looking, not at all &#x27;orangey&#x27;.</li>
            <li> It really helped disguise some of the scrapes I had on my legs from a recent hike too.  </li>
            <li> it makes my legs feel very itchy the next day after I&#x27;ve applied it.</li>
            <li> I also have sensitive skin on my legs (eczema) and have had no adverse reactions.</li>
            <li> It is very gradual, it took several days for me to notice a difference</li>
            <li> , that distinct odor is still present, but it&#x27;s not necessarily &amp;#34;bad.&amp;#34; Just odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That being said, this self tanner looked good, and didn&#x27;t make me look fake when I used it.  </li>
            <li> The second thing that I liked is that this is a lotion that gradually builds up to the desired results and it doesn&#x27;t cause streaking because of the subtle buildup.</li>
            <li> It takes a long while before the results show up on your skin, but when my legs finally started to &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; it was worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Several hours later I showed my lovely winter white legs to a co-worker, and she definitely noticed a difference, and said she also did not see the typical orange color present in many other</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t decided which I like better, but might end up using the lighter color since I don&#x27;t necessarily want a deep tan, just a little glow and even skin</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t decided which I like better, but might end up using the lighter color since I don&#x27;t necessarily want a deep tan, just a little glow and even skin</li>
            <li> Lastly, the tan looks like a natural color and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> like the way the lotion feels when applying - not too thick, spreading easily.</li>
            <li> It also dried quickly, allowing me to use it before work when I am rushed.</li>
            <li> I have super pale skin, so I tried using the Fair-Medium version of this Suave self tanner.</li>
            <li> This will take practice to make the look fade in a natural way, leaving the soles of your feet and toenails clean and pink without an abrupt stop-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>

            <li> so I&#x27;m noticing a difference in general.</li>
            <li> so I have generally steered away.</li>
            <li> you follow directions and are careful in smoothing it out and not trying to put too much on at once</li>
            <li> but I wouldn&#x27;t have spent that much again.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Such a bummer, but not worth the headache from powerful scent.</li>
            <li> the color is lighter than usual sunless tanners, it fades rather quickly, but about the time I&#x27;m noticing a fade, I am applying again anyway.</li>
            <li> , it is crucial to know that I am super pale.</li>
            <li> This has a nice &#x60;beachy&#x27; smell to it and does not give that awful orange tan that so many products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Suave self tanner is a nice, faintly scented lotion that will give your skin a sun kissed look after only a couple applications.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this a few mornings a week and really like it!</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong on tanned/olive skin but does look natural, especially in small doses.</li>
            <li> And though I did not notice an immediate change, after a few weeks of applying the lotion once every other day (on average - some days I was better about remembering it than others), they are about even.</li>
            <li> I have used several different self tanners, and have had good results, and bad results.  </li>
            <li> If I use too much or too often, it does seem to become a bit on the orangey side, but that could be because my skin is pale</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, and this Suave doesn&#x27;t bother me like lots of other self tanners and/or lotions.  </li>
            <li> Because if medical reasons I can not be in the sun very long.  </li>
            <li> Using the gradual tanner, it&#x27;s far less noticeable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have also used this on my legs which get far less sun, and though the difference isn&#x27;t as noticeable as my arm, it has brightened up their color a bit,</li>
            <li> I have used more expensive brands in the past such as bare essentials etc.</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve learned my lesson, and have the pale skin to prove it, I really wanted that little hint of color, without doing further damage.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t want huge amounts of color from the get go because it just looks weird on</li>
            <li> It has that self-tanner tang to it, and on the days that I apply this lotion to my legs, I smell it on and off all day long.</li>
            <li> So, when this appeared as an orange color on my skin, I was not particularly surprised.</li>
            <li> and I have a good base color.</li>
            <li> This self-tanner takes longer to dry than others.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I experimented with several different self-tanners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done so much damage to my skin, since I was young &amp; stupid in the 80s, not caring at the time about using sunscreen, just wanting that fast color.  </li>
            <li> next morning I woke up and looking down at my feet</li>
            <li> I typically use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Sublime instant bronzing lotion but there are two things that I don&#x27;t like about it, 1)</li>
            <li> and this one compares favorably even with some of the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past</li>
            <li> It reminds me a little bit of the Jergens natural glow with how gradually it tans, although the color of the tan is a little darker.</li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL TO STOP APPLYING BEFORE YOU GET TO THE NAILS.  </li>
            <li> BE CAREFUL TO STOP APPLYING BEFORE YOU GET TO THE NAILS.  </li>
            <li> I have red hair and really pale skin</li>
            <li> One thing that makes this product hard to use is its white and goes on clear, so it&#x27;s hard to determine evenness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no streaks and there is no self tanner odor like some other self tanners out there.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Every other day or every two days is plenty.</li>
            <li> (one is darker than the other from driving).</li>
            <li> Not orange or dark bronze like some other  products.</li>
            <li> I have to admit, however, that this product has much less odor than any other gradual tanner that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product on two different days and hardly saw a difference in the color of my skin</li>
            <li> This gives you an opportunity to even out the bugs before the tan gets so dark that every imperfection is glaring.  </li>
            <li> , then on Tuesday morning you come in and are dark tan, everyone will know you got it from a bottle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has one down side.</li>
            <li> The scent is slightly floral and smells a lot like shampoo.</li>
            <li> After about 3 applications it gives skin a slight glow of a tan.</li>
            <li> I waited about a half hour, then sat on my recliner, took a nap in my underwear for about 3 hours, and when I woke up, I was brown.</li>
            <li> Follow these steps and you will have the results you are looking for and less chance of skin cancer that tanning in the sun can give you.</li>
            <li> Not especially pleasant.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to people who want to look a little tanner for the summer but who don&#x27;t want to sit in a tanning bed or do the spray - I didn&#x27;t have any problems with streaks or too-dark patches.</li>
            <li> I think that if a person had a little pigment to her/his skin, this would accentuate it.</li>
            <li> No funky smell or extra dumb glitter stuff in it, either.</li>
            <li> I am ghostly pale, so pale in fact, the lightest shade of concealer is too dark for my skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m having a little trouble getting the color even, but I&#x27;ll chalk that up to me being absolutely terrible at applying any kind of tanner.</li>
            <li> I used it sparingly for a few days, and noticed a gradual hint of color.  </li>
            <li> I have used a few sunless tanners before and did not care for them because of either the color tone, the uneven color produced, or both.</li>
            <li> It is not greasy or heavy.</li>
            <li> like I do, you can&#x27;t use it everyday.</li>
            <li> My wife it is using it since we were in Miami few month ago, and it is amazong how her skin looks witout taking any risk.</li>
            <li> Remove dead layer of skin in the shower using a body scrub, including knees and elbows.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have legs that are pale, and unevenly colored, with spider veins, stretch marks, and cellulite.  </li>
            <li> I have used Jergens and Oil of Olay in past years, this one absorbs quicker and costs less.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re pale</li>
            <li> I like how gradual it was because I don&#x27;t want to be pale one day</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced that nasty, fake orange look that makes me want to run from sunless tanners.  </li>
            <li> Here in Seattle if you want a little hint of tan, you almost have to have help!  </li>
            <li> but no more after using this product.</li>
            <li> Another plus is no brown hands which happened in the past with self tanners.</li>
            <li> Since some time has past, I decided to give this product try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to usually self tan, but I had a wedding coming up</li>
            <li> I am totally streaky, embarrassed, and angry.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> only complaint about this product is the odor, which is faint.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried at least 6-7 self tanners in the past 10 years or so</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a die hard Jergens self tanner fan for a while</li>
            <li> Still, hope dies hard</li>
            <li> and so when I saw this product, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color choices were confusing to me, because I have medium toned skin</li>
            <li> Yeah it sucks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t put on clothes or sit/lie down for at least 20 minutes!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not as expensive as other self-tanners.  </li>
            <li> Self tanners are almost never good for me.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that gave me gradual color without dark spots, streaks, orange weird color, or nasty scent.  </li>
            <li> I apply it evenly, and thinly on my arms, legs and neck.  </li>
            <li> On me, I just ended up looking weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It may not be drastic or immediate, but at least there is nothing unnatural or disastrous about this product, either</li>
            <li> but unfortunately I could not get an even color.</li>
            <li> My toenails turned brown, like the rest of my feet and legs, and it makes my feet look dirty.  </li>
            <li> , you should consider wearing gloves to apply or you palms and fingernails might end up looking brown and dirty.  </li>
            <li> My toenails turned brown, like the rest of my feet and legs, and it makes my feet look dirty.  </li>
            <li> , you should consider wearing gloves to apply or you palms and fingernails might end up looking brown and dirty.  </li>
            <li> lotion from this tanner doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as some do when they are developing.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s easier to wear without smelling bad.</li>
            <li> Legs are streaky as hell, looks bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This self-tanner takes longer to dry than others. And although the color was darker and fairly natural looking (not orange), it was streaky.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because my store was out of the jergens I use. Sauve&#x27;s is not gradual at all. I&#x27;ve only applied it once and I&#x27;m a lot darker. Also, it doesn&#x27;t fade as  naturally like jergens on  hands and feet. It did smell good though</li>
            <li> Item is as described very happy with it would buy again</li>
            <li> awful...turned my legs orange...sigh..</li>
            <li> I love this product. It gives you an amazing tan that looks like you been outside tanning or in the tanning bed, no one will know you got it from a bottle. I&#x27;ve had no streaks and there is no self tanner odor like some other self tanners out there. I have red hair and really pale skin and this product has given me the tan I ve been dreaming of. I&#x27;ve been a die hard Jergens self tanner fan for a while but no more after using this product. I highly recommended this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve done so much damage to my skin, since I was young &amp; stupid in the 80s, not caring at the time about using sunscreen, just wanting that fast color.  Now that I&#x27;ve learned my lesson, and have the pale skin to prove it, I really wanted that little hint of color, without doing further damage.  This lotion is really a good product.  I&#x27;m sensitive to smells, and this Suave doesn&#x27;t bother me like lots of other self tanners and/or lotions.  I used it sparingly for a few days, and noticed a gradual hint of color.  No streaking, no Jersey Shore cast orange, just a nice, subtle glow.  As gardening season is upon us, I&#x27;ll definitely be using this to enhance any color I might get from being outside.  This product doesn&#x27;t contain sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The scent is slightly floral and smells a lot like shampoo. It goes on smoothly and leaves a nice pleasant glow when used sparingly. It has a soft feel on the skin. I did not use it on the face, but on the legs. It isn&#x27;t strong on tanned/olive skin but does look natural, especially in small doses.</li>
            <li> To start Suave Professionals Gradual Self Tanner has a delightful light scent. I have been applying it after my shower to arms, legs face. It is not greasy and works right into the skin. Great moisturizer as far as I am concerned. I have been applying it to my upper arms and legs that never see the sun. I am 67 and don&#x27;t wear short shorts or tank tops which is understandable. Anyhow my upper arms and legs are getting a nice tan color with no lines or streaks along with lower legs and arms. I am seeing a lovely gentle tan from four days of use. I have to say I was a brown haired brunette when younger, now white haired so I have light to medium skin color. Another plus is no brown hands which happened in the past with self tanners. I had at one time purchased a high priced tanner that I don&#x27;t remember the name brand of. This is far better. Price is right and product is perfect.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve tried a self tanner. I didn&#x27;t like the smell much. But I thought it was a good consistency for applying on my skin. I&#x27;m pleased with the color on my legs, after just a few times of use. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used a few sunless tanners before and did not care for them because of either the color tone, the uneven color produced, or both. I have seen these new gradual tanning lotions for a while and was interested to give one a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is fair white with a cool undertone. I don&#x27;t tan easily, especially on my legs. I have used this product mostly on my legs, since they are so incredibly pale after the winter, as I transition into summer shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied after showers, about every 3 to 5 days between applications. I use a big dollop about the size of a half-dollar coin for one whole leg. I can definitely see a darker result when using more product or more frequently. I like both the fragrance and the soft feel of this lotion. It is not greasy or heavy. The gradual tanning is nice, because I can control it better, both color-wise and application-wise.  Please note, it is important to rinse hands thoroughly after applying to keep them from having residual coloration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the color is lighter than usual sunless tanners, it fades rather quickly, but about the time I&#x27;m noticing a fade, I am applying again anyway. If I use too much or too often, it does seem to become a bit on the orangey side, but that could be because my skin is pale so I&#x27;m noticing a difference in general. My husband didn&#x27;t seem to think it looked orangey at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One time I applied this, but didn&#x27;t really think about the fact that I had to leave right away. I put on socks &amp; sneakers and was gone the whole day. When I took them off that night, I noticed a sock line had developed around my ankle, as well as a bit of the texture pattern of the sock, in the color of the lotion. From then on, I make sure I am not going to need socks on the days when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I have been happier with this than those older sunless tanners I tried. I have a feeling I&#x27;ll be getting another bottle when this one is finished!</li>
            <li> My skin is fair, but this did not darken it that much. I had better luck with the medium -tan product. This has a nice &#x60;beachy&#x27; smell to it and does not give that awful orange tan that so many products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you follow directions and are careful in smoothing it out and not trying to put too much on at once this can give you a relatively natural colour. It certainly helps when summer comes and your legs look like 2 white appendages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just never did darken as much as I thought it would. I waited and then used the darker shade and was much more successful in obtaining the tan I wanted.</li>
            <li> I love this Suave self tanner - it works well, doesn&#x27;t streak and it&#x27;s not as expensive as other self-tanners.  I am very light skin so this fair medium is perfect for me.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion as soon as I get out of the shower. It is gentle enough that I even use it on my face. It absorbs quickly. Once it is absorbed it does not rub off. I noticed color the first day. Today is day five and I have a good base color. I wore shorts yesterday and my legs look tan. There is a scent to this that remains with you, it reminds me of crayons. It is not an offensive odor, but it is there. I have used Jergens and Oil of Olay in past years, this one absorbs quicker and costs less. I will be using this one.</li>
            <li> Forget any preconceived ideas about Suave being an inexpensive brand, because this Suave self-tanning lotion is pretty good stuff. It reminds me a little bit of the Jergens natural glow with how gradually it tans, although the color of the tan is a little darker. It takes about three days for the color to bloom on my legs (that&#x27;s the only place I use self-tanner), and then I use this a couple of times a week for maintenance. It&#x27;s a great product for the spring and summer time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m having a little trouble getting the color even, but I&#x27;ll chalk that up to me being absolutely terrible at applying any kind of tanner. Every product I&#x27;ve ever used has resulted in patchy or streaky color, so the fault has to lie with me and not the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this product is the odor, which is faint. It has that self-tanner tang to it, and on the days that I apply this lotion to my legs, I smell it on and off all day long. Not especially pleasant. I have to admit, however, that this product has much less odor than any other gradual tanner that I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m quite impressed with this product. I&#x27;ll probably buy another tube once I&#x27;ve finished this one up.</li>
            <li> I have legs that are pale, and unevenly colored, with spider veins, stretch marks, and cellulite.  You can easily see why I wanted a product that would even out my skin tone and give my legs a healthy-looking glow!  Sadly, most self tanners that I&#x27;ve tried leave streaks, dark-and-light spots and aren&#x27;t worth the trouble.  Still, hope dies hard and so when I saw this product, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color choices were confusing to me, because I have medium toned skin and I had the option of FAIR TO MEDIUM, and MEDIUM TO TAN.  What to do?  The only sensible thing  was to order both colors and try the Fair on my right leg and the Medium on my left leg.  Since I tried both colors, this review is for both colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, this product tans VERY GRADUALLY.  It was a full week of regular use before I could tell that anything at all had been applied to my legs.  And it was TWO WEEKS before I was able to see the difference between my right and my left leg.  SO.  IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR INSTANT GRATIFICATION, DO NOT BUY THIS SELF TANNER.  It takes a long while before the results show up on your skin, but when my legs finally started to &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; it was worth the wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the gradual tanning feature because this has helped me avoid the most major drawback of self tanners, which is streaks, &amp;#34;missed spots&amp;#34; and areas that are too dark.  When the tan first starts to appear, you will be able to see very light areas of imperfection, but it will be so subtle that it isn&#x27;t noticeable to people who aren&#x27;t looking for it.  This gives you an opportunity to even out the bugs before the tan gets so dark that every imperfection is glaring.  With patience, you can fashion your tan one day at a time and end up with really even toned skin that gives no clue the color isn&#x27;t natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is also really nice, and looks like a light, glow-y tan.  I haven&#x27;t experienced that nasty, fake orange look that makes me want to run from sunless tanners.  The MEDIUM TO TAN leg is a warm but light tan, while the LIGHT TO MEDIUM leg is a just a subtle touch darker than my natural skin tone, and mostly serves to create the illusion of a nice, even color on my entire leg.  Both colors do a great job of covering the blemishes on my legs and leaving me feeling healthy, pretty and ready for my summer clothes!  I haven&#x27;t decided which I like better, but might end up using the lighter color since I don&#x27;t necessarily want a deep tan, just a little glow and even skin tones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of warning:  This tanner, (like all sunless tanners) does you no favors when it gets on an area of your skin that you don&#x27;t want it to go.  My toenails turned brown, like the rest of my feet and legs, and it makes my feet look dirty.  BE CAREFUL TO STOP APPLYING BEFORE YOU GET TO THE NAILS.  This will take practice to make the look fade in a natural way, leaving the soles of your feet and toenails clean and pink without an abrupt stop-line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you should consider wearing gloves to apply or you palms and fingernails might end up looking brown and dirty.  I always wash my hands after applying, but after weeks of daily use, I find that I haven&#x27;t been getting it off my hands as thoroughly as I thought.  It isn&#x27;t as easy to apply with gloves, but the final effect is worth the extra trouble.  Other than that, I haven&#x27;t noticed any discoloration of my clothes or bed sheets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used a self tanner that I was willing to use in the long term, but Suave seems to have addressed the most troubling issues of streaking and unnatural color, giving us a first rate product!

            <li> I have used several different self tanners, and have had good results, and bad results.  The most recent one that I used was [[ASIN:B001UTK76C Jergens Natural Glow Firming Moisturizer, Fair to Medium Skin Tones 7.5 Ounces]].  I liked the color, but it rubbed off on sheets and clothes, even several days after you applied it.  It also washes off too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Suave doesn&#x27;t do this.  I really like the color!  I apply it evenly, and thinly on my arms, legs and neck.  A couple hours later, I notice some color.  I apply it the next morning, and 2 more mornings after that, until I get a color that I like, then I go to every other day, or every 2 days depending on how it looks.  It didn&#x27;t streak, or turn my orange.  I am ghostly pale, so pale in fact, the lightest shade of concealer is too dark for my skin.  That being said, this self tanner looked good, and didn&#x27;t make me look fake when I used it.  I wash my hands immediately after using it, and I have had no color show up later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far my most favorite self tanner, and I will be using it all summer.  I suggest giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Love this product! It&#x27;s amazing the nice tan tone you receive when applying everyday. However, I was just amazed by how fast it faded away when not applying for a day or two. I wanted to test both ways. A very good product, no orange-tones anymore. Yay! Chemical tanning products have come along way. I don&#x27;t know all the chemical processes but it would be even nicer if it didn&#x27;t fade so fast.</li>
            <li> Suave Professionals Gradual self Tanner is one of the best self tanning lotions I&#x27;ve used.  The scent wasn&#x27;t too strong, and it was absorbed into my skin evenly.  The tan color that resulted was natural looking, not at all &#x27;orangey&#x27;. I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and plan to use it throughout the summer for a nice glow.</li>
            <li> For anyone who wants a healthy glow without looking orange. Slides on like silk. Beautiful beachy scent. No lines, no streaks, no obvious stain left in-between your fingers from applying. I am extremely fair and after just one application I looked tan and healthier. Hard to accomplish living in the great Northeast. Friends asked if I had escaped for a long warm weather holiday. I wish. Worth every nickel. Sensational product for the value; and I&#x27;ve tried the top shelf self tanners. They honestly can&#x27;t compare.</li>
            <li> I am very fair. Self tanners are almost never good for me. I have had some luck using Jergens gradual product mixed with lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has some upsides-&lt;br /&gt;It smells better than the Jergens. It doesn&#x27;t make you smell like a bag of Fritos.&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing. This really feels nice on the skin and keeps you moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even. There aren&#x27;t streaks or patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has one down side. It just isn&#x27;t a credible color for very fair skin. I now look like a creamsicle. It is not a look I can rock.</li>
            <li> I have used Jergens self tanner before, and to me this product works just as well as that one.  It takes some time of using consistently to work, but once you do you will notice a definite glow.  I would recommend this product to people who want to look a little tanner for the summer but who don&#x27;t want to sit in a tanning bed or do the spray - I didn&#x27;t have any problems with streaks or too-dark patches.</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s a tanning lotion that creates a gentle tan not unlike the tans you get from the sun.  No orangey streaks, nothing that looks like a tan from a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had troube tanning my legs until now.  I easily tan on shoulders and arms, and noticeably do not tan on my legs.  Now that problem is gone.  Legs are tanned the same color as arms and shoulders.  By the way, I use the lotion for fair-medium skin, and it&#x27;s perfect for a tan that exactly matches my tanned skin color.  I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
            <li> A few years ago, I experimented with several different self-tanners. No matter how expensive or how cheap, each made me some shade of orange, stained my hands/fingernails, and had a pretty distinct odor. Since some time has past, I decided to give this product try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it is crucial to know that I am super pale. So, when this appeared as an orange color on my skin, I was not particularly surprised. I think that if a person had a little pigment to her/his skin, this would accentuate it. On me, I just ended up looking weird. I think it is more of a &amp;#34;me&amp;#34; problem and less of a Suave problem. (And, to avoid any staining issue with my hands and fingernails, I used Bath and Body Works Sea Salt Scrub after applying this product. I really scrubbed and had no problems with staining this time. Also, I used the scrub before applying this self-tanner to my legs and ended up with no discernible patchiness ... so, do exfoliate!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that distinct odor is still present, but it&#x27;s not necessarily &amp;#34;bad.&amp;#34; Just odd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that this product works. And, by using this instead of a tanning bed, you will save your health and your beauty! Try it!</li>
            <li> I have super pale skin, so I tried using the Fair-Medium version of this Suave self tanner. As with most self tanners, I get the best results by being sure to exfoliate really well before starting. Salt and sugar scrubs work the best, being sure to scrub really well around the knees, ankles and elbows. Also before applying the tanner, I take a dab of regular lotion and apply it to my knees and elbows. This helps moisturize those areas since they tend to absorb the tanner even more than the rest of the skin, and helps prevent from them getting darker than the areas around them, which can happen with self tanning lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very gradual tanning lotion, so you don&#x27;t need to be quite as perfect with your application as you might need to be with an overnight tanner. By tanning in stages, it&#x27;s helps prevent streaks. It also helps make it look a bit more natural with other people. If you are at work on a Monday and you&#x27;re pale, then on Tuesday morning you come in and are dark tan, everyone will know you got it from a bottle. Using the gradual tanner, it&#x27;s far less noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion from this tanner doesn&#x27;t smell nearly as bad as some do when they are developing. So it&#x27;s easier to wear without smelling bad. After about 3 applications it gives skin a slight glow of a tan. Suave gradual self tanner is a great way to get sun kissed skin without overdoing it and looking like an orange.</li>
            <li> As good or better than as any bronzerand cheaper</li>
            <li> Iove this product.  I have very fair skin. Because if medical reasons I can not be in the sun very long.  This gives my legs a gradual tan look..  It always looks smooth and tan.  Not orange or dark bronze like some other  products.</li>
            <li> Every spring I try a self-tanner, hoping it will work better than the dozens I have tried before.  This is the first one that gave me gradual color without dark spots, streaks, orange weird color, or nasty scent.  Love this product!  I bought the fair-medium and tried it on one lower leg first.  I did not notice any streaks.  The next morning I applied it again.  Several hours later I showed my lovely winter white legs to a co-worker, and she definitely noticed a difference, and said she also did not see the typical orange color present in many other tanners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way the lotion feels when applying - not too thick, spreading easily. It also dried quickly, allowing me to use it before work when I am rushed. I have not noticed any clothes staining either.  I think I may try the medium/dark formula next.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not one to usually self tan, but I had a wedding coming up and I wanted to blend out my T Shirt tan.  This worked great.  It is gradual, which I liked, since I don&#x27;t usually use this type of product.  I got to the tan level I wanted a couple of days ago, now I am just mixing it with my regular moisturizer to keep the shade.  It really helped disguise some of the scrapes I had on my legs from a recent hike too.  The scent is fine - and I&#x27;m not one to tolerate anything to smelly!  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I typically use L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Sublime instant bronzing lotion but there are two things that I don&#x27;t like about it, 1) it has a lot of shimmer that borders on glitter and unless the occasion calls for it, it&#x27;s just too much and 2) it makes my legs feel very itchy the next day after I&#x27;ve applied it. Therefore I was eager to try something new and I&#x27;m so happy with this sunless tanner. The first thing that I liked was the scent, it&#x27;s very pleasant and it doesn&#x27;t have the typical offensive odor that most sunless tanners have. The second thing that I liked is that this is a lotion that gradually builds up to the desired results and it doesn&#x27;t cause streaking because of the subtle buildup. Lastly, the tan looks like a natural color and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. I&#x27;m very pleased with this sunless tanner and will continue to use this in the future.</li>
            <li> I have been using this a few mornings a week and really like it! I am pale, and it has given me a nice glow in a pretty short amount of time. No funky smell or extra dumb glitter stuff in it, either. I also have sensitive skin on my legs (eczema) and have had no adverse reactions. I will totally be getting more of this!</li>
            <li> Suave self tanner is a nice, faintly scented lotion that will give your skin a sun kissed look after only a couple applications.  You do NOT wind up with orange legs, and it is gradual enough that you can control it.  Here in Seattle if you want a little hint of tan, you almost have to have help!  With all the evidence of the damage sun exposure does to us, it is incomprehensible to me that people do not cover up and avoid the sun altogether.  We outdoorsy folks cannot avoid the sun, so we use lots of sunscreen.  While pale skin is gorgeous, sometimes you want to color up just a notch or two.  This is the stuff:  goes on smoothly, has a pleasant scent, leaves you a shade darker (a normal shade) than before.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Self tanner, especially this one, is a redhead&#x27;s best friend. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different brands and came back to this one after being satisfied last summer. It has that self-tanner smell like all the others (hence the four v five stars), but for the price, I can deal with it. It never lasts longer than one&#x27;s next shower.</li>
            <li> The product works well. If you have fair skin like I do, you can&#x27;t use it everyday. Every other day or every two days is plenty. I gave it four starts because of the smell. It&#x27;s not overwhelming, but noticeably for the first hour or two.</li>
            <li> I am a very fair skinned bodybuilder. I burn in seconds, tan for minutes, and peel overnight. Yeah it sucks. I decided to try this product. Before I used this, I took a shower and scrubbed with an exfoliant, then again with my wife&#x27;s scrubby thing. Had her wash my back to be sure I removed every bit of dry skin. When I got out of the shower, I had my wife put the lotion on my entire body. Felt pretty good, dried quickly, and made my skin feel nice. I waited about a half hour, then sat on my recliner, took a nap in my underwear for about 3 hours, and when I woke up, I was brown. Cool, the only problem is I look like I got out of the sauna and rolled around in the infield of a baseball field in the desert. I am totally streaky, embarrassed, and angry. My stomach looks like someone dumped wood stain on it. Or maybe spit chewing tobacco on it. Legs are streaky as hell, looks bad. This may be good for someone who already has some color, but for a person that&#x27;s pale, beware, because every imperfection shows up with great detail. One thing that makes this product hard to use is its white and goes on clear, so it&#x27;s hard to determine evenness.</li>
            <li> I read lots of reviews before buying this. At first I didn&#x27;t feel like it was working but then people started asking if i had been tanning (which i will not do because of skin cancer history) so i was pretty impressed it worked. I still use it but just like 3 times a week to keep myself looking tan</li>
            <li> Tried it once. Not sure if it works. I couldn&#x27;t stand the lingering smell on my skin.  Such a bummer, but not worth the headache from powerful scent.</li>
            <li> This felt food enough going on, and I thought I&#x27;d really like it when I first used it.  It has fragrance but it was very pleasant and my skin felt moisturized after I&#x27;d applied it.&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I woke up and looking down at my feet I just looked splotchy.  The color was a bit peachy but it was ok, but I was definitely splotchy looking.&lt;br /&gt;I put more one the next night but awoke to find myself downright orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a very fair person- I always wear the lightest shades of makeup for instance.  I have never had any luck at all with ANY self tanner, but I hoped this one might be different as they are getting better as  the years pass.  This color was just too intense for me.  It was not gradual enough on a very fair person.  I might need a fair-fair level but this was the lightest they had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a positive note, it didn&#x27;t discolor my palms or and my knees looked ok.  I did wash my hands good after use &amp; was careful of my knees and elbows..</li>
            <li> Tans nicely but still leaves that characteristic self-tanning smell.</li>
            <li> My wife it is using it since we were in Miami few month ago, and it is amazong how her skin looks witout taking any risk.</li>
            <li> I have used this for A while but they have changed the formulation and it is Orange and streaky!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience with tanning lotion - I have witnessed horror-experiences of others over the years (orange, streaky skin, ruined bedsheets and clothing, etc). so I have generally steered away. But with a change in my daily transportation, I decided that it would be nice to even out my arms (one is darker than the other from driving). And though I did not notice an immediate change, after a few weeks of applying the lotion once every other day (on average - some days I was better about remembering it than others), they are about even. I have also used this on my legs which get far less sun, and though the difference isn&#x27;t as noticeable as my arm, it has brightened up their color a bit, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is pleasant, but the texture is a bit thin if you are looking for something to moisturize with - I usually use my regular lotion all over first and then just use this one as &amp;#34;topcoat&amp;#34; in places where I want some added color. What is also nice about it, is there is a subtle shimmer to the lotion that I have noticed in the sunlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be drastic or immediate, but at least there is nothing unnatural or disastrous about this product, either - I am quite pleased with it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very fair and have a rosy undertone to my skin so I don&#x27;t want huge amounts of color from the get go because it just looks weird on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried at least 6-7 self tanners in the past 10 years or so and this one compares favorably even with some of the more expensive ones I&#x27;ve had in the past - I can&#x27;t recall the name of the most expensive one I tried about 4 years ago but I recall that it was around 30 smackers and it worked ok but I wouldn&#x27;t have spent that much again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a nice gradual color from this and it wasn&#x27;t orange-y at all. I like how gradual it was because I don&#x27;t want to be pale one day and then super tan the next. I didn&#x27;t get that with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m so fair, I applied it every other day until I got a light tan look and then have applied it every few days or so as my &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; started to fade a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely use this again. It&#x27;s inexpensive, it works for me and I&#x27;ve been able to find it both online and in my local dept store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to Amazon and the Maker/Vendor for giving me the chance to try it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks now and I really like it. I used to use Jergens gradual self tanner, but I could not stand the smell of it. The smell of this is much better! I would order this again</li>
            <li> I tried a bit on my arm and had to wash it off...the scent was still there a day later.  Wish I could use it - have an allergy to some perfumes and this is obviously one of them.  Price is better than some other brands of gradual tanners.</li>
            <li> Using on my legs, chest and arms. Follow these steps and you will have the results you are looking for and less chance of skin cancer that tanning in the sun can give you. Just don&#x27;t expect the tan to look like you just came off a weeks vacation at the beach, you will look better than your pallid current self, but no product can give you a fabulous tan better than the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Exfoliate before application. Remove dead layer of skin in the shower using a body scrub, including knees and elbows.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Moisturize daily, immediately after your shower forgetting this step probably will result blotchy coloring.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Don&#x27;T apply in your steamy bathroom, or when you are warm from the shower/bath, or when perspiring, the self tanner will streak.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t rush, focus and don&#x27;t get distracted.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Lightly apply to knees, ankles and elbows - these areas tend to concentrate the tanner and will look darker if you don&#x27;t use less.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Wash your hands ASAP!!! Using a moisturized makeup sponge is always an option.&lt;br /&gt;&gt; Don&#x27;t put on clothes or sit/lie down for at least 20 minutes!! Phone a friend.</li>
            <li> I have been using self tanners for many years and have tried multiple brands. They have improved immensely over the years and the Suave Gradual self tanner is one of the nicer ones I&#x27;ve used. All self-tanners have a scent but this one was mild and not unpleasant. The lotion was moisturizing and not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of a gradual tan but unfortunately I could not get an even color. I used the tanner on my legs. One bottle lasted 30 days. It built up gradually and the color was a nice shade, but there were a few streaky areas. I tried all the tricks - exfoliate first, let lotion dry completely for about 15 minutes before getting dressed, apply extra to the area that remained light - but nothing worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this didn&#x27;t work well for me because of the uneven tanning, it could be because of my skin type, which is very fair. I would still recommend others give it a try.</li>
            <li> Although I liked this product because it has a nice moisturizer as a base, at the same time, it does take awhile for you to get the color right. Maybe the problem here for me is that I have really white skin and so it will take awhile. I used this product on two different days and hardly saw a difference in the color of my skin so if you want results, you&#x27;ll need to use it on a daily basis until you get the color you want.</li>
            <li> As a pale chick of Celtic extraction, every once in awhile I&#x27;ll go on a tear in search of the perfect self-tanner products, and they almost always turn me a gentle orange or are more trouble than they&#x27;re worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I was pretty impressed with Suave&#x27;s gradual self-tanner here. You receive a generous amount, in an easy to dispense tube, and the product goes on lightly and silkily, not greasily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is pleasant, and the best part is, the self-tan just kind of shows up throughout the day, as if you were a film negative just gently turning gold. The tan color is pretty and believable, and not overly orange.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;m a fan, and would use this again. Maybe this Summer Suave will help me turn a color darker than vanilla (healthily, of course)!</li>
            <li> I am more than happy with this self tanner! I am not a fan of exposing my skin to the sun but I also have pretty fair skin. I like to have just a hint of color and this gradual self tanner does the trick! It is very gradual, it took several days for me to notice a difference but I am just fine with that. It goes on nice and evenly and does not have a funky smell like some other self tanners. Plus the price is right!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about three weeks now and I must say I love it I have used more expensive brands in the past such as bare essentials etc. this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  There is very little streaking and the color is not orange like most self Tanners.  I will be buying this product again.</li>
            <li> Still have to apply  lightly or end up with orange steaky spots. VERY light on foot ankles and kness. Theres better.</li>
