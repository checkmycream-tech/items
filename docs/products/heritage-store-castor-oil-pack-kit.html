            <li>I am very pleased with this item that I purchased.</li>

            <li>The wipes included are so handy.</li>

            <li>One of Edgar Cayce&#x27;s most mentioned remedies.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am so glad I discovered this.</li>
            <li>I wish I could write more</li>
            <li>It had a large bottle of oil with a good top.</li>
            <li>I order these for my patients, they enjoy the convenience of getting everything they need at once to do castor oil packs at home.</li>
            <li>I have used this once so far and felt so good afterward.  </li>
            <li>I have not had to use the clean up cloths yet because I find the oil not offensive either in scent or being too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Everything you need to begin Edgar Cayce&#x27;s castor oil wrap therapy, just remember though, it is castor oil, greasy &amp; sticky, you&#x27;ll need to clean off thoroughly after each treatment or stain your shirts, bed, etc.</li>
            <li>Just received my kit in super fast time,very pleased with the size of caster oil and the wool cloth, can&#x27;t wait to try it.</li>
            <li>Bought this to cleanse my gut of impurities in preparation of getting pregnant again</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come with a heating pad, if it did, it would be worth it.</li>
            <li>For the price, I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done about 4 packs so far, and the flannel and oil are holding up fine.</li>
            <li>After too many mammograms from three different places, I was in a lot of pain and the hot pack treatment brought me some relief.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it did something, but whatever it is, I don&#x27;t feel any different.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>, that will be the most troubling I think......Will come back and give a more positive review after actually using it.</li>
            <li>The lids for the wipes doesn&#x27;t stay closed, and the pour spout for the castor oil is too small, but I&#x27;m very happy with the products themselves.</li>
            <li>I find that the flannel cloth is very itchy</li>
            <li>This castor oil kit really help with menstrual cramps and all types of joints pain it</li>
            <li>This kit was very convenient.  </li>
            <li>and I went through the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>I wanted to keep everything as natural as possible not to make matters worse and this was a wonderful alternative.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The cloths you can easily make yourself from white t-shirts, and you can buy twice as much castor oil from your local drug store.</li>
            <li>I really did not like the fact that the oil was old and smelled like it was sitting for over year.</li>
            <li>Now I have to purchase new oil</li>
            <li>This kit comes with a large bottle of oil-- enough to do several packs, a large flannel cloth and a canister of wipes.</li>
            <li>and the instructions weren&#x27;t really clear.  </li>
            <li>As i speak, we have a 7 month old boy.</li>
            <li>And now, my family is complete.</li>
            <li>but I tend to be sensitive to wool.  </li>
            <li>I thought about buying all the components separately, but since I was just starting out, I needed everything and wanted to have it all ready to use at once.</li>
            <li>there are many other medical uses for this treatment such as stomach pain &amp;</li>
            <li>Castor oil like any other kind of oil is not easy to get out of fabric (i.e., clothes, bed sheets).</li>

            <li> It does what it states but it is too messy and difficult to put on alone.  </li>

            <li> I get really painful ovarian cysts and using this castor oil kit did the trick to get rid of them.  I wish I tried this sooner!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love these packs.</li>
            <li> does not work at all.. waste of  $</li>
            <li> This kit came with everything needed which is so convenient. I think it would have been a hassle to purchase everything separately. It had a large bottle of oil with a good top. I have left it knocked over without realizing &amp; was worried about leakage but there was none. The wipes included are so handy. The oil is hard to clean &amp; can leave stains so having the wipes keeps it from getting too messy. It also included the cotton flannel cloth needed which I cut into smaller pieces to lay across my stomach &amp; I place a sheet of plastic saran wrap so the heating pad does not get any oil on it. I am using it to remove scar tissue from my Fallopian tubes but I cannot tell if it is working or not but it seems as tho there are many other medical uses for this treatment such as stomach pain &amp; it helps circulation and detoxes the liver.</li>
            <li> This product was wonderful. A must have.</li>
            <li> Overpriced. The cleaning towelettes were opened, the protective seal removed, so they are not sterile or usable. The cloths you can easily make yourself from white t-shirts, and you can buy twice as much castor oil from your local drug store. it doesn&#x27;t come with a heating pad, if it did, it would be worth it. Also it took a long time to ship.</li>
            <li> A very good package of needed supplies for detoxing.</li>
            <li> One of Edgar Cayce&#x27;s most mentioned remedies. It is a great detox for your body and feels so good for your body</li>
            <li> Good. Bought this to cleanse my gut of impurities in preparation of getting pregnant again (we were having issues with the second). As i speak, we have a 7 month old boy. I am not saying that its the one that did it.. all i am saying is i tried it after i read that it helps to cleanse out impurities. And now, my family is complete. So..</li>
            <li> A great price on a wonderful Edgar Cayce Remedy. It works but you must follow the instructions! Great quality product.</li>
            <li> I have used this once so far and felt so good afterward.  It is a convenient kit with everything included.</li>
            <li> Just follow the directions properly. Oil does not run while in use. Flannel is washable and can be reused. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just started using this so will have to post another review after using it for a while.  The package contains all you would need to use an oil pack for relief and then clean-up.  I find that the flannel cloth is very itchy but I tend to be sensitive to wool.  I have not had any rash from it.  I have not had to use the clean up cloths yet because I find the oil not offensive either in scent or being too greasy.  The oil does stay on the skin well and using a heating pad (protected) works to penetrate the oil.  I simply wiped away the remaining oil with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> I have used Castor Oil Pack and slept like a baby!</li>
            <li> Faced with the possibility of breast cancer,  I did a lot of research.  After too many mammograms from three different places, I was in a lot of pain and the hot pack treatment brought me some relief. I wanted to keep everything as natural as possible not to make matters worse and this was a wonderful alternative.</li>
            <li> The lids for the wipes doesn&#x27;t stay closed, and the pour spout for the castor oil is too small, but I&#x27;m very happy with the products themselves.</li>
            <li> do liver packs a lot to help with lyme. like this company&#x27;s castor oil.</li>
            <li> I purchased this pack to get started using castor oil packs for IBD relief. I thought about buying all the components separately, but since I was just starting out, I needed everything and wanted to have it all ready to use at once. This kit comes with a large bottle of oil-- enough to do several packs, a large flannel cloth and a canister of wipes. I&#x27;ve done about 4 packs so far, and the flannel and oil are holding up fine. I store the flannel in a gallon plastic ziploc bag in a closet. It doesn&#x27;t seem to require refrigeration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad I discovered this. It feels great on the abdomen to relax with the pack before going to bed. I believe it has helped ease my symptoms of IBD after just one application. In addition, the oil can be used for other applications as well, like treating skin and eye conditions. I will always keep castor oil around from now on.</li>
            <li> This castor oil kit really help with menstrual cramps and all types of joints pain it a wonderful treatment I love it!!</li>
            <li> This kit was very convenient.  I wish I could write more but I am still learning about and the benefits of the castor oil pack.</li>
            <li> I Loved My COP!!! It Did Everything I Expected It To.</li>
            <li> Worked well for what I needed it for.  Messy to use and the instructions weren&#x27;t really clear.  Had to do some research.</li>
            <li> Was experimenting to see if I could lose stomach fat from baby belly pooch or at least get rid of the stretchy wrinkly skin from losing what I could. I have not lost an inch and I went through the whole bottle. The wrinkles look slightly less visible. Works for some women at losing inches from the belly, but not for me. I&#x27;m sure it did something, but whatever it is, I don&#x27;t feel any different.</li>
            <li> Works great! Instead of having to purchase this pack separately, it all came in one convenient package. It was easy to use and great all around. The wipes were a bit disappointing, but I read online that you can use baking powder. It worked like a charm.</li>
            <li> Just received my kit in super fast time,very pleased with the size of caster oil and the wool cloth, can&#x27;t wait to try it. I know I am going to have to research to find a convenient way to use this daily with as little fuss &amp; mess as possible, that will be the most troubling I think......Will come back and give a more positive review after actually using it.</li>
            <li> Nice oil!!, a little sticky but it does the job. Great for liver packs and reduction of you waist size. I highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I really did not like the fact that the oil was old and smelled like it was sitting for over year. Now I have to purchase new oil I prefer to buy my own clothes and oil from&lt;br /&gt;Another vendor. I only order this product to help remove scar tissue for blocked tubes. I give it two stars because it did come with cloth and wipes.</li>
            <li> I am a great fan of Edgar Cayce&#x27;s castor oil packs. Along with this kit I also ordered the Cayce book on how to do castor oil packs. Very interesting and works for me.</li>
            <li> This is used for a lot of medicinal purposes and also it is used in the bath bombs my sister makes.</li>
            <li> Everything you need to begin Edgar Cayce&#x27;s castor oil wrap therapy, just remember though, it is castor oil, greasy &amp; sticky, you&#x27;ll need to clean off thoroughly after each treatment or stain your shirts, bed, etc.</li>
            <li> Spilled in package, big mess. Love the product but was disappointed that the cap wasn&#x27;t on properly!</li>
            <li> For the price, I don&#x27;t think this is worth the price. You could find the same items for less. I would not purchase again not suggest.  Items were as advertised just not a good but for the price</li>
            <li> It does what it states but it is too messy and difficult to put on alone.  It would be nice if the pad had a protective cover.  Castor oil like any other kind of oil is not easy to get out of fabric (i.e., clothes, bed sheets).</li>
            <li> Everything you need to do castor oil compresses.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this item that I purchased.</li>
            <li> If you have aching ligaments or an upset stomach this is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Ordered for a easy &amp; effective liver cleanse.  Great product. Good directions and easy to follow.  Will refer to others and reorder</li>
            <li> This product is great. I have seen results every time I have used it. Would recommend this product to others</li>
            <li> Product works well for skin issues and joint issues with the wool felt and warm packs as well as on its own.  Seems to be good quality oil from what I read of processing info</li>
            <li> I order these for my patients, they enjoy the convenience of getting everything they need at once to do castor oil packs at home.</li>
