            <li>but it gives perfect cuts every time</li>
            <li>Great cut.</li>
            <li>but it is a great knock off.</li>
            <li>We bought this and tried it out thinking it would be great, but</li>

            <li>These clips give me better results.</li>
            <li>times.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use the device still even with defect.</li>
            <li>I just clip my hair in there, spread it out to make sure it&#x27;s even all the way through the clip</li>
            <li>, quality could be better clasps don&#x27;t close easily have to force them shut and</li>
            <li>but I knew it would, not as easy to use as it looks but good not sorry</li>

            <li>When she got it she sent me lots of thank yous saying this product was very cool and shed use it all the time.</li>
            <li>Hair cutting tool wooks great for my wife, If she&#x27;s happy,  I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>But these clips are just as good as &#x27;the real thing&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>They arrive quickly and were very easy to use.</li>
            <li>How cool is that, love it.</li>
            <li>Took less than 5 minutes to get a perfect haircut!  </li>
            <li>I found the cheap price at Amazon and bought</li>
            <li>the cheap price is right.&lt;br /&gt;However, buyers beware of who and where you order this product.</li>
            <li>Contrary to what another reviewer claims, I find these to be very sturdy and of nice quality.  </li>
            <li>Some people automatically assume a \\&quot;knockoff\\&quot; will be cheap</li>
            <li>Look at the list of available sellers to find a US seller if you want it faster.  </li>
            <li>This little gadget is amazing and so incredibly easy!  </li>
            <li>This is a cheap Knockoff, NOT the real CreaClip.</li>
            <li>And as far as the bang tool goes; better have someone else do them.</li>
            <li>This item is so useful.  </li>
            <li>I trim my own hair and this is such a help for holding it into place as I make the cut.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>The quality is very low, cheap looking plastic and it seems to break easily.</li>
            <li>The products were exactly how I thought they would be</li>
            <li>The seller I found (K&amp;J) was only $1 more than the price of those overseas.</li>
            <li>Thank-you so much!</li>
            <li>Absolute junk!</li>
            <li>If anyone absolutely needs the instructions and wants to pay 3 times as much to get them then by all means, give up that hard-earned money.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!  </li>
            <li>We just ordered the REAL CreaClip from CreaProducts.</li>
            <li>love the hair cutting tool, i would recommend it to anyone who cuts their own hair, saves you money and time.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s flimsy and too loose to even hold your hair tight enough to get a good enough grip to even be able to cut it.</li>
            <li>Well, it does hold the hair but as far as the levels go don&#x27;t bank on them!</li>
            <li>it was always a huge mess.  </li>
            <li>As far as layering the hair it works.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;It took 3 weeks to arrived coming directly from China.&lt;br</li>
            <li>first it took a long time to get this product almost a month!!!</li>
            <li>I have really long straight hair and have been trimming the ends myself for years.</li>
            <li>mine almost broke the first time I closed it.</li>
            <li>I love it the only thing I would change is the clip it is hard to close</li>
            <li>, rather it&#x27;s thick &amp; absolutely fine.</li>
            <li>using it, I realized that these might be the factory rejects because, the hinges cannot open completely or shut easily.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>I was afraid the clips would be cheap plastic,but it is very durable.</li>

            <li> I was afraid the clips would be cheap plastic,but it is very durable.</li>
            <li> Must flat iron hair before use.</li>
            <li> Cutting bangs or the back, top and sides of your hair.  </li>
            <li> I cut angled bangs, tapered my hair from chin to shoulder &amp; trimmed the back by flipping my head upside down &amp; clipping it all in the big white one.  </li>
            <li> It is a lot for a piece of cheap plastic and weird working gel level.</li>
            <li> she has bangs and was complaining they got too long and didn&#x27;t feel like going out and spending money on just trimming her bangs every two weeks, so i showed her a video on youtube of this product being used.</li>
            <li> that just seems like it would take a long time.  </li>
            <li> My husband shook his head and laughed at me after I showed him my layered haircut that I did with this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Saw these in a youtube video on how to cut long hair, and as a person hating to pay a small fortune for just a trim ever five weeks on waist length hair, these are a live save.  </li>
            <li> with patience, it will open enough to get hair in and shut tight to hold hair in place.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was very long (from China!)</li>
            <li> The bars are so tight you can barely open or close them</li>
            <li> I bought these hoping to save myself a few pennies and give myself a little more &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; by cutting the hair around my face.</li>
            <li> I feel I extremely overpaid.</li>
            <li> Only took a few minutes to do!</li>
            <li> Yes it was a few dollars more, but then again it is your hair that you are cutting with it!</li>
            <li> so i thought it over and spend so little money on this product and bought it for her for a late Christmas present.</li>
            <li> So you don&#x27;t have to go to a hairstyle just to cut a little bit of your hait.</li>
            <li> This really does help for cutting your child&#x27;s bangs.</li>
            <li> Not cheap plastic</li>
            <li> Bang clip a little confusing for me.</li>
            <li> This product sucks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this Chinese piece of crap.</li>
            <li> (so you don&#x27;t get a weird chunky spot), snap it shut &amp; buzzer the hair off.  </li>
            <li> All I needed were the clips since I already have hair cutting scissors</li>
            <li> Nearly worthless without &amp;#34;How To&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I hate paying a salon to cut my hair</li>
            <li> Bad quality!</li>

            <li> Je suis très contente de cet achat, cela guide bien pour avoir une coupe parfaite.&lt;br /&gt;A recommander pour les novices comme moi.&lt;br /&gt;Cordialités&lt;br /&gt;Edith.A</li>
            <li> I got this for one of my friends mom who loves to play around with her hair at home. she has bangs and was complaining they got too long and didn&#x27;t feel like going out and spending money on just trimming her bangs every two weeks, so i showed her a video on youtube of this product being used. SHE WAS ECSTATIC. so i thought it over and spend so little money on this product and bought it for her for a late Christmas present. When she got it she sent me lots of thank yous saying this product was very cool and shed use it all the time. That week she cut her own hair with it and both of her daughters with this and saved tons of money. How cool is that, love it.</li>
            <li> Saw these in a youtube video on how to cut long hair, and as a person hating to pay a small fortune for just a trim ever five weeks on waist length hair, these are a live save.  They arrive quickly and were very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I received it a couple days ago paying $17. Now it is $11 and I did not get any keychain. It is a lot for a piece of cheap plastic and weird working gel level. Shipping was very long (from China!) I feel I extremely overpaid.</li>
            <li> Instructions on how to use is writtten in Chinese!!!  It was shi[[ed to an English apeaking address in the USA.  Nearly worthless without &amp;#34;How To&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> first it took a long time to get this product almost a month!!! guess cause its shipped all the way from china, quality could be better clasps don&#x27;t close easily have to force them shut and level switch doesn&#x27;t acurrately work managed to make it work just to trim my kids bangs</li>
            <li> love the hair cutting tool, i would recommend it to anyone who cuts their own hair, saves you money and time.</li>
            <li> Hello. I would like to say that this is a good product, easy to use in your own house. So you don&#x27;t have to go to a hairstyle just to cut a little bit of your hait. You can do it!</li>
            <li> I have really long straight hair and have been trimming the ends myself for years. I bought these hoping to save myself a few pennies and give myself a little more &amp;#34;style&amp;#34; by cutting the hair around my face. When I seen this I thought would help. Well, it does hold the hair but as far as the levels go don&#x27;t bank on them! And as far as the bang tool goes; better have someone else do them.</li>
            <li> This item is so useful.  Cutting bangs or the back, top and sides of your hair.  As far as layering the hair it works.</li>
            <li> The products were exactly how I thought they would be and I love them. I save so much money and my hair looks great! The best and the cheapest products, no question about it!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!  I use to pay between $22-$40 to get my hair trimmed or cut. These clips give me better results. I was afraid the clips would be cheap plastic,but it is very durable. So happy I decided to buy this! For those who are complaining about the instructions being in Chinese there are a ton of videos on youtube that show how to use the creaclip.</li>
            <li> Dues what is it says. Great cut. I&#x27;m happy!  Not an official Crea Clip but it is a great knock off. Not cheap plastic, rather it&#x27;s thick &amp; absolutely fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after viewing Creativclip video. I found the cheap price at Amazon and bought it.&lt;br /&gt;It took 3 weeks to arrived coming directly from China.&lt;br /&gt;The brand was not on the package. It looked the same as Creativclip advertising.&lt;br /&gt;Upon using it, I realized that these might be the factory rejects because, the hinges cannot open completely or shut easily.&lt;br /&gt;But with patience, it will open enough to get hair in and shut tight to hold hair in place.&lt;br /&gt;The lever bubble was painted over with gold paint, blocking the actual bubble from being seen, and giving the illusion that the clip is held level at all times.&lt;br /&gt;I was able to use the device still even with defect. It serves my purpose and the cheap price is right.&lt;br /&gt;However, buyers beware of who and where you order this product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need to buy the whole creaclip set with the scissors and dvd, so this was perfect. All I needed were the clips since I already have hair cutting scissors and I watched the videos on youtube. It was easy to use and my hair looks great. Only took a few minutes to do!</li>
            <li> If anyone absolutely needs the instructions and wants to pay 3 times as much to get them then by all means, give up that hard-earned money.  But these clips are just as good as &#x27;the real thing&#x27;.  Contrary to what another reviewer claims, I find these to be very sturdy and of nice quality.  Some people automatically assume a \\&quot;knockoff\\&quot; will be cheap but sometimes they are actually better, and these are just fine.  I knew from the reviews that these didn&#x27;t come with instructions, so I had gone to creaclip&#x27;s site ahead of time to read up on how to use these and watch some how-to videos on their youtube channel.  Took less than 5 minutes to get a perfect haircut!  I hate paying a salon to cut my hair so I have tried cutting my own hair before and holy moly it was always a huge mess.  This little gadget is amazing and so incredibly easy!  I only wish I had discovered it sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Look at the list of available sellers to find a US seller if you want it faster.  The seller I found (K&amp;J) was only $1 more than the price of those overseas.</li>
            <li> This is a cheap Knockoff, NOT the real CreaClip. Bad quality! Stay away... We bought this and tried it out thinking it would be great, but NO NO. The quality is very low, cheap looking plastic and it seems to break easily. This product sucks. Stay away! We just ordered the REAL CreaClip from CreaProducts. Yes it was a few dollars more, but then again it is your hair that you are cutting with it!</li>
            <li> no problems with the item but took forever to get here but I knew it would, not as easy to use as it looks but good not sorry I purchased</li>
            <li> Hair cutting tool wooks great for my wife, If she&#x27;s happy,  I&#x27;m happy. Took a bit longer than in the mail than I expcted, but from overseas,  it arrived alot earler than stated. couldn&#x27;t beat the price anywhere else.</li>
            <li> I got this item like in a month. Looks just like item above. Wish it came with english instructions, its all chinese.</li>
            <li> Received today. Sturdy, no English instructions. Cut my hair today with it. Turned out well. Must flat iron hair before use. Didn&#x27;t know that since I had no instructions. Price was great. Shipping took a while since it came from Singapore. Quality is good. Bang clip a little confusing for me. But would recommend others to purchase. Cheaper than name brand one, but just as good I would think.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this Chinese piece of crap. It literally ships from China. You have to sign for it. It&#x27;s flimsy and too loose to even hold your hair tight enough to get a good enough grip to even be able to cut it. Not to mention it took FOREVER to ship--ALMOST A MONTH!</li>
            <li> This is perfect for what I need it for. I trim my own hair and this is such a help for holding it into place as I make the cut. Well worth the money. Thank-you so much!</li>
            <li> It does what its supposed to! I found it easy to use and even though  it&#x27;s a cheaper price the quality is really good!</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and get your haircut at a salon.  It doesn&#x27;t hold your hair in place.  My husband shook his head and laughed at me after I showed him my layered haircut that I did with this piece of crap.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome!  I have no clue how the level is supposed to work as I found it easier just to eyeball the angle you want your hair at &amp; then go for it!  I use this with an electric buzzer.  I don&#x27;t know how it works with scissors.. that just seems like it would take a long time.  I just clip my hair in there, spread it out to make sure it&#x27;s even all the way through the clip (so you don&#x27;t get a weird chunky spot), snap it shut &amp; buzzer the hair off.  Perfect!  I cut angled bangs, tapered my hair from chin to shoulder &amp; trimmed the back by flipping my head upside down &amp; clipping it all in the big white one.  I use the white for the front &amp; back b/c it has the rounded part which I like.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if I could figure out the level thing but I couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I love it the only thing I would change is the clip it is hard to close but it gives perfect cuts every time</li>
            <li> The bars are so tight you can barely open or close them mine almost broke the first time I closed it. Absolute junk!</li>
            <li> This really does help for cutting your child&#x27;s bangs. I have used it twice on my daughter and it has already saved me 20.00 dollars. Would definitely r moment this product and ths seller.</li>
