            <li>these perfect match polishes are great.  </li>
            <li>but after you cure it under the lamp and put a sealer on it, it is gorgeous!</li>
            <li>Now on to the gel polish, well it is absolutely gorgeous!</li>
            <li>If you do 2-3 coats it also looks beautiful.</li>
            <li>, good coverage, excellent with three coats.</li>
            <li>Great product for the price.</li>
            <li>Both gel and RNP are great.</li>
            <li>great for matching mani-pedi&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li>My daughter and I LOVE this beautiful holographic glitter gel polish!</li>
            <li>I loved that the two types of polish come together as a set.</li>
            <li>, it wears well and looks good.  </li>
            <li>GORGEOUS by itself or as a topcoat.</li>
            <li>This one is full of wonderful rainbow holo glitter.</li>
            <li>The glitter gel looks beautiful over any shade or by itself,  cures easily (LED or UV), and lasts over two weeks.</li>
            <li>If you love sparkle, this is the color for you!  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this polish!</li>

            <li>My kids love it also!</li>
            <li>I love the color!  </li>
            <li>I used it for my toes and it looks amazing.</li>
            <li>The sparkle is amazing in this polish.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy my own</li>
            <li>Two coats is good but three is even better.  </li>
            <li>This company has another color called Seriously Golden that is beautiful, too, but the vendor didn&#x27;t ship it</li>
            <li>This is the most amazing holo glitter.  </li>
            <li>Also, be sure to check out Lechat&#x27;s webpage so that you know what KIND of polish you are purchasing (ie:frost vs creme).  </li>
            <li>I just decided to add my own glitter before I do the top coat.  </li>
            <li>The dual makes it easy and cost effective to do your nails.</li>
            <li>The name is so accurate!</li>
            <li>I wear it over most of my creme colors because it hides a lot of my mistakes.  </li>
            <li>I have gotten SO many compliments on my nails</li>
            <li>I am THOROUGHLY impressed with the regular polish and how closely matched the colors are.  </li>
            <li>I love this polish.  </li>
            <li>I love this sparkle</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better than the ones they have.</li>
            <li>Soooo glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Too glitter-dense for top coat IMO.</li>
            <li>I love the holographic sparkles in this polish.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love this nail color.</li>
            <li>Yes, this polish is somewhat thick...but only because it is so packed with delicious sparkly glitter!</li>
            <li>Love this Gel so much&lt;br /&gt;last</li>
            <li>Once it is applied and cured the bits of glitter appear to glimmer and dance with the light!</li>
            <li>I have been using gel polish for almost a year now and have tried many brands.  </li>
            <li>Th is an awesome glittet!It goes on wonderfully-never a need for a third coat.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that that there was 2.  </li>
            <li>But I love the polish either way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been on my nails for more than 3 weeks, without a chip and without any lifting.  </li>
            <li>Awesome for an accent nail or even an entire manicure!</li>
            <li>Love this shade and this brand.</li>
            <li>and I am so in love.  </li>
            <li>This is going too be one of my favorite polish.  </li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>As a bonus, it stays on perfectly, and only takes 2 coats for a rich sparkle!</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li>It applies beautifully and is nearly opaque with 3 coats.</li>
            <li>I loved it so much I ordered two more.</li>
            <li>This is the FIRST of now 9 Lechat Duo Polishes that I currently own (and plan to buy more).  </li>
            <li>Great for accent nails or an entire manicure with stamping over top.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more, hoping to see the new Mood Perfect line on AMAZON SOON hopefully!!  </li>
            <li>The two polishes are great because i can do my daughter&#x27;s nail in the same color without all the steps!</li>
            <li>The color is fantastic (hence the two stars instead of one), but I will never use it again because of the way it applied.</li>
            <li>Such a great price also since you get both the shellac and matching toe polish.</li>
            <li>Just remember you need a Gel Polish curing light to set.</li>
            <li>The end result is a bit rough to the touch but can easily be remedied by a coat or two of a good top coat.</li>
            <li>This is truly my new favorite polish!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i received this in the mail.</li>
            <li>This is one of our all-time favorites, and the fact that it comes with the matching regular polish makes it even more appealing!</li>
            <li>so long, no chipping, no dulling just a great product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>First off I love the idea of a matching set of both polish mediums.</li>
            <li>This is my first gel from Le Chat, but you can bet I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li>they are a perfect match, go on smoothly and last a long time.  </li>
            <li>This product gives a nice coverage ofmulti-colored sparkle that shows compared to a leading brand of gold that really doesn&#x27;t show up much on my dark-colored gel nails.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super sparkly, and was opaque in 3 coats.  </li>
            <li>Super glittery, gel polish goes on well</li>
            <li>almost felt like it had been used good quality gel and lasted long</li>
            <li>I will definitely be buying more lechat products!</li>
            <li>Definitely will be buying more from LeChat!</li>
            <li>As an accent on a french manicure, it is stunning!</li>
            <li>The regular polish and the gel polish are equally amazing.</li>
            <li>It only took about 3 days to arrive, the packaging is nice, not smashed at all.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I only used the gel polish so far, and it applies and cures great.</li>
            <li>they sell gel polishes, most of which i own and they are 10$ for a bottle half the size of the lechat!</li>
            <li>It looks good over other colors or by itself.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the smell of it was very strong and GROSS.</li>
            <li>The sparkle is so intense, it truly is &amp;#34;hologram&amp;#34; diamond!</li>
            <li>I think out of all 9 polishes I had 1 that was not quite \\&quot;PERFECT\\&quot; but pretty darn close.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love holographic nail polish and have several brands both gel &amp; lacquer.</li>
            <li>This is the first gel glitter I&#x27;ve been able to use as the actual polish vs. as a topcoat.</li>
            <li>I love how this brand includes a matching bottle of regular polish.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have ever tried this brand</li>
            <li>The gel polish has enough sparkles for a top coat</li>
            <li>The gel definitely has more sparkle but the normal polish is very pretty too.</li>
            <li>would definitely order this again and highly recommend to anyone who loves glitter as much as I do :)</li>
            <li>for 12$ you get 2 LARGE size bottles</li>
            <li>I love the color, it&#x27;s just what I wanted and it delivered waaay before expected.</li>
            <li>The Hologram glitter makes it really sparkle.</li>
            <li>It really \\&quot;blings\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>and I really like the LECHAT brand.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Since one will be on my hands and the other on my toes, don&#x27;t think too many people would really notice anyway.  </li>
            <li>It has more glitter than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Such a fun set!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so vibrant</li>
            <li>While the regular polish of the duo set is stunningly beautiful and sparkly on my toes, the gel polish comes out as mostly clear, runny and even after 3 coats could hardly see the sparkly.</li>
            <li>The regular polish is thick because it is LOADED with beautiful shimmery bits of holographic sparkles that will completely cover your nail if you choose to use 2 to 3 coats.</li>
            <li>highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The bottle of regular polish matches exactly!</li>
            <li>I bought this a few months ago, used the regular nail polish a few times and it was AWESOME.</li>
            <li>pretty but takes multiple coats to cover</li>
            <li>So pretty inside and even prettier outside!</li>
            <li>Super disappointing, I was hoping this would look as nice as the regular polish.</li>
            <li>You get one gel polish and a normal polish of the same color.</li>
            <li>Both are exactly what I expected to look like.</li>
            <li>This is thick enough to wear alone as a neutral glitter which I love.  </li>
            <li>Once applied the polish does level itself out and becomes smooth like any other gel polish would be expected to do.</li>
            <li>but u have to be very light stroking because very thick and dry for longer time</li>
    </ol>

            <li> While the regular polish of the duo set is stunningly beautiful and sparkly on my toes, the gel polish comes out as mostly clear, runny and even after 3 coats could hardly see the sparkly.</li>
            <li> The regular polish is thick because it is LOADED with beautiful shimmery bits of holographic sparkles that will completely cover your nail if you choose to use 2 to 3 coats.</li>
            <li> highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The bottle of regular polish matches exactly!</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago, used the regular nail polish a few times and it was AWESOME.</li>
            <li> pretty but takes multiple coats to cover</li>
            <li> So pretty inside and even prettier outside!</li>
            <li> Super disappointing, I was hoping this would look as nice as the regular polish.</li>
            <li> You get one gel polish and a normal polish of the same color.</li>
            <li> Both are exactly what I expected to look like.</li>
            <li> This is thick enough to wear alone as a neutral glitter which I love.  </li>
            <li> Once applied the polish does level itself out and becomes smooth like any other gel polish would be expected to do.</li>
            <li> but u have to be very light stroking because very thick and dry for longer time</li>
            <li> kinda chunky didn&#x27;t seem to last very long</li>
            <li> High impact glitter with holographic glitter pieces in small and med-small sizes.</li>
            <li> It lasts so long too.</li>
            <li> After it got all over the place I realized how strangely greasy it is.</li>
            <li> Too bad as love the regular polish.</li>
            <li> My only disappointment with this particular color is that it takes at least 4 coats to achieve close to full coverage.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend the seller I used due to the long delivery time of 9 days.</li>
            <li> The consistency is a little different from Gelish</li>
            <li> I ordered the Technobeat Pink from another seller and it is a newer bottle that cures with both.</li>
            <li> This clear based polish is loaded with holographic glitter that gives some serious sparkle to your manicure.</li>
            <li> Stick to the other brands.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve applied other gel polished at home, and have never had any problems until now.</li>
            <li> It is just clear polish with a little bit of glitter, you can hardly see it on your nail.  </li>
            <li> The gel is a tiny bit thick</li>
            <li> It looks like a hologram and little diamonds.</li>
            <li> The glitter might be a little too dense for a topper</li>
            <li> I purchased this  a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular polish and was quite disappointed as it was very rough (glitter specs are maybe too big..).</li>
            <li> It was gloppy, way too thick, and was uneven when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> Just have a small amount of polish on the brush.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to put gell on my toes because its too hard to remove it myself</li>
            <li> Again, this polish is in a clear base which the picture does not suggest.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking they thin theirs.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, the polish I got is not compatible with LED lamps.</li>
            <li> I put a very thin coat on, and its was so runny</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if I somehow got a bad bottle???</li>
            <li> I was sick of all the salons being out of this color or not having it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had a color that I am disappointed with yet.</li>
            <li> Tried the gel polish today and it was HORRIBLE!!!!</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered this that you get one bottle for gel nails and one bottle for regular nail polish (they call it nail lacquer).  So you can use one on your gel nails and one on your toes to match!  This product gives a nice coverage ofmulti-colored sparkle that shows compared to a leading brand of gold that really doesn&#x27;t show up much on my dark-colored gel nails.  This company has another color called Seriously Golden that is beautiful, too, but the vendor didn&#x27;t ship it and I may have to get a refund from Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing holo glitter.  I wear it over most of my creme colors because it hides a lot of my mistakes.  The best part is that I can wear it alone.  If you love sparkle, this is the color for you!  It has more glitter than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this polish! I have gotten SO many compliments on my nails I cant even count! The sparkle is so intense, it truly is &amp;#34;hologram&amp;#34; diamond! This is truly my new favorite polish! As a bonus, it stays on perfectly, and only takes 2 coats for a rich sparkle!</li>
            <li> The name is so accurate! It looks like a hologram and little diamonds. I used it for my toes and it looks amazing. The regular polish and the gel polish are equally amazing. You dont need a bunch of coats to get the look in the picture. It has a lot of glitter in each application. The two polishes are great because i can do my daughter&#x27;s nail in the same color without all the steps! :) this brand rocks!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i received this in the mail. You get one gel polish and a normal polish of the same color. The gel definitely has more sparkle but the normal polish is very pretty too. The gel is a tiny bit thick but after you cure it under the lamp and put a sealer on it, it is gorgeous! for 12$ you get 2 LARGE size bottles I know at ulta they sell gel polishes, most of which i own and they are 10$ for a bottle half the size of the lechat! For just one! I will definitely be buying more lechat products!</li>
            <li> This is the FIRST of now 9 Lechat Duo Polishes that I currently own (and plan to buy more).  Needless to say LECHAT is currently my FAVORITE of 4 brands that I currently use.  I am THOROUGHLY impressed with the regular polish and how closely matched the colors are.  I think out of all 9 polishes I had 1 that was not quite \\&quot;PERFECT\\&quot; but pretty darn close.  Since one will be on my hands and the other on my toes, don&#x27;t think too many people would really notice anyway.  Will definitely be purchasing more, hoping to see the new Mood Perfect line on AMAZON SOON hopefully!!  Also, be sure to check out Lechat&#x27;s webpage so that you know what KIND of polish you are purchasing (ie:frost vs creme).  I prefer frosts and purchased a creme b/c sometimes you cannot tell with the posted photos.</li>
            <li> Love this brand and this color is amazing! Definitely will be buying more from LeChat! I haven&#x27;t had a color that I am disappointed with yet.</li>
            <li> I like how the polish looks when on but u have to be very light stroking because very thick and dry for longer time</li>
            <li> I love this polish.  I use the gel on my fingers and the regular one on my toes.  I didn&#x27;t realize when I ordered it that its actually 2 bottles one regular polish and one bottle of UV/led gel.  I don&#x27;t like to put gell on my toes because its too hard to remove it myself and I dont have a problem with keeping polish on my toes like I do on my fingernails.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I LOVE this beautiful holographic glitter gel polish! This is one of our all-time favorites, and the fact that it comes with the matching regular polish makes it even more appealing! This is exactly what I was looking for. The glitter gel looks beautiful over any shade or by itself,  cures easily (LED or UV), and lasts over two weeks. As an accent on a french manicure, it is stunning!</li>
            <li> I love this sparkle it&#x27;s perfect and came with the matching lacquer for a pedi. Great product for the price. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I was sick of all the salons being out of this color or not having it. I decided to buy my own so I always had it. It&#x27;s better than the ones they have. I&#x27;m thinking they thin theirs. This one is full of wonderful rainbow holo glitter. Soooo glad I bought it. My salon was out this week and immediately after being bummed I remembered I had it in my car. Saved!</li>
            <li> Both gel and RNP are great. Almost opaque in two coats. Too glitter-dense for top coat IMO.</li>
            <li> kinda chunky didn&#x27;t seem to last very long almost felt like it had been used good quality gel and lasted long</li>
            <li> pretty but takes multiple coats to cover</li>
            <li> I love the color, it&#x27;s just what I wanted and it delivered waaay before expected.</li>
            <li> I love the holographic sparkles in this polish. It looks good over other colors or by itself. Again, this polish is in a clear base which the picture does not suggest. I gave it 4 stars because it is so versatile, but not 5 because it wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting (from the picture).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a glitter freak and I absolutely love this nail color.</li>
            <li> This gel polish was a nightmare to work with after a year of using Gelish and Shellac. It was gloppy, way too thick, and was uneven when I put it on.  The color is fantastic (hence the two stars instead of one), but I will never use it again because of the way it applied. Stick to the other brands.</li>
            <li> While the regular polish of the duo set is stunningly beautiful and sparkly on my toes, the gel polish comes out as mostly clear, runny and even after 3 coats could hardly see the sparkly. Definitely not the solid sparkle nail color I was looking for. Too bad as love the regular polish.</li>
            <li> these perfect match polishes are great.  they are a perfect match, go on smoothly and last a long time.  great for matching mani-pedi&#x27;s.  highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this glitter gel polish! I used it here with one coat. If you do 2-3 coats it also looks beautiful. The Hologram glitter makes it really sparkle.</li>
            <li> Yes, this polish is somewhat thick...but only because it is so packed with delicious sparkly glitter! Once applied the polish does level itself out and becomes smooth like any other gel polish would be expected to do. The regular lacquer is just as packed with the same glitter, doesn&#x27;t look anything like the photo provided by another customer. Both are exactly what I expected to look like. It only took about 3 days to arrive, the packaging is nice, not smashed at all.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely order this again and highly recommend to anyone who loves glitter as much as I do :)</li>
            <li> Absolutely incredible! This is not a topper - it has 3-d depth and sparkle!</li>
            <li> This clear based polish is loaded with holographic glitter that gives some serious sparkle to your manicure. It applies beautifully and is nearly opaque with 3 coats. Great for accent nails or an entire manicure with stamping over top. The glitter might be a little too dense for a topper but I haven&#x27;t tried it as one yet.</li>
            <li> A little disappointed, the polish I got is not compatible with LED lamps. There are newer bottles of LeChat that cure with LED and UV, but this one does not have the sticker indicating this. I ordered the Technobeat Pink from another seller and it is a newer bottle that cures with both.</li>
            <li> I loved that the two types of polish come together as a set. The consistency is a little different from Gelish but once I got used to it, it worked great. I always get compliments on this sparkly color. It really \\&quot;blings\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Love this Gel so much&lt;br /&gt;last so long, no chipping, no dulling just a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Always get so many complainant where everywhere I go !!!!!</li>
            <li> I love holographic nail polish and have several brands both gel &amp; lacquer. First off I love the idea of a matching set of both polish mediums. The regular polish is thick because it is LOADED with beautiful shimmery bits of holographic sparkles that will completely cover your nail if you choose to use 2 to 3 coats. The end result is a bit rough to the touch but can easily be remedied by a coat or two of a good top coat. Love it! Now on to the gel polish, well it is absolutely gorgeous! Once it is applied and cured the bits of glitter appear to glimmer and dance with the light! The colors bouncing when light hits my nails remind me of beautiful crystal prisms in the sunlight. I definitely recommend this set of polish to everyone wishing to add drama and excitement to your nails. I would not recommend the seller I used due to the long delivery time of 9 days.</li>
            <li> I purchased this  a few weeks ago and I really like the LECHAT brand.  My only disappointment with this particular color is that it takes at least 4 coats to achieve close to full coverage.  Other than that, it wears well and looks good.  I have been using gel polish for almost a year now and have tried many brands.  I will continue to buy LECHAT brand.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular polish and was quite disappointed as it was very rough (glitter specs are maybe too big..). But, the UV cured lacquer ... Lovely!!</li>
            <li> Th is an awesome glittet!It goes on wonderfully-never a need for a third coat. This is the first gel glitter I&#x27;ve been able to use as the actual polish vs. as a topcoat. It&#x27;s so vibrant it&#x27;s almost distracting! I love how this brand includes a matching bottle of regular polish. I use on my toes to match!</li>
            <li> I would give this 1000 stars, 2 coats and there isn&#x27;t a spot left on your nail that isn&#x27;t covered! This is the first time I have ever tried this brand but I will definitely buy it again! So pretty inside and even prettier outside! How can you beat the low price for two bottles of polish! My kids love it also! Everyone has glitter toes! The picture doesn&#x27;t do any justice!</li>
            <li> Love the fact that that there was 2.  I used the regular on my toes.  The gel polish has enough sparkles for a top coat but if you want build up it will take 3 coats.  I just decided to add my own glitter before I do the top coat.  But I love the polish either way. I will definately buy this brand again,</li>
            <li> No chipping. No fading. Fast delivery. I used 3 coats of the hologram diamond glitter gel. In the pic im also wearing lechat rosemantic mood gel polish.</li>
            <li> This Le Chat gel polish is super-long-wearing - I&#x27;m wearing it now.  It&#x27;s been on my nails for more than 3 weeks, without a chip and without any lifting.  I love the color!  It&#x27;s super sparkly, and was opaque in 3 coats.  This is my first gel from Le Chat, but you can bet I&#x27;ll buy more.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!!! Super glittery, gel polish goes on well, good coverage, excellent with three coats. Awesome for an accent nail or even an entire manicure! The bottle of regular polish matches exactly! Such a fun set! It looks very similar to Gelish Water Field with only one coat, but with three coats it is opaque glitter.</li>
            <li> Love this shade and this brand. It lasts so long too. I feel like a billion bucks when I wear this shade in vegas.</li>
            <li> This gel is so awesome and the sparkle is insane!!!!! I loved it so much I ordered two more.</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months ago, used the regular nail polish a few times and it was AWESOME. Tried the gel polish today and it was HORRIBLE!!!! I&#x27;m wondering if I somehow got a bad bottle??? I put a very thin coat on, and its was so runny it was ALL over my fingers. After it got all over the place I realized how strangely greasy it is. Not to mention the smell of it was very strong and GROSS. I&#x27;ve applied other gel polished at home, and have never had any problems until now. If I could have given it 0 stars I would have. Super disappointing, I was hoping this would look as nice as the regular polish.</li>
            <li> This is thick enough to wear alone as a neutral glitter which I love.  I will definitely be ordering this brand from now on.  Such a great price also since you get both the shellac and matching toe polish.</li>
            <li> I read two review saying how glittery this polish is, I however did not find that to be the case.  It is just clear polish with a little bit of glitter, you can hardly see it on your nail.  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> I just received my Hologram Diamond dual set and I am so in love.  I only used the gel polish so far, and it applies and cures great. Two coats is good but three is even better.  This is going too be one of my favorite polish.  Highly recommend!!!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this stuff!! The dual makes it easy and cost effective to do your nails. High impact glitter with holographic glitter pieces in small and med-small sizes. GORGEOUS by itself or as a topcoat. (need UV topcoat as well though)</li>
            <li> The sparkle is amazing in this polish. Want a dusting of bling? Just have a small amount of polish on the brush. Want an explosion of bling? You can do that too. I love this polish. Just remember you need a Gel Polish curing light to set.</li>
