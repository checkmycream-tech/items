            <li>These are really great.  </li>
            <li>Great for travel.  </li>
            <li>She is happy with it.</li>

            <li>Great affordable night guard.</li>
            <li>They work great for me</li>
            <li>They work great.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re great and have helped keep away grinding headaches.</li>
            <li>but now that I&#x27;m used to, I&#x27;m happy I got these.</li>
            <li>Been using for 2 weeks now and they work great.</li>
            <li>These work great.</li>
            <li>great start.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>It works great and is affordable.</li>
            <li>These are great-</li>
            <li>These are great.</li>
            <li>Well, I have to say they are truly AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>This product is great for beginners and will give you a good idea if you need to spend the money on a custom &#x27;boil &amp; bite&#x27; or if you&#x27;re a light-grinder and can get away with these.</li>
            <li>Perfect solution for my grinding, good fit &amp; great value for money</li>
            <li>Very easy!</li>
            <li>I imagine they&#x27;ll soon be sued out of business by the loved ones of people who have choked to death.</li>
            <li>Does the job, not as good as the custom made one from the dentist but a good replacement.</li>
            <li>The plastic seems to make a perfect fit after warming to body temperature.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m delighted with Plackers.  </li>
            <li>This is the cheapest and really good solution if you grind your teeth at night or driving your car in traffic.</li>
            <li>Good price but meh on product.</li>
            <li>The fit was perfect although I did find myself taking out in my sleep.</li>
            <li>but I wore one for a good month</li>
            <li>It looks good.</li>
            <li>wish I knew about them because they are a good price.</li>
            <li>These will leave indentions on the inside of your gums if they don&#x27;t fit perfectly....</li>
            <li>the good thing, is you get a pack of 10.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li>but i read online saliva is good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product if you have these problems.</li>
            <li>I thought this was a good way to try the guard without spending a pile of money on the custom one from the dentist.</li>
            <li>These guards are a good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li>There good for vacation or while working if you need daytime help.</li>
            <li>My dentist told me that it would be a good idea for me to get a mouth guard.  </li>
            <li>It is a good option.</li>
            <li>Good product and good delivery</li>
            <li>Good luck</li>
            <li>Good for travel / overnight bag extras</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t sleep with the full teeth covers, but these are perfect.  </li>
            <li>I gave them four stars because the fit was not the best, but it was effective for me.</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>Very very timely service, and product in excellent condition upon arrival.</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I ended up having more pain after using it!</li>
            <li>I get lots more than 3 days wear from one of the night guards!  </li>
            <li>I cannot remember how very, very many &amp;#34;mouth guards&amp;#34; of every kind I have purchased for sleeping.  </li>
            <li>I love these!  </li>
            <li>Pretty awesome.</li>
            <li>and I wish you a happier more restful sleep!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also great because you can pack them easily if you&#x27;re going out of town or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li>These are amazing.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice to have a mouth guard that is disposable, have more then one and at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Tried to make my own custom guards</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money again.</li>
            <li>and they took forever to warm up to where they didn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li>She liked them</li>
            <li>It was the kind that molds to your teeth after submerging them in water, etc.  </li>
            <li>However, use your own discrestion as to when you need to discard.</li>
            <li>These caused me more harm then good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to break of the floor and need to be replaced like the $400 kind you get at the dentist either.</li>
            <li>But, if you do splurge for the fancy dentist kind, you won&#x27;t look like a wrestler when you wear it, either.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will buy more!</li>
            <li>but are more effective at keeping the grinding to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Near perfect.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed with these and will get them until I can have a professional one made.</li>
            <li>Fantastic, very good, wonderfull.&lt;br /&gt;Congratulation to this excelent supplier!&lt;br /&gt;Thank very much!</li>
            <li>I have found it to be very comfortable and it seems to be breaking my clenching habit.  </li>
            <li>very comfortable and helpful</li>
            <li>Very comfortable but must have an allergy as now</li>
            <li>very comfortable and is still in place when I wake up.</li>
            <li>They are individually packed, which is nice, and are the perfect size - now, I say that for me, but to be honest, is that true for all?</li>
            <li>Safe, comfortable, good price and easy to use.</li>
            <li>and I both enjoy the comfort and protection these guards provide!</li>
            <li>much better than the mold to  your mouth version.</li>
            <li>I have been using the dr brux guard that fits better and for me works, after a bit trimming.  </li>
            <li>mouth guards and these work better than all of them.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>It can be used on the top or bottom.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many mouth guards and every one has always had issues.</li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also able to use one for a lot longer than 3 days :)</li>
            <li>I get a lot more usage out of one so</li>
            <li>I thought these might be able to help.  </li>
            <li>They are not bulky like many of the mouth guards you find in stores.  </li>
            <li>This is a very helpful, useful product and I am very happy I found this item on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>The box says you can use 3 times, but I get many more uses from each one.</li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t keep it in my mouth for more than an hour at a time.</li>
            <li>Wearing these retrained the way my jaw sits within a couple of weeks and seems to continue to get even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Disposable...I would like to be able to sanitize and reuse...</li>
            <li>If you have had braces, these will be even better.</li>
            <li>Still a good deal and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Need I say more?</li>
            <li>However, they sometimes make the top or bottom of my gums hurt, depending on how I wear it the night before.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>I was not even sure if I grind my teeth at night</li>
            <li>I love that there is no adjusting</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they are disposable</li>
            <li>This will be my second order and I am very happy with them!</li>
            <li>I found that they &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; better when worn on the bottom.</li>
            <li>I like that you can place it on your top teeth or your bottom teeth</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did not invest in a $100 customized guard-</li>
            <li>I use mine for more than the 3 days each</li>
            <li>I wear it on the top, and it stays in place, preventing me from clenching or grinding my teeth or from biting my tongue.</li>
            <li>With the cost of having a dentist make one of these this purchase was a better alternative.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gotten more than the three days out of each one.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve found they are a lot better</li>
            <li>Laying it on my bottom teeth works well for me and seems safer then on the top teeth.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s probably better to take it out until you are finished.</li>
            <li>Putting it on the top teeth doesn&#x27;t seem practical to me</li>
            <li>I guess some people have more of a grinding problem than others.</li>
            <li>i use it for more than 5 times.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>(you can choose top of bottom row of teeth) and they do not fall out overnight</li>
            <li>Love the way that they are disposable</li>
            <li>would Be the most you can use them.</li>
            <li>The guard can be worn on your top or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li>and I use them every night gladly.</li>
            <li>These mouth guards are much better than those that you need to mend in boiling water.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel safe sleeping in these Plackers.  </li>
            <li>I did use them during the day which is okay if you clench your teeth during the day- like while driving or petting cute animals.</li>
            <li>Better price on Amazon than Rite Aid</li>
            <li>After wearing them one night my jaw was even more sore than it was to begin with...</li>
            <li>I am SO GLAD that I found these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>am pleased with them and they don&#x27;t pop out of my mouth.</li>
            <li>Love these.</li>
            <li>I love these, beats paying hundreds for.</li>
            <li>I do use one more than the 3 times recommended.  </li>
            <li>I have tried sooooo many mouth guards.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve passed out so many that I&#x27;ve got people hooked on these, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear these on my top teeth because they fall out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li>After my dog ate my Dentist made mouth guard, I wanted to find a better replacement.  </li>
            <li>This product is cheap and it works!</li>
            <li>and I like them much better than the custom fitted ones.</li>
            <li>But, tried it at home and was able to get two weeks of wear from it.  </li>
            <li>I am able to wear them more than one night.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get a \\&quot;boil &amp; bite\\&quot; and I love it.</li>
            <li>more often&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sometimes it gets pinched from how it is stored in them package and doesn&#x27;t fit well (kind of a v instead of a u)&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>sure I have a preference yet.</li>
            <li>I do love my teeth but $700 is still a lot for a mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That saves a lot more money than the custom one from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Furthermore, these are comfortable!</li>
            <li>I then started thinking why can&#x27;t anyone make a guard that just blocked the teeth from touching while not having 2 pounds of plastic in my mouth?  </li>
            <li>They are the MOST comfortable guards I have ever had!  </li>
            <li>I wear them on my top teeth.  </li>
            <li>+, spending $3 to find out if this is a good guard for you is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>+, spending $3 to find out if this is a good guard for you is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>you wear them on the top,</li>
            <li>Works well and can be used more than once.</li>
            <li>and I would wake up in even more pain than before.</li>
            <li>You just put it in (top or bottom, doesn&#x27;t matter) and fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>They work on both top and bottom</li>
            <li>I mostly clench my teeth at night from the moment I close my eyes.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure that I needed a guard, but after using this product for over 30 days - it&#x27;s a five star with me.  </li>
            <li>You can try them on the bottom teeth or the top.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Compared to the dentist made guards, or the ones that you drop in boiling water then bight into, this design is much more sensible.</li>
            <li>These are ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to put it in again and again it happened.  </li>
            <li>so I have a basis in comparison and can honestly say these are the most comfortable night guard I have used to date.</li>
            <li>They stay in and i can wear them top or bottom.</li>
            <li>You can also get a lot more uses than just the three they mention on the box.</li>
            <li>I put them on my top teeth for comfort.</li>
            <li>I ordered it because I thought it might be an alternative to (as another reviewer hilariously suggested) looking like a wrestler when donning it.</li>
            <li>but it broke after many years of abuse in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>I *love</li>
            <li>Worked okay.  </li>
            <li>I love these.  </li>
            <li>I use more than suggested.</li>
            <li>I have used them way many more times than 3.</li>
            <li>Using for two months and extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>Flexes very nicely and very lightweight.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t quite know how they work, but they do a great job and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Oh my lucky stars I am so glad I found these!  </li>
            <li>They arrived quickly and I love them!</li>
            <li>Bruxism is strong may not be able to use them more than once&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty good.....</li>
            <li>After the first couple days I find a guard deforms a bit, but after that retains it&#x27;s shape fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel like a football player with a mouth full of plastic, but do the job nicely.</li>
            <li>Nice to be able to have a fresh guard when desired.</li>
            <li>easy to use -- and so many for the price</li>
            <li>Wearing on top was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>For me, I found it more comfortable to use them on my top teeth.</li>
            <li>tried to make these work three times and in each case although they sat securely on the bottom jaw of my mouth when I went to sleep and didn&#x27;t move despite having them in my mouth for a couple of hours before I went to sleep just to be sure they were fitting well</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit my mouth perfectly, but enough to make it work.</li>
            <li>Most comfortable of the 3 and in some ways I like it better than the dentist&#x27;s NTI one.  </li>
            <li>While a professionally fit guard is probably the best way to go, I simply cannot afford that.</li>
            <li>I have found that wearing them on the top teeth seems more comfortable because they contact your tongue less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fortunately, they are VERY COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li>Then at night, before I use it, I clean it again, finishing off with some mouthwash and off I go!</li>
            <li>These work great, fit very well and are comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li>but still ok since they&#x27;re so cheap.</li>
            <li>Much more comfortable than dentist-made guard.</li>
            <li>It seems to do the job well but after using it I think the risk of choking on the plastic is far too great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also important to see a doctor or take an anti-inflammatory and be more mindful of when you are clenching your jaw.  </li>
            <li>These have been great so far.</li>
            <li>Thank you for the wonderful product, these are getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li>I really enjoy these and use them most nights.</li>
            <li>The Plackers Mouth Guard was really good, but found that I grind my teeth so much that they could not withstand the abuse that my teeth could deliver for 3 days.</li>
            <li>I know other reviews mentioned they almost choked on them etc, but if you are a clincher, these are perfect for you.</li>
            <li>product is definitely unique, and it&#x27;s perhaps a leap of faith to try, but I&#x27;m really pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m impressed with the quality and they &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; extremely well and don&#x27;t move in my mouth at night.  </li>
            <li>These on the other hand work GREAT!</li>
            <li>May not work for everyone but seems to be just what I needed, they stay in place very good - much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Easy to wash</li>
            <li>Easy to use and no problems with braces</li>
            <li>best.&lt;br /&gt;Being an engineer myself I can see this is a well engineered product and easy to work with but</li>
            <li>It does not stay in place and it falls very quickly.</li>
            <li>night.&lt;br /&gt;Actually getting used to it was easy.</li>
            <li>I have a ritual now every morning of trying to find it as it gets spit out easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I travel a lot and they are easy to travel with</li>
            <li>I like that I can clean each guard while I use it for three days and then dispose of it, which I feel is more hygienic.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have to say that of you are a hardcore teethgrinder or grit your jaws strongly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this product on my first try on Amazon.</li>
            <li>so first I tried the kind that you boil and mold yourself.</li>
            <li>Better off buying a full mouth guard.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still good as new (</li>
            <li>Sometimes hurts mu gums otherise fine</li>
            <li>and my teeth are fine.  </li>
            <li>So much more comfortable than a full mouth guard.</li>
            <li>and it was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>However 7 of them were fine which lasted for quite some time.</li>
            <li>Comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
            <li>I found them to be easy to use and comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I started using this and even though it says you can use each guard for a maximum of three days, I accidentally used mine for 5 and it was still fine.</li>
            <li>They say they are disposable and for one-time use, but I have used it now for four nights and it is in fine shape.  </li>
            <li>They say they are disposable and for one-time use, but I have used it now for four nights and it is in fine shape.  </li>
            <li>we like that they fit easily and can be disguarded after a couple uses.</li>
            <li>They are cheap and easy, like me.</li>
            <li>I use these nightly and it has helps tremendously!</li>
            <li>Light weight &amp; strong.</li>
            <li>My husband bites while he&#x27;s asleep, so he chews them up rather quickly!</li>
            <li>The guard is extremely light, flexible, and comfortable, but protects my back molars beautifully.  </li>
            <li>Cheap, easy, comfortable.</li>
            <li>Its a huge bargain buying these.</li>
            <li>Huge improvement from full-on mouthguards.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bulky or huge.  </li>
            <li>Huge and bulky</li>
            <li>They are for clenching, primarily at night.  </li>
            <li>They do a great job, especially for the price, but I did sometimes wake up with sore teeth, as though I had been clenching it.</li>
            <li>Not at all comfortable putting these in my mouth to sleep with</li>
            <li>Although the guard is compact and light as a feather, I haven&#x27;t been perforating them.  </li>
            <li>i used it was really comfortable</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are fantastic.  </li>
            <li>they are comfortable, inexpensive, and you can wear them way longer than a day or two as suggested by the packaging.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you grind your teeth every night, but as someone who grinds their teeth when they are stressed these fit the bill.</li>
            <li>BUT these are the best guards I have found so far and the only ones I&#x27;ve been able to keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li>These are not at all comfortable.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit and just fall out a million times during the night.</li>
            <li>so we thought maybe this would work for him, just couldn&#x27;t get it to fit</li>
            <li>They are comfortable, they keep me from grinding my teeth.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and to clean.  </li>
            <li>I checked out what was available online and chose the Plackers mouth guard</li>
            <li>It is comfortable, cushions</li>
            <li>It gave immediate relief from my problem and it is comfortable.</li>
            <li>I could not get a comfortable feel in my mouth - no matter what I did.</li>
            <li>I tried &#x27;DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit&#x27; and</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to clean and take care of as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not such a great savings after all.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no cut to fit, or boiling.  </li>
            <li>Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit ,, now those are grreat.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li>these seems to fit well and don&#x27;t bother her while sleeping.  </li>
            <li>so when I leave for awhile, there is one already available, as I use to forget my NTI often.  </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also nonlatex, an important consideration if you&#x27;re allergic.</li>
            <li>This product is now as important to me as Plackers, Sonicare, Prevident, and The Doctors BrushPics in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li>How can \\&quot;one size fit</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sleep Right is adjustable, but abraids my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Plackers can be worn on top or bottom arcade,</li>
            <li>Most I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t feel right overnight...</li>
            <li>It is very useful, but sometimes it get out of the mouth because they are not adjusted to the bite.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Great product but no for people who grind hard - I occasionally grind my teeth and have found these are perfect -no falling apart as the boil to fit products</li>
            <li>can get a good 4-5 days wear out of each piece, by handwashing them in the morning, carry them easily for sleepovers, and sleep in the same room with someone without waking them up.</li>
            <li>I originally had an NTI fitted for me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So worth it!</li>
            <li>After a couple of nights I had significant improvement in the pain in my jaw from TMJ.</li>
            <li>How economical!</li>
            <li>Works well for me - no more tooth wear from night grinding, it stays in place -- an excellent value.</li>
            <li>After the first week, I managed to find the most comfy spot and keep the night guard in.</li>
            <li>I did see one person who had said they woke up choking on the unit, but figured they must have had a unique experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like how I can wear them on top or bottom but the flat plastic piece that keeps the top and bottom teeth from touching causes pain for hours after taking it</li>
            <li>They still dont fit too good but work as short term relief.  </li>
            <li>I just clean it every morning.</li>
            <li>They are SUPER comfortable and helpful.</li>
            <li>I wake up, I rinse mine off and put it into a clean baggie or container.</li>
            <li>You simply clean it with toothpaste and toothbrush each morning.  </li>
            <li>, so if I lose or forget it no biggie&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have to clean them&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li>I have tried 3 different over the counter replacements and feel this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li>I love this product very easy and comfortable to wear, will definitely order these again.</li>
            <li>This is significant since he uses a sleep apnea machine and used to neglect the use of his mouth guard since he felt very constricted with so many oral devices at night.  </li>
            <li>Right after I saw the blood!).  </li>
            <li>They fit fine and are not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a better result than the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard - I never tried a &#x27;real&#x27; ($400) fitted guard.</li>
            <li>I bought a $40 night guard but it ended up being too soft (it was the kind that forms after biting into to it after softening it in boiling water)</li>
            <li>Comfortable and useful.  </li>
            <li>My mouth felt like it was full of cotton balls</li>
            <li>These are good for the occasional TMJ pain that I experience.</li>
            <li>area that in the morn, my guard would be full of blood</li>
            <li>I just make sure to rinse it very well and use Listerine once in awhile.</li>
            <li>I have been grinding my teeth for well over a decade and have worn away probably a good 1/6 of my teeth height to the point that I am finally feeling the sensitivity after having worn away the enamel and have gone into the tooth portion.  </li>
            <li>Besides that, good simple solution to grinding teeth!</li>
            <li>Putting one of these in really helps, and soothes (for the lack of a better term)</li>
            <li>* these about as much as one can *love* any mouth guard, but</li>
            <li>me, as a clencher, I find that having them in my mouth makes me involuntarily clench my teeth more, which makes my neck and jaw hurt just as much in the mornings even if it protects my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Also wear when exercising to prevent to much pressure and helped prevent more teeth cracking.</li>
            <li>&quot; the guard doesn&#x27;t get all gross and gunky; a quick rinse and perhaps a dunk in mouthwash and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They fit just right.</li>
            <li>have a very small mouth, this may not be the best one for me...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t think these were the greatest fit for an average adult.</li>
            <li>Will continue to use these, at this price, for certain!!</li>
            <li>and they have helped my BF tremendously with his tooth grinding problem.</li>
            <li>and it quickly went away.  </li>
            <li>and they are great for traveling and a good way to decide if you want to invest in a expensive guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li>Walmart Wallgreens and most others sell something very similar for much much more..</li>
            <li>The cushion between the molars is adequate for grinding and clenching protection but just don&#x27;t stay in during sleep.</li>
            <li>This caused tremendous stress/pain on the injury</li>
            <li>I have a bigger mouth and this guard actually fits perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>I have a bigger mouth and this guard actually fits perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>10 get used up fairly quickly...</li>
            <li>These might be perfect for a teen, or smaller mouths.</li>
            <li>Sure beats the high price of one from my dentist.</li>
            <li>I did notice I was biting the guard more than normal, but I learned to stop doing that was well.  </li>
            <li>It floats freely in your mouth and when I fell asleep the first night wearing one I awoke choking with one end lodged in my throat.</li>
            <li>and they fit good enough to where I have no issues at all really.</li>
            <li>When you first &#x27;make&#x27; it, you do boil it, which is the closest thing you can get to a &#x27;custom fit&#x27; without paying your dentist $400.</li>
            <li>I think they are pretty comfortable and do not bother me when I am trying to sleep.</li>
            <li>There are lots of other mouth guards that are comparable in price that fit better and provide more comfort.</li>
            <li>i think 2 or 3 more nights, and i will have to put a new one in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>more comfortable to use than a full tooth guard, generic or prescription.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is EXACTLY what I needed!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Plackers!!</li>
            <li>But these are a great starter if you want to see if you can live with one before shelling out the big bucks.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the way they are individually packaged and easy to take along for a road trip.</li>
            <li>Band that goes in front is too large to fit.</li>
            <li>and I think would do the job, but since they are too large, they don&#x27;t fit around the front of my gumline as they should and don&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li>Luckily, the dentist from whom I had ordered the $600 mouth guard ($1300 if I used insurance!) messed up the process and I was able to get my money back.  </li>
            <li>He came across these mouth guards and they are so sleek and inexpensive that they really are a fantastic alternative.  </li>
            <li>and they fit my mouth very well.</li>
            <li>But, they fit well and really do the job</li>
            <li>Fit very well</li>
            <li>do seem to fit my mouth very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit in your mouth very well.</li>
            <li>I ended up getting a more professional mouth guard from my dentist.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve become more conscious of my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>and he suggested that even OTC mouthguards are extremely useful in creating a barrier so that your teeth do not grind overnight.</li>
            <li>Tried a couple different brands so far and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t laugh.  </li>
            <li>Wish it was more soft</li>
            <li>My only issue with the mouth guards is attributable to my own fault.</li>
            <li>And so nice to know that I have a whole supply of them waiting for me when I feel like this one is too old.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the try, if you are having difficulties with grinding your teeth.  </li>
            <li>I brush it daily with toothpaste and sometimes wash it with warm water and soap.</li>
            <li>I have kind of mixed feeling about these after using them for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is simple in design and incredibly effective.  </li>
            <li>They are super easy to use, last much longer than the suggested time of usage, and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li>I still have to try the other two brands I bough, but frankly, the Plackers guard is great, and I don&#x27;t really see a need to make the switch at this point.  </li>
            <li>I still have to try the other two brands I bough, but frankly, the Plackers guard is great, and I don&#x27;t really see a need to make the switch at this point.  </li>
            <li>We had been using full-wrap mouth guards, but decided to try these due to the good reviews and the affordable price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re also small and can be worn either on top or bottom, whichever is more comfortable.</li>
            <li>For the money it&#x27;s a good alternative to other stuff out there</li>
            <li>Right guards to compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It fits just right.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>When I grind my teeth my mouth slides to the right and</li>
            <li>(if I calculated right).  </li>
            <li>right.</li>
            <li>but it really didn&#x27;t fit correctly from the first.</li>
            <li>These are small and perfect as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>Worth trying since the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t tried anything like these before, but they fit in the mouth easily and keep you teeth separated well enough.</li>
            <li>Small and great for travel</li>
            <li>I have a small mouth and this works great.</li>
            <li>I, too, think you can wear them a lot more than just 3 nights...as long as you clean them</li>
            <li>My dentist has strongly recommended a guard for many years, but due to the cost, and the fact that they are not covered by insurance, I refused.  </li>
            <li>It no longer fit after new dental work</li>
            <li>I think they are right when they say talk to your dentist first.  </li>
            <li>It was much more comfortable than I expected.  </li>
            <li>I have spent more money and time at my dentist from my clenching and grinding than I&#x27;m comfortable admitting.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>just the front portion which fit to my teeth, and the bottom spacer portion to keep my teeth from touching each other.  </li>
            <li>Still, they&#x27;re fairly durable, and you can wear them a little longer than the prescribed 3 days</li>
            <li>These little \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; things are great - small, flexible and so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li>My most obvious discomfort changed as soon as I started using it.  </li>
            <li>highly highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li>These can each last for much more than 3 days</li>
            <li>it stayed in place and did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>I decided to try an otc mouthguard first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m more of a clencher (especially night-time) than a grinder.  </li>
            <li>wash with hot soapy water every AM</li>
            <li>and sure enough I had just gotten to sleep when I woke up chocking on it.</li>
            <li>These work pretty well to alleviate some of the pressure of grinding.</li>
            <li>When I first took it out of the box I was concerned because it&#x27;s flimsy feeling.  </li>
            <li>Stayed exactly where I put it.  </li>
            <li>also love it because I don&#x27;t look like a total freak going to bed!</li>
            <li>B003TUQCXM Plackers Stop Grinding Disposable Dental Night Protector]], and it came undone during the first night, so I hastily ordered these instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is the first night guard that doesn&#x27;t make me gag.</li>
            <li>It has finally given me morning free of headaches from grinding!</li>
            <li>He suggested that I try these first.</li>
            <li>I used these successfully for a bit, but eventually decided that they were not safe.  </li>
            <li>I have used a similar design in a non-disposable, but it was more substantial and I never had an issue with it shifting around.  </li>
            <li>and of course you&#x27;re aware you have something in your mouth.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t slip, it&#x27;s soft and comfortable and I can&#x27;t grind.  </li>
            <li>They last way more than 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Simple, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that sleeping would be a problem and that I would not be able to forget that something was in my mouth all</li>
            <li>I bought my first package of Grind No Mores at a drugstore.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s okay to use for several weeks.</li>
            <li>This is my first product review on Amazon.</li>
            <li>The second one was better and helped cushion my nighttime teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>I used this product for the first time on 1-25-2013.</li>
            <li>finally got a dental guard made by my dentist and that definately does a better job and will not fall apart on you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>On my most recent visit to my dentist, she sold me a mouth guard to try again, which I did.  </li>
            <li>In fact the Plackers website offers a free sample</li>
            <li>In fact the Plackers website offers a free sample</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using my first one after 2.5 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve woken up so many times with sore and achy jaws because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one of the regular OTC bite guards where you have to cut it to size but</li>
            <li>And the first morning that I woke up from wearing one I did not have any jaw pain whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>This product does what it is designed to do, and it&#x27;s very affordable!</li>
            <li>I use each one for several days, more than the three they recommend, and a box lasts me quite awhile.  </li>
            <li>Most likely not.</li>
            <li>would rather just eliminate the stress that leads me to grind in the first place - working on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;You can definitely use them for more than three nights if you rinse them in the morning, so</li>
            <li>You can make a 10 pack last for a month or more if you don&#x27;t need to wear one every night.</li>
            <li>better deal then in stores, definitely helps with grinding, prevents my jaw from hurting in the morning, not bulky either so I like that</li>
            <li>These are good for the day for me, for a few hours...</li>
            <li>They did not fit as well as I had hoped, but surprisingly did the job.</li>
            <li>Ok, but only as a temporary fix before seeing a dentist to get a real mouth guard fit for your own teeth, they are not much more money...</li>
            <li>It comes in a pack of 10, which is good, and even after a three month use, I&#x27;m still on the first one, it hasn&#x27;t wear off enough or reap anywhere for me to switch to the next one.</li>
            <li>I would say I have an average sized mouth, but can&#x27;t say for sure!</li>
            <li>Although it is your choice to wear either on top or on the bottom, I wear mine on the bottom, with the soft, very comfortable plastic covering the tops of the molars that I seem intent on destroying in my sleep.  </li>
            <li>These can be purchased at most pharmacies that are well stocked or here on Amazon for about half the price I was paying at that pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;The super thin design of these make them easy to wear on either the top or bottom of your mouth depending on what is comfortable for you.</li>
            <li>It fits easily in the mouth, does not get in the way, it can be situated on the top row or bottom row of teeth, it has a cut out in front and two small bite wings, one on each side.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m puzzled by all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I am going to try another mouthguard brand next time and see if it is better or worse, but either way, I know this is a GREAT product and WORKS</li>
            <li>The Plackers guard was the first one I chose since it had the absolute smallest profile.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using it for as long as it lasts and will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>I plan on using it for as long as it lasts and will be buying more.  </li>
            <li>Not bad as far as night guards go.</li>
            <li>Low cost - and better than a high priced dentists guard.</li>
            <li>These guys are strong and last longer than 3 days.</li>
            <li>Not very good doesn&#x27;t hold good in your mouth</li>
            <li>I love that there&#x27;s no hard or extra plastic.  </li>
            <li>Being too large, it hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li>I find that I spit it out during the night, mostly because it&#x27;s loose and doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li>These have worked for me for the last couple of years very well.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to get used to, and for me they absolutely did the trick.</li>
            <li>They are very light, almost delicate, and extremely comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li>These little guards are so handy and really work well.  </li>
            <li>The only suggestion that I have is that I would much rather pay a little more to have one or two more placed in the pack.</li>
            <li>These are comfortable and minimal (doesn&#x27;t cover your front teeth), so when my husband wakes up and looks at me I can smile at him without looking like a wrestler.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very small/thin in mouth, not bulky.</li>
            <li>As immediate relief for bruxism, these are very convenient.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li>Too much moving around in my mouth.</li>
            <li>work really really really well.</li>
            <li>Maybe not as much as others</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than investing in a mouth guard through the dentist and easier than trying to boil a sports mouth guard for temporary use and relief.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li>Who wants to have a gigantic&lt;br /&gt;mouthpiece in their mouth when they go to bed with their sweety?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like wearing any sort of mouth guard</li>
            <li>But now, I could see that I don&#x27;t clench my jaw or grind my teeth as much</li>
            <li>Ships fast every time.</li>
            <li>They seem to be made really well</li>
            <li>VERY WELL in preventing teeth grinding.</li>
            <li>I was not so much grinding but clenching.  </li>
            <li>But this can really help as part of a broader strategy to relieve jaw pain.</li>
            <li>On the one hand, they work well for me, being reasonably comfortable and remarkably simple.</li>
            <li>Now, If my dog eats one of these, I can replace them eaasily thanks to Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I calculated the cost and if I use these for a whole year, it ends up being around $150</li>
            <li>you wash it, you can use it repeatedly for up to 2 weeks - depending on how much you grind.</li>
            <li>Do you really think you will do that when you&#x27;re asleep?</li>
            <li>Also, lasts much longer than 1 week.</li>
            <li>They say to throw away after 2 uses but really?</li>
            <li>It really put me off of it...</li>
            <li>ready reviews and decided to give them a go.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Aside from that, though, these really work.  </li>
            <li>and these have really helped.</li>
            <li>So...I tried the Plackers and they really work.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t take much time to get used to.</li>
            <li>Also, these mouth guards are comfortable for use while sleeping, which is critical.</li>
            <li>But they don&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
            <li>I would Absolutely recommend this to anyone who grids their teeth.</li>
            <li>This one didn&#x27;t help me much.</li>
            <li>But, these do seem very flexible (maybe too flexible for some of you)</li>
            <li>They are very flexible.</li>
            <li>These are much cheaper than all the rest of them,</li>
            <li>He says it is comfortable to use compared to what I got him at the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t stay put very well which makes me nervous to sleep with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li>If they don&#x27;t work then you haven&#x27;t invested much money.</li>
            <li>They are flexible, can be worn on the upper or lower jaw, and your mouth gets comfortable within a minute of having it in.  </li>
            <li>Still, after a few nights of wearing it the grinding will stop which is nice.</li>
            <li>If you wash them when you brush your teeth, I don&#x27;t think you have to throw them out as early as the box recommends, so you actually can get a lot more for your money.</li>
            <li>These worked very well for me much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I tried these out, and when I first got them, I would go through a pair every week because it would flatten out the more you bite down on them during the night.  </li>
            <li>For the price, I think it is a great product, although I wish it was made a little sturdier so it doesn&#x27;t wear down as quickly.</li>
            <li>On top of that, they are much, much cheaper than other otc mouthguards and disposable</li>
            <li>I use the same one much longer than recommended keeping it clean and it continues to work.</li>
            <li>Tried for 3 nights and gave up due to my jaw being even more sore/stiff in the mornings.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You look relatively normal after you put it in and can grind all you want at night without worrying about your chompers!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, for the normal night grinders I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li>The first night I used these, my jaw hurt a little more in the morning.</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I found these -- they worked well enough for me, and meant I could avoid paying $600 for a custom night guard.</li>
            <li>Pretty comfortable that after a few minutes I do not even notice and I fall right to sleep.</li>
            <li>Slightly too large for me, but OK for others in my family.</li>
            <li>you can toss out or lose &amp; not worry about, they did stop my back teeth from grinding but not as good as other adjustable no-boil guards that create the barrier between the further back teeth which is more what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>This product was so easy to use but before purchasing this products you should carefully read the Warning or better yet consult a dentist first, so it won&#x27;t be a waste.</li>
            <li>But these are actually comfortable, in contrast to other boil-and-mold-to-your-teeth night guards; and  head &amp; shoulders more comfortable than the hard plastic, permanent ones you can buy at the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>These were too long fit for my mouth</li>
            <li>With the Plackers mouth guard, it is not nearly as intrusive and can comfortably be used during the day.</li>
            <li>have tried several others and this fit the best and didnt feel so bulky but pain is usually a bad thing.</li>
            <li>I will never go back to a full tooth guard.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but these designed very well.</li>
            <li>However, if they were thinner, i&#x27;m not sure how effective they would be.</li>
            <li>So we are currently trying a full mouth piece</li>
            <li>These are small but effective.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to brush in the morning since there are no real crevices for gross morning breath gunk to get lodged in and it&#x27;s clear so easy to see if anything gets funky or too damaged.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;2nd night, i tried wearing it upside down (around the top teeth) hoping to avoid a blister, but all that did was put my jaw out.</li>
            <li>I went to my new dentist, she said I would need one that costs $700!  </li>
            <li>Found these for less at the dollar store that did not require me to buy so many.</li>
            <li>No one had ever taught me about this before, I think because previous dentists saw me comin&#x27; with a checkbook and figured out they could make more money off me if I continued to grind and clench my teeth.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a $400 custom bite guard from the dentist - and I like these better.</li>
            <li>I suffer from jaw clenching, which mainly affects my front teeth.  </li>
            <li>only complaint is that they&#x27;re disposable - which isn&#x27;t great for the environment.  </li>
            <li>I would send them back if it didn&#x27;t take more time and money sending it back than it costs.</li>
            <li>No More since they not only are much more comfortable</li>
            <li>and only a blister for the very first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had high hopes that these would help with my jaw clenching that caused a lot of tension and is probably contributing to my chronic headaches.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>All through high school, I used the bulky custom guards</li>
            <li>would highly recommend to anyone with this problem.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it as it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have high anxiety levels...and instead of my blood pressure being through the roof about it all</li>
            <li>highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This is a small appliance and very easy to adapt to your bite.  </li>
            <li>These little guards are fantastic!  </li>
            <li>I should have thought this out a little better.  </li>
            <li>I found after a week that I need something a little more customized for my mouth.</li>
            <li>a GREAT alternative to having custom trays made (which is SO expensive).</li>
            <li>These are not thick.  </li>
            <li>I love that I can keep a few in my travel bag and not have to remember to bring one from home all the time.</li>
            <li>These did take a few nights to get used but love going to bed knowing that I&#x27;m not grinding my teeth together.</li>
            <li>Obviously everyone is in a different situation and has different preferences but these honestly worked for me and I recommend you give them a try.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t stay asleep more than a few hours before I&#x27;d wake up with jaw/teeth pain.</li>
            <li>gave it three stars because it&#x27;s so thick that my mouth won&#x27;t close on its own.  </li>
            <li>After the fourth night, the guard is pretty \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; and ready to toss out for a new one.  </li>
            <li>No more aweful trays of goop trying to get the right fit.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to get this product after reading the different reviews of all of the people who loved it compared to expensive alternatives.  </li>
            <li>I was amazed when I woke up the next morning with out the tradition right side temple area head ache pain.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, not wanting to spend hundreds for a new one, I decided to try a \\&quot;drugstore guard\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I purchased these as an in-between use while I was waiting for a new grind guard I ordered to come in.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t live without these gizmos.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s when I swap out for a new one.</li>
            <li>I do not grind my teeth every night, but whenI fall into my bad habits every now and then, its nice to be able to grab a new sanitary grind guard without worrying about cleanliness.</li>
            <li>They are a very different fit from a traditional mouth guard.</li>
            <li>I thought I had stopped doing that after I stopped a certain medication, but apparently, I still do at times.</li>
            <li>First I tried an adjustable sleepright guard, which was so big</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the first one two weeks later.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why they say it&#x27;s a one night use as we use ours for many nights</li>
            <li>OTHER dental guards cover your entire teeth (not too sexy, girls).</li>
            <li>exactly the same, not like there&#x27;s a plastic mouth guard in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried these I though I would swallow it in the middle of the night or it would fall out.  </li>
            <li>in order to know where it needs to be cut you need to actually wear it first.  </li>
            <li>(This is the first time I have ever used such a product.)</li>
            <li>They charge nearly $25 for a package like this!  </li>
            <li>I occasionally brush them with my toothbrush, and every day I run hot water over them and wash off the gunk from my mouth.</li>
            <li>I tried a few others and this was the first one that was comfortable enough for me to fall alseep and stay asleep..</li>
            <li>You carefully follow the simple directions which tell you to boil the guard for a specified time, then have a glass of cool water ready where you can dunk the guard for an even shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li>The next one we tried cost slightly less then the first one &amp; also was able to be molded to the teeth after softening it in water but we must not have formed it correctly &amp; noticed that it was making a space between his top &amp; bottom teeth (similar to what happens to a young child who  uses a pacifier or sucks his thumb) after 3-4 weeks of wearing it at night.</li>
            <li>Although these are made to last a week they will last much longer as long as you clean and rinse it well before each use.</li>
            <li>I recently got new dental insurance with my new job and went to the dentist to get fitted for a new mouthguard.  </li>
            <li>About 5-7 days per unit  and clear with mouth wash each morning.</li>
            <li>My young daughter</li>
            <li>Although we got the professionally made night guard from the dentist he has continued to use the Plackers</li>
            <li>I received the Plackers mouth guards about 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>and I have no trouble sleeping with them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;2.They feel too soft to make a difference</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made of some soft plastic/rubber like substance that didn&#x27;t rub my gums or cause any sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO not buy a soft bite guard, as per my dentist.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn a professional custom guard for 6 years; it broke and I needed a temporary solution.  </li>
            <li>They are very convenient because you can throw them away after multiple days wear.</li>
            <li>My husband grinds his teeth frequently at night ad was fitted for a mouthpiece by the dentist.  </li>
            <li>He grinder his teeth all the time at night and would have so much pain the next day.</li>
            <li>These have completely stopped that.</li>
            <li>So far my teeth and jaws do not hurt anymore</li>
            <li>Put too much pressure on one or two of my back teeth...</li>
            <li>These mouth guards are soft and flexible.</li>
            <li>They also last much longer than the package implies</li>
            <li>They last me much longer than the 3 days it says on the box.  </li>
            <li>So far, they work will well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>No trouble sleeping with them; they&#x27;ve never moved out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li>Would completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>The bite plates are noticeable, but in comparison to others I have tried, they are completely tolerable.  </li>
            <li>Each guard will last about 2-3 months depending on how intense your grinding is.  </li>
            <li>I was so surprised.</li>
            <li>and so far I have had no complaints.</li>
            <li>and I have a sensitive reflex.</li>
            <li>I bought these because professional night guards are hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li>in all, I really like these and recommend - but again, with a product like this, every person is different.</li>
            <li>I am getting ready to purchase my second order.  </li>
            <li>I started grinding my teeth in my sleep unexpectedly after having my wisdom teeth removed.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE them, minus the fact that they only last 3-4 nights each, but they&#x27;re labeled &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; for a reason.  </li>
            <li>The pressure of the grind is absorbed by the back teeth only...</li>
            <li>Very dissatisfied that this product is too small, the back part of the guards moves out of the way when grinding, feel like i wasted 20 something dollars on something that just gave me more of a hassle, thanks plackers for a really messed up product!</li>
            <li>I wear them mostly in the upper position, but every few nights I&#x27;ll switch to the lower position.</li>
            <li>Sorry, I just can&#x27;t give these a good review.  </li>
            <li>Thought one of these would be good for traveling (even if I lost it, not that expensive).  </li>
            <li>Since these are small, I can&#x27;t find them easily.</li>
            <li>I was concerned because many reviews were so negative saying they didn&#x27;t fit, they fell out, etc, but I had to try it because it was SO SMALL.  </li>
            <li>I woke up with my teeth feeling funny and loose.</li>
            <li>the guard is pushing it open past a neutral/relaxed position, which makes me clench even more when I fall asleep.  </li>
            <li>Further, as each guard is meant to last only three days, the cost to use this product mounts up quickly.</li>
            <li>As far as a mouth piece goes this one is small and comfortable.</li>
            <li>The guards are small but if you wear them on your bottom teeth instead of your top you won&#x27;t feel as likely to swallow them.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems that (oral surgeon told me) there is a muscle running from the top of your skull down both sides of your head to the jaw area.&lt;br /&gt;Grinding your teeth can actually cause the muscle on either side to exhibit sharp pain from the top of your head down along your ear to just above the jaw.</li>
            <li>These are small, comfortable, and keep me from grinding my teeth together at night.</li>
            <li>I guess thats the trade off for small and light.</li>
            <li>They are small and fit well and protect your teeth whether you grind or clench.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t hurt your gums and when you wake up in the morning you can absolutely tell that you didn&#x27;t grind all night long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently on day 3 with NO neck pain (I wear a different, more heavy duty guard at night while sleeping).  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, hardly noticeable</li>
            <li>The Plackers looked intriguing -- obviously very different from the other \\&quot;old standard\\&quot; type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>AND I used one for several nights/weeks before using a new one.</li>
            <li>The package recommends three uses and then toss, I cleaned the product each morning and used until it was obviously time to put a new one to use.  </li>
            <li>these don&#x27;t seem to bother me too much, and I like that you can cycle through them rather than use the same one for 6 months, which is kinda gross.</li>
            <li>Why night guards have been so ill designed before escapes me, as this is just perfect, at least for me.</li>
            <li>: Because they are disposable, they deteriate and become super flat and gross if worn too long.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used one single guard for 6 months and it&#x27;s held up really well.</li>
            <li>The wife grinds like no other, throughout the night I feel like she was going to break her teeth apart.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite being very minimal and looking quite similar to the former, these have never come undone yet ( just try both jaws, and wiggle a bit, pushing the front part into the lip slightly etc until you feel it&#x27;s steady), and I&#x27;ve come to love the minimalist, no bulk feel of these compared to the custom molds.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find them to be more comfortable, cleaner, and much less expensive than custom mouth guards.</li>
            <li>I have needed grind guards for a long time but knew the full mouth piece would not work for me due to gagging issues.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a dentist, and the main reason I got these was as a temporary measure until I get fitted for my permanent night guard later next month.</li>
            <li>He said that I have grinded my teeth down so much that he doesn&#x27;t want me to have no teeth left when I get older...</li>
            <li>The boil and fit types worked well but were not nice to my veneers!&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do what they advertise and they are the only ones that fit a small mouth.</li>
            <li>I was told by my dentist that as long as my teeth don&#x27;t touch, any guard will work (for a while until I save enough money for a real one...)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how much these are really helping me with my clenching</li>
            <li>I barely knew I had one</li>
            <li>I do notice soreness of my far back teeth in the morning.</li>
            <li>They keep me from clenching my teeth, but I barely notice they are in my mouth.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because I had about 3 in the package that were completely bent out of shape after one night</li>
            <li>actually developed a problem that I never knew was possible to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but then again, neither are pebbly teeth :o</li>
            <li>I barely had any of the guard remaining after my trimming,</li>
            <li>I apparently get it out of my system at night by clenching my teeth together.  </li>
            <li>I have only spit it out a couple times in my sleep and found it under my pillow, no problems so far with choking or gagging</li>
            <li>I clench/grind my teeth frequently and my dentist recently urged me to get a mouth guard.</li>
            <li>The big ones tend to feel bulky and uncomfortable and I ended up spitting them out in the middle of the night in my sleep which didn&#x27;t do me any good.  </li>
            <li>These bite guards are a very poor fit, they do not stay in place well at all for me on the bottoms, much less on the top where it instantly fell out.</li>
            <li>Its small enough to where I can sleep with my mouth closed and very comfortable.</li>
            <li>This item keeps my front teeth slightly separated, which is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li>I did have a slight gag reflex at first, but kept with it</li>
            <li>The simple construction is basically a couple of small L shaped molds that fit over the back teeth held together by a strip.</li>
            <li>I found it much easier to get used to sleeping with one of these in my mouth versus both the permanant ones and other disposable night guards..</li>
            <li>so i spent the whole of the next day</li>
            <li>I actually reuse these by washing them off every morning and one has lasted several weeks so far.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re probably not perfect for every mouth, but they are thin, light and generally easy to get used to, compared to dental guards which mould to your teeth and grip very</li>
            <li>The other I have used for a few years, although at times it was difficult to use consistently and get a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li>at first you can feel it, but after a few nights, it is invisible.</li>
            <li>It hurt her the first few nights but after using it for a week, she loves it and doesn&#x27;t notice it at all.</li>
            <li>These are ok, sort of small, and make your mouth feel a little off in the mornings.</li>
            <li>I found that out the hard way (but luckily all was fine).&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than buying in the store for a much less price.</li>
            <li>They are much thinner, so it bother me less when I&#x27;m asleep, yet, it takes some time to get used to wearing it.</li>
            <li>only complaint would be that they do fall off while sleeping, but that could be true for any mouth guard.</li>
            <li>No More for a few years now and have always enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>In fact, the next day I woke up and it was clear my teeth hadn&#x27;t been fixed in a solid piece of plastic molded to my bite, but instead had been gnashing against each other.</li>
            <li>very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give these a try because they looked much less bulky, It only took me three or four days to get used to them.</li>
            <li>I know I have a smaller jaw, so it is no shocker to me that these are a little too large for me.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realized how much I clenched my teeth until my dentist informed me that I had little indents in my teeth from it.</li>
            <li>This mouth guard was too soft and too loose!</li>

            <li> These are great-</li>
            <li> These are great.</li>
            <li> Well, I have to say they are truly AMAZING!  </li>
            <li> This product is great for beginners and will give you a good idea if you need to spend the money on a custom &#x27;boil &amp; bite&#x27; or if you&#x27;re a light-grinder and can get away with these.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for my grinding, good fit &amp; great value for money</li>
            <li> Very easy!</li>
            <li> I imagine they&#x27;ll soon be sued out of business by the loved ones of people who have choked to death.</li>
            <li> Does the job, not as good as the custom made one from the dentist but a good replacement.</li>
            <li> The plastic seems to make a perfect fit after warming to body temperature.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m delighted with Plackers.  </li>
            <li> This is the cheapest and really good solution if you grind your teeth at night or driving your car in traffic.</li>
            <li> Good price but meh on product.</li>
            <li> The fit was perfect although I did find myself taking out in my sleep.</li>
            <li> but I wore one for a good month</li>
            <li> It looks good.</li>
            <li> wish I knew about them because they are a good price.</li>
            <li> These will leave indentions on the inside of your gums if they don&#x27;t fit perfectly....</li>
            <li> the good thing, is you get a pack of 10.&lt;br /&gt;my</li>
            <li> but i read online saliva is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product if you have these problems.</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good way to try the guard without spending a pile of money on the custom one from the dentist.</li>
            <li> These guards are a good deal for the price.  </li>
            <li> There good for vacation or while working if you need daytime help.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that it would be a good idea for me to get a mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> It is a good option.</li>
            <li> Good product and good delivery</li>
            <li> Good luck</li>
            <li> Good for travel / overnight bag extras</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep with the full teeth covers, but these are perfect.  </li>
            <li> I gave them four stars because the fit was not the best, but it was effective for me.</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> Very very timely service, and product in excellent condition upon arrival.</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I ended up having more pain after using it!</li>
            <li> I get lots more than 3 days wear from one of the night guards!  </li>
            <li> I cannot remember how very, very many &amp;#34;mouth guards&amp;#34; of every kind I have purchased for sleeping.  </li>
            <li> I love these!  </li>
            <li> Pretty awesome.</li>
            <li> and I wish you a happier more restful sleep!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also great because you can pack them easily if you&#x27;re going out of town or something.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are amazing.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s nice to have a mouth guard that is disposable, have more then one and at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Tried to make my own custom guards</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money again.</li>
            <li> and they took forever to warm up to where they didn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> She liked them</li>
            <li> It was the kind that molds to your teeth after submerging them in water, etc.  </li>
            <li> However, use your own discrestion as to when you need to discard.</li>
            <li> These caused me more harm then good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to break of the floor and need to be replaced like the $400 kind you get at the dentist either.</li>
            <li> But, if you do splurge for the fancy dentist kind, you won&#x27;t look like a wrestler when you wear it, either.</li>
            <li> I love this product and will buy more!</li>
            <li> but are more effective at keeping the grinding to a minimum.</li>
            <li> Near perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with these and will get them until I can have a professional one made.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very good, wonderfull.&lt;br /&gt;Congratulation to this excelent supplier!&lt;br /&gt;Thank very much!</li>
            <li> I have found it to be very comfortable and it seems to be breaking my clenching habit.  </li>
            <li> very comfortable and helpful</li>
            <li> Very comfortable but must have an allergy as now</li>
            <li> very comfortable and is still in place when I wake up.</li>
            <li> They are individually packed, which is nice, and are the perfect size - now, I say that for me, but to be honest, is that true for all?</li>
            <li> Safe, comfortable, good price and easy to use.</li>
            <li> and I both enjoy the comfort and protection these guards provide!</li>
            <li> much better than the mold to  your mouth version.</li>
            <li> I have been using the dr brux guard that fits better and for me works, after a bit trimming.  </li>
            <li> mouth guards and these work better than all of them.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> It can be used on the top or bottom.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many mouth guards and every one has always had issues.</li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also able to use one for a lot longer than 3 days :)</li>
            <li> I get a lot more usage out of one so</li>
            <li> I thought these might be able to help.  </li>
            <li> They are not bulky like many of the mouth guards you find in stores.  </li>
            <li> This is a very helpful, useful product and I am very happy I found this item on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> The box says you can use 3 times, but I get many more uses from each one.</li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t keep it in my mouth for more than an hour at a time.</li>
            <li> Wearing these retrained the way my jaw sits within a couple of weeks and seems to continue to get even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Disposable...I would like to be able to sanitize and reuse...</li>
            <li> If you have had braces, these will be even better.</li>
            <li> Still a good deal and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> However, they sometimes make the top or bottom of my gums hurt, depending on how I wear it the night before.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> I was not even sure if I grind my teeth at night</li>
            <li> I love that there is no adjusting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they are disposable</li>
            <li> This will be my second order and I am very happy with them!</li>
            <li> I found that they &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; better when worn on the bottom.</li>
            <li> I like that you can place it on your top teeth or your bottom teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did not invest in a $100 customized guard-</li>
            <li> I use mine for more than the 3 days each</li>
            <li> I wear it on the top, and it stays in place, preventing me from clenching or grinding my teeth or from biting my tongue.</li>
            <li> With the cost of having a dentist make one of these this purchase was a better alternative.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gotten more than the three days out of each one.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve found they are a lot better</li>
            <li> Laying it on my bottom teeth works well for me and seems safer then on the top teeth.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably better to take it out until you are finished.</li>
            <li> Putting it on the top teeth doesn&#x27;t seem practical to me</li>
            <li> I guess some people have more of a grinding problem than others.</li>
            <li> i use it for more than 5 times.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> (you can choose top of bottom row of teeth) and they do not fall out overnight</li>
            <li> Love the way that they are disposable</li>
            <li> would Be the most you can use them.</li>
            <li> The guard can be worn on your top or bottom teeth.</li>
            <li> and I use them every night gladly.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards are much better than those that you need to mend in boiling water.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel safe sleeping in these Plackers.  </li>
            <li> I did use them during the day which is okay if you clench your teeth during the day- like while driving or petting cute animals.</li>
            <li> Better price on Amazon than Rite Aid</li>
            <li> After wearing them one night my jaw was even more sore than it was to begin with...</li>
            <li> I am SO GLAD that I found these on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> am pleased with them and they don&#x27;t pop out of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Love these.</li>
            <li> I love these, beats paying hundreds for.</li>
            <li> I do use one more than the 3 times recommended.  </li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many mouth guards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve passed out so many that I&#x27;ve got people hooked on these, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear these on my top teeth because they fall out of my mouth.  </li>
            <li> After my dog ate my Dentist made mouth guard, I wanted to find a better replacement.  </li>
            <li> This product is cheap and it works!</li>
            <li> and I like them much better than the custom fitted ones.</li>
            <li> But, tried it at home and was able to get two weeks of wear from it.  </li>
            <li> I am able to wear them more than one night.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get a \\&quot;boil &amp; bite\\&quot; and I love it.</li>
            <li> more often&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes it gets pinched from how it is stored in them package and doesn&#x27;t fit well (kind of a v instead of a u)&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> sure I have a preference yet.</li>
            <li> I do love my teeth but $700 is still a lot for a mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That saves a lot more money than the custom one from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Furthermore, these are comfortable!</li>
            <li> I then started thinking why can&#x27;t anyone make a guard that just blocked the teeth from touching while not having 2 pounds of plastic in my mouth?  </li>
            <li> They are the MOST comfortable guards I have ever had!  </li>
            <li> I wear them on my top teeth.  </li>
            <li> +, spending $3 to find out if this is a good guard for you is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> +, spending $3 to find out if this is a good guard for you is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> you wear them on the top,</li>
            <li> Works well and can be used more than once.</li>
            <li> and I would wake up in even more pain than before.</li>
            <li> You just put it in (top or bottom, doesn&#x27;t matter) and fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> They work on both top and bottom</li>
            <li> I mostly clench my teeth at night from the moment I close my eyes.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure that I needed a guard, but after using this product for over 30 days - it&#x27;s a five star with me.  </li>
            <li> You can try them on the bottom teeth or the top.</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> Compared to the dentist made guards, or the ones that you drop in boiling water then bight into, this design is much more sensible.</li>
            <li> These are ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to put it in again and again it happened.  </li>
            <li> so I have a basis in comparison and can honestly say these are the most comfortable night guard I have used to date.</li>
            <li> They stay in and i can wear them top or bottom.</li>
            <li> You can also get a lot more uses than just the three they mention on the box.</li>
            <li> I put them on my top teeth for comfort.</li>
            <li> I ordered it because I thought it might be an alternative to (as another reviewer hilariously suggested) looking like a wrestler when donning it.</li>
            <li> but it broke after many years of abuse in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> I *love</li>
            <li> Worked okay.  </li>
            <li> I love these.  </li>
            <li> I use more than suggested.</li>
            <li> I have used them way many more times than 3.</li>
            <li> Using for two months and extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> Flexes very nicely and very lightweight.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t quite know how they work, but they do a great job and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Oh my lucky stars I am so glad I found these!  </li>
            <li> They arrived quickly and I love them!</li>
            <li> Bruxism is strong may not be able to use them more than once&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty good.....</li>
            <li> After the first couple days I find a guard deforms a bit, but after that retains it&#x27;s shape fairly well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t feel like a football player with a mouth full of plastic, but do the job nicely.</li>
            <li> Nice to be able to have a fresh guard when desired.</li>
            <li> easy to use -- and so many for the price</li>
            <li> Wearing on top was much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> For me, I found it more comfortable to use them on my top teeth.</li>
            <li> tried to make these work three times and in each case although they sat securely on the bottom jaw of my mouth when I went to sleep and didn&#x27;t move despite having them in my mouth for a couple of hours before I went to sleep just to be sure they were fitting well</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit my mouth perfectly, but enough to make it work.</li>
            <li> Most comfortable of the 3 and in some ways I like it better than the dentist&#x27;s NTI one.  </li>
            <li> While a professionally fit guard is probably the best way to go, I simply cannot afford that.</li>
            <li> I have found that wearing them on the top teeth seems more comfortable because they contact your tongue less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fortunately, they are VERY COMFORTABLE.</li>
            <li> Then at night, before I use it, I clean it again, finishing off with some mouthwash and off I go!</li>
            <li> These work great, fit very well and are comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s much more comfortable.  </li>
            <li> but still ok since they&#x27;re so cheap.</li>
            <li> Much more comfortable than dentist-made guard.</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job well but after using it I think the risk of choking on the plastic is far too great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s also important to see a doctor or take an anti-inflammatory and be more mindful of when you are clenching your jaw.  </li>
            <li> These have been great so far.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the wonderful product, these are getting harder to find.  </li>
            <li> I really enjoy these and use them most nights.</li>
            <li> The Plackers Mouth Guard was really good, but found that I grind my teeth so much that they could not withstand the abuse that my teeth could deliver for 3 days.</li>
            <li> I know other reviews mentioned they almost choked on them etc, but if you are a clincher, these are perfect for you.</li>
            <li> product is definitely unique, and it&#x27;s perhaps a leap of faith to try, but I&#x27;m really pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m impressed with the quality and they &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; extremely well and don&#x27;t move in my mouth at night.  </li>
            <li> These on the other hand work GREAT!</li>
            <li> May not work for everyone but seems to be just what I needed, they stay in place very good - much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Easy to wash</li>
            <li> Easy to use and no problems with braces</li>
            <li> best.&lt;br /&gt;Being an engineer myself I can see this is a well engineered product and easy to work with but</li>
            <li> It does not stay in place and it falls very quickly.</li>
            <li> night.&lt;br /&gt;Actually getting used to it was easy.</li>
            <li> I have a ritual now every morning of trying to find it as it gets spit out easily.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I travel a lot and they are easy to travel with</li>
            <li> I like that I can clean each guard while I use it for three days and then dispose of it, which I feel is more hygienic.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have to say that of you are a hardcore teethgrinder or grit your jaws strongly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this product on my first try on Amazon.</li>
            <li> so first I tried the kind that you boil and mold yourself.</li>
            <li> Better off buying a full mouth guard.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s still good as new (</li>
            <li> Sometimes hurts mu gums otherise fine</li>
            <li> and my teeth are fine.  </li>
            <li> So much more comfortable than a full mouth guard.</li>
            <li> and it was perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> However 7 of them were fine which lasted for quite some time.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and easy to wear.</li>
            <li> I found them to be easy to use and comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I started using this and even though it says you can use each guard for a maximum of three days, I accidentally used mine for 5 and it was still fine.</li>
            <li> They say they are disposable and for one-time use, but I have used it now for four nights and it is in fine shape.  </li>
            <li> They say they are disposable and for one-time use, but I have used it now for four nights and it is in fine shape.  </li>
            <li> we like that they fit easily and can be disguarded after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> They are cheap and easy, like me.</li>
            <li> I use these nightly and it has helps tremendously!</li>
            <li> Light weight &amp; strong.</li>
            <li> My husband bites while he&#x27;s asleep, so he chews them up rather quickly!</li>
            <li> The guard is extremely light, flexible, and comfortable, but protects my back molars beautifully.  </li>
            <li> Cheap, easy, comfortable.</li>
            <li> Its a huge bargain buying these.</li>
            <li> Huge improvement from full-on mouthguards.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bulky or huge.  </li>
            <li> Huge and bulky</li>
            <li> They are for clenching, primarily at night.  </li>
            <li> They do a great job, especially for the price, but I did sometimes wake up with sore teeth, as though I had been clenching it.</li>
            <li> Not at all comfortable putting these in my mouth to sleep with</li>
            <li> Although the guard is compact and light as a feather, I haven&#x27;t been perforating them.  </li>
            <li> i used it was really comfortable</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are fantastic.  </li>
            <li> they are comfortable, inexpensive, and you can wear them way longer than a day or two as suggested by the packaging.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you grind your teeth every night, but as someone who grinds their teeth when they are stressed these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> BUT these are the best guards I have found so far and the only ones I&#x27;ve been able to keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li> These are not at all comfortable.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit and just fall out a million times during the night.</li>
            <li> so we thought maybe this would work for him, just couldn&#x27;t get it to fit</li>
            <li> They are comfortable, they keep me from grinding my teeth.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and to clean.  </li>
            <li> I checked out what was available online and chose the Plackers mouth guard</li>
            <li> It is comfortable, cushions</li>
            <li> It gave immediate relief from my problem and it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> I could not get a comfortable feel in my mouth - no matter what I did.</li>
            <li> I tried &#x27;DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit&#x27; and</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to clean and take care of as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not such a great savings after all.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no cut to fit, or boiling.  </li>
            <li> Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit ,, now those are grreat.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit well.</li>
            <li> these seems to fit well and don&#x27;t bother her while sleeping.  </li>
            <li> so when I leave for awhile, there is one already available, as I use to forget my NTI often.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also nonlatex, an important consideration if you&#x27;re allergic.</li>
            <li> This product is now as important to me as Plackers, Sonicare, Prevident, and The Doctors BrushPics in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> How can \\&quot;one size fit</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sleep Right is adjustable, but abraids my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Plackers can be worn on top or bottom arcade,</li>
            <li> Most I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t feel right overnight...</li>
            <li> It is very useful, but sometimes it get out of the mouth because they are not adjusted to the bite.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> Great product but no for people who grind hard - I occasionally grind my teeth and have found these are perfect -no falling apart as the boil to fit products</li>
            <li> can get a good 4-5 days wear out of each piece, by handwashing them in the morning, carry them easily for sleepovers, and sleep in the same room with someone without waking them up.</li>
            <li> I originally had an NTI fitted for me by my dentist.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So worth it!</li>
            <li> After a couple of nights I had significant improvement in the pain in my jaw from TMJ.</li>
            <li> How economical!</li>
            <li> Works well for me - no more tooth wear from night grinding, it stays in place -- an excellent value.</li>
            <li> After the first week, I managed to find the most comfy spot and keep the night guard in.</li>
            <li> I did see one person who had said they woke up choking on the unit, but figured they must have had a unique experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like how I can wear them on top or bottom but the flat plastic piece that keeps the top and bottom teeth from touching causes pain for hours after taking it</li>
            <li> They still dont fit too good but work as short term relief.  </li>
            <li> I just clean it every morning.</li>
            <li> They are SUPER comfortable and helpful.</li>
            <li> I wake up, I rinse mine off and put it into a clean baggie or container.</li>
            <li> You simply clean it with toothpaste and toothbrush each morning.  </li>
            <li> , so if I lose or forget it no biggie&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have to clean them&lt;br /&gt;Give</li>
            <li> I have tried 3 different over the counter replacements and feel this is by far the best one.</li>
            <li> I love this product very easy and comfortable to wear, will definitely order these again.</li>
            <li> This is significant since he uses a sleep apnea machine and used to neglect the use of his mouth guard since he felt very constricted with so many oral devices at night.  </li>
            <li> Right after I saw the blood!).  </li>
            <li> They fit fine and are not uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a better result than the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard - I never tried a &#x27;real&#x27; ($400) fitted guard.</li>
            <li> I bought a $40 night guard but it ended up being too soft (it was the kind that forms after biting into to it after softening it in boiling water)</li>
            <li> Comfortable and useful.  </li>
            <li> My mouth felt like it was full of cotton balls</li>
            <li> These are good for the occasional TMJ pain that I experience.</li>
            <li> area that in the morn, my guard would be full of blood</li>
            <li> I just make sure to rinse it very well and use Listerine once in awhile.</li>
            <li> I have been grinding my teeth for well over a decade and have worn away probably a good 1/6 of my teeth height to the point that I am finally feeling the sensitivity after having worn away the enamel and have gone into the tooth portion.  </li>
            <li> Besides that, good simple solution to grinding teeth!</li>
            <li> Putting one of these in really helps, and soothes (for the lack of a better term)</li>
            <li> * these about as much as one can *love* any mouth guard, but</li>
            <li> me, as a clencher, I find that having them in my mouth makes me involuntarily clench my teeth more, which makes my neck and jaw hurt just as much in the mornings even if it protects my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Also wear when exercising to prevent to much pressure and helped prevent more teeth cracking.</li>
            <li> &quot; the guard doesn&#x27;t get all gross and gunky; a quick rinse and perhaps a dunk in mouthwash and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They fit just right.</li>
            <li> have a very small mouth, this may not be the best one for me...</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think these were the greatest fit for an average adult.</li>
            <li> Will continue to use these, at this price, for certain!!</li>
            <li> and they have helped my BF tremendously with his tooth grinding problem.</li>
            <li> and it quickly went away.  </li>
            <li> and they are great for traveling and a good way to decide if you want to invest in a expensive guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li> Walmart Wallgreens and most others sell something very similar for much much more..</li>
            <li> The cushion between the molars is adequate for grinding and clenching protection but just don&#x27;t stay in during sleep.</li>
            <li> This caused tremendous stress/pain on the injury</li>
            <li> I have a bigger mouth and this guard actually fits perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> I have a bigger mouth and this guard actually fits perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> 10 get used up fairly quickly...</li>
            <li> These might be perfect for a teen, or smaller mouths.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the high price of one from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I did notice I was biting the guard more than normal, but I learned to stop doing that was well.  </li>
            <li> It floats freely in your mouth and when I fell asleep the first night wearing one I awoke choking with one end lodged in my throat.</li>
            <li> and they fit good enough to where I have no issues at all really.</li>
            <li> When you first &#x27;make&#x27; it, you do boil it, which is the closest thing you can get to a &#x27;custom fit&#x27; without paying your dentist $400.</li>
            <li> I think they are pretty comfortable and do not bother me when I am trying to sleep.</li>
            <li> There are lots of other mouth guards that are comparable in price that fit better and provide more comfort.</li>
            <li> i think 2 or 3 more nights, and i will have to put a new one in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> more comfortable to use than a full tooth guard, generic or prescription.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is EXACTLY what I needed!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Plackers!!</li>
            <li> But these are a great starter if you want to see if you can live with one before shelling out the big bucks.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the way they are individually packaged and easy to take along for a road trip.</li>
            <li> Band that goes in front is too large to fit.</li>
            <li> and I think would do the job, but since they are too large, they don&#x27;t fit around the front of my gumline as they should and don&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> Luckily, the dentist from whom I had ordered the $600 mouth guard ($1300 if I used insurance!) messed up the process and I was able to get my money back.  </li>
            <li> He came across these mouth guards and they are so sleek and inexpensive that they really are a fantastic alternative.  </li>
            <li> and they fit my mouth very well.</li>
            <li> But, they fit well and really do the job</li>
            <li> Fit very well</li>
            <li> do seem to fit my mouth very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit in your mouth very well.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting a more professional mouth guard from my dentist.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve become more conscious of my teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> and he suggested that even OTC mouthguards are extremely useful in creating a barrier so that your teeth do not grind overnight.</li>
            <li> Tried a couple different brands so far and these are by far the best.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t laugh.  </li>
            <li> Wish it was more soft</li>
            <li> My only issue with the mouth guards is attributable to my own fault.</li>
            <li> And so nice to know that I have a whole supply of them waiting for me when I feel like this one is too old.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the try, if you are having difficulties with grinding your teeth.  </li>
            <li> I brush it daily with toothpaste and sometimes wash it with warm water and soap.</li>
            <li> I have kind of mixed feeling about these after using them for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is simple in design and incredibly effective.  </li>
            <li> They are super easy to use, last much longer than the suggested time of usage, and very comfortable.  </li>
            <li> I still have to try the other two brands I bough, but frankly, the Plackers guard is great, and I don&#x27;t really see a need to make the switch at this point.  </li>
            <li> I still have to try the other two brands I bough, but frankly, the Plackers guard is great, and I don&#x27;t really see a need to make the switch at this point.  </li>
            <li> We had been using full-wrap mouth guards, but decided to try these due to the good reviews and the affordable price.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re also small and can be worn either on top or bottom, whichever is more comfortable.</li>
            <li> For the money it&#x27;s a good alternative to other stuff out there</li>
            <li> Right guards to compare.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It fits just right.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> When I grind my teeth my mouth slides to the right and</li>
            <li> (if I calculated right).  </li>
            <li> right.</li>
            <li> but it really didn&#x27;t fit correctly from the first.</li>
            <li> These are small and perfect as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> Worth trying since the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried anything like these before, but they fit in the mouth easily and keep you teeth separated well enough.</li>
            <li> Small and great for travel</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth and this works great.</li>
            <li> I, too, think you can wear them a lot more than just 3 nights...as long as you clean them</li>
            <li> My dentist has strongly recommended a guard for many years, but due to the cost, and the fact that they are not covered by insurance, I refused.  </li>
            <li> It no longer fit after new dental work</li>
            <li> I think they are right when they say talk to your dentist first.  </li>
            <li> It was much more comfortable than I expected.  </li>
            <li> I have spent more money and time at my dentist from my clenching and grinding than I&#x27;m comfortable admitting.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> just the front portion which fit to my teeth, and the bottom spacer portion to keep my teeth from touching each other.  </li>
            <li> Still, they&#x27;re fairly durable, and you can wear them a little longer than the prescribed 3 days</li>
            <li> These little \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; things are great - small, flexible and so much more comfortable.</li>
            <li> My most obvious discomfort changed as soon as I started using it.  </li>
            <li> highly highly recommend this product!!</li>
            <li> These can each last for much more than 3 days</li>
            <li> it stayed in place and did exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> I decided to try an otc mouthguard first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a clencher (especially night-time) than a grinder.  </li>
            <li> wash with hot soapy water every AM</li>
            <li> and sure enough I had just gotten to sleep when I woke up chocking on it.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well to alleviate some of the pressure of grinding.</li>
            <li> When I first took it out of the box I was concerned because it&#x27;s flimsy feeling.  </li>
            <li> Stayed exactly where I put it.  </li>
            <li> also love it because I don&#x27;t look like a total freak going to bed!</li>
            <li> B003TUQCXM Plackers Stop Grinding Disposable Dental Night Protector]], and it came undone during the first night, so I hastily ordered these instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is the first night guard that doesn&#x27;t make me gag.</li>
            <li> It has finally given me morning free of headaches from grinding!</li>
            <li> He suggested that I try these first.</li>
            <li> I used these successfully for a bit, but eventually decided that they were not safe.  </li>
            <li> I have used a similar design in a non-disposable, but it was more substantial and I never had an issue with it shifting around.  </li>
            <li> and of course you&#x27;re aware you have something in your mouth.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t slip, it&#x27;s soft and comfortable and I can&#x27;t grind.  </li>
            <li> They last way more than 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Simple, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that sleeping would be a problem and that I would not be able to forget that something was in my mouth all</li>
            <li> I bought my first package of Grind No Mores at a drugstore.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise it&#x27;s okay to use for several weeks.</li>
            <li> This is my first product review on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The second one was better and helped cushion my nighttime teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time on 1-25-2013.</li>
            <li> finally got a dental guard made by my dentist and that definately does a better job and will not fall apart on you.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> On my most recent visit to my dentist, she sold me a mouth guard to try again, which I did.  </li>
            <li> In fact the Plackers website offers a free sample</li>
            <li> In fact the Plackers website offers a free sample</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using my first one after 2.5 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve woken up so many times with sore and achy jaws because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one of the regular OTC bite guards where you have to cut it to size but</li>
            <li> And the first morning that I woke up from wearing one I did not have any jaw pain whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> This product does what it is designed to do, and it&#x27;s very affordable!</li>
            <li> I use each one for several days, more than the three they recommend, and a box lasts me quite awhile.  </li>
            <li> Most likely not.</li>
            <li> would rather just eliminate the stress that leads me to grind in the first place - working on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;You can definitely use them for more than three nights if you rinse them in the morning, so</li>
            <li> You can make a 10 pack last for a month or more if you don&#x27;t need to wear one every night.</li>
            <li> better deal then in stores, definitely helps with grinding, prevents my jaw from hurting in the morning, not bulky either so I like that</li>
            <li> These are good for the day for me, for a few hours...</li>
            <li> They did not fit as well as I had hoped, but surprisingly did the job.</li>
            <li> Ok, but only as a temporary fix before seeing a dentist to get a real mouth guard fit for your own teeth, they are not much more money...</li>
            <li> It comes in a pack of 10, which is good, and even after a three month use, I&#x27;m still on the first one, it hasn&#x27;t wear off enough or reap anywhere for me to switch to the next one.</li>
            <li> I would say I have an average sized mouth, but can&#x27;t say for sure!</li>
            <li> Although it is your choice to wear either on top or on the bottom, I wear mine on the bottom, with the soft, very comfortable plastic covering the tops of the molars that I seem intent on destroying in my sleep.  </li>
            <li> These can be purchased at most pharmacies that are well stocked or here on Amazon for about half the price I was paying at that pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;The super thin design of these make them easy to wear on either the top or bottom of your mouth depending on what is comfortable for you.</li>
            <li> It fits easily in the mouth, does not get in the way, it can be situated on the top row or bottom row of teeth, it has a cut out in front and two small bite wings, one on each side.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m puzzled by all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I am going to try another mouthguard brand next time and see if it is better or worse, but either way, I know this is a GREAT product and WORKS</li>
            <li> The Plackers guard was the first one I chose since it had the absolute smallest profile.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using it for as long as it lasts and will be buying more.  </li>
            <li> I plan on using it for as long as it lasts and will be buying more.  </li>
            <li> Not bad as far as night guards go.</li>
            <li> Low cost - and better than a high priced dentists guard.</li>
            <li> These guys are strong and last longer than 3 days.</li>
            <li> Not very good doesn&#x27;t hold good in your mouth</li>
            <li> I love that there&#x27;s no hard or extra plastic.  </li>
            <li> Being too large, it hurt my gums.  </li>
            <li> I find that I spit it out during the night, mostly because it&#x27;s loose and doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> These have worked for me for the last couple of years very well.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to get used to, and for me they absolutely did the trick.</li>
            <li> They are very light, almost delicate, and extremely comfortable to wear.</li>
            <li> These little guards are so handy and really work well.  </li>
            <li> The only suggestion that I have is that I would much rather pay a little more to have one or two more placed in the pack.</li>
            <li> These are comfortable and minimal (doesn&#x27;t cover your front teeth), so when my husband wakes up and looks at me I can smile at him without looking like a wrestler.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small/thin in mouth, not bulky.</li>
            <li> As immediate relief for bruxism, these are very convenient.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Too much moving around in my mouth.</li>
            <li> work really really really well.</li>
            <li> Maybe not as much as others</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than investing in a mouth guard through the dentist and easier than trying to boil a sports mouth guard for temporary use and relief.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this.</li>
            <li> Who wants to have a gigantic&lt;br /&gt;mouthpiece in their mouth when they go to bed with their sweety?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like wearing any sort of mouth guard</li>
            <li> But now, I could see that I don&#x27;t clench my jaw or grind my teeth as much</li>
            <li> Ships fast every time.</li>
            <li> They seem to be made really well</li>
            <li> VERY WELL in preventing teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I was not so much grinding but clenching.  </li>
            <li> But this can really help as part of a broader strategy to relieve jaw pain.</li>
            <li> On the one hand, they work well for me, being reasonably comfortable and remarkably simple.</li>
            <li> Now, If my dog eats one of these, I can replace them eaasily thanks to Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I calculated the cost and if I use these for a whole year, it ends up being around $150</li>
            <li> you wash it, you can use it repeatedly for up to 2 weeks - depending on how much you grind.</li>
            <li> Do you really think you will do that when you&#x27;re asleep?</li>
            <li> Also, lasts much longer than 1 week.</li>
            <li> They say to throw away after 2 uses but really?</li>
            <li> It really put me off of it...</li>
            <li> ready reviews and decided to give them a go.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Aside from that, though, these really work.  </li>
            <li> and these have really helped.</li>
            <li> So...I tried the Plackers and they really work.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take much time to get used to.</li>
            <li> Also, these mouth guards are comfortable for use while sleeping, which is critical.</li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t stay in place very well.</li>
            <li> I would Absolutely recommend this to anyone who grids their teeth.</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t help me much.</li>
            <li> But, these do seem very flexible (maybe too flexible for some of you)</li>
            <li> They are very flexible.</li>
            <li> These are much cheaper than all the rest of them,</li>
            <li> He says it is comfortable to use compared to what I got him at the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay put very well which makes me nervous to sleep with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> If they don&#x27;t work then you haven&#x27;t invested much money.</li>
            <li> They are flexible, can be worn on the upper or lower jaw, and your mouth gets comfortable within a minute of having it in.  </li>
            <li> Still, after a few nights of wearing it the grinding will stop which is nice.</li>
            <li> If you wash them when you brush your teeth, I don&#x27;t think you have to throw them out as early as the box recommends, so you actually can get a lot more for your money.</li>
            <li> These worked very well for me much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I tried these out, and when I first got them, I would go through a pair every week because it would flatten out the more you bite down on them during the night.  </li>
            <li> For the price, I think it is a great product, although I wish it was made a little sturdier so it doesn&#x27;t wear down as quickly.</li>
            <li> On top of that, they are much, much cheaper than other otc mouthguards and disposable</li>
            <li> I use the same one much longer than recommended keeping it clean and it continues to work.</li>
            <li> Tried for 3 nights and gave up due to my jaw being even more sore/stiff in the mornings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You look relatively normal after you put it in and can grind all you want at night without worrying about your chompers!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, for the normal night grinders I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The first night I used these, my jaw hurt a little more in the morning.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found these -- they worked well enough for me, and meant I could avoid paying $600 for a custom night guard.</li>
            <li> Pretty comfortable that after a few minutes I do not even notice and I fall right to sleep.</li>
            <li> Slightly too large for me, but OK for others in my family.</li>
            <li> you can toss out or lose &amp; not worry about, they did stop my back teeth from grinding but not as good as other adjustable no-boil guards that create the barrier between the further back teeth which is more what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This product was so easy to use but before purchasing this products you should carefully read the Warning or better yet consult a dentist first, so it won&#x27;t be a waste.</li>
            <li> But these are actually comfortable, in contrast to other boil-and-mold-to-your-teeth night guards; and  head &amp; shoulders more comfortable than the hard plastic, permanent ones you can buy at the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> These were too long fit for my mouth</li>
            <li> With the Plackers mouth guard, it is not nearly as intrusive and can comfortably be used during the day.</li>
            <li> have tried several others and this fit the best and didnt feel so bulky but pain is usually a bad thing.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to a full tooth guard.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but these designed very well.</li>
            <li> However, if they were thinner, i&#x27;m not sure how effective they would be.</li>
            <li> So we are currently trying a full mouth piece</li>
            <li> These are small but effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to brush in the morning since there are no real crevices for gross morning breath gunk to get lodged in and it&#x27;s clear so easy to see if anything gets funky or too damaged.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;2nd night, i tried wearing it upside down (around the top teeth) hoping to avoid a blister, but all that did was put my jaw out.</li>
            <li> I went to my new dentist, she said I would need one that costs $700!  </li>
            <li> Found these for less at the dollar store that did not require me to buy so many.</li>
            <li> No one had ever taught me about this before, I think because previous dentists saw me comin&#x27; with a checkbook and figured out they could make more money off me if I continued to grind and clench my teeth.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a $400 custom bite guard from the dentist - and I like these better.</li>
            <li> I suffer from jaw clenching, which mainly affects my front teeth.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that they&#x27;re disposable - which isn&#x27;t great for the environment.  </li>
            <li> I would send them back if it didn&#x27;t take more time and money sending it back than it costs.</li>
            <li> No More since they not only are much more comfortable</li>
            <li> and only a blister for the very first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that these would help with my jaw clenching that caused a lot of tension and is probably contributing to my chronic headaches.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All through high school, I used the bulky custom guards</li>
            <li> would highly recommend to anyone with this problem.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it as it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have high anxiety levels...and instead of my blood pressure being through the roof about it all</li>
            <li> highly recommend these.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a small appliance and very easy to adapt to your bite.  </li>
            <li> These little guards are fantastic!  </li>
            <li> I should have thought this out a little better.  </li>
            <li> I found after a week that I need something a little more customized for my mouth.</li>
            <li> a GREAT alternative to having custom trays made (which is SO expensive).</li>
            <li> These are not thick.  </li>
            <li> I love that I can keep a few in my travel bag and not have to remember to bring one from home all the time.</li>
            <li> These did take a few nights to get used but love going to bed knowing that I&#x27;m not grinding my teeth together.</li>
            <li> Obviously everyone is in a different situation and has different preferences but these honestly worked for me and I recommend you give them a try.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t stay asleep more than a few hours before I&#x27;d wake up with jaw/teeth pain.</li>
            <li> gave it three stars because it&#x27;s so thick that my mouth won&#x27;t close on its own.  </li>
            <li> After the fourth night, the guard is pretty \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; and ready to toss out for a new one.  </li>
            <li> No more aweful trays of goop trying to get the right fit.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product after reading the different reviews of all of the people who loved it compared to expensive alternatives.  </li>
            <li> I was amazed when I woke up the next morning with out the tradition right side temple area head ache pain.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, not wanting to spend hundreds for a new one, I decided to try a \\&quot;drugstore guard\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I purchased these as an in-between use while I was waiting for a new grind guard I ordered to come in.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t live without these gizmos.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s when I swap out for a new one.</li>
            <li> I do not grind my teeth every night, but whenI fall into my bad habits every now and then, its nice to be able to grab a new sanitary grind guard without worrying about cleanliness.</li>
            <li> They are a very different fit from a traditional mouth guard.</li>
            <li> I thought I had stopped doing that after I stopped a certain medication, but apparently, I still do at times.</li>
            <li> First I tried an adjustable sleepright guard, which was so big</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the first one two weeks later.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why they say it&#x27;s a one night use as we use ours for many nights</li>
            <li> OTHER dental guards cover your entire teeth (not too sexy, girls).</li>
            <li> exactly the same, not like there&#x27;s a plastic mouth guard in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried these I though I would swallow it in the middle of the night or it would fall out.  </li>
            <li> in order to know where it needs to be cut you need to actually wear it first.  </li>
            <li> (This is the first time I have ever used such a product.)</li>
            <li> They charge nearly $25 for a package like this!  </li>
            <li> I occasionally brush them with my toothbrush, and every day I run hot water over them and wash off the gunk from my mouth.</li>
            <li> I tried a few others and this was the first one that was comfortable enough for me to fall alseep and stay asleep..</li>
            <li> You carefully follow the simple directions which tell you to boil the guard for a specified time, then have a glass of cool water ready where you can dunk the guard for an even shorter amount of time.</li>
            <li> The next one we tried cost slightly less then the first one &amp; also was able to be molded to the teeth after softening it in water but we must not have formed it correctly &amp; noticed that it was making a space between his top &amp; bottom teeth (similar to what happens to a young child who  uses a pacifier or sucks his thumb) after 3-4 weeks of wearing it at night.</li>
            <li> Although these are made to last a week they will last much longer as long as you clean and rinse it well before each use.</li>
            <li> I recently got new dental insurance with my new job and went to the dentist to get fitted for a new mouthguard.  </li>
            <li> About 5-7 days per unit  and clear with mouth wash each morning.</li>
            <li> My young daughter</li>
            <li> Although we got the professionally made night guard from the dentist he has continued to use the Plackers</li>
            <li> I received the Plackers mouth guards about 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> and I have no trouble sleeping with them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2.They feel too soft to make a difference</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made of some soft plastic/rubber like substance that didn&#x27;t rub my gums or cause any sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO not buy a soft bite guard, as per my dentist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a professional custom guard for 6 years; it broke and I needed a temporary solution.  </li>
            <li> They are very convenient because you can throw them away after multiple days wear.</li>
            <li> My husband grinds his teeth frequently at night ad was fitted for a mouthpiece by the dentist.  </li>
            <li> He grinder his teeth all the time at night and would have so much pain the next day.</li>
            <li> These have completely stopped that.</li>
            <li> So far my teeth and jaws do not hurt anymore</li>
            <li> Put too much pressure on one or two of my back teeth...</li>
            <li> These mouth guards are soft and flexible.</li>
            <li> They also last much longer than the package implies</li>
            <li> They last me much longer than the 3 days it says on the box.  </li>
            <li> So far, they work will well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> No trouble sleeping with them; they&#x27;ve never moved out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have sensitive teeth</li>
            <li> Would completely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The bite plates are noticeable, but in comparison to others I have tried, they are completely tolerable.  </li>
            <li> Each guard will last about 2-3 months depending on how intense your grinding is.  </li>
            <li> I was so surprised.</li>
            <li> and so far I have had no complaints.</li>
            <li> and I have a sensitive reflex.</li>
            <li> I bought these because professional night guards are hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> in all, I really like these and recommend - but again, with a product like this, every person is different.</li>
            <li> I am getting ready to purchase my second order.  </li>
            <li> I started grinding my teeth in my sleep unexpectedly after having my wisdom teeth removed.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE them, minus the fact that they only last 3-4 nights each, but they&#x27;re labeled &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; for a reason.  </li>
            <li> The pressure of the grind is absorbed by the back teeth only...</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied that this product is too small, the back part of the guards moves out of the way when grinding, feel like i wasted 20 something dollars on something that just gave me more of a hassle, thanks plackers for a really messed up product!</li>
            <li> I wear them mostly in the upper position, but every few nights I&#x27;ll switch to the lower position.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I just can&#x27;t give these a good review.  </li>
            <li> Thought one of these would be good for traveling (even if I lost it, not that expensive).  </li>
            <li> Since these are small, I can&#x27;t find them easily.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because many reviews were so negative saying they didn&#x27;t fit, they fell out, etc, but I had to try it because it was SO SMALL.  </li>
            <li> I woke up with my teeth feeling funny and loose.</li>
            <li> the guard is pushing it open past a neutral/relaxed position, which makes me clench even more when I fall asleep.  </li>
            <li> Further, as each guard is meant to last only three days, the cost to use this product mounts up quickly.</li>
            <li> As far as a mouth piece goes this one is small and comfortable.</li>
            <li> The guards are small but if you wear them on your bottom teeth instead of your top you won&#x27;t feel as likely to swallow them.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems that (oral surgeon told me) there is a muscle running from the top of your skull down both sides of your head to the jaw area.&lt;br /&gt;Grinding your teeth can actually cause the muscle on either side to exhibit sharp pain from the top of your head down along your ear to just above the jaw.</li>
            <li> These are small, comfortable, and keep me from grinding my teeth together at night.</li>
            <li> I guess thats the trade off for small and light.</li>
            <li> They are small and fit well and protect your teeth whether you grind or clench.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t hurt your gums and when you wake up in the morning you can absolutely tell that you didn&#x27;t grind all night long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently on day 3 with NO neck pain (I wear a different, more heavy duty guard at night while sleeping).  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, hardly noticeable</li>
            <li> The Plackers looked intriguing -- obviously very different from the other \\&quot;old standard\\&quot; type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> AND I used one for several nights/weeks before using a new one.</li>
            <li> The package recommends three uses and then toss, I cleaned the product each morning and used until it was obviously time to put a new one to use.  </li>
            <li> these don&#x27;t seem to bother me too much, and I like that you can cycle through them rather than use the same one for 6 months, which is kinda gross.</li>
            <li> Why night guards have been so ill designed before escapes me, as this is just perfect, at least for me.</li>
            <li> : Because they are disposable, they deteriate and become super flat and gross if worn too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used one single guard for 6 months and it&#x27;s held up really well.</li>
            <li> The wife grinds like no other, throughout the night I feel like she was going to break her teeth apart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite being very minimal and looking quite similar to the former, these have never come undone yet ( just try both jaws, and wiggle a bit, pushing the front part into the lip slightly etc until you feel it&#x27;s steady), and I&#x27;ve come to love the minimalist, no bulk feel of these compared to the custom molds.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find them to be more comfortable, cleaner, and much less expensive than custom mouth guards.</li>
            <li> I have needed grind guards for a long time but knew the full mouth piece would not work for me due to gagging issues.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a dentist, and the main reason I got these was as a temporary measure until I get fitted for my permanent night guard later next month.</li>
            <li> He said that I have grinded my teeth down so much that he doesn&#x27;t want me to have no teeth left when I get older...</li>
            <li> The boil and fit types worked well but were not nice to my veneers!&lt;br</li>
            <li> They do what they advertise and they are the only ones that fit a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I was told by my dentist that as long as my teeth don&#x27;t touch, any guard will work (for a while until I save enough money for a real one...)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how much these are really helping me with my clenching</li>
            <li> I barely knew I had one</li>
            <li> I do notice soreness of my far back teeth in the morning.</li>
            <li> They keep me from clenching my teeth, but I barely notice they are in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because I had about 3 in the package that were completely bent out of shape after one night</li>
            <li> actually developed a problem that I never knew was possible to have.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but then again, neither are pebbly teeth :o</li>
            <li> I barely had any of the guard remaining after my trimming,</li>
            <li> I apparently get it out of my system at night by clenching my teeth together.  </li>
            <li> I have only spit it out a couple times in my sleep and found it under my pillow, no problems so far with choking or gagging</li>
            <li> I clench/grind my teeth frequently and my dentist recently urged me to get a mouth guard.</li>
            <li> The big ones tend to feel bulky and uncomfortable and I ended up spitting them out in the middle of the night in my sleep which didn&#x27;t do me any good.  </li>
            <li> These bite guards are a very poor fit, they do not stay in place well at all for me on the bottoms, much less on the top where it instantly fell out.</li>
            <li> Its small enough to where I can sleep with my mouth closed and very comfortable.</li>
            <li> This item keeps my front teeth slightly separated, which is exactly what I need.  </li>
            <li> I did have a slight gag reflex at first, but kept with it</li>
            <li> The simple construction is basically a couple of small L shaped molds that fit over the back teeth held together by a strip.</li>
            <li> I found it much easier to get used to sleeping with one of these in my mouth versus both the permanant ones and other disposable night guards..</li>
            <li> so i spent the whole of the next day</li>
            <li> I actually reuse these by washing them off every morning and one has lasted several weeks so far.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re probably not perfect for every mouth, but they are thin, light and generally easy to get used to, compared to dental guards which mould to your teeth and grip very</li>
            <li> The other I have used for a few years, although at times it was difficult to use consistently and get a good nights sleep.</li>
            <li> at first you can feel it, but after a few nights, it is invisible.</li>
            <li> It hurt her the first few nights but after using it for a week, she loves it and doesn&#x27;t notice it at all.</li>
            <li> These are ok, sort of small, and make your mouth feel a little off in the mornings.</li>
            <li> I found that out the hard way (but luckily all was fine).&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying in the store for a much less price.</li>
            <li> They are much thinner, so it bother me less when I&#x27;m asleep, yet, it takes some time to get used to wearing it.</li>
            <li> only complaint would be that they do fall off while sleeping, but that could be true for any mouth guard.</li>
            <li> No More for a few years now and have always enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li> In fact, the next day I woke up and it was clear my teeth hadn&#x27;t been fixed in a solid piece of plastic molded to my bite, but instead had been gnashing against each other.</li>
            <li> very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give these a try because they looked much less bulky, It only took me three or four days to get used to them.</li>
            <li> I know I have a smaller jaw, so it is no shocker to me that these are a little too large for me.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realized how much I clenched my teeth until my dentist informed me that I had little indents in my teeth from it.</li>
            <li> This mouth guard was too soft and too loose!</li>
            <li> I know, it sounds easy, but it&#x27;s tough for me as a long term teeth clencher.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend giving these a try in lieu of going the super expensive route with dentists and custom-fit</li>
            <li> down side, you need a new one every 3 days.  </li>
            <li> This product is useful, but it is not a good habit to use it, when you stop to use, still grind</li>
            <li> I usually bought the Den Tek comfort fit one at walmart and they were pretty expensive for just 2 mouth guards.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that they&#x27;re really taking you for a ride financially here on Amazon when you can buy them el cheapo at the dollar store</li>
            <li> These can last a month as long as they are cleaned.</li>
            <li> and so it almost feels like you are biting on a flat, squishy pencil.</li>
            <li> So these last me a long time.</li>
            <li> Each one is only about 1.25&amp;#34; long and .75&amp;#34</li>
            <li> As a long time grinder who has destroyed my teeth because I refused to spend a ton of money, I only wish I found this product 10 years ago!</li>
            <li> They seem quite durable, so I assume my 10-pack will last a long while.  </li>
            <li> It is flimsy, does not stay in the mouth as placed, fails to protect the teeth from coming in contact with each other and actually causes certain teeth to sustain more stress than usual.  </li>
            <li> This product was way too small for my mouth, it did not fit right as described!  </li>
            <li> (I prefer the bottom), and it felt far less obtrusive than the night guard</li>
            <li> all\\&quot; when they are so tiny they don&#x27;t even fit in a woman&#x27;s mouth who is a mere 5&#x27;4\\&quot; with a mouth size proportional.</li>
            <li> I made an appointment with the dentist &amp; in the meantime ordered these from Amazon (&amp; spent the extra $4.00 to have them shipped next day Prime).</li>
            <li> I grind and clench my teeth a lot at night and have worn NTI  night guards in the past which I totally love but are so expensive, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;These clearly help prevent teeth from grinding.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> They uniquely have little flat plates that rest on your back molars - and only a thin (non visible) band wraps around your gum-line.</li>
            <li> But I do get some use out of only using them on the lower teeth, even though they do not stay in place well and hard to get used to as they sit near front teeth only.</li>
            <li> In my case, the part that goes between your teeth to cushion them stuck in past my teeth so far that when I woke up the next morning, my tongue was sore.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately my sister cannot use it  because she have 2 or more missing teeth Upper and Lower Teeth.</li>
            <li> My fiance has been complaining for a long time</li>
            <li> Not recommended for long term solution as it would be pricey</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered them twice and will continue to use these as long as I need to.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking for a tooth grinder protection that I can wear without gagging or falling out for a long time.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found it a long time ago</li>
            <li> /&gt;Didn&#x27;t take long to acclimate to using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> They work as long as you can keep them in.</li>
            <li> I like how there&#x27;s minimal plastic only where you read need it.  </li>
            <li> Although, it is not a complete cure for migraine headaches, it is a</li>
            <li> It was a bit uncomfortable, but I did trim it down (CONSIDERABLY) to finally be able to stand it in my mouth throughout the night.  </li>
            <li> I no longer clench my teeth and the swelling is starting to go down in my temples after only 2 nights of use.</li>
            <li> Typical mouth guards create a natural &amp;#34;suction cup&amp;#34; so you wake up and your jaw and teeth feel super uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> They are also very thin, so they are comfortable when sleeping.</li>
            <li> I decided to try these because the other mouth guard I&#x27;ve used were just too big.  </li>
            <li> So here you are getting two points of view that are totally different from each other, but from two customers who are content with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than any other mouth guard I&#x27;ve ever seen or used.  </li>
            <li> i do wonder about chewing on plastic all night long!  </li>
            <li> i guess they&#x27;ll come out with some other material sooner or later</li>
            <li> I found THREE different products online and ordered them all so I can compare them to each other.  </li>
            <li> They have little cushions between the back teeth only so it isn&#x27;t a mouthful.</li>
            <li> and my mouth would dry out.</li>
            <li> the pieces are too small and my first one tore a few minutes after trying.</li>
            <li> But this device is soooo small; it does not reach back to the molars; it barely reached beyond my canines.  </li>
            <li> I clench my teeth so much that I have broken several of my molars</li>
            <li> As a long time grinder who has destroyed my teeth because I refused to spend a ton of money, I only wish I found this product 10 years ago!e to clamp down at night.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m a pretty tough grinder.</li>
            <li> When I started to physically notice that my teeth were being ground down by each other, I caved and tried a bunch of different mouth</li>
            <li> they are far too small and flimsy</li>
            <li> Due to shoddy work, I had a  cracked tooth under a crown (very front tooth</li>
            <li> It is too small to have near your airway when sleeping in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Lets see, no more headaches when I wake up, no more $250.00 chipped or broken tooth at the dentist, I&#x27;m loving these things.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t fall off or come loose and no boiling required either.</li>
            <li> tried these for 2 weeks hoping for improvement,but they either came loose at night</li>
            <li> before I need to use a new one, and trust me, I clench hard.  </li>
            <li> After losing several teeth due to the fact that they were hopelessly cracked and broken, and after paying large dental bills to have crowns etc.  </li>
            <li> but I have been too stubborn to go and get a professional one fitted, mainly because they are so expensive.</li>
            <li> ...did the job I wanted it to, stayed where I wanted it to, and I expect theat by brushing them down they will last longer than just the recommended three days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Tip:  My gums got a little sensitive when I wore it with the &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; side facing down.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have anything to keep them in place, so if you sleep with your mouth open, these are not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;Mildly too big for my small mouth and no way to trim them.</li>
            <li> My front teeth had begun to move forward slightly, and these guards have begun to tuck them back in.  </li>
            <li> first thought will be (due to the sharp type of pain) that this is a serious problem caused by some type of life threatening condition.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has just enough between your upper and lower teeth to stop the grinding, and is small enough to not keep your jaw at some odd angle.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anybody who has an issue with nighttime teeth grinding, especially if you find those larger mouth guards to be obstructive and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> that sucker wasn&#x27;t going ANYWHERE unless I consciously wanted it to!  </li>
            <li> The first two nights were very difficult, but by the third I barely noticed it.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried the hot water molding product and it was very difficult to do it right.  </li>
            <li> My previous one with my former dentist and insurance was $250, which was expensive but worth it since it lasted over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These are small and the flat part does not reach the back teeth.</li>
            <li> For years I have tried other over the counter guards in an attempt to curb the problem, but usually get discouraged by a mouth piece which is much too large for my mouth and uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t wrap around your teeth, so the only way to keep them in place is to keep your mouth closed tightly.</li>
            <li> Obviously, one little item can&#x27;t fix everyone&#x27;s troubles...</li>
            <li> : I wake up with my gums in the back of my mouth feeling a little sore and weird.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but when you get it is a little tiny device that I have no idea how it works.  </li>
            <li> So I woke up a couple of times due to dry mouth or drool.  </li>
            <li> They are much different than my hard upper one but do the trick and stay in place.</li>
            <li> He uses these now frequently without complaint.</li>
            <li> These appear to be a smaller type of mouth guard and not a full mouth piece to other ones I compared.</li>
            <li> These things will last longer than a few days.</li>
            <li> It was very loose and did not stay on my teeth.</li>
            <li> Sometimes i forget to put it on and can tell that I&#x27;ve been clenching when i wake up but definitely not as much as before because i dont have the aches and pains.</li>
            <li> But after tries with one night, I felt my teeth and muscle around my mouth was sore.</li>
            <li> When I first received this product, I was surprised how small the guard is and skeptical about whether it would stay in place during the sleep.  </li>
            <li> they didn&#x27;t require boiling or cutting, but they work so much better than I expected that I plan to stick with them instead of paying a few hundred dollars for a custom one.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really a fan.</li>
            <li> I spent 400.00 on a mouth guard instead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that I can wear the Plackers during the day, with minimal impedance to my speech--they basically keep me from clenching my jaw.&lt;br</li>
            <li> ; wide.  </li>
            <li> first night was very uncomfortable - woke in the mid of the night with a tiny blister on the bottom of my gum where the guard was rubbing.</li>
            <li> these did not really work for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to shell out hundreds of dollars for a custom nightguard</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same one for a few weeks</li>
            <li> They last a few days each</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sometimes I wear it for a few hours at night and then take it out in the middle of the night.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m also trying to train myself to learn to have my mouth closed</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were priced well, disposable, and the shape was minimal.  </li>
            <li> I woke the next morning to it still carefully protecting my teeth firmly in place.</li>
            <li> Very uncomfortable and even feels like it make my teeth want to grip down more.</li>
            <li> Compared to the other teeth guards, these are thin and very flexible.  </li>
            <li> obviously one size fits all is not easy thing to do.</li>
            <li> It turns out that wearing a partial guard, that allows you to chew on your molars but not the other teeth, can cause the teeth to move.</li>
            <li> When I get down to my last few, I reorder.</li>
            <li> After waking up everyday with migraine headaches and jaw pain, I knew I finally had to break down and do something about my grinding and clenching.</li>
            <li> It feels little be strange.</li>
            <li> They work just fine, but are just a little awkward to get used to.</li>
            <li> This product has saved us the $1,000&#x27;s it would have cost to have the cosmetic improvements made to his teeth from the grinding as well as the braces the dentist said he would have ended up needing from the space the other night guard was causing to his bite.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The plastic is too sharp, if that make sense.</li>
            <li> I did not have any problems with &amp;#34;losing it&amp;#34; as some other posters have mentioned-</li>
            <li> I have actually fractured my tooth roots in the past.  </li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t bulky and require molding like other grind protection.  </li>
            <li> These only press on a small part of your teeth</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an extreme grinder, as in, I wake up my partner every night, without exception, with the grinding noise unless I wear guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is no need to cover you front teeth if your back teeth are not touching.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist the other day</li>
            <li> work when I don&#x27;t need to talk to other people.</li>
            <li> Plackers are small enough</li>
            <li> They are cheaper than other</li>
            <li> teeth wear, muscle jaw strain, and other issues.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> No more headaches and smaller than the ones sold at the drugstores.</li>
            <li> my molars and separates my other teeth.</li>
            <li> They are small enough to not feel like I have a mouth guard in.</li>
            <li> I suppose it works for some people (according to other reviews) but it kept falling out of mouth.</li>
            <li> The product was individually wrapped but was too small to use.</li>
            <li> No boiling of water or other torture.  </li>
            <li> The blather you read about boiling it is silly; you don&#x27;t put a hot thing in your mouth.</li>
            <li> Will keep looking for other options.</li>
            <li> my dd&#x27;s teeth have been hurting due to grinding.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it is this particular product i&#x27;m not thrilled with or the concept.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m semi-retired with a dinky little parttime job and a meager pension check and am just managing to buy groceries and pay the light bill</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical when I ordered these, but I thought they were worth a shot.</li>
            <li> He used it for a while, but found it to large and cumbersome, which was unfortunate because it was pretty expensive.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that this is a partial mouth guard not a full guard making it easier to tolerate.</li>
            <li> I tried lots of other kinds of bulky contraptions with no success.</li>
            <li> only downside is that, at least for me, there were no positive results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how or why, but I believe I am actually clenching less overnight as well as protecting the teeth.  </li>
            <li> If you choose to try the other night guards that mold to your teeth be very very careful that nightly use isn&#x27;t altering your teeth!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re less noticeable in the mouth than other styles</li>
            <li> The first night with these in my mouth was a little difficult, but after that I became used to them</li>
            <li> first night or two that you wear it, it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable but as it shapes to your mouth through use, it becomes unnoticable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Call me stupid, but I wanted to be sure I was not doing</li>
            <li> For me, they have been lasting for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> and they last at least 2 weeks each.</li>
            <li> I tried the latter, and barely could sleep with it, since even after mending it was too uncomfortable to wear it,and in the morning my jaw would hurt.</li>
            <li> The only complaint that I have is that it sometimes irritates my lower frenum (the tissue that connects the front of the lip to the gum).</li>
            <li> I use each one for longer than they say - probably 2-3 weeks on average.</li>
            <li> first few nights they are difficult to get used to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least three different guards but they all made me gag a</li>
            <li> EXPENSIVE there is no need for them to cost so much, they are not made of gold.</li>
            <li> The flimsy plastic doesn&#x27;t cover the whole tooth area, so I found it useless.</li>
            <li> Not worth messing up my years of dental work.</li>
            <li> ( They did not fit like I expected them to.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable on gums.</li>
            <li> It was not very comfortable ...</li>
            <li> We noticed that he was was beginning to wear down his teeth from the nightly grinding.</li>
            <li> I turned the guards upside down and haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Probably not for kids as the guard may slip and go down the throat</li>
            <li> Nothing like a piece of plastic that is keeping you awake at night as you drool down your chin.</li>
            <li> I have chewed the heck out of them, and have found that they might be reducing my desire to clamp down at night.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just beginning to wear down.</li>
            <li> So there went $400 down the drain.  </li>
            <li> but they do wear down eventually.</li>
            <li> I had to get used to  biting down and working my lip to keep the band across my teeth.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, each guard comes packaged in a plastic box with a plastic foil cover (that can be maddeningly difficult to open), and the 10 boxes come in a larger plastic box.</li>
            <li> However the discomfort lessened, but sort of shifted - other teeth felt odd for a while, and although that went away, my jaw still aches a little in the morning.  </li>
            <li> The trachea is less than one inch in diameter, the device is quite small, and it comes loose and floats around in the mouth at night.</li>
            <li> My teeth show less signs of pain through out the day as well.</li>
            <li> I know some of you said you have a problem keeping them in, but if you&#x27;re even a slight clencher, you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer mentions, this helped with migraines.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;something wrong, and tried it a third time, but finally learned my lesson.  </li>
            <li> They seem awkward at first</li>
            <li> I needed a dental implant to replace the tooth &amp; mess that was created ($6,000).  </li>
            <li> With the thin front \\&quot;strap\\&quot; that holds the two bite plates, I barely feel ANYTHING across my front gums.  </li>
            <li> I tend to grind and clutch my jaw tight at night so these help.</li>
            <li> These mouth guard were a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> They do give you a little Lisp.</li>
            <li> They take a little while to get used to....</li>
            <li> and the plastic gets a little worn.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to them.</li>
            <li> The flat part protects the teeth that would be grinding together in the night and the front part is a small strip of plastic that you hardly notice.  </li>
            <li> I gave a few to my father, who gets terrible headaches from grinding, and he also liked them.  </li>
            <li> &amp; it actually made the grinding worse.</li>
            <li> These work well for me and stay in place at night, although I understand some people have trouble with them.</li>
            <li> I feel like they are a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I grind through these in a few days--</li>
            <li> I use each one for a few months before I find it becomes ineffective.  </li>
            <li> I started using this guard and based on deformation of the guard after I use it for a few times, I do sometimes grind at night.</li>
            <li> Hate those home mold to fit ones.  </li>
            <li> I use them every night, year round.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few days to adjust to them.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  </li>
            <li> But after wearing it for a few nights, I do not even notice it is there.  </li>
            <li> It takes a few nights to get fully used to it.  </li>
            <li> So keep wearing it for a few nights.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, each guard can be worn for at least two weeks if not much longer.  </li>
            <li> and I am quite the heavy grinder.</li>
            <li> These items provide quite a few in one pack.  </li>
            <li> Also, one size does not fit all.</li>
            <li> You can just throw them away after a few nights.</li>
            <li> Feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> However, they are not for heavy grinders.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just not comfortable with them yet...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy nighttime grinder and literally wore out my $600 night guard.</li>
            <li> They are not comfortable and do not stay in place.</li>
            <li> One pack lasted me a few months doing this.</li>
            <li> Not comfortable and too flimsy.</li>
            <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> and I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> Waste of my money.</li>
            <li> I use this product a few nights a week..</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re small and you can wear them either face up or face down.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, I pour a little Listermint in the small container that comes with the guard and soak it in Listermint during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I clenched down so hard on that problem</li>
            <li> I think you need something hard to keep your jaws separated - these are squishy and my jaws tended to want to just clamp down on them, grinding them.</li>
            <li> I tried them for a few weeks and was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> To small not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Floats in mouth at  night and rubs gums raw.  </li>
            <li> It is not perfect and I did not get chances to try other guards to have something else to compare it to, but overall I continue to use this guard at least for now.</li>
            <li> These are BY FAR the least uncomfortable and easiest to use.  </li>
            <li> Plastic is a little too hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ground through two hard shell dentist made mouth guards over the years - even making the bite of my teeth uneven because of it.</li>
            <li> that is small as I have underbite.  </li>
            <li> It actually manages to stay in my mouth all night, unlike my custom guard, which usually winds up behind the bed!</li>
            <li> I have had two mouth guards from dentists in the past 6 years.</li>
            <li> One of the guards I was not able to tolerate at all.</li>
            <li> I tried several kinds of mouth guards but they were bulky, uncomfortable and made me salivate.</li>
            <li> They are to small and don&#x27;t stay in place</li>
            <li> I usually buy these at Dollar tree</li>
            <li> Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> No More Night Time</li>
            <li> They are way too small and flimsy.  </li>
            <li> These are small.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I was nervous even going to bed with it in my mouth because it&#x27;s so small and moves around.</li>
            <li> My dentist said I have a small mouth</li>
            <li> have used these for almost a year and no more headaches or sore jaw from grinding my teeth at night</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure if these help or not.</li>
            <li> Started using these and no more headaches/pain since.</li>
            <li> Not safe.</li>
            <li> I feel much less tense when I wake up.</li>
            <li> SO I am not sure yet.  </li>
            <li> (sorry, gross I know).  </li>
            <li> No More in RiteAid..  </li>
            <li> No More does the trick.  </li>
            <li> No more headaches since I started using them.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s about it. :/</li>
            <li> No More mouth guards.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have $500 to spend on a custom guard that my insurance doesn&#x27;t even cover :/</li>
            <li> Because of their small size and lack of any stay-put mechanism, I end up spitting them out every night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think my mouth is that small</li>
            <li> No More Night Time Use&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not exactly &#x27;sexy&#x27;...</li>
            <li> I like that the item is not so big that it is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> but since my mouth is so small.</li>
            <li> Wasted time and money!</li>
            <li> These are not safe to use, and I can not&lt;br /&gt;recommend</li>
            <li> No More mouth guards.</li>
            <li> (No more a.m. headaches upon waking.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does or doesn&#x27;t..</li>
            <li> But what I didn&#x27;t like about the expensive dentist made one was that it wore down my front teeth at an alarming rate.  </li>
            <li> Before finding this brand, I used several brands of grind guards and hated nearly every one of them.</li>
            <li> And I couldn&#x27;t grind my teeth, but in the morning my jaw and some teeth felt off, plus the one time use thing kinda sucks, and it felt too small for my mouth</li>
            <li> They are so uncomfortable, was not able to sleep with these, very loose and feel like its just there in my mouth floating around...</li>
            <li> I have a small mouth, so it is awkward to have one of the larger night guards in</li>
            <li> Plackers&#x27; brand is small and thin, it is a disposable product that is designed to be worn for a few nights and thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I hardly feel them when I am going to sleep.</li>
            <li> However, after a while he started grinding his teeth so hard that he needs protection for his front teeth as well.</li>
            <li> Gets hard and hurts my teeth.  </li>
            <li> They are getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> maybe because i&#x27;m not grinding as hard now?</li>
            <li> These are hardly noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They were hard to keep in my mouth</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get used to sleeping with them in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> you can hardly tell they&#x27;re there, and they work for me.</li>
            <li> I have an expensive custom-made guard which is very hard, cubed-shaped and fits over my upper front teeth.  </li>
            <li> One lasted at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I actually think this product is quite dangerous.</li>
            <li> I use each one for at least a week.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying these suckers from the dollar store from here on out.  </li>
            <li> They are so terribly thick compared to a pro guard.  </li>
            <li> I hate to take it when I leave home; these really cover those instances well.</li>
            <li> (Doctors)...too thick, didn&#x27;t work,spit out in the night.</li>
            <li> The dentist suggested a custom made mouth guard but is unable to prepare one until I have other dental work completed, so I purchased this product.  </li>
            <li> Very small</li>
            <li> The first one I hated and didn&#x27;t use.</li>
            <li> My dentist had suggested I consider using my guard during the day, which was next to impossible as I am a teacher and talk with my students all day.  </li>
            <li> and I am afraid to pay the price for one that is professional made for fear that it will be uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way less expensive than getting one made from your dentist</li>
            <li> Although the manufacturer say otherwise I think there is a serious danger of choking.</li>
            <li> i guess i&#x27;m a serious grinder.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t want to spring for an expensive custom fitted night guard or find traditional night guards uncomfortable, give these a try.</li>
            <li> Aint nothing wrong with a little bump and grind.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> A little expensive, though.</li>
            <li> Sorry 2 thumbs DOWN!</li>
            <li> Not a good design or a well thought out design.</li>
            <li> no good at all</li>
            <li> The amount of waste is unsettling.</li>
            <li> Useless waste of money.</li>
            <li> Very small in size and very thick in between my gaw&#x27;s .</li>
            <li> These are very small and thin but do the job.</li>
            <li> I hated the idea of wearing one, particularly when a custom one cost $450 and dental insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it.</li>
            <li> These things are a ridiculous and dangerous waste of money.</li>
            <li> and they work perfectly -- no more headaches!!  </li>
            <li> No More !!</li>
            <li> After having my teeth permanently damaged by a hard guard made by my dentist, that failed to stop my severe night clenching I decided to give these a try.</li>
            <li> It is made with a thin strip of plastic and two thicker tabs on the ends that are supposed to stop you teeth from grinding.</li>
            <li> I did try a mouth guard several years ago and practically gagged up my meal as I HATE anything in my mouth.  </li>
            <li> The morning after I wear these my jaw feels worse and feel like my bite has been shifted.  </li>
            <li> But seriously - these are absolutely useless.  </li>
            <li> When I got these, I was so skeptical thinking how a flimsy piece of plastic is going to help my serious grinding problem.</li>
            <li> the mold was sloppy.</li>
            <li> No More is a dangerous product because it does not protect the user from tooth grinding as advertised.  </li>
            <li> I am also afraid to sleep with them because they are small and I don&#x27;t want to risk choking on them.</li>
            <li> They are too small and move around in your mouth, I would be afraid of choking on it.</li>
            <li> i used it at night and find it under my pillow very dangerous it get loose.</li>
            <li> No More has saved my expensive dental implant!  </li>
            <li> Bulky and dirty and just annoying to sleep with, they tended to only be used for a while and then &#x27;forgotten&#x27; about.  </li>
            <li> I woke up with the stupid mouth guard going down my throat and choking on</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth in my sleep and unfortunately, my insurance does not cover a dentist made mouth guard.  </li>
            <li> I have been using mouth guards (very similar to football mouth guards) and they have been horrible.</li>
            <li> Difficult to get use to.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I try these as opposed to getting an expensive custom made one from the office.&lt;br /&gt;They</li>
            <li> This made my grinding worse !</li>
            <li> Expensive, but they work without gagging you.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving expensive custom grinding mouth guard at hotels with these.  </li>
            <li> I have a guard made by my dentist and since it was so expensive</li>
            <li> so I bought this, hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t be too uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Totally useless to me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the mouthguard exacerbated the problem...</li>
            <li> It was a scary experience.</li>
            <li> This product fails to protect the teeth.</li>
            <li> Feels insecure or in the way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an expensive night guard from my dentist for a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit weird sleeping with these in your mouth but because they are reversible you can always change the way they feel.  </li>
            <li> They are a bit uncomfortable of</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but man, I was waking up with a clenched jaw and headaches off and on and my dentist said I was grinding my teeth.</li>
            <li> although I suspect sleeping with anything in your mouth is uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> them in any way after my frightening experience with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to get a really expensive one, so I searched Amazon and came up with this option.  </li>
            <li> The fact that they aren&#x27;t too expensive is a plus.</li>
            <li> and that is a waste I hate to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry they didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to just throw them away, but they were useless to me.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about spending $$$ on a replacement for the expensive one I used to use.  </li>
            <li> These are useless.</li>
            <li> sorry for my review.</li>
            <li> but according to others that occasionally spend the night..I grind my teeth terribly.</li>
            <li> Had tried other kinds but hated them.</li>
            <li> I was afraid I&#x27;d end up swallowing them in my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> I keep these around always, and I grind like crazy.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be dangerous.</li>
            <li> Or what was dangerous is that my jaws ground them into pieces and I almost gagged and choked on a piece.</li>
            <li> Im afraid I will choke on it while I sleep.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, they are small and I was hesitate to wear at night because of the size.</li>
            <li> I go through the expensive brands within 3-4 days max!</li>
            <li> They were very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Flimsy and impossible to keep in place.</li>
            <li> I have bad night time grinding and daytime clenching.  </li>
            <li> I grind my teeth so bad</li>
            <li> Have a bad habit of leaving the 20.00 guards when I take them.</li>
            <li> and I woke up with a bad headache both times</li>
            <li> which tells you how bad I am at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> painful - digs into my gums on the front</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid that I may swallow them!</li>
            <li> Dangerous product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still working up the desperation to pay $500 for a stupid dental night guard -</li>
            <li> Dentist wanted to charge me 400$ for mouth guard, my crap insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it.</li>
            <li> i have a bad habit of clenching which gives me terrible headaches every morning and tooth/jaw pain all day.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth really badly!</li>
            <li> I hated the mouth guard that the dentist gave me because my saliva pooled into it.</li>
            <li> I went to the dentist and was told these were a very bad idea.  </li>
            <li> and I really hated them!</li>
            <li> Caused me to awake each morning with my bite maladjusted and caused awful headaches.</li>
            <li> As a result I wake up with horrible headaches, which sometimes turn into migraines.</li>
            <li> The strap that comes around the front of the teeth rubs against the inside of the lips in the worst way.</li>
            <li> Was quite miserable and prayiing asking God to help.  </li>
            <li> WORST product for teeth grinders.</li>
            <li> Terrible tmj problems and my dentist wanted to make me a $1000 retainer.</li>
            <li> These are terrible.</li>
            <li> Terrible time sleeping when you grind your teeth.  </li>

            <li> I love these! My young daughter and I both enjoy the comfort and protection these guards provide!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small/thin in mouth, not bulky. I wash and reuse for a week. much better than the mold to  your mouth version.FYI  I am a clencher and not a grinder so I have no issues with it staying in place.</li>
            <li> Pretty comfortable that after a few minutes I do not even notice and I fall right to sleep. Flexes very nicely and very lightweight.</li>
            <li> They are so uncomfortable, was not able to sleep with these, very loose and feel like its just there in my mouth floating around...</li>
            <li> But seriously - these are absolutely useless.  The &amp;#34;guards&amp;#34; flop around in my mouth and aren&#x27;t click-in-able at all.  The product simply lays in between your teeth.  I don&#x27;t know why this product is still on the market.  I imagine they&#x27;ll soon be sued out of business by the loved ones of people who have choked to death.</li>
            <li> As immediate relief for bruxism, these are very convenient.  My most obvious discomfort changed as soon as I started using it.  However the discomfort lessened, but sort of shifted - other teeth felt odd for a while, and although that went away, my jaw still aches a little in the morning.  That&#x27;s a better result than the Doctor&#x27;s Night Guard - I never tried a &#x27;real&#x27; ($400) fitted guard.</li>
            <li> I needed something for my TMJ pain. I did not realize it was not meant for that. I ended up having more pain after using it!</li>
            <li> My teenage son has been grinding his teeth in his sleep ever since he was a toddler.  We noticed that he was was beginning to wear down his teeth from the nightly grinding. I bought a $40 night guard but it ended up being too soft (it was the kind that forms after biting into to it after softening it in boiling water) &amp; it actually made the grinding worse. The next one we tried cost slightly less then the first one &amp; also was able to be molded to the teeth after softening it in water but we must not have formed it correctly &amp; noticed that it was making a space between his top &amp; bottom teeth (similar to what happens to a young child who  uses a pacifier or sucks his thumb) after 3-4 weeks of wearing it at night. We threw that one out also. I made an appointment with the dentist &amp; in the meantime ordered these from Amazon (&amp; spent the extra $4.00 to have them shipped next day Prime). Although we got the professionally made night guard from the dentist he has continued to use the Plackers Grind No More since they not only are much more comfortable the a traditional mouth guard but are more effective at keeping the grinding to a minimum. This product has saved us the $1,000&#x27;s it would have cost to have the cosmetic improvements made to his teeth from the grinding as well as the braces the dentist said he would have ended up needing from the space the other night guard was causing to his bite.&lt;br /&gt;I highly highly recommend this product!! If you choose to try the other night guards that mold to your teeth be very very careful that nightly use isn&#x27;t altering your teeth!</li>
            <li> Says one size fits all but they were too big for my mouth</li>
            <li> I have bad night time grinding and daytime clenching.  Dental guard made my ears have noise so I dediced to try all these things.  These were too long fit for my mouth that is small as I have underbite.  I sometimes put in during day when gums get so irritated from jaw muslces.  They still dont fit too good but work as short term relief.  I have been using the dr brux guard that fits better and for me works, after a bit trimming.  This is not something I would buy again.</li>
            <li> These things will last longer than a few days. Its a huge bargain buying these. I just clean it every morning. These can last a month as long as they are cleaned. I paid quite a bit of money for &amp;#34;better&amp;#34; mouth guards and these work better than all of them. for 15 bucks you cant beat them.</li>
            <li> Comfortable and useful.  Sure beats the high price of one from my dentist. Does the job, not as good as the custom made one from the dentist but a good replacement.</li>
            <li> These mouth guard were a little flimsy. They were unstable and did not want to stay in place. I tried them for a few weeks and was not satisfied. I ended up getting a more professional mouth guard from my dentist.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I will buy these again. Very very timely service, and product in excellent condition upon arrival. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> I suffer from jaw clenching, which mainly affects my front teeth.  I have a custom-made guard, but it still allows me to press my lower teeth to the guard.  This item keeps my front teeth slightly separated, which is exactly what I need.  And it&#x27;s much more comfortable.  It actually manages to stay in my mouth all night, unlike my custom guard, which usually winds up behind the bed!</li>
            <li> Flimsy and impossible to keep in place.</li>
            <li> easy to use -- and so many for the price</li>
            <li> I have had two mouth guards from dentists in the past 6 years. They are for clenching, primarily at night.  One of the guards I was not able to tolerate at all. The other I have used for a few years, although at times it was difficult to use consistently and get a good nights sleep. I received the Plackers mouth guards about 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised.  They are a night guard that covers your molars, and a slim band goes across the front of your teeth.  It can be used on the top or bottom.  I have found it to be very comfortable and it seems to be breaking my clenching habit.  With the dental guard I was still biting on the guard at night.  My dentist had suggested I consider using my guard during the day, which was next to impossible as I am a teacher and talk with my students all day.  With the Plackers mouth guard, it is not nearly as intrusive and can comfortably be used during the day. I would highly recommend to others!</li>
            <li> Pretty good.....for over the counter mouth guard. If your grinding your teeth......u need these!</li>
            <li> I have tried many mouth guards and every one has always had issues. The problem with most mouth guards is that they are so uncomfortable, but not this one. Yes-- at first you can feel it, but after a few nights, it is invisible. Easy to wash and I have been using the same one for several months with no problems. I love this and it is the only one that I will use!!</li>
            <li> It is very useful, but sometimes it get out of the mouth because they are not adjusted to the bite.&lt;br /&gt;But they works..</li>
            <li> Dentist cost for a custom mouth guard was $600.  The boil-and-fit mouth guards never worked well for me.  These work great, fit very well and are comfortable to use.  I will be using them from now on.  For me, they have been lasting for at least two weeks.</li>
            <li> These work well for me and stay in place at night, although I understand some people have trouble with them. They&#x27;re less noticeable in the mouth than other styles and I have no trouble sleeping with them. I&#x27;m also able to use one for a lot longer than 3 days :)</li>
            <li> These are small and perfect as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;Much more comfortable to use than a full tooth guard, generic or prescription.&lt;br /&gt;They are supposed to be a 1 use item...I get a lot more usage out of one so I&#x27;m&lt;br /&gt;not spending a lot.  I will never go back to a full tooth guard.</li>
            <li> I tried several kinds of mouth guards but they were bulky, uncomfortable and made me salivate. These are very small and thin but do the job. They are supposed to be disposable but I use them for weeks since I do not have a grinding problem but a sleep apnea problem. They keep my mouth open enough so I can breathe while asleep. The simple construction is basically a couple of small L shaped molds that fit over the back teeth held together by a strip. Simple and effective. The only problem is I tend to lose them. No matter what mouth guard I&#x27;ve tried, they sometimes fall out at night. Since these are small, I can&#x27;t find them easily.</li>
            <li> Works great, no longer wake up to my husbands teeth grinding. He uses until he wears through the guard. Great price and does the trick.</li>
            <li> Use nightly. Perfect as I am a grinder. I wish I wasn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I am a tooth clincher in my sleep.  I thought these might be able to help.  In my case, the part that goes between your teeth to cushion them stuck in past my teeth so far that when I woke up the next morning, my tongue was sore.  I tried trimming them up, but that didn’t help.  I think they are right when they say talk to your dentist first.  I ended up tossing these in the trash.</li>
            <li> Oh my lucky stars I am so glad I found these!  I grind my teeth in my sleep and unfortunately, my insurance does not cover a dentist made mouth guard.  For years I have tried other over the counter guards in an attempt to curb the problem, but usually get discouraged by a mouth piece which is much too large for my mouth and uncomfortable.  NOT ANYMORE!  These are perfect.  They are not bulky like many of the mouth guards you find in stores.  I have already purchased a second box for when I run out.  Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Use them to assist in migraine prevention. They do what they advertise and they are the only ones that fit a small mouth.</li>
            <li> I found these uncomfortable to the point that they caused sores in my mouth whether I wore them on the top or the bottom. The plastic is too sharp, if that make sense. I would not recommend them.</li>
            <li> Works to prevent grinding of surfaces, but probably would not work for someone who grinds side-to-side.  Nice to be able to have a fresh guard when desired.</li>
            <li> These can each last for much more than 3 days and they have helped my BF tremendously with his tooth grinding problem.</li>
            <li> These littles gems work like a charm. I&#x27;m a grinder/ clenched, and my teeth were paying the price. Also headaches from the pressure. Dentist wanted to charge me 400$ for mouth guard, my crap insurance doesn&#x27;t cover it. Instead got these at the local cvs. Haven&#x27;t looked back. Easy to use, hardly noticeable and they stay in place. Life saver!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried after reading some of the other reviews.  I did have a slight gag reflex at first, but kept with it and it quickly went away.  I did notice I was biting the guard more than normal, but I learned to stop doing that was well.  I have definitely seen a reduction in my head aches.</li>
            <li> This product is useful, but it is not a good habit to use it, when you stop to use, still grind</li>
            <li> This is a very helpful, useful product and I am very happy I found this item on amazon.com.  I love this product.</li>
            <li> I bought these to help with a place inside my mouth that I kept biting during the night. They do a great job, especially for the price, but I did sometimes wake up with sore teeth, as though I had been clenching it. I did not have any problems with &amp;#34;losing it&amp;#34; as some other posters have mentioned- it stayed in place and did exactly what I needed. One lasted at least 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Sorry, I just can&#x27;t give these a good review.  I feel like they are a waste of money. I was afraid I&#x27;d end up swallowing them in my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;1. They are to small and don&#x27;t stay in place&lt;br /&gt;2.They feel too soft to make a difference</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t tried anything like these before, but they fit in the mouth easily and keep you teeth separated well enough. My problem was that I kept taking it out in my sleep...always finding it under my pillow.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it.  I grind my teeth at night.  this left grooves in my molars after 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> Compared to the other teeth guards, these are thin and very flexible.  You can talk with the guard on.  The box says you can use 3 times, but I get many more uses from each one.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes that these would help with my jaw clenching that caused a lot of tension and is probably contributing to my chronic headaches.  They are super easy to use, last much longer than the suggested time of usage, and very comfortable.  After a couple of nights using them, I got so used to them I barely knew I had one in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that, at least for me, there were no positive results.</li>
            <li> Much cheaper than buying in the store for a much less price. When I get down to my last few, I reorder. Very easy!</li>
            <li> After waking up everyday with migraine headaches and jaw pain, I knew I finally had to break down and do something about my grinding and clenching. I visited a dentist that specializes in such, they offered to make a custom mouthguard for $500 (my insurance would not cover it). I decided to try an otc mouthguard first. First I tried an adjustable sleepright guard, which was so big it dug into my cheeks and I couldn&#x27;t keep it in my mouth for more than an hour at a time. Then I bought this product, what a difference! These are slim and flexible with NO extra plastic. The plastic seems to make a perfect fit after warming to body temperature. On top of that, they are much, much cheaper than other otc mouthguards and disposable so I never have to worry about losing or ruining one. Wearing these retrained the way my jaw sits within a couple of weeks and seems to continue to get even better. Could not be happier, try this before you drop a load of cash on anything else!</li>
            <li> These work well for me.  I have a small mouth, so it is awkward to have one of the larger night guards in and I am afraid to pay the price for one that is professional made for fear that it will be uncomfortable.  These are small, comfortable, and keep me from grinding my teeth together at night.</li>
            <li> Not very comfortable on gums. Band that goes in front is too large to fit.</li>
            <li> I cannot sleep without these ! i always have obe with me in case of an impromptu nap!! I usually buy these at Dollar tree but they were out of this product so I stocked up on amazon</li>
            <li> Had one of the $500 grinding guard... always felt like a tennis racquet in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Bought both the Plackers and the Sleep Right guards to compare.&lt;br /&gt;Sleep Right is adjustable, but abraids my cheek.&lt;br /&gt;Plackers can be worn on top or bottom arcade, whichever works better.&lt;br /&gt;Plackers is meant to be worn only 3 times, but I&#x27;ve been using mine for a month, and it&#x27;s working great!&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Our daughter was getting Headaches from grinding her teeth, and we were told she needed a mouth guard but would have to wait until she finishes braces -- 18 months!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We purchased these and they work perfectly -- no more headaches!!  Easy to use and no problems with braces</li>
            <li> Not at all comfortable putting these in my mouth to sleep with they are far too small and flimsy and I worry about swallowing or possibly choking on them</li>
            <li> I grind through these in a few days-- but still ok since they&#x27;re so cheap. I was told by my dentist that as long as my teeth don&#x27;t touch, any guard will work (for a while until I save enough money for a real one...)</li>
            <li> I grind and clench my teeth a lot at night and have worn NTI  night guards in the past which I totally love but are so expensive, sadly.&lt;br /&gt;These clearly help prevent teeth from grinding.&lt;br /&gt;They don&#x27;t have anything to keep them in place, so if you sleep with your mouth open, these are not the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;Mildly too big for my small mouth and no way to trim them.</li>
            <li> These things work great,  as a night time grinder I require a guard.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Small and thin,,,AKA I CAN SLEEP W/O being BOTHERED&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable Price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Disposable...I would like to be able to sanitize and reuse...I guess thats the trade off for small and light.</li>
            <li> These are ok, sort of small, and make your mouth feel a little off in the mornings. Still do the job though</li>
            <li> I am a clincher, not a grinder. I have been using mouth guards (very similar to football mouth guards) and they have been horrible. Typical mouth guards create a natural &amp;#34;suction cup&amp;#34; so you wake up and your jaw and teeth feel super uncomfortable. I would highly recommend this product. They are SUPER comfortable and helpful. I know other reviews mentioned they almost choked on them etc, but if you are a clincher, these are perfect for you. If you have had braces, these will be even better. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews but these designed very well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m more of a clencher (especially night-time) than a grinder.  I have actually fractured my tooth roots in the past.  I have an expensive custom-made guard which is very hard, cubed-shaped and fits over my upper front teeth.  I can&#x27;t find it anywhere.  For all I know, I yanked it off during the night and threw it out the window.  Anyway, not wanting to spend hundreds for a new one, I decided to try a \\&quot;drugstore guard\\&quot;.  The Plackers looked intriguing -- obviously very different from the other \\&quot;old standard\\&quot; type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m delighted with Plackers.  The guard is extremely light, flexible, and comfortable, but protects my back molars beautifully.  Although it is your choice to wear either on top or on the bottom, I wear mine on the bottom, with the soft, very comfortable plastic covering the tops of the molars that I seem intent on destroying in my sleep.  I&#x27;m not sure how or why, but I believe I am actually clenching less overnight as well as protecting the teeth.  Although the guard is compact and light as a feather, I haven&#x27;t been perforating them.  I got four nights use from each one.  After the fourth night, the guard is pretty \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; and ready to toss out for a new one.  I like that each guard is individually and sanitarily packaged; you can even use the individual guard containers to store the guard in between uses.  Because it&#x27;s so \\&quot;minimalist,\\&quot; the guard doesn&#x27;t get all gross and gunky; a quick rinse and perhaps a dunk in mouthwash and you&#x27;re good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is definitely unique, and it&#x27;s perhaps a leap of faith to try, but I&#x27;m really pleased.

            <li> Slightly too large for me, but OK for others in my family. Still a good deal and worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a teeth saver.. I tried a few others and this was the first one that was comfortable enough for me to fall alseep and stay asleep..</li>
            <li> Difficult to get use to. Not sure yet.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t be wearing these overnight : ( They did not fit like I expected them to. Too much moving around in my mouth. I&#x27;m afraid that I may swallow them!</li>
            <li> I actually bought my night guard from Dollar Tree ffor a dollar and have worn it 2 nights. Much more comfortable than dentist-made guard. I was hoping to find some in bulk for even cheaper but looks like Dollar Tree will be cheapest! May not work for everyone but seems to be just what I needed, they stay in place very good - much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended that I try these as opposed to getting an expensive custom made one from the office.&lt;br /&gt;They work really really really well. I used to wake up with a sore face from clenching and grinding &amp; that hasn&#x27;t happened since I started using these.&lt;br /&gt;They are also disposable &amp; hygienic... Need I say more?</li>
            <li> Helps a lot! Great product!</li>
            <li> This is the cheapest and really good solution if you grind your teeth at night or driving your car in traffic. I am amazed at how well the Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Night Time Use works AND I used one for several nights/weeks before using a new one.</li>
            <li> This product was so easy to use but before purchasing this products you should carefully read the Warning or better yet consult a dentist first, so it won&#x27;t be a waste. It was actually written on the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When i used it was really comfortable but i did not bought it for me it&#x27;s for my sister actually. Unfortunately my sister cannot use it  because she have 2 or more missing teeth Upper and Lower Teeth. It was all my fault because i did not review the product well.</li>
            <li> I like these and they are great for traveling and a good way to decide if you want to invest in a expensive guard from the dentist.</li>
            <li> They are way too small and flimsy.  I had concerns about choking while sleeping. Not what we were expecting at all.</li>
            <li> All through high school, I used the bulky custom guards and I really hated them! My mouth felt like it was full of cotton balls and I would take it out without even waking up. Recently, I came to need a mouth guard again, and I haven&#x27;t made it to the dentist. I picked these up at a drug store and I am very pleased! They don&#x27;t feel bulky and I never have an issue with them falling out. However, they sometimes make the top or bottom of my gums hurt, depending on how I wear it the night before.&lt;br /&gt;When I wake up, I rinse mine off and put it into a clean baggie or container. Then at night, before I use it, I clean it again, finishing off with some mouthwash and off I go!</li>
            <li> Frequenty Nightly teeth grinder.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;These are fantastic.  I&#x27;ve been using this same set for over a year actually even though they are supposed to be disposable/temporary.  They aren&#x27;t bulky and require molding like other grind protection.  Saves me from a lot of morning jaw ache and headaches.  After the first couple days I find a guard deforms a bit, but after that retains it&#x27;s shape fairly well.  I use each one for a few months before I find it becomes ineffective.  It&#x27;s easy to brush in the morning since there are no real crevices for gross morning breath gunk to get lodged in and it&#x27;s clear so easy to see if anything gets funky or too damaged.  Small and great for travel too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;None for me!</li>
            <li> I did not like them at all and they fell out during the night. They were very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> These are great. I hardly feel them when I am going to sleep. Huge improvement from full-on mouthguards.</li>
            <li> I was not even sure if I grind my teeth at night but I had feeling I do since I had problems with my teeth. I started using this guard and based on deformation of the guard after I use it for a few times, I do sometimes grind at night. Maybe not as much as others but I do. This guard does the job, it prevent grind. I do notice soreness of my far back teeth in the morning. It feels little be strange. Also you have to get used to wearing the guard at night. Initially I would wake up without the guard in my mouth, I would spit it out during the sleep. It is not perfect and I did not get chances to try other guards to have something else to compare it to, but overall I continue to use this guard at least for now.</li>
            <li> These are good for the occasional TMJ pain that I experience. Much cheaper than investing in a mouth guard through the dentist and easier than trying to boil a sports mouth guard for temporary use and relief. I love that there is no adjusting and they will work when placed on the upper jaw or lower jaw. I&#x27;m glad they are disposable so I can just throw them away when I&#x27;ve used them for three days or when my pain goes away. I&#x27;d buy these again if needed.</li>
            <li> This product is great I  use it every night and have reduce my jaw pain and the sensitivity of my teeth from grinding at night when sleep. I can use it for three nights before I have to depose the use one.</li>
            <li> Good price but meh on product.</li>
            <li> These are small. Not bulky. They will work for anyone. They don&#x27;t get in the way. I use them to keep from biting my tongue at night. I asked my dentist for a recommendation and he suggested mouth guards like the athletes wear. No. I asked my lunch buddy for a recommendation and she came up with this. Cheap, easy, comfortable.</li>
            <li> It was much more comfortable than I expected.  It&#x27;s made of some soft plastic/rubber like substance that didn&#x27;t rub my gums or cause any sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gave it three stars because it&#x27;s so thick that my mouth won&#x27;t close on its own.  So I woke up a couple of times due to dry mouth or drool.  It&#x27;s definitely not a sexy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Btw, being a fan of gummi candy, I had several dreams of having gummi worms in my mouth on the first night using this mouthguard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;ve never used mouthguards so I don&#x27;t know how this product compares to others out there.</li>
            <li> This product is &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;. It was very loose and did not stay on my teeth. I felt it was a choking hazard</li>
            <li> I had tried for years to find a mouth guard I wouldn&#x27;t spit out at night.....and this is it!! This will be my second order and I am very happy with them! I use them way longer than 3 days too....wash with hot soapy water every AM and they last at least 2 weeks each.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money! the pieces are too small and my first one tore a few minutes after trying. Not a good design or a well thought out design. Sorry 2 thumbs DOWN!</li>
            <li> Dangerous product! I was nervous even going to bed with it in my mouth because it&#x27;s so small and moves around. and sure enough I had just gotten to sleep when I woke up chocking on it. will not be trying this again.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. To small not comfortable. Made my teeth feel out of alignment. My dentist said I have a small mouth soo...idk...guess I will be getting a custom one.</li>
            <li> they are comfortable, inexpensive, and you can wear them way longer than a day or two as suggested by the packaging. I like these better than an expensive one I started out with.</li>
            <li> These work pretty well to alleviate some of the pressure of grinding. They do take a bit of time to get used to though. I found that they &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; better when worn on the bottom. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you grind your teeth every night, but as someone who grinds their teeth when they are stressed these fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this. It seems to do the job well but after using it I think the risk of choking on the plastic is far too great. I actually think this product is quite dangerous.</li>
            <li> This works as well as a dentist-made product and when it is germ-infested, can simply be tossed. Near perfect. I have gone beyond the recommended 3 days so this should last longer than advertised.</li>
            <li> Excellent at stopping teeth grinding.  Comforable in mouth.  I use the same mouth guard until it wears out or gets lost. One package lasts for months.</li>
            <li> This made my grinding worse ! DO not buy a soft bite guard, as per my dentist.</li>
            <li> Just received these yesterday, tried them last night.  When I first took it out of the box I was concerned because it&#x27;s flimsy feeling.  Similar to a rubber band string with two flattened ends, I was thinking this is going to float around in my mouth in the middle of the night.  I had read reviews of some people saying it had done just that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for me?  Stayed exactly where I put it.  I like that you can place it on your top teeth or your bottom teeth (I prefer the bottom), and it felt far less obtrusive than the night guard I&#x27;m currently using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...did the job I wanted it to, stayed where I wanted it to, and I expect theat by brushing them down they will last longer than just the recommended three days.  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> I do not grind my teeth every night, but whenI fall into my bad habits every now and then, its nice to be able to grab a new sanitary grind guard without worrying about cleanliness. The fit was perfect although I did find myself taking out in my sleep. I&#x27;m glad I did not invest in a $100 customized guard- this one works just fine!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it is this particular product i&#x27;m not thrilled with or the concept.  Bite guards are thicker than I had thought they would be. When relaxing my jaw the guard is pushing it open past a neutral/relaxed position, which makes me clench even more when I fall asleep.  Tried for 3 nights and gave up due to my jaw being even more sore/stiff in the mornings. However, if they were thinner, i&#x27;m not sure how effective they would be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way less expensive than getting one made from your dentist and I find that it&#x27;s way more&lt;br /&gt;hygenic because they are disposable. I use mine for more than the 3 days each it recommends.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also great because you can pack them easily if you&#x27;re going out of town or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love it because I don&#x27;t look like a total freak going to bed! Who wants to have a gigantic&lt;br /&gt;mouthpiece in their mouth when they go to bed with their sweety?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You look relatively normal after you put it in and can grind all you want at night without worrying about your chompers!</li>
            <li> LOVE em!!!  I get lots more than 3 days wear from one of the night guards!  Will continue to use these, at this price, for certain!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a professional custom guard for 6 years; it broke and I needed a temporary solution.  Hate those home mold to fit ones.  They are so terribly thick compared to a pro guard.  The bite wing idea seems great.  But this device is soooo small; it does not reach back to the molars; it barely reached beyond my canines.  Caused me to awake each morning with my bite maladjusted and caused awful headaches.</li>
            <li> I use these nightly and it has helps tremendously! I used to wake up with sore teeth and jaw, not anymore. I use them each about 1 month, brushing them every morning.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t sleep without these.  I&#x27;m such a mouth grinder.  Expensive, but they work without gagging you.</li>
            <li> Sometimes hurts mu gums otherise fine</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realized how much I clenched my teeth until my dentist informed me that I had little indents in my teeth from it. I thought I would give these a try before buying a more expensive one. They work just fine, but are just a little awkward to get used to.</li>
            <li> These only press on a small part of your teeth and so it almost feels like you are biting on a flat, squishy pencil. Very uncomfortable and even feels like it make my teeth want to grip down more.</li>
            <li> have used these for almost a year and no more headaches or sore jaw from grinding my teeth at night</li>
            <li> These are amazing. a GREAT alternative to having custom trays made (which is SO expensive). When I can get my boyfriend to actually use them, it totally relieves his grinding &amp; he doesn&#x27;t wake up with headaches on the evenings he uses them.</li>
            <li> These used to be carried at Walgreens, but now I can only find them online. I alternate these with my regular retainers and they seem to work like I need them to. They fit just right.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my boyfriend. They are very convenient because you can throw them away after multiple days wear. However, after a while he started grinding his teeth so hard that he needs protection for his front teeth as well. So we are currently trying a full mouth piece product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, for the normal night grinders I would recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My husband grinds his teeth frequently at night ad was fitted for a mouthpiece by the dentist.  He used it for a while, but found it to large and cumbersome, which was unfortunate because it was pretty expensive.  He came across these mouth guards and they are so sleek and inexpensive that they really are a fantastic alternative.  I gave a few to my father, who gets terrible headaches from grinding, and he also liked them.  This is significant since he uses a sleep apnea machine and used to neglect the use of his mouth guard since he felt very constricted with so many oral devices at night.  He uses these now frequently without complaint.</li>
            <li> My dentist said that these caused my teeth to move and separate allowing space between the teeth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly not sure if these help or not. I don&#x27;t wear them every night. If I wake up and can feel that I&#x27;ve been grinding my teeth, I use one of these the same night. They&#x27;re fairly comfortable and don&#x27;t bother me, but sometimes in the morning it almost hurts worse than it did when I was grinding without it. Still, after a few nights of wearing it the grinding will stop which is nice.</li>
            <li> I clench my teeth at night.  As a result I wake up with horrible headaches, which sometimes turn into migraines. I decided to try these because the other mouth guard I&#x27;ve used were just too big.  It was difficult to fall asleep while using them and most times I spit them out during the night.  These are really great.  They keep me from clenching my teeth, but I barely notice they are in my mouth.  Sometimes I will walk around with the guard in my mouth for ten or fifteen minutes before I realize it is still in there.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for the price.  I don&#x27;t really like wearing any sort of mouth guard and it takes a lot of getting used to BUT these are the best guards I have found so far and the only ones I&#x27;ve been able to keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip:  My gums got a little sensitive when I wore it with the &amp;#34;wrap&amp;#34; side facing down.  I turned the guards upside down and haven&#x27;t had a problem since.</li>
            <li> I found that this doesnt protect the back and actually makes my front teeth hurt.</li>
            <li> The first night I used these, my jaw hurt a little more in the morning. Then I switched it to my bottom teeth, and it&#x27;s helped a lot.</li>
            <li> Great product but no for people who grind hard - I occasionally grind my teeth and have found these are perfect -no falling apart as the boil to fit products do - I get at least a weeks worth of use for each unit</li>
            <li> Works.  Comfortable in my mouth.</li>
            <li> works well and does what it is supposed to do. would highly recommend to anyone with this problem. very good.</li>
            <li> I cannot remember how very, very many &amp;#34;mouth guards&amp;#34; of every kind I have purchased for sleeping.  These are BY FAR the least uncomfortable and easiest to use.  I&#x27;m still using the first one two weeks later.  I wear it on the top, and it stays in place, preventing me from clenching or grinding my teeth or from biting my tongue. Wish I had found these years ago. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great for travel.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about leaving expensive custom grinding mouth guard at hotels with these.  I use them every night, year round.  I find them to be more comfortable, cleaner, and much less expensive than custom mouth guards.</li>
            <li> Aint nothing wrong with a little bump and grind.&lt;br /&gt;I grind still but now I dont need to worry if my teeth will turn to nubs</li>
            <li> I may forget my custom made guard on trips. I put a couple of these in all suitcases and never without! They are much different than my hard upper one but do the trick and stay in place.</li>
            <li> i have a bad habit of clenching which gives me terrible headaches every morning and tooth/jaw pain all day. Started using these and no more headaches/pain since. Sometimes i forget to put it on and can tell that I&#x27;ve been clenching when i wake up but definitely not as much as before because i dont have the aches and pains.</li>
            <li> I have had teeth grinding problems on and off for a couple years now and I have had the dentist-made ones before.  But what I didn&#x27;t like about the expensive dentist made one was that it wore down my front teeth at an alarming rate.  The dentist didn&#x27;t seem to be too concerned with it but I was.  I tried these out, and when I first got them, I would go through a pair every week because it would flatten out the more you bite down on them during the night.  But now, I could see that I don&#x27;t clench my jaw or grind my teeth as much and my teeth are fine.  For the price, I think it is a great product, although I wish it was made a little sturdier so it doesn&#x27;t wear down as quickly.</li>
            <li> These little guards are so handy and really work well.  I have a guard made by my dentist and since it was so expensive I hate to take it when I leave home; these really cover those instances well.</li>
            <li> Floats in mouth at  night and rubs gums raw.  Not safe.</li>
            <li> Not very good doesn&#x27;t hold good in your mouth</li>
            <li> I order these for my husband about every month. Ships fast every time. He grinder his teeth all the time at night and would have so much pain the next day. These have completely stopped that.</li>
            <li> With the cost of having a dentist make one of these this purchase was a better alternative. She is happy with it.</li>
            <li> After reading a lot of the reviews on these I decided to buy them.  I&#x27;m so glad I did.  They have been a lifesaver.  I&#x27;ve gotten more than the three days out of each one.  I&#x27;ve never woke up choking or anything.  Though they do seem to loosen up after being used.</li>
            <li> My dentist noticed that my teeth had been suffering from clenching while weight lifting.  These seem to be the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> I just started to use this product. Yes they may not be the best for everyone. If you have a severe case of teeth grinding you should be seeing a Doc anyway. My dentist wanted $200 to make a guard. So I bought one of these to see if it would work for me. It takes a few days to adjust to them. They seem awkward at first but I&#x27;ve found they are a lot better the bulky mouth guards, which I have also tried. So far my teeth and jaws do not hurt anymore and I&#x27;ve become more conscious of my teeth grinding. Laying it on my bottom teeth works well for me and seems safer then on the top teeth. It stays in position over night and I don&#x27;t worry about swallowing it. I have no problem talking or drinking but it&#x27;s probably better to take it out until you are finished. Putting it on the top teeth doesn&#x27;t seem practical to me but you&#x27;ll just have to try it to see what suits you best.&lt;br /&gt;Being an engineer myself I can see this is a well engineered product and easy to work with but obviously one size fits all is not easy thing to do. I still don&#x27;t understand why only 3 days. I guess some people have more of a grinding problem than others. I&#x27;ve been using one for the last 2 weeks and the only problem I have is occasionally I misplace it. I suggest you try one, give it a chance. If it&#x27;s not for you then you&#x27;ve only lost $4.00. I only gave it a 4 because it&#x27;s not for everyone.</li>
            <li> Put too much pressure on one or two of my back teeth...the bite area isn&#x27;t big enough. I woke up with my teeth feeling funny and loose.</li>
            <li> This item works perfedct</li>
            <li> i use these and have them on subscription</li>
            <li> Found these for less at the dollar store that did not require me to buy so many. Needed them after some dental work.. Walmart Wallgreens and most others sell something very similar for much much more.. I suggest you check your dollartree store if you need just one or two</li>
            <li> These are not thick.  Very good for me!  Have helped with alignment and jaw clunking.</li>
            <li> delivered on time and as delivered</li>
            <li> I originally had an NTI fitted for me by my dentist.  I broke it and insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover another one.  I thought these would help or at least be worth a try.  They don&#x27;t work at all.  I can still clench and grind my teeth with one in.  I ended up getting another NTI from my dentist.  I would suggest anyone with grinding issues to ask your dentist about one.  It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an extreme grinder, as in, I wake up my partner every night, without exception, with the grinding noise unless I wear guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon losing my custom-molded protector, I initially tried the very similar looking [[ASIN:B003TUQCXM Plackers Stop Grinding Disposable Dental Night Protector]], and it came undone during the first night, so I hastily ordered these instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being very minimal and looking quite similar to the former, these have never come undone yet ( just try both jaws, and wiggle a bit, pushing the front part into the lip slightly etc until you feel it&#x27;s steady), and I&#x27;ve come to love the minimalist, no bulk feel of these compared to the custom molds.&lt;br /&gt;I can get a good 4-5 days wear out of each piece, by handwashing them in the morning, carry them easily for sleepovers, and sleep in the same room with someone without waking them up.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY mouth guard I can wear! I have a small mouth and this works great. Not as bulky as those boil ones!!</li>
            <li> i use it for more than 5 times.  Gets hard and hurts my teeth.  Tha&#x27;ts what she said.</li>
            <li> These are not at all comfortable.  The strap that comes around the front of the teeth rubs against the inside of the lips in the worst way.</li>
            <li> These are awesome! Light weight &amp; strong. So much more comfortable than a full mouth guard. There is no need to cover you front teeth if your back teeth are not touching. Will buy another box for backup.</li>
            <li> I love it. Its small enough to where I can sleep with my mouth closed and very comfortable. This is a wonderful product</li>
            <li> very comfortable and helpful</li>
            <li> The wife grinds like no other, throughout the night I feel like she was going to break her teeth apart. Then low and behold Plackers Mouth Guard GRIND NO MORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are cannot handle the sight of blood deal with it. It hurt her the first few nights but after using it for a week, she loves it and doesn&#x27;t notice it at all. Also I guess her gums got stronger.</li>
            <li> I know I have a smaller jaw, so it is no shocker to me that these are a little too large for me. They seem to be made really well and I think would do the job, but since they are too large, they don&#x27;t fit around the front of my gumline as they should and don&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth, a LOT. My fiance has been complaining for a long time but I have been too stubborn to go and get a professional one fitted, mainly because they are so expensive. I went to the dentist the other day and he suggested that even OTC mouthguards are extremely useful in creating a barrier so that your teeth do not grind overnight. He said that I have grinded my teeth down so much that he doesn&#x27;t want me to have no teeth left when I get older... and I&#x27;m only 26! I got so nervous so I bought this, hoping that it wouldn&#x27;t be too uncomfortable. Fortunately, they are VERY COMFORTABLE. I wear them on my lower jaw (you can choose top of bottom row of teeth) and they do not fall out overnight and they fit my mouth very well. I&#x27;m thrilled to have found this product on my first try on Amazon. I am going to try another mouthguard brand next time and see if it is better or worse, but either way, I know this is a GREAT product and WORKS VERY WELL in preventing teeth grinding.</li>
            <li> I love this product very easy and comfortable to wear, will definitely order these again. Love the way that they are disposable</li>
            <li> This is the first night guard that doesn&#x27;t make me gag. It has finally given me morning free of headaches from grinding!</li>
            <li> I purchased these as an in-between use while I was waiting for a new grind guard I ordered to come in. I definitely recommend them. They say they are rated for a couple of nights but I wore one for a good month and it was perfectly fine. They are small and fit well and protect your teeth whether you grind or clench. The only reason I rated it 4 stars is because I had about 3 in the package that were completely bent out of shape after one night and I guess it was just a flaw in that lot. However 7 of them were fine which lasted for quite some time.</li>
            <li> It looks good. But after tries with one night, I felt my teeth and muscle around my mouth was sore. I think it is because that it makes your teeth feel like they are chewing something. So I don&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great for travel or just a temp need. I keep these around always, and I grind like crazy. Lasts me about 5 days if I have to push it. Not recommended for long term solution as it would be pricey but if I&#x27;ve not ordered my 6 month mouth guards  in time, I use these.</li>
            <li> These things are great! I feel much less tense when I wake up. They stay put in your mouth with no feeling of choking. 3&lt;br /&gt;Days would Be the most you can use them. I find myself Wearing them @ work when I don&#x27;t need to talk to other people. They do give you a little Lisp.</li>
            <li> My dentist has been telling me for years that I needed a night guard for grinding. I hated the idea of wearing one, particularly when a custom one cost $450 and dental insurance wouldn&#x27;t cover it. He suggested that I try these first. Each guard is meant to be worn for three nights, but you can stretch this a bit by cleaning with mouthwash. The guard can be worn on your top or bottom teeth. Wearing on the bottom set made me feel like I was going to choke. Wearing on top was much more comfortable. The guard fits snugly. The first two nights were very difficult, but by the third I barely noticed it. I no longer feel pain in my teeth or jaw when I wake up in the morning, so I assume that means it&#x27;s workng. I may purchase a smaller, custom guard from my dentist. But these are a great starter if you want to see if you can live with one before shelling out the big bucks.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit and just fall out a million times during the night. Totally useless to me. Don&#x27;t buy them</li>
            <li> Pros: My jaw stopped hurting when I began wearing them at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Because they are disposable, they deteriate and become super flat and gross if worn too long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m puzzled by all the positive reviews.  Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.  After a couple nights the remaining guards went into the garbage.</li>
            <li> I was not so much grinding but clenching.  These help with that, and the clicking in my jaw has been signifcantly reduced.  However I can&#x27;t get used to the feel of them in my mouth.  I almost always take them out at some point.  They effect my sleep as well.  SO I am not sure yet.  But the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> I love these!  I grind my teeth so bad I wake up with a headache in the mornings. Plackers are small enough I don&#x27;t feel like a football player with a mouth full of plastic, but do the job nicely.</li>
            <li> The first night with these in my mouth was a little difficult, but after that I became used to them and I use them every night gladly. I&#x27;m not a dentist, and the main reason I got these was as a temporary measure until I get fitted for my permanent night guard later next month. Should these be a permanent solution? Probably not, but I recommend them all the same.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth really badly! I go through the expensive brands within 3-4 days max! So it&#x27;s nice to have a mouth guard that is disposable, have more then one and at a fair price. Highly recommend it as it was recommended by my dentist.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years now. I have veneers and this has been perfect for me to use when I sleep.  It&#x27;s not bulky or huge.  It fits just right.</li>
            <li> Although the manufacturer say otherwise I think there is a serious danger of choking. The trachea is less than one inch in diameter, the device is quite small, and it comes loose and floats around in the mouth at night. My dentist advised me not to use it. I am astounded it is marketed and wonder what the manufacturer had in mind.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night, so I&#x27;ve been looking for an inexpensive mouth guard. These mouth guards are much better than those that you need to mend in boiling water. I tried the latter, and barely could sleep with it, since even after mending it was too uncomfortable to wear it,and in the morning my jaw would hurt. They are much thinner, so it bother me less when I&#x27;m asleep, yet, it takes some time to get used to wearing it. It comes in a pack of 10, which is good, and even after a three month use, I&#x27;m still on the first one, it hasn&#x27;t wear off enough or reap anywhere for me to switch to the next one.</li>
            <li> Great affordable night guard. Comfortable and easy to wear. Although these are made to last a week they will last much longer as long as you clean and rinse it well before each use. Unless my dental coverage changes and covers night guards, I will continue to buy these.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome. My neck aches have disappeared and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Once in a while, I&#x27;ll forget to put it in and the next day, my neck pains are back, so I know this works!</li>
            <li> Grind No More has saved my expensive dental implant!  Due to shoddy work, I had a  cracked tooth under a crown (very front tooth #9).  My dentist in her attempt to be helpful made a prof mouthguard to the tune of $500.  Unfortunately the mouthguard exacerbated the problem...I clenched down so hard on that problem area that in the morn, my guard would be full of blood (sorry, gross I know).  AFter 4 visits to adjust the prof mouthguard- I finally went to 2 periodontists for 2nd opinion.  They immediately said to STOP using the mouthguard (Yeah, you think? Right after I saw the blood!).  I needed a dental implant to replace the tooth &amp; mess that was created ($6,000).  The process began...tooth extracted, temp placed.  BUT, I still grind...same prob, was grinding on my front teeth!  Tried to make my own custom guards (Doctors)...too thick, didn&#x27;t work,spit out in the night. Was quite miserable and prayiing asking God to help.  Well, I came across the GRind No More in RiteAid..  It is EXACTLY what I needed!  The guard can be worn (2 ways) to cover the bottom teeth only which totally protects the upper.  For people who have occlusion and hit on their front teeth...Grind No More does the trick.  The pressure of the grind is absorbed by the back teeth only...your front teeth actually never touch in the night.  It&#x27;s allmost like sleeping with your mouth slightly open (hey, whatever works).  If you have probs with your back teeth, then perhaps this wouldn&#x27;t work for you. BUT, if you have any issues with the front- like me.  Run to the store and try these!  I&#x27;m on day 4, and have had the best night&#x27;s sleep in months since beginning this process.  What a great product! A++</li>
            <li> I used these successfully for a bit, but eventually decided that they were not safe.  In my mouth, admittedly lacking some teeth, nothing holds them in place, and I worry about chocking in the night.  If you have all your front lower teeth, that may not be a problem for you.  No way to know without trying.</li>
            <li> I found this product to be dangerous. It floats freely in your mouth and when I fell asleep the first night wearing one I awoke choking with one end lodged in my throat. I had to remove it with my finger. It was a scary experience.</li>
            <li> In the past, I have tried the hot water molding product and it was very difficult to do it right.  When I first received this product, I was surprised how small the guard is and skeptical about whether it would stay in place during the sleep.  But after wearing it for a few nights, I do not even notice it is there.  It takes a few nights to get fully used to it.  So keep wearing it for a few nights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works.  The tooth pain has gone.  Also, each guard can be worn for at least two weeks if not much longer.  In the morning, I pour a little Listermint in the small container that comes with the guard and soak it in Listermint during the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is truly the easiest one to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have used a similar design in a non-disposable, but it was more substantial and I never had an issue with it shifting around.  I don&#x27;t feel safe sleeping in these Plackers.  I did use them during the day which is okay if you clench your teeth during the day- like while driving or petting cute animals. For the price I decided to give it a try, but I prefer the .99 mouth guard from the sports department in WalMart.</li>
            <li> PLEASE do not even look further. WORST product for teeth grinders. It does not stay in place and it falls very quickly. Overall no support whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;you have been warned.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards are soft and flexible. I have been using the same mouth guard for over a month now without having to throw it away and I am quite the heavy grinder. The only complaint that I have is that it sometimes irritates my lower frenum (the tissue that connects the front of the lip to the gum).</li>
            <li> The Plackers Mouth Guard was really good, but found that I grind my teeth so much that they could not withstand the abuse that my teeth could deliver for 3 days. I will continue to use them when I go away from home for short stays. Have a bad habit of leaving the 20.00 guards when I take them. Protects my teeth and pocket change that way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been having headaches and ear pain for months. I clench my teeth when I sleep and finally figured out that was the cause of my pain. These mouth guards are great! No more headaches since I started using them. I tried the mouth guards that you had to boil and had no luck. These are small but effective.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get used to it, though it does seem to do as advertised, I wake up and end up taking it out..probably not the product entirely</li>
            <li> May work for some, problem for me is I grind my back teeth, so this just gave my jaw something to grind on, causing jaw pain and headache. My husband grinds his front teeth so we thought maybe this would work for him, just couldn&#x27;t get it to fit right and so we do not recommend.</li>
            <li> I tried these 3 times and they did not stay in my mouth properly.  Once, I woke up with the thing in the back of my mouth.  They do not stay seated on your teeth.  I would not advise buying this item.</li>
            <li> These work great! They also last much longer than the package implies and I&#x27;m a pretty tough grinder. We will definately buy these again.</li>
            <li> I like these a lot.  They&#x27;re probably not perfect for every mouth, but they are thin, light and generally easy to get used to, compared to dental guards which mould to your teeth and grip very tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they&#x27;re disposable - which isn&#x27;t great for the environment.  Still, they&#x27;re fairly durable, and you can wear them a little longer than the prescribed 3 days but you have to disinfect and keep them clean!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably not for kids as the guard may slip and go down the throat...something I&#x27;ve thought about but has yet to happen.</li>
            <li> Bought these in a rush after going to the dentist for tooth pain and finding out that I had cracked 3 fillings from clenching at night (who knew?) While waiting for my scheduled overlays, the dentist said to buy a temporary night guard at the drugstore until he could make me a custom one. I picked these cause they didn&#x27;t require boiling or cutting, but they work so much better than I expected that I plan to stick with them instead of paying a few hundred dollars for a custom one. Better price on Amazon than Rite Aid so I will buy them here next time.</li>
            <li> Plackers Grind No More is a dangerous product because it does not protect the user from tooth grinding as advertised.  It is flimsy, does not stay in the mouth as placed, fails to protect the teeth from coming in contact with each other and actually causes certain teeth to sustain more stress than usual.  Using it briefly caused one of my teeth to crack at the root, which is not repairable.  The tooth had to be extracted.  This product fails to protect the teeth.</li>
            <li> These little guards are fantastic!  I clench my jaw and likely grind in my sleep and feel substantial ease when I use them, day and night.  An added bonus - I had braces when younger and my retainer broke.  My front teeth had begun to move forward slightly, and these guards have begun to tuck them back in.  Luckily, the dentist from whom I had ordered the $600 mouth guard ($1300 if I used insurance!) messed up the process and I was able to get my money back.  I have been using one of these, at $2 a piece, for weeks, just cleaning thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable but must have an allergy as now I can&#x27;t use them.  Taste like plastic, skin adjacent to them on lips  and cheeks are swollen by morning.</li>
            <li> They flop about in your mouth to much and if you have back teeth missing there no good at all</li>
            <li> After wearing them one night my jaw was even more sore than it was to begin with...I am also afraid to sleep with them because they are small and I don&#x27;t want to risk choking on them. These are good for the day for me, for a few hours...but that&#x27;s about it. :/</li>
            <li> After losing several teeth due to the fact that they were hopelessly cracked and broken, and after paying large dental bills to have crowns etc.  I finally asked my dentist \\&quot;why do my teeth break and crack so badly?\\&quot;  And he said \\&quot;you grind them at night don&#x27;t you?\\&quot;  I was stunned.  No one had ever taught me about this before, I think because previous dentists saw me comin&#x27; with a checkbook and figured out they could make more money off me if I continued to grind and clench my teeth.  THEN my dentist wanted $600 for a bite guard.  Can you believe this?  I&#x27;m semi-retired with a dinky little parttime job and a meager pension check and am just managing to buy groceries and pay the light bill and they act as if we&#x27;re all millionaires.  I am SO GLAD that I found these on Amazon.  I have gone through two boxes and am ordering another now.  They last me much longer than the 3 days it says on the box.  They work great for me and I haven&#x27;t had a cracked tooth since I began using them.  Help me with my TMJ too.  HOORAY for Grind No More !!</li>
            <li> I usually bought the Den Tek comfort fit one at walmart and they were pretty expensive for just 2 mouth guards. At CVS I saw these and decided to try them. I opened the box and observed them and they are similar to the Den tek one but those can be adjusted.&lt;br /&gt;I tried these since they were $20 cheaper. So far, they work will well.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with them and they don&#x27;t pop out of my mouth. I tend to grind and clutch my jaw tight at night so these help. They do have these in the 14 unit one.&lt;br /&gt;I wish I knew about them because they are a good price.</li>
            <li> Jaw hurts?  TMJ issues?  Cracking noises?  Went to a dentist for tooth pain and heard it&#x27;s your jaw?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wearing this product at night can help you some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also important to see a doctor or take an anti-inflammatory and be more mindful of when you are clenching your jaw.  But this can really help as part of a broader strategy to relieve jaw pain.</li>
            <li> Love these. They work great.</li>
            <li> Obviously, one little item can&#x27;t fix everyone&#x27;s troubles... but for me, these things work WONDERFULLY. I don&#x27;t have any issue with it moving around or getting stuck in my throat. I will be using them from now on!  I&#x27;m about to order for the second time.  I, too, think you can wear them a lot more than just 3 nights...as long as you clean them good.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I LOVE the way they are individually packaged and easy to take along for a road trip. Thanks Plackers!!</li>
            <li> I love these, beats paying hundreds for. Something custom.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth and night to the point I thought I would have to have some dental procedure done to keep me from wearing them off!  I found these on Amazon and have no worries anymore.  They take a little while to get used to....and of course you&#x27;re aware you have something in your mouth.  But, they fit well and really do the job and they&#x27;re a heck of a lot cheaper than what the dentist recommended (over $600 for a bite guard).  I&#x27;ve ordered them twice and will continue to use these as long as I need to.  I do use one more than the 3 times recommended.  I just make sure to rinse it very well and use Listerine once in awhile.</li>
            <li> way cheaper than the $400++ the dentist wanted to charge me.  I wear one on my bottom teeth - it doesn&#x27;t slip, it&#x27;s soft and comfortable and I can&#x27;t grind.  They last way more than 3 days.  No complaints whatsoever!</li>
            <li> I have tried sooooo many mouth guards.  These certain;y are the best.  They are comfortable, they keep me from grinding my teeth.  They are cheaper than other I have tried too.</li>
            <li> I am ambivalent about Plackers Grind No More mouth guards. On the one hand, they work well for me, being reasonably comfortable and remarkably simple. On the other hand, each guard comes packaged in a plastic box with a plastic foil cover (that can be maddeningly difficult to open), and the 10 boxes come in a larger plastic box. The amount of waste is unsettling. Further, as each guard is meant to last only three days, the cost to use this product mounts up quickly. Amazon currently sells 10 for $17.99. 10 guards last about a month. That means over $200 a year, an amount that approaches the cost of what my dentist would charge for a fitted guard. I do not plan to continue using this product.</li>
            <li> Product performs as my physician said it would. Simple, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned that sleeping would be a problem and that I would not be able to forget that something was in my mouth all night.&lt;br /&gt;Actually getting used to it was easy. The problem comes when you need to remind yourself that this product will not stop you from grinding your teeth. You will continue to grind your teeth but while wearing this you won&#x27;t be experiencing any of the unwanted results of doing so: teeth wear, muscle jaw strain, and other issues.&lt;br /&gt;I actually developed a problem that I never knew was possible to have.&lt;br /&gt;It seems that (oral surgeon told me) there is a muscle running from the top of your skull down both sides of your head to the jaw area.&lt;br /&gt;Grinding your teeth can actually cause the muscle on either side to exhibit sharp pain from the top of your head down along your ear to just above the jaw. It can also cause discomfort within the ear. It comes with each bite of food but stops as soon as you don&#x27;t bite.&lt;br /&gt;Your first thought will be (due to the sharp type of pain) that this is a serious problem caused by some type of life threatening condition.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll leave it at that. See an oral surgeon if this occurs.&lt;br /&gt;The product above needs to be used probably for the rest of your life if you want to \\&quot;cover all your bases\\&quot;, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;And that take an effort and habit to continue using this appliance.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: It  does work.</li>
            <li> I like how I can wear them on top or bottom but the flat plastic piece that keeps the top and bottom teeth from touching causes pain for hours after taking it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried several others and this fit the best and didnt feel so bulky but pain is usually a bad thing.</li>
            <li> These did not work for me.  It did not want to stay in place during the night and I woke up with a bad headache both times I tried using them.  That was enough for me and I stopped using them.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my wife. We had been using full-wrap mouth guards, but decided to try these due to the good reviews and the affordable price. She chipped a tooth in her sleep the second night we had them. Useless waste of money.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, great price, speedy shipping and works well.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t live without these gizmos.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve ordered them.  I&#x27;ve passed out so many that I&#x27;ve got people hooked on these, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mom can&#x27;t wear them on her bottom teeth because they fall out of her mouth.  I can&#x27;t wear these on my top teeth because they fall out of my mouth.  Once you put them in and acclimate yourself to them, the sensation of this plastic trap in your mouth disappears.  No trouble sleeping with them; they&#x27;ve never moved out of place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not a grinder, I&#x27;m a clencher.  My mother&#x27;s a grinder.  So here you are getting two points of view that are totally different from each other, but from two customers who are content with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****One tip: the box says \\&quot;wear 3 times and discard\\&quot; but I find that I can reuse one pair for 2 months.  You simply clean it with toothpaste and toothbrush each morning.  voila!  bob&#x27;s your uncle.</li>
            <li> I have needed grind guards for a long time but knew the full mouth piece would not work for me due to gagging issues.  These work well in that my morning pain is reduced and I don&#x27;t spit them out as soon as I go to sleep. The price is very reasonable.  The description states they should last about three days.  I would guess that depends on the extent of your clenching and grinding as mine have lasted between 5 and 7 days each.</li>
            <li> After my dog ate my Dentist made mouth guard, I wanted to find a better replacement.  I bought my first package of Grind No Mores at a drugstore.  I found them to be easy to use and comfortable.  Now, If my dog eats one of these, I can replace them eaasily thanks to Amazon.  They are getting hard to find.</li>
            <li> Tried a couple different brands so far and these are by far the best. Very small and I can actually fall asleep with them in. I don&#x27;t have $500 to spend on a custom guard that my insurance doesn&#x27;t even cover :/</li>
            <li> When I grind my teeth my mouth slides to the right and my lower teeth crash into a capped upper tooth. I&#x27;ve already broke it and the dentist had to do another cap. This was a permanent cap not a temporary. The dentist knows I&#x27;m a grinder and they offer a $500 version that my insurance doesn&#x27;t help pay. So I tried some that you boil and mold and they didn&#x27;t work and the mold was sloppy. I tried these and have been using them since. I use the same one much longer than recommended keeping it clean and it continues to work. So these last me a long time. I have no choking issues with these and they fit good enough to where I have no issues at all really.</li>
            <li> hubby says they work as well as the ones he pays between $15 and $20 dollars a piece for</li>
            <li> These bite guards are a very poor fit, they do not stay in place well at all for me on the bottoms, much less on the top where it instantly fell out. The cushion between the molars is adequate for grinding and clenching protection but just don&#x27;t stay in during sleep.</li>
            <li> Awsome... Not exactly what I was looking for but they turned out great!</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and to clean.  I wear one for upper teeth and one for lower teeth.  It worked well.</li>
            <li> Got as an alternative to boil and bit designs or a custom dentist-made model. It is made with a thin strip of plastic and two thicker tabs on the ends that are supposed to stop you teeth from grinding. The thinker pieces end up around the middle of the each side of the mouth. Feels insecure or in the way. Save you money for something else.</li>
            <li> After having my teeth permanently damaged by a hard guard made by my dentist, that failed to stop my severe night clenching I decided to give these a try. I can&#x27;t believe the difference! I no longer clench my teeth and the swelling is starting to go down in my temples after only 2 nights of use. The best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my husband.  He loves them.  I have used them too.  Not sure why they say it&#x27;s a one night use as we use ours for many nights and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a problem.  Perhaps if you break it each night but otherwise it&#x27;s okay to use for several weeks.</li>
            <li> I only recently started grinding my teeth at night. These have been great so far. I use each one for at least a week. If you wash them when you brush your teeth, I don&#x27;t think you have to throw them out as early as the box recommends, so you actually can get a lot more for your money. They&#x27;re also small and can be worn either on top or bottom, whichever is more comfortable. They stay in place all night. They&#x27;re great and have helped keep away grinding headaches.</li>
            <li> This is my first product review on Amazon. I have been looking for a tooth grinder protection that I can wear without gagging or falling out for a long time. This product is cheap and it works! I wish I had found it a long time ago</li>
            <li> I ordered these not realizing that you MUST have all your teeth. Don&#x27;t laugh.  I have a bridge in the upper back of my mouth which I take out at night and this product has nothing to hold onto.  So the three stars from me.  I should have thought this out a little better.  Will try something else.</li>
            <li> I started using this and even though it says you can use each guard for a maximum of three days, I accidentally used mine for 5 and it was still fine. It doesn&#x27;t fall off or come loose and no boiling required either.</li>
            <li> Best buy around. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this product.</li>
            <li> Works well!!  They last longer than 3 days, I&#x27;m getting over a week on each.  No more headaches and smaller than the ones sold at the drugstores.</li>
            <li> And I couldn&#x27;t grind my teeth, but in the morning my jaw and some teeth felt off, plus the one time use thing kinda sucks, and it felt too small for my mouth so I&#x27;m not really a fan.</li>
            <li> These items provide quite a few in one pack.  They are also very thin, so they are comfortable when sleeping.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used an expensive night guard from my dentist for a couple of years. The first one I hated and didn&#x27;t use. The second one was better and helped cushion my nighttime teeth grinding. It no longer fit after new dental work and I didn&#x27;t want to spend that kind of money again. I checked out what was available online and chose the Plackers mouth guard and I like them much better than the custom fitted ones. It is comfortable, cushions my molars and separates my other teeth. If I use each for 3 days, the cost will match the custom guard from my dentist in about 5 years. However, I use each for several days longer before it gets too squishy.</li>
            <li> Most I&#x27;ve tried don&#x27;t feel right overnight... these don&#x27;t seem to bother me too much, and I like that you can cycle through them rather than use the same one for 6 months, which is kinda gross.</li>
            <li> I used this product for the first time on 1-25-2013. It is just incredible! It was just what I needed because of my teeth clenching! It gave immediate relief from my problem and it is comfortable.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, they are small and I was hesitate to wear at night because of the size. I spent 400.00 on a mouth guard instead.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go without these! I love that I can keep a few in my travel bag and not have to remember to bring one from home all the time.</li>
            <li> Purchased this package as I bit all the way through one of the thicker guards.  Thought one of these would be good for traveling (even if I lost it, not that expensive).  But, tried it at home and was able to get two weeks of wear from it.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am able to wear them more than one night.  They are a great, inexpensive product!</li>
            <li> Sometimes it&#x27;s a bit weird sleeping with these in your mouth but because they are reversible you can always change the way they feel.  They don&#x27;t hurt your gums and when you wake up in the morning you can absolutely tell that you didn&#x27;t grind all night long. My teeth show less signs of pain through out the day as well.</li>
            <li> Great Product - Thank You!!</li>
            <li> About 3 years ago, I was in a car accident that caused soft-tissue damage in my C1/C2 area of the spine.  As a result of this damage, I believe my jaw and bite had been misaligned.  Over time, I realized that I had been grinding my bite, both during the night as well as during the day (stress), biting the insides of my lip, etc.  This caused tremendous stress/pain on the injury spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stumbled upon these in the grocery store, so decided to give them a try.  I&#x27;m currently on day 3 with NO neck pain (I wear a different, more heavy duty guard at night while sleeping).  I&#x27;ve found that I can wear the Plackers during the day, with minimal impedance to my speech--they basically keep me from clenching my jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend giving these a try in lieu of going the super expensive route with dentists and custom-fit molds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So worth it!</li>
            <li> I have to say that of you are a hardcore teethgrinder or grit your jaws strongly this product will not work for you.&lt;br /&gt;I finally got a dental guard made by my dentist and that definately does a better job and will not fall apart on you.&lt;br /&gt;I tried these for 2 weeks hoping for improvement,but they either came loose at night and I spit them out in my sleep. Or what was dangerous is that my jaws ground them into pieces and I almost gagged and choked on a piece. I quit using them after that.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes saving money can threaten your life.</li>
            <li> It takes some time getting used to something being in your mouth while you sleep but these definitely do the job. They are small enough to not feel like I have a mouth guard in. As far as a mouth piece goes this one is small and comfortable. After a couple of nights I had significant improvement in the pain in my jaw from TMJ. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> They are much smaller than any other mouth guard I&#x27;ve ever seen or used.  Each one is only about 1.25&amp;#34; long and .75&amp;#34; wide.  They do spread out so that the width is not an issue, but they only extend past the first 3 front teeth on each side.  Because of their small size and lack of any stay-put mechanism, I end up spitting them out every night.</li>
            <li> Huge and bulky and it gave me a headache. I have sensitive teeth and they took forever to warm up to where they didn&#x27;t make my teeth hurt. Did not like, will not reorder.</li>
            <li> This product was exactly as described. I recently found out that i&#x27;m a grinder and was told by my dentist to find a grind guard that I could sleep in. These work well, but I found after a week that I need something a little more customized for my mouth. These will leave indentions on the inside of your gums if they don&#x27;t fit perfectly.... despite they&#x27;re \\&quot;One Size Fits all\\&quot;. I still use them though when I travel. I decided to get a \\&quot;boil &amp; bite\\&quot; and I love it. This product is great for beginners and will give you a good idea if you need to spend the money on a custom &#x27;boil &amp; bite&#x27; or if you&#x27;re a light-grinder and can get away with these.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t sleep with the full teeth covers, but these are perfect.  I don&#x27;t use them every night, but when I need them they are a life saver!</li>
            <li> I suppose it works for some people (according to other reviews) but it kept falling out of mouth. I don&#x27;t think my mouth is that small but it really didn&#x27;t fit correctly from the first. I could not get a comfortable feel in my mouth - no matter what I did. Tossed and turned and was still grinding!</li>
            <li> I have veneers. The boil and fit types worked well but were not nice to my veneers!&lt;br /&gt;So I tried &#x27;DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit&#x27; and &#x27;Plackers Mouth Guard Grind No More Night Time Use&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros of Plackers&lt;br /&gt;Fit well enough&lt;br /&gt;Use them when I travel, so if I lose or forget it no biggie&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have to clean them&lt;br /&gt;Give enough cushion&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t snore anymore than usual&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t take long to acclimate to using it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Disposable, I have to buy them more often&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it gets pinched from how it is stored in them package and doesn&#x27;t fit well (kind of a v instead of a u)&lt;br /&gt;When Bruxism is strong may not be able to use them more than once&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like both of them. Neither cause damage to my veneers.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure I have a preference yet. Still using both of them.</li>
            <li> Bought these as an attempt to relieve my wife&#x27;s frustration with my nightly grinding. They fit fine and are not uncomfortable.  They work as long as you can keep them in. I have a ritual now every morning of trying to find it as it gets spit out easily.</li>
            <li> These actually work as well for me as the $300 bite guard my dentist made that I lost.</li>
            <li> I recently got new dental insurance with my new job and went to the dentist to get fitted for a new mouthguard.  My previous one with my former dentist and insurance was $250, which was expensive but worth it since it lasted over a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I went to my new dentist, she said I would need one that costs $700!  I do love my teeth but $700 is still a lot for a mouth guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up searching for one online and found this.  I calculated the cost and if I use these for a whole year, it ends up being around $150 (if I calculated right).  That saves a lot more money than the custom one from the dentist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, these are comfortable! I like how there&#x27;s minimal plastic only where you read need it.  It took me 3-4 days to get used to but now that I&#x27;m used to, I&#x27;m happy I got these.</li>
            <li> These are not as convenient had I had hoped. You have to adjust them, and the adjustment shifts, so you must remove them and adjust again.</li>
            <li> the good thing, is you get a pack of 10.&lt;br /&gt;my first night was very uncomfortable - woke in the mid of the night with a tiny blister on the bottom of my gum where the guard was rubbing. woke in the morning with a SORE jaw! i guess i&#x27;m a serious grinder. lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd night, i tried wearing it upside down (around the top teeth) hoping to avoid a blister, but all that did was put my jaw out. so i spent the whole of the next day re-aligning my jaw/teeth to sit together right. yeah - don&#x27;t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3rd, 4th and 5th night, i woke with a sore jaw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...it has eased off. maybe because i&#x27;m not grinding as hard now? and only a blister for the very first night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you wash it, you can use it repeatedly for up to 2 weeks - depending on how much you grind. i&#x27;ve worn the same guard for 10 nights now.  i think 2 or 3 more nights, and i will have to put a new one in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;at this point, it&#x27;s just a matter of remembering to put it in. i do wonder about chewing on plastic all night long!  i guess they&#x27;ll come out with some other material sooner or later that&#x27;s safer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and... it&#x27;s not exactly &#x27;sexy&#x27;... but then again, neither are pebbly teeth :o</li>
            <li> These things are a ridiculous and dangerous waste of money. They don&#x27;t wrap around your teeth, so the only way to keep them in place is to keep your mouth closed tightly. Do you really think you will do that when you&#x27;re asleep? No. I just got these today and I won&#x27;t be wearing them to bed. They are too small and move around in your mouth, I would be afraid of choking on it. Also, one size does not fit all. These are small and the flat part does not reach the back teeth. Amazon needs to prohibit these from being sold on its site as they pose a choking hazard to anyone using them.</li>
            <li> Bought these for a friend that was having some sensitivity after a dental procedure. She liked them so well she still uses them at night even after the sensitivity has gone.</li>
            <li> i will recomed the use if this product only in daylight cause i used it at night and find it under my pillow very dangerous it get loose. during the day is an excellent product.recomended.</li>
            <li> these did not really work for me. I could not get used to having them&lt;br /&gt;in my mouth all night.</li>
            <li> Nothing like a piece of plastic that is keeping you awake at night as you drool down your chin. I would have given it one star but i read online saliva is good for your skin.</li>
            <li> My husband bites while he&#x27;s asleep, so he chews them up rather quickly!</li>
            <li> I previously had a $400 custom bite guard from the dentist - and I like these better. OTHER dental guards cover your entire teeth (not too sexy, girls). Plackers do NOT cover your entire teeth. They uniquely have little flat plates that rest on your back molars - and only a thin (non visible) band wraps around your gum-line. Your &amp;#34;sleeping partner&amp;#34; won&#x27;t even know you&#x27;re wearing it! And they do NOT mumble your speech like full-mouth guards. They also do not need to be &amp;#34;fitted&amp;#34; - so there is no hassle of boiling water and molding them. Plus they are disposable - so you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing them (like a $400 guard). And  you can toss them out before they get gross - unlike traditional mouth guards - so they are always &amp;#34;fresh.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I like these a lot.  When my dentist told me that I should start sleeping with a mouth guard, I resisted.  When I started to physically notice that my teeth were being ground down by each other, I caved and tried a bunch of different mouth guards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for me.  They&#x27;re small and you can wear them either face up or face down.  The flat part protects the teeth that would be grinding together in the night and the front part is a small strip of plastic that you hardly notice.  You can&#x27;t tell that I have it in my mouth when it&#x27;s in my mouth.  Speaking sounds exactly the same, not like there&#x27;s a plastic mouth guard in my mouth.  The big ones tend to feel bulky and uncomfortable and I ended up spitting them out in the middle of the night in my sleep which didn&#x27;t do me any good.  These are hardly noticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night or two that you wear it, it&#x27;s a little uncomfortable but as it shapes to your mouth through use, it becomes unnoticable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it stays in place all night.  I don&#x27;t worry about swallowing it.  They&#x27;re easy to clean and take care of as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would highly recommend this product to anybody who has an issue with nighttime teeth grinding, especially if you find those larger mouth guards to be obstructive and uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Terrible tmj problems and my dentist wanted to make me a $1000 retainer. I tried this instead and have had zero problems since. Would completely recommend this product. Also, lasts much longer than 1 week.</li>
            <li> Being too large, it hurt my gums.  I wanted to try it because of the price but it just didn&#x27;t work out.</li>
            <li> I like that the item is not so big that it is uncomfortable.  Easy to use.  A little expensive, though.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried these I though I would swallow it in the middle of the night or it would fall out.  They are a very different fit from a traditional mouth guard. But after I wore them for a few nights I really like them.  I travel a lot and they are easy to travel with and I don&#x27;t have to worry about losing one in a hotel.</li>
            <li> I have been grinding my teeth for well over a decade and have worn away probably a good 1/6 of my teeth height to the point that I am finally feeling the sensitivity after having worn away the enamel and have gone into the tooth portion.  My dentist has strongly recommended a guard for many years, but due to the cost, and the fact that they are not covered by insurance, I refused.  I did try a mouth guard several years ago and practically gagged up my meal as I HATE anything in my mouth.  So that was not going to work.  On my most recent visit to my dentist, she sold me a mouth guard to try again, which I did.  It was the kind that molds to your teeth after submerging them in water, etc.  It was a bit uncomfortable, but I did trim it down (CONSIDERABLY) to finally be able to stand it in my mouth throughout the night.  It did the job!  I barely had any of the guard remaining after my trimming, just the front portion which fit to my teeth, and the bottom spacer portion to keep my teeth from touching each other.  It was quite bastardized, but it worked.  I then started thinking why can&#x27;t anyone make a guard that just blocked the teeth from touching while not having 2 pounds of plastic in my mouth?  So I began my search.  I found THREE different products online and ordered them all so I can compare them to each other.  The Plackers guard was the first one I chose since it had the absolute smallest profile.  I was concerned because many reviews were so negative saying they didn&#x27;t fit, they fell out, etc, but I had to try it because it was SO SMALL.  Well, I have to say they are truly AMAZING!  They are the MOST comfortable guards I have ever had!  With the thin front \\&quot;strap\\&quot; that holds the two bite plates, I barely feel ANYTHING across my front gums.  I wear them on my top teeth.  The bite plates are noticeable, but in comparison to others I have tried, they are completely tolerable.  I have chewed the heck out of them, and have found that they might be reducing my desire to clamp down at night.  They say they are disposable and for one-time use, but I have used it now for four nights and it is in fine shape.  I plan on using it for as long as it lasts and will be buying more.  If you are hesitant, just buy one.  In fact the Plackers website offers a free sample but you do have to pay shipping.  Considering that a custom guard from your dentist costs $500+, spending $3 to find out if this is a good guard for you is well worth the money.  I still have to try the other two brands I bough, but frankly, the Plackers guard is great, and I don&#x27;t really see a need to make the switch at this point.  I have a bigger mouth and this guard actually fits perfectly for me.  It does not shift around or even come close to falling out. In fact I have to peel it out of my mouth in the morning.  I hope you try this brand and it helps you.  As a long time grinder who has destroyed my teeth because I refused to spend a ton of money, I only wish I found this product 10 years ago!e to clamp down at night.

            <li> Been using for 2 weeks now and they work great. They say to throw away after 2 uses but really? Use for 2 weeks (rinsing daily) then pitching. Recommended purchase.</li>
            <li> This value pack will last you well over a year.  Each guard will last about 2-3 months depending on how intense your grinding is.  I&#x27;m still using my first one after 2.5 months. It&#x27;s just beginning to wear down. These are cheaper than forking out $400 at the dental office for a mouth guard which I lost a year later. So there went $400 down the drain.  The package says to use only 3 days then toss. However, use your own discrestion as to when you need to discard. These guys are strong and last longer than 3 days. I&#x27;m impressed with the quality and they &amp;#34;fit&amp;#34; extremely well and don&#x27;t move in my mouth at night.  I can also use the guard during the day and &amp;#34;talk&amp;#34; with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I found these -- they worked well enough for me, and meant I could avoid paying $600 for a custom night guard. Fast-forward 2 years. My rear teeth no longer meet at the back (posterior open bite). It turns out that wearing a partial guard, that allows you to chew on your molars but not the other teeth, can cause the teeth to move. So I am now facing $7k of orthodontic work for braces to move my teeth back into place. Not such a great savings after all.</li>
            <li> They are a bit uncomfortable of you wear them on the top, if you have cavities do not purchase it! It will bring out the sensitivity. Besides that, good simple solution to grinding teeth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these guards for a year now and they work great! I definitively recommend them. Safe, comfortable, good price and easy to use.</li>
            <li> When I got these, I was so skeptical thinking how a flimsy piece of plastic is going to help my serious grinding problem. I&#x27;ve ground through two hard shell dentist made mouth guards over the years - even making the bite of my teeth uneven because of it. However, I tried this flimsy piece of plastic wondering how it would stay in place all night. It works! I woke the next morning to it still carefully protecting my teeth firmly in place. I was so surprised. How economical! And they work. I use each one for longer than they say - probably 2-3 weeks on average. Though I do wash it every morning when I remove it, the guard over time seems to get some build-up and the plastic gets a little worn. That&#x27;s when I swap out for a new one. I&#x27;m sold on them now. No more aweful trays of goop trying to get the right fit.</li>
            <li> Works well and can be used more than once.</li>
            <li> These work great. Low cost - and better than a high priced dentists guard. They last three to four weeks each. I&#x27;ll buy them again.</li>
            <li> Plastic is a little too hard. Wish it was more soft so it didn&#x27;t hurt my gums</li>
            <li> These caused me more harm then good. I used these to help with TMJ before I got a custom nightguard and I would wake up in even more pain than before. If you actually have TMJ, I do not recommend buying these as a substitute for an actual custom nightguard.</li>
            <li> I received an open box of only 7 - not 10. The product was individually wrapped but was too small to use.</li>
            <li> Thank you for the wonderful product, these are getting harder to find.  I would have reviewed sooner but have been in and out of the hospital.  They arrived quickly and I love them!</li>
            <li> I have high anxiety levels...and instead of my blood pressure being through the roof about it all I apparently get it out of my system at night by clenching my teeth together.  I&#x27;ve woken up so many times with sore and achy jaws because of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried one of the regular OTC bite guards where you have to cut it to size but in order to know where it needs to be cut you need to actually wear it first.  I wore it and it gave me a sore on the side of my tongue!  It really put me off of it...plus it was just bulky and I felt like I was wearing a retainer.  So my search continued and I found Plackers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ready reviews and decided to give them a go.  One reviewer states that he found them at his local dollar store so I thought I&#x27;d take a chance and see if mine had them as well.  They do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying these suckers from the dollar store from here on out.  MUUUUUCH cheaper.  Ten for $10 instead of ten for almost $20!  I&#x27;m all for saving some money!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, though, these really work.  Some people worry about them not staying in place but I had no problems.  I&#x27;m a clencher...that sucker wasn&#x27;t going ANYWHERE unless I consciously wanted it to!  And the first morning that I woke up from wearing one I did not have any jaw pain whatsoever.  I was totally sold.  I love that there&#x27;s no hard or extra plastic.  There&#x27;s no cut to fit, or boiling.  You just put it in (top or bottom, doesn&#x27;t matter) and fall asleep.  They ARE made to be \\&quot;temporary\\&quot; but I get at least a week&#x27;s worth out of mine before I need to use a new one, and trust me, I clench hard.  I cracked my tooth from clenching (ouch!) which tells you how bad I am at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these.  They may not seem like they&#x27;d work but my goodness do they ever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that they&#x27;re really taking you for a ride financially here on Amazon when you can buy them el cheapo at the dollar store so I&#x27;m knocking off a star for that...but the actual product works wonders! Give it a go if you don&#x27;t believe me.  It will only cost you a buck!l product works wonders! Give it a go if you don&#x27;t believe me.  It will only cost you a buck!</li>
            <li> It does the job... sorta. It took the pressure off my teeth... but it distributed the pressure to my jaws.</li>
            <li> These worked very well for me much better than I expected. They work on both top and bottom and I had no problem with them falling out during the night. I clench my teeth so much that I have broken several of my molars and these have really helped. No morning headache or aching jaws. I will buy these again.</li>
            <li> Works well for me - no more tooth wear from night grinding, it stays in place -- an excellent value.</li>
            <li> No boiling of water or other torture.  This product fits everyone.  And it lasts and lasts.  I&#x27;ve used one for months, not just days.  And it works.  I don&#x27;t grind my teeth or bite my tongue in the middle of the night.  It&#x27;s a good product if you have these problems.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t rate these items because I do not use them  I bought them for a person that does use them and so far I have had no complaints.</li>
            <li> I suppose this might work for some people, but not for me.  Worth trying since the price was very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I mostly clench my teeth at night from the moment I close my eyes. I know some of you said you have a problem keeping them in, but if you&#x27;re even a slight clencher, you won&#x27;t have a problem. I also grind my teeth but not anymore with this. These are comfortable and minimal (doesn&#x27;t cover your front teeth), so when my husband wakes up and looks at me I can smile at him without looking like a wrestler. I hated the mouth guard that the dentist gave me because my saliva pooled into it. That&#x27;s not possible with this one. And they&#x27;re so affordable and you don&#x27;t have to scrub them after every use. You can just throw them away after a few nights. Personally I rinse them to save money but they do wear down eventually.</li>
            <li> Fantastic, very good, wonderfull.&lt;br /&gt;Congratulation to this excelent supplier!&lt;br /&gt;Thank very much!</li>
            <li> This is a small appliance and very easy to adapt to your bite.  I wasn&#x27;t sure that I needed a guard, but after using this product for over 30 days - it&#x27;s a five star with me.  I just wanted to try something like this and it works.&lt;br /&gt;The down side, you need a new one every 3 days.  Try it.</li>
            <li> As a previous reviewer mentions, this helped with migraines. These Grind-no-more grind guards helped alleviate headaches onset because of clenching or grinding my teeth while I sleep. Although, it is not a complete cure for migraine headaches, it is a great start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first few nights they are difficult to get used to. I noticed that I took them out while I slept. It kept my mouth open a bit and my mouth would dry out. After the first week, I managed to find the most comfy spot and keep the night guard in. (This is the first time I have ever used such a product.) These appear to be a smaller type of mouth guard and not a full mouth piece to other ones I compared. You can try them on the bottom teeth or the top. For me, I found it more comfortable to use them on my top teeth. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck and I wish you a happier more restful sleep!</li>
            <li> Compared to the dentist made guards, or the ones that you drop in boiling water then bight into, this design is much more sensible. It has just enough between your upper and lower teeth to stop the grinding, and is small enough to not keep your jaw at some odd angle. They seem quite durable, so I assume my 10-pack will last a long while.  Why night guards have been so ill designed before escapes me, as this is just perfect, at least for me.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical, but man, I was waking up with a clenched jaw and headaches off and on and my dentist said I was grinding my teeth. I thought I had stopped doing that after I stopped a certain medication, but apparently, I still do at times. So...I tried the Plackers and they really work. I have been using the same one since I purchased them about a month ago, just rinsing it out each morning. Works great and it didn&#x27;t take much time to get used to. I am very pleased. Also, had a dental cleaning and they didn&#x27;t mention the grinding!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least three different guards but they all made me gag a but since my mouth is so small. These are perfect! They have little cushions between the back teeth only so it isn&#x27;t a mouthful.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards are wonderful! I ordered them recently and my jaw and tension related headaches are abating. They do help prevent teeth clenching. Also, these mouth guards are comfortable for use while sleeping, which is critical. I like that I can clean each guard while I use it for three days and then dispose of it, which I feel is more hygienic. My only issue with the mouth guards is attributable to my own fault. I recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not ready to shell out hundreds of dollars for a custom nightguard so first I tried the kind that you boil and mold yourself. If I can even get to the sleeping part before I take it out, it&#x27;s out of my mouth before i wake up. These little \\&quot;disposable\\&quot; things are great - small, flexible and so much more comfortable. I&#x27;ve been using the same one for a few weeks and it&#x27;s still good as new (but I don&#x27;t grind, just clench). And so nice to know that I have a whole supply of them waiting for me when I feel like this one is too old.</li>
            <li> This product was way too small for my mouth, it did not fit right as described!  I tried using it and feared that I may choke on it, so I do not use them!!!  Wasted time and money!</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good way to try the guard without spending a pile of money on the custom one from the dentist. I tried using it on both my upper and lower teeth.  It was not very comfortable ...although I suspect sleeping with anything in your mouth is uncomfortable.  Additionally I woke up with a sore jaw several mornings and a couple times I spit it out in my sleep.&lt;br /&gt;I have a very small mouth, this may not be the best one for me...I m going to keep using it and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> These are ok. I find that I spit it out during the night, mostly because it&#x27;s loose and doesn&#x27;t stay in place.</li>
            <li> I thought my mouth guard I had was no longer useable so I tried these.  They were hard to keep in my mouth and they threw my bit off, so I went to the dentist and was told these were a very bad idea.  Feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to get this product after reading the different reviews of all of the people who loved it compared to expensive alternatives.  I did see one person who had said they woke up choking on the unit, but figured they must have had a unique experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to make these work three times and in each case although they sat securely on the bottom jaw of my mouth when I went to sleep and didn&#x27;t move despite having them in my mouth for a couple of hours before I went to sleep just to be sure they were fitting well, so I went to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Talk about TERROR!  I woke up with the stupid mouth guard going down my throat and choking on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made sure to put it in again and again it happened.  Call me stupid, but I wanted to be sure I was not doing&lt;br /&gt;something wrong, and tried it a third time, but finally learned my lesson.  These are not safe to use, and I can not&lt;br /&gt;recommend them in any way after my frightening experience with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I returned them.</li>
            <li> This product does what it is designed to do, and it&#x27;s very affordable! I have only spit it out a couple times in my sleep and found it under my pillow, no problems so far with choking or gagging and I have a sensitive reflex. Have already reordered.</li>
            <li> These guards are a good deal for the price.  However, they are not for heavy grinders. There good for vacation or while working if you need daytime help.</li>
            <li> my dentist told me to use a mouth guard, because I grind my teeth.  I&#x27;m still getting used to them....I&#x27;m just not comfortable with them yet...but I haven&#x27;t given up.</li>
            <li> Best mouth guards I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve used one single guard for 6 months and it&#x27;s held up really well.</li>
            <li> I grind my teeth at night.Had tried other kinds but hated them. These did take a few nights to get used but love going to bed knowing that I&#x27;m not grinding my teeth together. Fit very well and now there is no discomfort.</li>
            <li> My dentist told me that it would be a good idea for me to get a mouth guard.  I didn&#x27;t want to get a really expensive one, so I searched Amazon and came up with this option.  I use each one for several days, more than the three they recommend, and a box lasts me quite awhile.  They help shield my teeth and jaw from the tension I have around my mouth while a sleep.  It is a good option.</li>
            <li> I bought these because professional night guards are hundreds of dollars. They don&#x27;t fit my mouth perfectly, but enough to make it work. I have used one for 2 months, and I wash it often. So don&#x27;t be fooled by the weekly use idea.</li>
            <li> These mouth guards definitely keep me from clenching my teeth. But they don&#x27;t stay in place very well. I do like that they are disposable after 2 or 3 times wearing them. The fact that they aren&#x27;t too expensive is a plus.</li>
            <li> EXPENSIVE there is no need for them to cost so much, they are not made of gold. i go thru these like water. changed to DenTek Comfort Fit Dental Guard kit ,, now those are grreat.</li>
            <li> These will save your teeth if you grid your teeth at night. I noticed that I was loosing enamel on a couple of my teeth so tried the Grid No More mouth guards. That was 2 years ago, I still use them to this date. I would Absolutely recommend this to anyone who grids their teeth. This has saved my teeth from permanent damage. I like the fact that this is a partial mouth guard not a full guard making it easier to tolerate.</li>
            <li> Perfect solution for my grinding, good fit &amp; great value for money</li>
            <li> This mouth guard was too soft and too loose!</li>
            <li> I have used the most expensive brand of night guard and have had a dentist&#x27;s custom made guard so I have a basis in comparison and can honestly say these are the most comfortable night guard I have used to date.</li>
            <li> Good product and good delivery</li>
            <li> Easy to use. No need to be fitted. Just open and pop it in. The only suggestion that I have is that I would much rather pay a little more to have one or two more placed in the pack. 10 get used up fairly quickly...</li>
            <li> I have spent more money and time at my dentist from my clenching and grinding than I&#x27;m comfortable admitting. I tried lots of other kinds of bulky contraptions with no success. These on the other hand work GREAT! They stay in and i can wear them top or bottom. You can also get a lot more uses than just the three they mention on the box. Lets see, no more headaches when I wake up, no more $250.00 chipped or broken tooth at the dentist, I&#x27;m loving these things. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit well. Im afraid I will choke on it while I sleep.</li>
            <li> They did not fit as well as I had hoped, but surprisingly did the job. Not too bulky. I think it is worth the try, if you are having difficulties with grinding your teeth.  I gave them four stars because the fit was not the best, but it was effective for me.</li>
            <li> Do order if you have problems grinding your teeth! It works great and is affordable. I love this product and will buy more!</li>
            <li> I put them on my top teeth for comfort. They last a few days each</li>
            <li> This one didn&#x27;t help me much. In fact, the next day I woke up and it was clear my teeth hadn&#x27;t been fixed in a solid piece of plastic molded to my bite, but instead had been gnashing against each other. The flimsy plastic doesn&#x27;t cover the whole tooth area, so I found it useless. Even if it did, the plastic is too flimsy to fix my bite when sleeping. I ordered it because I thought it might be an alternative to (as another reviewer hilariously suggested) looking like a wrestler when donning it. I gave it my best shot, but I recommend getting a mouth guard from a sporting goods store. I got two about 6-10 years ago for about $2 each and I&#x27;ve been using mine ever since. I brush it daily with toothpaste and sometimes wash it with warm water and soap. When you first &#x27;make&#x27; it, you do boil it, which is the closest thing you can get to a &#x27;custom fit&#x27; without paying your dentist $400. The blather you read about boiling it is silly; you don&#x27;t put a hot thing in your mouth. You carefully follow the simple directions which tell you to boil the guard for a specified time, then have a glass of cool water ready where you can dunk the guard for an even shorter amount of time. Then, you put it in your mouth and voila, a custom-fit guard. It&#x27;s not going to break of the floor and need to be replaced like the $400 kind you get at the dentist either. But, if you do splurge for the fancy dentist kind, you won&#x27;t look like a wrestler when you wear it, either. My husband doesn&#x27;t find it attractive, but boy does my head appreciate it in the a.m.! (No more a.m. headaches upon waking.) Good luck</li>
            <li> I had to get used to  biting down and working my lip to keep the band across my teeth. It works, I don&#x27;t clinch at night.</li>
            <li> Not bad as far as night guards go. For the money it&#x27;s a good alternative to other stuff out there</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me . Very small in size and very thick in between my gaw&#x27;s . I think they should offer a package of 2 so people can try them . I had to return a box of ten after I used only 1 and that is a waste I hate to do. I did like the idea of disposable mouth guard. I&#x27;m sorry they didn&#x27;t work. Will keep looking for other options.</li>
            <li> At night, often I go to bed clenching my teeth. Putting one of these in really helps, and soothes (for the lack of a better term) my jaw while going to sleep. They are individually packed, which is nice, and are the perfect size - now, I say that for me, but to be honest, is that true for all? Most likely not. I would say I have an average sized mouth, but can&#x27;t say for sure! I think trial and error is the only way to go. But, these do seem very flexible (maybe too flexible for some of you) so it may not be a problem having them fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be that they do fall off while sleeping, but that could be true for any mouth guard. Sometimes I will wake up with them still in, sometimes not. Going in on your bottom teeth, perhaps your tongue may inadvertently push it out - who knows. Also - keep away from the family pet. My dog can bite through it in seconds and swallow it. I found that out the hard way (but luckily all was fine).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really like these and recommend - but again, with a product like this, every person is different. But, for the price, I think it is a bargain.</li>
            <li> my dd&#x27;s teeth have been hurting due to grinding.  these seems to fit well and don&#x27;t bother her while sleeping.  we like that they fit easily and can be disguarded after a couple uses.</li>
            <li> I had a $528 NTI from my wonderful dentist but it broke after many years of abuse in my mouth.  I have tried 3 different over the counter replacements and feel this is by far the best one. Most comfortable of the 3 and in some ways I like it better than the dentist&#x27;s NTI one.  I like that I can afford to have one in my purse for when I may hit traffic nd get stressed, or in my overnight bag so when I leave for awhile, there is one already available, as I use to forget my NTI often.  One lasts quite awhile for me;weeks actually.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Plackers Grind No More for a few years now and have always enjoyed the product. Before finding this brand, I used several brands of grind guards and hated nearly every one of them. Bulky and dirty and just annoying to sleep with, they tended to only be used for a while and then &#x27;forgotten&#x27; about.  Plackers&#x27; brand is small and thin, it is a disposable product that is designed to be worn for a few nights and thrown away.&lt;br /&gt;I have ground my teeth for years and the damage adds up. My dentist recommended me purchase one from her for almost $600. While a professionally fit guard is probably the best way to go, I simply cannot afford that. These can be purchased at most pharmacies that are well stocked or here on Amazon for about half the price I was paying at that pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;The super thin design of these make them easy to wear on either the top or bottom of your mouth depending on what is comfortable for you. I really enjoy these and use them most nights. They get brushed at night when I brush my teeth and then I pop them in my mouth for sleeping. Easy to use, take care of, and a teeth saver!!! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a heavy nighttime grinder and literally wore out my $600 night guard. I was a little skeptical when I ordered these, but I thought they were worth a shot. They are very light, almost delicate, and extremely comfortable to wear. I throw them out after about a week, but I could probably get a couple weeks out of each one if I pushed it. Don&#x27;t quite know how they work, but they do a great job and I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I think you need something hard to keep your jaws separated - these are squishy and my jaws tended to want to just clamp down on them, grinding them. I&#x27;m still working up the desperation to pay $500 for a stupid dental night guard - would rather just eliminate the stress that leads me to grind in the first place - working on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I tried these for two nights in a row and then gave up and gave the rest (still individually packaged) to Goodwill. I didn&#x27;t want to just throw them away, but they were useless to me.</li>
            <li> These do what they are meant to do. I have fears of swallowing them at night. They are very flexible. I wear them one or twice a week.</li>
            <li> I *love* these about as much as one can *love* any mouth guard, but they do the job - stopping me from mangling my teeth - as I grind my teeth at night, uncontrollably. But these are actually comfortable, in contrast to other boil-and-mold-to-your-teeth night guards; and  head &amp; shoulders more comfortable than the hard plastic, permanent ones you can buy at the dentist&#x27;s. I found it much easier to get used to sleeping with one of these in my mouth versus both the permanant ones and other disposable night guards.. These are much cheaper than all the rest of them,t oo.  They&#x27;re also nonlatex, an important consideration if you&#x27;re allergic.</li>
            <li> Works great! Wake up in the morning with no jaw pain.</li>
            <li> I found this for my husband because he grinds his teeth at night. He says it is comfortable to use compared to what I got him at the local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> These are great!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about spending $$$ on a replacement for the expensive one I used to use.  I get about a week out of one.  Even if I used one every three days, as recommended, I am saving mucho $$$ over buying them in the local drug store.  They charge nearly $25 for a package like this!  I will definitely keep a stock of these on hand!</li>
            <li> Worked okay.  Can feel like it is falling out.</li>
            <li> Very dissatisfied that this product is too small, the back part of the guards moves out of the way when grinding, feel like i wasted 20 something dollars on something that just gave me more of a hassle, thanks plackers for a really messed up product!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think these were the greatest fit for an average adult. But I do get some use out of only using them on the lower teeth, even though they do not stay in place well and hard to get used to as they sit near front teeth only. These might be perfect for a teen, or smaller mouths. Good for travel / overnight bag extras you can toss out or lose &amp; not worry about, they did stop my back teeth from grinding but not as good as other adjustable no-boil guards that create the barrier between the further back teeth which is more what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with clenching my teeth - day and night - and I decided to try these because of the headaches and neck pain I get as a result. I have kind of mixed feeling about these after using them for about a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO&#x27;s: I&#x27;ve never had a problem with choking on them like some reviewers said.&lt;br /&gt;They do keep my teeth apart to prevent further damage.&lt;br /&gt;They do seem to fit my mouth very well.&lt;br /&gt;You can definitely use them for more than three nights if you rinse them in the morning, so it&#x27;s a wonderful value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: I wake up with my gums in the back of my mouth feeling a little sore and weird.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s hard to get used to sleeping with them in your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;For me, as a clencher, I find that having them in my mouth makes me involuntarily clench my teeth more, which makes my neck and jaw hurt just as much in the mornings even if it protects my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;I actually woke up several times in the middle of the night finding myself chewing the guard like a piece of gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I wear it for a few hours at night and then take it out in the middle of the night. I&#x27;m not sure how much these are really helping me with my clenching so I think I will try one of the custom ones that you boil and compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also trying to train myself to learn to have my mouth closed but my teeth apart. I know, it sounds easy, but it&#x27;s tough for me as a long term teeth clencher.</li>
            <li> This is our 4 or 5 purchase of these. They work well and prevent the night grinding of teeth. Also wear when exercising to prevent to much pressure and helped prevent more teeth cracking.</li>
            <li> painful - digs into my gums on the front</li>
            <li> The only product that has lasted!</li>
            <li> These are terrible. They are not comfortable and do not stay in place. I was paranoid that I was going to swallow this, so I didn&#x27;t get a very good night sleep. There are lots of other mouth guards that are comparable in price that fit better and provide more comfort.</li>
            <li> I love these.  They are cheap and easy, like me.</li>
            <li> For me, it made my jaw hurt.  Feel like I have to fight to keep it in place. Tried several nights but could not stand it.</li>
            <li> This appeared to be like a sports protection thing but when you get it is a little tiny device that I have no idea how it works.  It is too small to have near your airway when sleeping in my opinion.  I NEVER return things but this one is going back.</li>
            <li> It took me a little while to get used to them. I use more than suggested. About 5-7 days per unit  and clear with mouth wash each morning.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t stay put very well which makes me nervous to sleep with it in my mouth.</li>
            <li> I clench/grind my teeth frequently and my dentist recently urged me to get a mouth guard. Insurance quoted me over $600 for a custom one, no thank you! I have tried the traditional plastic ones you boil and mold but I&#x27;ve always found them very uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give these a try because they looked much less bulky, It only took me three or four days to get used to them. I have found that wearing them on the top teeth seems more comfortable because they contact your tongue less.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use each one for about a week, rinsing them with Listerine each morning and they seem to be holding up fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spring for an expensive custom fitted night guard or find traditional night guards uncomfortable, give these a try. If they don&#x27;t work then you haven&#x27;t invested much money. Obviously everyone is in a different situation and has different preferences but these honestly worked for me and I recommend you give them a try.</li>
            <li> These are great- you can hardly tell they&#x27;re there, and they work for me. I have used them way many more times than 3. I occasionally brush them with my toothbrush, and every day I run hot water over them and wash off the gunk from my mouth. One pack lasted me a few months doing this. I can&#x27;t imagine wearing those big things like the sports guys wear. These are great.</li>
            <li> Started gagging when trying to use this mechanism.  Would not recommend.  Not comfortable and too flimsy. Best of Luck to all</li>
            <li> Ok, but only as a temporary fix before seeing a dentist to get a real mouth guard fit for your own teeth, they are not much more money... Especially compared to buying these once a month</li>
            <li> The dentist suggested a custom made mouth guard but is unable to prepare one until I have other dental work completed, so I purchased this product.  I was amazed when I woke up the next morning with out the tradition right side temple area head ache pain.  I am getting ready to purchase my second order.  The package recommends three uses and then toss, I cleaned the product each morning and used until it was obviously time to put a new one to use.  It fits easily in the mouth, does not get in the way, it can be situated on the top row or bottom row of teeth, it has a cut out in front and two small bite wings, one on each side.  It is simple in design and incredibly effective.  Using for two months and extremely pleased with the results.  This product is now as important to me as Plackers, Sonicare, Prevident, and The Doctors BrushPics in my bathroom cabinet.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit in your mouth very well. Better off buying a full mouth guard.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t recommend for teeth grinding. The morning after I wear these my jaw feels worse and feel like my bite has been shifted.  Not worth messing up my years of dental work. The guards are small but if you wear them on your bottom teeth instead of your top you won&#x27;t feel as likely to swallow them.  I wish I didn&#x27;t waste my money.</li>
            <li> These have worked for me for the last couple of years very well.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re easy to get used to, and for me they absolutely did the trick.</li>
            <li> I started grinding my teeth in my sleep unexpectedly after having my wisdom teeth removed.  I couldn&#x27;t stay asleep more than a few hours before I&#x27;d wake up with jaw/teeth pain. Terrible time sleeping when you grind your teeth.  I bought these because they were priced well, disposable, and the shape was minimal.  I absolutely LOVE them, minus the fact that they only last 3-4 nights each, but they&#x27;re labeled &amp;#34;disposable&amp;#34; for a reason.  They are flexible, can be worn on the upper or lower jaw, and your mouth gets comfortable within a minute of having it in.  I can also SEE the grinding I&#x27;ve done in the morning by the teeth impressions in the spacers.  I wear them mostly in the upper position, but every few nights I&#x27;ll switch to the lower position. I&#x27;m really impressed with these and will get them until I can have a professional one made. You can make a 10 pack last for a month or more if you don&#x27;t need to wear one every night.</li>
            <li> These are useless. They fall out while you sleep. I would send them back if it didn&#x27;t take more time and money sending it back than it costs.</li>
            <li> How can \\&quot;one size fit all\\&quot; when they are so tiny they don&#x27;t even fit in a woman&#x27;s mouth who is a mere 5&#x27;4\\&quot; with a mouth size proportional. There is no way this can work and I have wasted my money.</li>
            <li> better deal then in stores, definitely helps with grinding, prevents my jaw from hurting in the morning, not bulky either so I like that</li>
            <li> I actually reuse these by washing them off every morning and one has lasted several weeks so far. I think they are pretty comfortable and do not bother me when I am trying to sleep. I would buy them again.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t sleep with it on... Bulky. Not comfy to wear. Wore it once. Waste of my money. Oh we&#x27;ll. sorry for my review.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it does or doesn&#x27;t..I sleep alone so I have no idea when im grinding my teeth...but according to others that occasionally spend the night..I grind my teeth terribly. I use this product a few nights a week..very comfortable and is still in place when I wake up.</li>
