            <li>Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.</li>
            <li>This is better than any conditioner I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li>I surprisingly love Fekkai&#x27;s Shea Mask.  </li>
            <li>I love the scent, I love the way my hair feels, and I love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>I love my hair.</li>
            <li>She has been growing it for years to donate it to Locks of Love.</li>
            <li>About the feel of softened butter Smell: Incredibly lovely.</li>
            <li>But the effectiveness of this is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>If a jar is going to be used, they just need to have a cap under the top cap with a hole to allow just one or two fingers to get into the jar.  </li>
            <li>I love this hair mask.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be using this one once a week to keep my hair healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li>If you use about a tea spoon a time, it should be able to be used about 40 - 42 times.</li>
            <li>The Essential Shea smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>You would think they would have designed it to have a grip around the top so that you can get a better grasp to close it.</li>
            <li>In terms of water conservation, it a great deterrent to using too much water.</li>
            <li>conditioner has a lovely smell and a creamy, buttery feel.</li>
            <li>This product is very rich and moisturizing and I’d recommend using it sparingly.  </li>
            <li>Nice mild floral/herbal scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;For an intense conditioning experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.ng experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li>shea mask has a really nice light, clean, floral scent.  </li>
            <li>I use other Fekkai products as well, because they are some of the best hair products I&#x27;ve use.  </li>
            <li>Believe me, the lid DOES NOT go on easy at all.</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t strong, but I could smell it when I put my hair up to my nose.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner does have a fairly strong, flowery jasmine smell to it.</li>
            <li>Because I color my hair, I really value a good deep conditioner and this does great for my purposes.  </li>
            <li>It is baby fine</li>
            <li>A jar would be fine if I was washing my hair at the sink, but for the shower I would have preferred a pump bottle or tube.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a huge fan of Fredric Fekkai.</li>
            <li>Tip from the Fekkai Salon: For an intense conditioning experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>With that being said, even though my hair looks relatively shiny and healthy (with the help of many products) I have to say that even after only one use of this mask, my hair was GREAT!!!</li>
            <li>Overall a great mask and would continue to use until gone.</li>
            <li>nothing so far has been found to be able to effectively control it.</li>
            <li>But for now, I&#x27;m very pleased with how soft my hair is while it also stays in place.</li>
            <li>I prefer fruity and clean scents.  </li>
            <li>Great for dry or burned out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Directions are to apply to damp clean hair, wait 3-5 minutes, rinse.  </li>
            <li>This masque is applied to clean, damp hair and rinsed out after 3-5 minutes.  </li>
            <li>04/28/215:  The hair is really soft and in better condition after using this product!</li>
            <li>There is a light, pleasant scent I can&#x27;t identify that lingers in the strands when they are dry.  </li>
            <li>just nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a true staple.</li>
            <li>I love this intense conditioner.</li>
            <li>do think I have used some superior products, such as Wen, Ojon and the L&#x27;Occitane line</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair with a very nice texture and a nice, subtle scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells great, and is very easy to use, easiest to use while showering since it only needs to be left on for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li>This really is a great product for it here cheaper then some of the other sights.</li>
            <li>This product really reduced the damage and shedding my hair has experienced in the last 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I love how soft and smooth my hair feels after use.</li>
            <li>I didnt&#x27; have as many tangles as i normally do.  </li>
            <li>My scalp hasn&#x27;t felt that good for a long time.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner rinsed out nice and clean, leaving only a hint of the perfumed smell.</li>
            <li>The floral scent is very strong when you apply the masque, but after rinsing it’s barely noticeable – just a fresh and clean scent.  </li>
            <li>The mask rinsed out fairly easy, did not weigh my fine hair down, and really smells good.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it makes it shine any more than it ordinarily does, but it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>Wash out is easy and fast.</li>
            <li>There is minimal, but pleasant, fragrance.</li>
            <li>so I have to order more frequently!</li>
            <li>My hair feels stronger, more nourished and so soft!  </li>
            <li>I measure product success by the amount of breakage after my hair dries.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I liked it and would use it again.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable with lots of volume and shine and zero static.  </li>
            <li>it rinses out easily and left my hair soft, smelling nice and managable.  </li>
            <li>I found that I didn&#x27;t need as much of the Fekkai mask and it felt good even while wet.  </li>
            <li>Luckily, it stayed in place through this very damp day.</li>
            <li>I put it in my freshly shampooed, wet hair for 10 minutes and wrapped a warm towel around my head.  </li>
            <li>I could see this working for almost every hair type except for very fine or thinning hair (it might leave the hair looking too “flat”).  </li>
            <li>I thought at first I had put too much conditioner on, but after rinsing my hair and drying off the excess water with a towel, I very easily combed my short hair.</li>
            <li>The first time I tried a FEKKAI product was by chance.</li>
            <li>my hair was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The static is the only reason for the 1 star subtraction.  </li>
            <li>Most of the products I use maintain the current condition - they don&#x27;t cause harm, but haven&#x27;t helped the hair either.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Fekkai!</li>
            <li>Overall I thought this Shae mask did a good job at putting some mositure back into my hair</li>
            <li>but I would not say that is was amazing, but simply average.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t wash my hair the next day and it was still as nice and bouncy and fluffy and healthy as the day before.  </li>
            <li>and it makes my hair super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Infused with pure Shea</li>
            <li>product does not seem to require to be used in a large quantity; a teaspoonful or two seems to be sufficient, even though I have a lot of hair (medium-long hair).</li>
            <li>guess this product works great for someone having hair like mine, especially if you want to keep your hair volume down, but not so much for someone who needs volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It tangles and breaks easily and can get pretty dry.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of the product for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It looks much brighter and healthier as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really a God send.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t like it too much, saying it made his hair volume lower and made his hair look thinner.</li>
            <li>My hair now feels soft and clean, natural, like when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li>but I would rate this particular shea mask very high in terms of quality and benefit.</li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;ve found that simply applying, then putting on a shower cap for a few minutes while in the warm shower is easier and simpler, while still producing those super results.</li>
            <li>Blow drying my hair certainly doesn&#x27;t help much, but what a busy gal to do?</li>
            <li>Applying the product is easy (though I don&#x27;t do it every day), and I followed the instructions and let it stand on my wet hair for five minutes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I will definitely buy more in the future....</li>
            <li>Probably (as I am in my 40&#x27;s now) my hair is just changing as I grow older, too.</li>
            <li>and I left it in for more than 5 minutes and ensured it covered my entire hair.  </li>
            <li>The main problem with this product is the jar.  </li>
            <li>My hair emerged shiny and soft and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>People who are sensitive to fragrance may find the floral scent too intense.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t normally like florals --</li>
            <li>liked the result so much that I tried on my husband&#x27;s straight and thin hair.</li>
            <li>It was nice and thick, something for me that is a must for a hair mask.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a wide flat jar that isn&#x27;t very easy to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not hard on my hair</li>
            <li>Just super results -  soft, silky, and fluid.  </li>
            <li>and I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li>My hair was sleek and shiny, even coarse white hairs were smooth.  </li>
            <li>My fine, straight hair ordinarily feels like straw in the winter, even using cream rinse.  </li>
            <li>receiving FEKKAI ESSENTIAL SHEA MASK 7 OZ, after having tried another FEKKAI product of a much smaller quantity, I was pleasantly surprised this one was of a greater amount and would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my hair was soft, glossy and no more hairs saluting from the top of my scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found that my hair after I blew dry felt a little bit softer but nothing out of this world amazing.  </li>
            <li>I have long, very thick hair and have a huge collection of conditioners, mostly to get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li>While the overall volume of the hair is kept down, it helps to give my hair more bouncy curl - it makes my hair look</li>
            <li>However, since the consistency of this new mask isn&#x27;t as thick, distributing it through my hair is easier, and I can get a lot more usage out of this one.  </li>
            <li>If you have dry or damaged hair, this will fix you right up</li>
            <li>For external use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;Infused with pure Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>I tried the Fekkai Essential Shea Rich Moisture Masque and did not leave it on long enough (and probably did not thoroughly apply to my hair) and did not see much difference.  </li>
            <li>After using this mask my hair feels soft and it shines resulting in salon hair.</li>
            <li>Lavish hair with the luxuriously intense conditioning treatment of Essential Shea</li>
            <li>The reason I am surprised is because I didn&#x27;t care for the shea shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have natural blond hair that I highlight once or twice a year.  </li>
            <li>To have your hair feel really soft try this product.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This is intended as a weekly intense conditioning treatment and I wouldn’t use it as a substitute for a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have spent a lot of money to manage it, even $5/oz shampoo, but I rarely saw any differences no matter what product I use for my hair.</li>
            <li>Your hair will feel waxy at first, but once you rinse and blow dry you&#x27;ll notice</li>
            <li>I have long, color treated hair that I heat style daily, and static electricity has been a major issue, leaving my hair looking dry and flyaway.  </li>
            <li>I have dry, frizzy, color-treated hair made worse by daily use of a flatiron, so I&#x27;m always searching for a better deep conditioner to keep it looking healthy and</li>
            <li>I normally use multiple products to get rid of the frizziness and dryness.  </li>
            <li>This is a really nice deep conditioner for coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li>This intense conditioning treatment wraps dry hair in moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This intense conditioning treatment wraps dry hair in moisture.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t see how it could be any different than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>The cream is thick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>I bought this having had so-so experiences with other hair masques and noticed a difference the first time I washed my hair after applying this product.</li>
            <li>I normally have to slather on a ton of thick masks on my hair to be able to get a wide toothed comb through my tangles.  </li>
            <li>It is not a big deal, because it did fine with the products I use to style my hair and had no static once I finished fixing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The next morning her hair was so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Coarse, ultra-dry hair is manageable, soft and tamed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li>Coarse, ultra-dry hair is manageable, soft and tamed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will definitely keep using the product since it was better than more expensive products that I used in the past.</li>
            <li>I left the conditioner on for five minutes before rinsing and the result was hair that was shiny, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li>It definitely left my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>This hair mask has a nice creamy texture and a faintly floral smell.  </li>
            <li>middle daughter has very course, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li>you have coarse, straight, dry hair - get this.</li>
            <li>First, conditioner is extremely slippery - just try getting that lid back on once you&#x27;ve gotten it off.</li>
            <li>I have recently been trying some different deep conditioners/masks of a wide price range without much</li>
            <li>My god child has really  course hair that mattes easily and tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li>I have fine but very thick shoulder length hair and have had little baby hairs that would stick straight up in my part area...</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend this product to other women (or men) who are having problems with dry hair.</li>
            <li>However, certain heavy products can sometimes make it look greasy.  </li>

            <li> It looked so nice and even had a bit of volume after drying</li>
            <li> Nice product.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice scent, too.</li>
            <li> An additional label tip is to wrap in a warm towel during that time.  </li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> The smell was nice, Jasmine and an &amp;#34;exotic floral&amp;#34; sent.  </li>
            <li> Although i did not notice any significant changes in my hair texture but just feels good that it nourishes my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have to say that I am well pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> After rinsing it out, my hair had much more volume and just felt healthier.</li>
            <li> and I love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love what it does to and for my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> ESSENTIAL SHEA MASK smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.</li>
            <li> This is better than any conditioner I&#x27;ve</li>
            <li> I surprisingly love Fekkai&#x27;s Shea Mask.  </li>
            <li> I love the scent, I love the way my hair feels, and I love the way my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> I love my hair.</li>
            <li> She has been growing it for years to donate it to Locks of Love.</li>
            <li> About the feel of softened butter Smell: Incredibly lovely.</li>
            <li> But the effectiveness of this is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> If a jar is going to be used, they just need to have a cap under the top cap with a hole to allow just one or two fingers to get into the jar.  </li>
            <li> I love this hair mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be using this one once a week to keep my hair healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li> If you use about a tea spoon a time, it should be able to be used about 40 - 42 times.</li>
            <li> The Essential Shea smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> You would think they would have designed it to have a grip around the top so that you can get a better grasp to close it.</li>
            <li> In terms of water conservation, it a great deterrent to using too much water.</li>
            <li> conditioner has a lovely smell and a creamy, buttery feel.</li>
            <li> This product is very rich and moisturizing and I’d recommend using it sparingly.  </li>
            <li> Nice mild floral/herbal scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions&lt;br /&gt;For an intense conditioning experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.ng experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> shea mask has a really nice light, clean, floral scent.  </li>
            <li> I use other Fekkai products as well, because they are some of the best hair products I&#x27;ve use.  </li>
            <li> Believe me, the lid DOES NOT go on easy at all.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t strong, but I could smell it when I put my hair up to my nose.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner does have a fairly strong, flowery jasmine smell to it.</li>
            <li> Because I color my hair, I really value a good deep conditioner and this does great for my purposes.  </li>
            <li> It is baby fine</li>
            <li> A jar would be fine if I was washing my hair at the sink, but for the shower I would have preferred a pump bottle or tube.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Fredric Fekkai.</li>
            <li> Tip from the Fekkai Salon: For an intense conditioning experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> With that being said, even though my hair looks relatively shiny and healthy (with the help of many products) I have to say that even after only one use of this mask, my hair was GREAT!!!</li>
            <li> Overall a great mask and would continue to use until gone.</li>
            <li> nothing so far has been found to be able to effectively control it.</li>
            <li> But for now, I&#x27;m very pleased with how soft my hair is while it also stays in place.</li>
            <li> I prefer fruity and clean scents.  </li>
            <li> Great for dry or burned out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Directions are to apply to damp clean hair, wait 3-5 minutes, rinse.  </li>
            <li> This masque is applied to clean, damp hair and rinsed out after 3-5 minutes.  </li>
            <li> 04/28/215:  The hair is really soft and in better condition after using this product!</li>
            <li> There is a light, pleasant scent I can&#x27;t identify that lingers in the strands when they are dry.  </li>
            <li> just nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a true staple.</li>
            <li> I love this intense conditioner.</li>
            <li> do think I have used some superior products, such as Wen, Ojon and the L&#x27;Occitane line</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair with a very nice texture and a nice, subtle scent.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells great, and is very easy to use, easiest to use while showering since it only needs to be left on for about 3 minutes.  </li>
            <li> This really is a great product for it here cheaper then some of the other sights.</li>
            <li> This product really reduced the damage and shedding my hair has experienced in the last 3 years.  </li>
            <li> I love how soft and smooth my hair feels after use.</li>
            <li> I didnt&#x27; have as many tangles as i normally do.  </li>
            <li> My scalp hasn&#x27;t felt that good for a long time.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner rinsed out nice and clean, leaving only a hint of the perfumed smell.</li>
            <li> The floral scent is very strong when you apply the masque, but after rinsing it’s barely noticeable – just a fresh and clean scent.  </li>
            <li> The mask rinsed out fairly easy, did not weigh my fine hair down, and really smells good.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it makes it shine any more than it ordinarily does, but it&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li> Wash out is easy and fast.</li>
            <li> There is minimal, but pleasant, fragrance.</li>
            <li> so I have to order more frequently!</li>
            <li> My hair feels stronger, more nourished and so soft!  </li>
            <li> I measure product success by the amount of breakage after my hair dries.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I liked it and would use it again.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and manageable with lots of volume and shine and zero static.  </li>
            <li> it rinses out easily and left my hair soft, smelling nice and managable.  </li>
            <li> I found that I didn&#x27;t need as much of the Fekkai mask and it felt good even while wet.  </li>
            <li> Luckily, it stayed in place through this very damp day.</li>
            <li> I put it in my freshly shampooed, wet hair for 10 minutes and wrapped a warm towel around my head.  </li>
            <li> I could see this working for almost every hair type except for very fine or thinning hair (it might leave the hair looking too “flat”).  </li>
            <li> I thought at first I had put too much conditioner on, but after rinsing my hair and drying off the excess water with a towel, I very easily combed my short hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried a FEKKAI product was by chance.</li>
            <li> my hair was soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The static is the only reason for the 1 star subtraction.  </li>
            <li> Most of the products I use maintain the current condition - they don&#x27;t cause harm, but haven&#x27;t helped the hair either.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Fekkai!</li>
            <li> Overall I thought this Shae mask did a good job at putting some mositure back into my hair</li>
            <li> but I would not say that is was amazing, but simply average.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t wash my hair the next day and it was still as nice and bouncy and fluffy and healthy as the day before.  </li>
            <li> and it makes my hair super soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Infused with pure Shea</li>
            <li> product does not seem to require to be used in a large quantity; a teaspoonful or two seems to be sufficient, even though I have a lot of hair (medium-long hair).</li>
            <li> guess this product works great for someone having hair like mine, especially if you want to keep your hair volume down, but not so much for someone who needs volume.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tangles and breaks easily and can get pretty dry.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of the product for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It looks much brighter and healthier as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really a God send.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t like it too much, saying it made his hair volume lower and made his hair look thinner.</li>
            <li> My hair now feels soft and clean, natural, like when I was a kid.  </li>
            <li> but I would rate this particular shea mask very high in terms of quality and benefit.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve found that simply applying, then putting on a shower cap for a few minutes while in the warm shower is easier and simpler, while still producing those super results.</li>
            <li> Blow drying my hair certainly doesn&#x27;t help much, but what a busy gal to do?</li>
            <li> Applying the product is easy (though I don&#x27;t do it every day), and I followed the instructions and let it stand on my wet hair for five minutes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will definitely buy more in the future....</li>
            <li> Probably (as I am in my 40&#x27;s now) my hair is just changing as I grow older, too.</li>
            <li> and I left it in for more than 5 minutes and ensured it covered my entire hair.  </li>
            <li> The main problem with this product is the jar.  </li>
            <li> My hair emerged shiny and soft and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> People who are sensitive to fragrance may find the floral scent too intense.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t normally like florals --</li>
            <li> liked the result so much that I tried on my husband&#x27;s straight and thin hair.</li>
            <li> It was nice and thick, something for me that is a must for a hair mask.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a wide flat jar that isn&#x27;t very easy to handle in the shower.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not hard on my hair</li>
            <li> Just super results -  soft, silky, and fluid.  </li>
            <li> and I live in the desert.  </li>
            <li> My hair was sleek and shiny, even coarse white hairs were smooth.  </li>
            <li> My fine, straight hair ordinarily feels like straw in the winter, even using cream rinse.  </li>
            <li> receiving FEKKAI ESSENTIAL SHEA MASK 7 OZ, after having tried another FEKKAI product of a much smaller quantity, I was pleasantly surprised this one was of a greater amount and would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my hair was soft, glossy and no more hairs saluting from the top of my scalp.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I found that my hair after I blew dry felt a little bit softer but nothing out of this world amazing.  </li>
            <li> I have long, very thick hair and have a huge collection of conditioners, mostly to get the tangles out.  </li>
            <li> While the overall volume of the hair is kept down, it helps to give my hair more bouncy curl - it makes my hair look</li>
            <li> However, since the consistency of this new mask isn&#x27;t as thick, distributing it through my hair is easier, and I can get a lot more usage out of this one.  </li>
            <li> If you have dry or damaged hair, this will fix you right up</li>
            <li> For external use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indications&lt;br /&gt;Infused with pure Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> I tried the Fekkai Essential Shea Rich Moisture Masque and did not leave it on long enough (and probably did not thoroughly apply to my hair) and did not see much difference.  </li>
            <li> After using this mask my hair feels soft and it shines resulting in salon hair.</li>
            <li> Lavish hair with the luxuriously intense conditioning treatment of Essential Shea</li>
            <li> The reason I am surprised is because I didn&#x27;t care for the shea shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have natural blond hair that I highlight once or twice a year.  </li>
            <li> To have your hair feel really soft try this product.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This is intended as a weekly intense conditioning treatment and I wouldn’t use it as a substitute for a daily conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a lot of money to manage it, even $5/oz shampoo, but I rarely saw any differences no matter what product I use for my hair.</li>
            <li> Your hair will feel waxy at first, but once you rinse and blow dry you&#x27;ll notice</li>
            <li> I have long, color treated hair that I heat style daily, and static electricity has been a major issue, leaving my hair looking dry and flyaway.  </li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, color-treated hair made worse by daily use of a flatiron, so I&#x27;m always searching for a better deep conditioner to keep it looking healthy and</li>
            <li> I normally use multiple products to get rid of the frizziness and dryness.  </li>
            <li> This is a really nice deep conditioner for coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> This intense conditioning treatment wraps dry hair in moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This intense conditioning treatment wraps dry hair in moisture.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t see how it could be any different than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> The cream is thick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> I bought this having had so-so experiences with other hair masques and noticed a difference the first time I washed my hair after applying this product.</li>
            <li> I normally have to slather on a ton of thick masks on my hair to be able to get a wide toothed comb through my tangles.  </li>
            <li> It is not a big deal, because it did fine with the products I use to style my hair and had no static once I finished fixing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The next morning her hair was so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Coarse, ultra-dry hair is manageable, soft and tamed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;•</li>
            <li> Coarse, ultra-dry hair is manageable, soft and tamed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will definitely keep using the product since it was better than more expensive products that I used in the past.</li>
            <li> I left the conditioner on for five minutes before rinsing and the result was hair that was shiny, soft, and manageable.</li>
            <li> It definitely left my hair feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> This hair mask has a nice creamy texture and a faintly floral smell.  </li>
            <li> middle daughter has very course, dry, frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> you have coarse, straight, dry hair - get this.</li>
            <li> First, conditioner is extremely slippery - just try getting that lid back on once you&#x27;ve gotten it off.</li>
            <li> I have recently been trying some different deep conditioners/masks of a wide price range without much</li>
            <li> My god child has really  course hair that mattes easily and tangles like crazy.</li>
            <li> I have fine but very thick shoulder length hair and have had little baby hairs that would stick straight up in my part area...</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend this product to other women (or men) who are having problems with dry hair.</li>
            <li> However, certain heavy products can sometimes make it look greasy.  </li>
            <li> The instructions suggest leaving it in for only 3 to 5 minutes, but I&#x27;ve left it in for as long as an hour under a shower cap, and have found its results excellent.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I do flat iron</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use this on oily or fine hair - the Shea can be fatty, and hard to wash</li>
            <li> About half my hair is fine and dark, the other half white and coarse.  </li>
            <li> If your hair is thin or fine textured you’ll need very little product; thick or coarse textured hair types will want to apply a little more.  </li>
            <li> Because I often shower after my morning workout and then often shower again after work, my hair tends to become dry - even with regular use of conditioners.</li>
            <li> I have coarse dry hair that has been damaged by my beautician who I continue to see continue</li>
            <li> Later in the day after running errands with the weather still rather wet, my hair still held its place, but was softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing to use this conditioner on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> My daughter has thick, straight, long blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I think anyone with color-treated hair will be pleased with the results; it really makes my rather tired highlights look fresh and glossy and perks up the base color.  </li>
            <li> I have long hair, down mid back area, that I get highlighted regularly</li>
            <li> Yes, it is dry and cold outside, but I run a couple humidifiers in my house and haven&#x27;t had static problems all winter.  </li>
            <li> Given my hair texture, I find that I have to leave this mask on for much longer than the recommended time—at least an hour—</li>
            <li> I dressed her hair in this mask and then washed it out after making two long pig tails.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I even found myself sniffing my hair all day long.  </li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai products for a long while now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;History - my hair is long, blonde (dyed), I live in a REALLY dry place (LA) and I have REALLY hard</li>
            <li> For now, I turn the shower off (which is actually not too bad of an idea for water conservation), apply the product, use a towel to put the lid back on and close it back up, turn the water back on after 5 minutes and rinse my hair with cool water.</li>
            <li> I have long, dry,  processed hair</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week, and a little goes a long way: I can see this tub lasting 5 to 6 months at my current usage</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about trying it on my dry legs...</li>
            <li> maybe it&#x27;s the answer for dry skin as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have time in my day to let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> wanted to give this product a try to see if it could alleviate some of my dry hair symptoms</li>
            <li> Her curls were looser and easier to comb when her hair was dry.</li>
            <li> So knowing that you will understand my hair does not look dry or brittle.</li>
            <li> I suffer from a dry itchy scalp</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll even apply a pea size amount to my shoulder length hair after showering to keep it from frizzing throughout the dry winter.</li>
            <li> Which means that water gets into the product until my hands and the jar are dry</li>
            <li> You only need to use a tiny bit and run it/comb it through your hair, wait a few minutes, and rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> I have a lot of shea products including some 100% shea butter and shea has a characteristic smell which I don&#x27;t smell in this</li>
            <li> Since a little goes a long way, this 7 ounce tub will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> She gets these huge difficult icky knots near her scalp if any shampoo doesn&#x27;t rise out.</li>
            <li> As it stands, I have to put my whole hand into the jar to get the product out and it creates a small mess in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 04/13/2015:</li>
            <li> After a couple minutes, I rinse out the conditioner and my hair is noticeably softer -- at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair.</li>
            <li> (Sounds strange, but that&#x27;s my hair!!)  </li>
            <li> The mask is similar to mayonnaise and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I see a slight improvement in breakage, but there is still breakage because my hair is so coarse.  </li>
            <li> I left it on about a half hour and rinsed well.  </li>
            <li> Less than a teaspoon was sufficient for my short hair.</li>
            <li> My hair tends to get very dry in the winter...</li>
            <li> My hair is bleached and very dry?</li>
            <li> Both are very dry.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, coarse, color-treated hair and have been looking for a product that will keep it looking soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much of this conditioner -- less than a quarter sized dab -- to coat my shoulder length, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I hate to compare, but I do think that the previous Essential Shea mask (in the tube) does a better job at moisturizing my coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> You apply it to wet hair, leaving on for 3 to 5 minutes and rinse off.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too heavy for me to use daily</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s flat and limp, and there is no reduction in frizz.</li>
            <li> Also, this product doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smelling stinky like some other hair products do.</li>
            <li> My hair actually feels drier than usual</li>
            <li> I used less than a tablespoon on my hair that is about 4&amp;#34; past my shoulders and left it in while I shaved and washed the rest of me before rinsing out.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, long, medium-coarse, wavy hair that gets very dry in the winter.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is with the way the product is packaged.</li>
            <li> It did NOT weigh my hair down at all.  </li>
            <li> To avoid weighing down the hair I’d concentrate the product from the mid-shaft of the hair thru to the ends (skipping the root area).  </li>
            <li> but I would state it as a typical salon-type product scent with some slightly sour jasmine.  </li>
            <li> After one use, my daughter’s hair was shinier, less frizzy, with softer curls without weighing it down or leaving it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now before I give my review of the product I will provide this slight disclaimer:</li>
            <li> He tried it again using less quantity, but he still didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair seemed to take less time to style after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Another thing I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down after it is rinsed off, sometimes heavy conditioners make my hair dull and heavy, and that is not a problem with this deep conditioner.  </li>
            <li> hair is thick, frizzy, dry curly hair with some damage from hair dye used monthly.</li>
            <li> I applied just a little of it after shampooing.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair and kinda towel dried it for a few minutes then applied this and combed through.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets really dried out in the winter, and this restores moisture without leaving it greasy or limp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use a small spoon for a facial cream jar, but using a spoon during the shower while keeping it dry is difficult.</li>
            <li> Winter is tough on my hair, and then in the summer there&#x27;s chlorine and the sun to dry it out.</li>
            <li> Usually I must add a leave-in conditioner that feels waxy.  </li>
            <li> I never used anything like this in the past.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why this product works so well for others but not for me, but there it is.</li>
            <li> This has been a looong winter here in New England, and the combination of frigid outdoor temperatures and dry indoor heating have taken their toll on my hair.  </li>
            <li> No too thick and not too watery.</li>
            <li> I have really thick</li>
            <li> The conditioner has a thick, pudding-like texture.</li>
            <li> No more knots!</li>
            <li> small amount of the Fekkai Shea Mask was all that I needed to use to see dramatic results.</li>
            <li> Well, I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed in the results.</li>
            <li> I am not sure how you judge the cost, but it is way cheaper than my expensive shampoo that was $2.50 per use, and with this product, I can see the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, and I needed to use approximately 2 Tablespoons to fully saturate my hair.</li>
            <li> It can be difficult finding a product that doesn&#x27;t make it look dry/frizzy or greasy.  </li>
            <li> When I started rinsing the Fekkai shea mask, I thought it was going to be another fail -- it felt like it wasn&#x27;t rinsing out, so I assumed it would make my hair look greasy.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the idea of sticking my fingers in a jar, dripping water in it and making the content a bit dirty.</li>
            <li> I wasn’t crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> In terms of ease of use, it&#x27;s frustratingly impossible to close the lid without help.</li>
            <li> However, the concept of the jar is annoying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very annoying.</li>

            <li> This product is divine!  My hair tends to get very dry in the winter...I have fine but very thick shoulder length hair and have had little baby hairs that would stick straight up in my part area...dove me crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using the Fekkai Essential Shea Mask one time.....my hair was soft, glossy and no more hairs saluting from the top of my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product smells great, and is very easy to use, easiest to use while showering since it only needs to be left on for about 3 minutes.  You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of the product for it to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not had any greasiness, and my hair doesn&#x27;t feel goopy...like there is any residue left on it .... just nice and soft.  It looks much brighter and healthier as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m thinking about trying it on my dry legs...maybe it&#x27;s the answer for dry skin as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy more in the future....great product.</li>
            <li> Because I often shower after my morning workout and then often shower again after work, my hair tends to become dry - even with regular use of conditioners. Blow drying my hair certainly doesn&#x27;t help much, but what a busy gal to do? I don&#x27;t have time in my day to let my hair air dry. Probably (as I am in my 40&#x27;s now) my hair is just changing as I grow older, too. Who knows?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to give this product a try to see if it could alleviate some of my dry hair symptoms and I have to say that I am well pleased with the results. Applying the product is easy (though I don&#x27;t do it every day), and I followed the instructions and let it stand on my wet hair for five minutes. After rinsing it out, my hair had much more volume and just felt healthier. Also, this product doesn&#x27;t leave your hair smelling stinky like some other hair products do. I would certainly recommend this product to other women (or men) who are having problems with dry hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a huge fan of Fredric Fekkai.I have a lot of his products and I&#x27;ve been using them for years.I have relaxed,fine,color treated African American hair.This mask does a great job at moisturizing my hair.The consistency is perfect.No too thick and not too watery.It also smells fabulous,almost heavenly.After using this mask my hair feels soft and it shines resulting in salon hair.I will definitely buy this again when I run out.It&#x27;s a true staple.</li>
            <li> works the best to nourish hair...</li>
            <li> smells good and moisturizes my curly hair!</li>
            <li> Just what wife wanted</li>
            <li> I have long hair, down mid back area, that I get highlighted regularly and I love this product.  I use other Fekkai products as well, because they are some of the best hair products I&#x27;ve use.  This one is a mask and I use in the shower.  I shampoo my hair with a Fekkai shampoo, then rinse and add the mask once or twice a week.  The mask is similar to mayonnaise and a little goes a long way. I leave the mask in for 3 to 5 minutes and then rinse.  It rinses easily and  has a beautiful floral smell.  When I go to style my hair, I find it makes my highlights pop and the rest of my hair shiny and gorgeous.  I love what it does to and for my highlighted hair.</li>
            <li> My fine, straight hair ordinarily feels like straw in the winter, even using cream rinse.  Usually I must add a leave-in conditioner that feels waxy.  I used less than a tablespoon on my hair that is about 4&amp;#34; past my shoulders and left it in while I shaved and washed the rest of me before rinsing out.  My hair now feels soft and clean, natural, like when I was a kid.  I don&#x27;t think it makes it shine any more than it ordinarily does, but it&#x27;s a good product.  There is a light, pleasant scent I can&#x27;t identify that lingers in the strands when they are dry.  The cream is thick and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> My god child has really  course hair that mattes easily and tangles like crazy. Her mom combs her hair every morning painstakingly. I dressed her hair in this mask and then washed it out after making two long pig tails. The next morning her hair was so soft and silky. Her curls were looser and easier to comb when her hair was dry. Really a God send.</li>
            <li> The first time I tried a FEKKAI product was by chance. I had no idea what I was in for, and though a bit costly, FEKKAI is an amazing product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving FEKKAI ESSENTIAL SHEA MASK 7 OZ, after having tried another FEKKAI product of a much smaller quantity, I was pleasantly surprised this one was of a greater amount and would last longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My middle daughter has very course, dry, frizzy hair. As a teen girl, that is unacceptable and something a mother will do what she can to help eliminate the problem. FEKKAI ESSENTIAL SHEA MASK smells wonderful. After one use, my daughter’s hair was shinier, less frizzy, with softer curls without weighing it down or leaving it greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Infused with pure Shea Butter.&lt;br /&gt;• Scented by jasmine and exotic florals.&lt;br /&gt;• This intense conditioning treatment wraps dry hair in moisture.&lt;br /&gt;• Coarse, ultra-dry hair is manageable, soft and tamed to fluidity.&lt;br /&gt;• Tip from the Fekkai Salon: For an intense conditioning experience, wrap hair in a warm towel for 5-10 minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;• Lavish hair with the luxuriously intense conditioning treatment of Essential Shea Masque.&lt;br /&gt;• Gives hair beautiful manageability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product Description:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Safety Warning&lt;br /&gt;Avoid contact with eyes.

            <li> I have long, dry,  processed hair and I live in the desert.  I normally use multiple products to get rid of the frizziness and dryness.  I tried the Fekkai Essential Shea Rich Moisture Masque and did not leave it on long enough (and probably did not thoroughly apply to my hair) and did not see much difference.  I then tried a second time using the Fekkai product and I left it in for more than 5 minutes and ensured it covered my entire hair.  The results were very good- my hair was soft and smooth.  I will definitely keep using the product since it was better than more expensive products that I used in the past.</li>
            <li> This is better than any conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not hard on my hair but I do flat iron it quite often - so I am not unfamiliar with split ends and frizz. I bought this having had so-so experiences with other hair masques and noticed a difference the first time I washed my hair after applying this product. My hair was shiny, silky, and it felt moisturized. So nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to apply this the night before you wash. I know the jar says only leave it on for 5-10 minutes but I like to rub this into my hair, brush, tie it into a bun and let the masque harden. Your hair will feel waxy at first, but once you rinse and blow dry you&#x27;ll notice the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have coarse, straight, dry hair - get this. I also recommend this for ladies who perm or relax their hair as a deep conditioner...it&#x27;ll seal the bonds in your hair and soothe your scalp. I wouldn&#x27;t use this on oily or fine hair - the Shea can be fatty, and hard to wash out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is addictive, too.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Although i did not notice any significant changes in my hair texture but just feels good that it nourishes my hair. I have really thick frizz prone hair and nothing so far has been found to be able to effectively control it.</li>
            <li> I surprisingly love Fekkai&#x27;s Shea Mask.  The reason I am surprised is because I didn&#x27;t care for the shea shampoo and conditioner.  My line of choice is Fekkai&#x27;s glossing shampoo and conditioner.  I have recently been trying some different deep conditioners/masks of a wide price range without much luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shea mask has a really nice light, clean, floral scent.  I don&#x27;t normally like florals -- I prefer fruity and clean scents.  I normally have to slather on a ton of thick masks on my hair to be able to get a wide toothed comb through my tangles.  I found that I didn&#x27;t need as much of the Fekkai mask and it felt good even while wet.  I left the mask on for over an hour (I always do this).  I have natural blond hair that I highlight once or twice a year.  It is baby fine but lots of it.  It tangles and breaks easily and can get pretty dry.  However, certain heavy products can sometimes make it look greasy.  It can be difficult finding a product that doesn&#x27;t make it look dry/frizzy or greasy.  (Sounds strange, but that&#x27;s my hair!!)  When I started rinsing the Fekkai shea mask, I thought it was going to be another fail -- it felt like it wasn&#x27;t rinsing out, so I assumed it would make my hair look greasy.  It did NOT!  It looked so nice and even had a bit of volume after drying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I had is that my hair was staticky in the morning.  Yes, it is dry and cold outside, but I run a couple humidifiers in my house and haven&#x27;t had static problems all winter.  The only change was this mask.  It is not a big deal, because it did fine with the products I use to style my hair and had no static once I finished fixing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even found myself sniffing my hair all day long.  It isn&#x27;t strong, but I could smell it when I put my hair up to my nose.  The static is the only reason for the 1 star subtraction.  I love the scent, I love the way my hair feels, and I love the way my hair looks.  I plan to use this mask once a week.</li>
            <li> This really is a great product for it here cheaper then some of the other sights. To have your hair feel really soft try this product.</li>
            <li> I love this product! 5 Stars. My hair is bleached and very dry? After using this product my hair looks healthy and I can just blow it without putting a curling iron on it !</li>
            <li> I hate to compare, but I do think that the previous Essential Shea mask (in the tube) does a better job at moisturizing my coarse hair.  However, since the consistency of this new mask isn&#x27;t as thick, distributing it through my hair is easier, and I can get a lot more usage out of this one.  Given my hair texture, I find that I have to leave this mask on for much longer than the recommended time—at least an hour—but when I do take the plastic cap off, my hair is definitely easier to comb through.  While I&#x27;m moving on to try my luck with a different Fekkai mask (Prx), I would still recommend this one to those looking for moisture.  If it can soften my unruly hair, it can probably work work for anyone.</li>
            <li> I feel as though this product is repairing the damage to my hair left by the heat of blow drying and curling iron.</li>
            <li> I never used anything like this in the past.  I have long, very thick hair and have a huge collection of conditioners, mostly to get the tangles out.  This is like a body lotion consistency.  you smear it on your hair.  I washed my hair and kinda towel dried it for a few minutes then applied this and combed through.  i left it on for 5 minutes then rinsed it out.  it rinses out easily and left my hair soft, smelling nice and managable.  It did make it easier to comb through.  I didnt&#x27; have as many tangles as i normally do.  I blow dryed my hair and it was bouncy all day at work and even after i worked out. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair the next day and it was still as nice and bouncy and fluffy and healthy as the day before.  I don&#x27;t think i would use this every day but i will use it once a week.  Nice product.  If you have dry or damaged hair, this will fix you right up</li>
            <li> As a woman who has her hair double-processed about once ever 5 - 6 weeks, I am always looking for products to help restore moisture and restore health, so when I had the opportunity to try this product, I jumped at it. Now before I give my review of the product I will provide this slight disclaimer: I take exceptionally good care of my hair. (Yeah.. I admit it. I love my hair. I am a vain woman. LOL ) So knowing that you will understand my hair does not look dry or brittle. With that being said, even though my hair looks relatively shiny and healthy (with the help of many products) I have to say that even after only one use of this mask, my hair was GREAT!!! The mask rinsed out fairly easy, did not weigh my fine hair down, and really smells good. I truly recommend this mask regardless if you abuse your hair like I do or if you just need the occasional deep conditioner.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged to try this after reading all of the glowing reviews. I have thick, long, medium-coarse, wavy hair that gets very dry in the winter. So this product sounded perfect for me, right? Well, I&#x27;ve used it several times now, and I have to say I&#x27;m disappointed in the results. My hair actually feels drier than usual, it&#x27;s flat and limp, and there is no reduction in frizz. I&#x27;m not sure why this product works so well for others but not for me, but there it is. My quest continues.</li>
            <li> Fekkai has scored big with this. My daughter has thick, straight, long blonde hair. She has been growing it for years to donate it to Locks of Love. She gets these huge difficult icky knots near her scalp if any shampoo doesn&#x27;t rise out. It takes 45 minutes to comb through it when it happens. We have tried salon, drugstore, online, homemade shampoos and conditioners to help strangle knots.  Texture: About the feel of softened butter Smell: Incredibly lovely. It reminds me of Michael Kors&#x27; signature fragrance. If this was a perfume, I would buy it. Usage: Wash out is easy and fast. But the effectiveness of this is phenomenal. No more knots!</li>
            <li> My hair loves this stuff !!</li>
            <li> I have coarse dry hair that has been damaged by my beautician who I continue to see continue I can find someone else.  With that said, I literally need a miracle product at this point.  Most of the products I use maintain the current condition - they don&#x27;t cause harm, but haven&#x27;t helped the hair either.  This product seems to be on the end where it doesn&#x27;t cause my hair harm.  It does seem to be softening though as well.  I measure product success by the amount of breakage after my hair dries.  I see a slight improvement in breakage, but there is still breakage because my hair is so coarse.  I have used the product twice and will continue to use it until the jar is used up.  The main problem with this product is the jar.  The product comes in a body butter jar which is not conducive to use in a shower.  If a jar is going to be used, they just need to have a cap under the top cap with a hole to allow just one or two fingers to get into the jar.  As it stands, I have to put my whole hand into the jar to get the product out and it creates a small mess in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 04/13/2015: This product really reduced the damage and shedding my hair has experienced in the last 3 years.  It is a keeper!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 04/28/215:  The hair is really soft and in better condition after using this product!</li>
            <li> I thought at first I had put too much conditioner on, but after rinsing my hair and drying off the excess water with a towel, I very easily combed my short hair. Luckily, it stayed in place through this very damp day. Later in the day after running errands with the weather still rather wet, my hair still held its place, but was softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on continuing to use this conditioner on a regular basis. If anything changes, I will update this review. But for now, I&#x27;m very pleased with how soft my hair is while it also stays in place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been impressed with every Fekkai product I&#x27;ve tried, and this one is no exception.  I&#x27;m using this as a weekly super-moisturizing treatment.  My hair gets really dried out in the winter, and this restores moisture without leaving it greasy or limp.  You only need to use a tiny bit and run it/comb it through your hair, wait a few minutes, and rinse it out.  It leaves my shoulder-length hair bouncier and healthier-looking.  It has a nice scent, too.</li>
            <li> I love this hair mask. It works great on my color treated, fine, medium-length hair. I use it twice a week, and a little goes a long way: I can see this tub lasting 5 to 6 months at my current usage rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has affected my hair color at all, which I was relieved about – preserving platinum blonde can be tricky, especially when trying to maintain hair health. The instructions suggest leaving it in for only 3 to 5 minutes, but I&#x27;ve left it in for as long as an hour under a shower cap, and have found its results excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner has helped maintain the shine and strength of my hair. There is minimal, but pleasant, fragrance. Fekkai is known for its excellent quality, and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Hubby uses it all up on his beard so I have to order more frequently! Smells great and you can&#x27;t beat Amazon&#x27;s price!</li>
            <li> I love this intense conditioner. Winter is tough on my hair, and then in the summer there&#x27;s chlorine and the sun to dry it out. It doesn&#x27;t take much of this conditioner -- less than a quarter sized dab -- to coat my shoulder length, thick hair. After a couple minutes, I rinse out the conditioner and my hair is noticeably softer -- at the same time, it doesn&#x27;t weigh down my hair. That&#x27;s often a tricky aspect of deep conditioners. I&#x27;ll be using this one once a week to keep my hair healthy and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Wow. My hair feels AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History - my hair is long, blonde (dyed), I live in a REALLY dry place (LA) and I have REALLY hard water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this mask ONCE and the change was immediate. My hair feels stronger, more nourished and so soft!  Definitely keeping this in supply!</li>
            <li> Fekkai never disappoints and this Essential Shea mask keeps up the tradition.  Just super results -  soft, silky, and fluid.  Nice mild floral/herbal scent. Great for dry or burned out hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions are to apply to damp clean hair, wait 3-5 minutes, rinse.  An additional label tip is to wrap in a warm towel during that time.  However, I&#x27;ve found that simply applying, then putting on a shower cap for a few minutes while in the warm shower is easier and simpler, while still producing those super results.</li>
            <li> What a great hair treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Smells wonderful like creamy jasmine.  I applied just a little of it after shampooing.  I suffer from a dry itchy scalp so I rubbed some into my scalp too.  I left it on about a half hour and rinsed well.  Nice.  My hair was sleek and shiny, even coarse white hairs were smooth.  My scalp hasn&#x27;t felt that good for a long time.  No itchiness!  And my hair looked great for days.  About half my hair is fine and dark, the other half white and coarse.  Both are very dry.  This performed well for  my combination hair and I plan to use it regularly.  I think it is intended for occasional use but I can see using it after each shampoo since dryness is a big factor.  Thanks Fekkai!</li>
            <li> Disclaimer:  This review was written by my wife!&lt;br /&gt;Worked great on my hair, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, frizzy, dry curly hair with some damage from hair dye used monthly. I have spent a lot of money to manage it, even $5/oz shampoo, but I rarely saw any differences no matter what product I use for my hair. But with this product, only after using once, my hair became softer, looked healthier, and was easier to manage! While the overall volume of the hair is kept down, it helps to give my hair more bouncy curl - it makes my hair look younger!&lt;br /&gt;I liked the result so much that I tried on my husband&#x27;s straight and thin hair. He didn&#x27;t like it too much, saying it made his hair volume lower and made his hair look thinner. He tried it again using less quantity, but he still didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess this product works great for someone having hair like mine, especially if you want to keep your hair volume down, but not so much for someone who needs volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does not seem to require to be used in a large quantity; a teaspoonful or two seems to be sufficient, even though I have a lot of hair (medium-long hair). If you use about a tea spoon a time, it should be able to be used about 40 - 42 times. Assuming the price about $20, it is about 50 cents a use. I am not sure how you judge the cost, but it is way cheaper than my expensive shampoo that was $2.50 per use, and with this product, I can see the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic jar looks like a glass and looks fancy. However, I personally prefer plastic bottles over jars for hair conditioners. I don&#x27;t like the idea of sticking my fingers in a jar, dripping water in it and making the content a bit dirty. I&#x27;d use a small spoon for a facial cream jar, but using a spoon during the shower while keeping it dry is difficult. Because the hair mask is not too tick nor runny, it would have been perfect to put in a tube, although it might make the packaging look cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, but not for all hair types!recommended, but not for all hair types!</li>
            <li> I have been using Fekkai products for a long while now. I love how soft and smooth my hair feels after use. I often get compliments on the healthiness of my hair. The Essential Shea smells wonderful. I&#x27;ll even apply a pea size amount to my shoulder length hair after showering to keep it from frizzing throughout the dry winter. However, the concept of the jar is annoying. First, conditioner is extremely slippery - just try getting that lid back on once you&#x27;ve gotten it off. Which means that water gets into the product until my hands and the jar are dry and I can close it back up. It&#x27;s very annoying. You would think they would have designed it to have a grip around the top so that you can get a better grasp to close it. Believe me, the lid DOES NOT go on easy at all. For now, I turn the shower off (which is actually not too bad of an idea for water conservation), apply the product, use a towel to put the lid back on and close it back up, turn the water back on after 5 minutes and rinse my hair with cool water. In terms of water conservation, it a great deterrent to using too much water. In terms of ease of use, it&#x27;s frustratingly impossible to close the lid without help. Will I stop using it? Of course not. I&#x27;ll deal with it until it&#x27;s all used up ...then just not purchase the jar again.</li>
            <li> I have dry, frizzy, color-treated hair made worse by daily use of a flatiron, so I&#x27;m always searching for a better deep conditioner to keep it looking healthy and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A small amount of the Fekkai Shea Mask was all that I needed to use to see dramatic results. Less than a teaspoon was sufficient for my short hair. I left the conditioner on for five minutes before rinsing and the result was hair that was shiny, soft, and manageable. The effects of the conditioning lasted almost a week before I needed to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner has a lovely smell and a creamy, buttery feel. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was having to fumble around with a jar in the shower. A jar would be fine if I was washing my hair at the sink, but for the shower I would have preferred a pump bottle or tube.</li>
            <li> This hair mask has a nice creamy texture and a faintly floral smell.  You apply it to wet hair, leaving on for 3 to 5 minutes and rinse off.  It&#x27;s too heavy for me to use daily but I have used it about twice a week and it makes my hair super soft and shiny.  Because I color my hair, I really value a good deep conditioner and this does great for my purposes.  Another thing I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down after it is rinsed off, sometimes heavy conditioners make my hair dull and heavy, and that is not a problem with this deep conditioner.  I have no complaints and love it!</li>
            <li> I like all Fekkai products and am no stranger to them.  Overall I thought this Shae mask did a good job at putting some mositure back into my hair but I would not say that is was amazing, but simply average.  The smell was nice, Jasmine and an &amp;#34;exotic floral&amp;#34; sent.  It was nice and thick, something for me that is a must for a hair mask.  It did NOT weigh my hair down at all.  I found that my hair after I blew dry felt a little bit softer but nothing out of this world amazing.  Overall a great mask and would continue to use until gone.</li>
            <li> The packaging makes this look like a body-moisturizer product but it is for hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, you apply the product to damp hair and let it sit for a period of time between 3 and 10 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent does have notes of jasmine but I would state it as a typical salon-type product scent with some slightly sour jasmine.  I have a lot of shea products including some 100% shea butter and shea has a characteristic smell which I don&#x27;t smell in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe this product does what it advertises.  My hair emerged shiny and soft and very manageable.&lt;br /&gt;I do think I have used some superior products, such as Wen, Ojon and the L&#x27;Occitane line but I would rate this particular shea mask very high in terms of quality and benefit.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using this product. I really didn&#x27;t see how it could be any different than regular conditioner. I was pleasantly surprised. It definitely left my hair feeling soft and silky. I tried it on my daughters hair and it did leave her fair feeling quite greasy. She is a teen though, and her hair is prone to oiliness. Overall, I liked it and would use it again.</li>
            <li> This has been a looong winter here in New England, and the combination of frigid outdoor temperatures and dry indoor heating have taken their toll on my hair.  I have long, color treated hair that I heat style daily, and static electricity has been a major issue, leaving my hair looking dry and flyaway.  This masque is applied to clean, damp hair and rinsed out after 3-5 minutes.  This product is very rich and moisturizing and I’d recommend using it sparingly.  To avoid weighing down the hair I’d concentrate the product from the mid-shaft of the hair thru to the ends (skipping the root area).  If your hair is thin or fine textured you’ll need very little product; thick or coarse textured hair types will want to apply a little more.  The floral scent is very strong when you apply the masque, but after rinsing it’s barely noticeable – just a fresh and clean scent.  I love this stuff!  It leaves my hair soft and manageable with lots of volume and shine and zero static.  Since a little goes a long way, this 7 ounce tub will last a long time.  This is intended as a weekly intense conditioning treatment and I wouldn’t use it as a substitute for a daily conditioner.  I could see this working for almost every hair type except for very fine or thinning hair (it might leave the hair looking too “flat”).  People who are sensitive to fragrance may find the floral scent too intense.  I think anyone with color-treated hair will be pleased with the results; it really makes my rather tired highlights look fresh and glossy and perks up the base color.  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I have thick, dark, coarse, color-treated hair and have been looking for a product that will keep it looking soft and shiny. I believe I may have found it in this conditioner! The conditioner comes in a substantial feeling tub. The packaging looks and feels very elegant. The conditioner has a thick, pudding-like texture. My hair is shoulder length, and I needed to use approximately 2 Tablespoons to fully saturate my hair. I put it in my freshly shampooed, wet hair for 10 minutes and wrapped a warm towel around my head.  This conditioner does have a fairly strong, flowery jasmine smell to it. I wasn’t crazy about the smell. The conditioner rinsed out nice and clean, leaving only a hint of the perfumed smell. My hair looked and felt noticeably softer, smoother and shinier. My hair seemed to take less time to style after using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice deep conditioner for coarse, thick hair. It leaves my hair with a very nice texture and a nice, subtle scent. My only complaint is with the way the product is packaged. It comes in a wide flat jar that isn&#x27;t very easy to handle in the shower. It seems like it would be easier to use if it were in a tube or even just a jar that wasn&#x27;t as big as the width of my palm.</li>
