            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and moisturizers for my hair, but this TAKES THE CAKE!</li>
            <li>the smell is fantastic!!</li>
            <li>Great item, got it cheap</li>
            <li>Smells kind of flowery.</li>

            <li>all nice like.</li>
            <li>Nice curls and waves.</li>
            <li>I used to work for a very popular beauty supply and every month we would get an abundance of free products.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, gentil and soft to the hair</li>

            <li>good smell and wash my hair clean</li>
            <li>Great item cheap when you have free shipping</li>
            <li>I got this one for my younger sister, as her experience, this was really nice product and best conditioner.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt clean the hair so good.</li>
            <li>Once I started using this, when I get out of the shower my hair feels very smooth</li>
            <li>Dove leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable, the smell is amazing and for the price &#x3D; score!!</li>
            <li>It was a great price and large size.</li>
            <li>Everyone has been complimenting me on how healthy my hair looks and that was not the case before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been more sure of a hair product in my life.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair feeling and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I love Dove products.</li>
            <li>I love how it makes my hair look silkier and healthier.</li>
            <li>with shipping and sealed at the top for leakage purposes.</li>
            <li>and she has lots of curls :)</li>
            <li>My hair feels thicker and seems to have more volume.</li>
            <li>i love the shampoo....</li>
            <li>No matter how many raving reviews.</li>
            <li>comes with cap collapsed, needs better cushion.</li>
            <li>Will continue to buy from Amazon every time I need more.</li>
            <li>I have seen so many of the commercials about how these shampoos and conditioners can help strengthen, detangle and defrizz your hair</li>
            <li>and I decide to never pay more than $3.00 for shampoo or conditioner again – thank heavens for Dollarama, huh?</li>
            <li>is a bit more, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>I love the shampoo but it came to me with the lids off and no way to save all of the shampoo</li>
            <li>It gives a healthy look to hair.</li>
            <li>I love all the product by Dove .</li>
            <li>Smells good and just makes my hair feel fresh and</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling lightweight, silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>Smells great and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li>This will always be my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Ok Shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li>It does the trick :-)</li>
            <li>So does because I love the smell of doce conditioner.</li>
            <li>I love Dove conditioner.</li>
            <li>I also love the smell.</li>
            <li>and I feel no frizz anymore :)</li>
            <li>I regularly buy this great product for under $5!</li>
            <li>am so glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li>Love the company &amp; the products.</li>
            <li>It arrived on dated promised as most Prime shipments do.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo to use.</li>
            <li>Great smelling, fresh feeling clean that I like to use.</li>
            <li>Its made my hair soft, and it smells really good!</li>
            <li>and Dove is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>Good clean and fresh smelling</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel so soft with a great neutral smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>a good one at a ​very reasonable cost</li>
            <li>She continuously used more than 3 months and for me price for this item is more worthy.</li>
            <li>Great buy on prime day big bottle for very cheap</li>
            <li>The conditioner allows me to easily comb my hair.</li>
            <li>hair easily breaks</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair smelling great and super soft!!</li>
            <li>I have really fine hair</li>
            <li>I get comments on how my hair looks super healthy, even my split ends.</li>
            <li>The bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li>used this product paired with the Intensive repair shampoo and just after one wash, I can notice a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>This shampoo works great on mine and my daughters hair which are two totally different types.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m sure you could find better if you went salon level and wanted to drop a lot more money, but as far as drugstore brands go, Dove will always be my go-to for hair care.</li>
            <li>My hair feels lighter and tangle free.</li>
            <li>hair feels different in a good way, love the smell</li>
            <li>Rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li>When I was approached with this review, I was excited</li>
            <li>the lather is so rich and creamy that you can  feel that your hair is clean</li>
            <li>and then I have clean hair</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair feeling silky and clean.</li>
            <li>I love how much faster success this has given me!</li>
            <li>This is a pretty decent shampoo, but the real deal is the price (which makes for a great price to quality ratio).</li>
            <li>I am told several times a week that my hair smells good</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White color is good for white hair.</li>
            <li>Amazon had this Shampoo at a good price, especially with the coupon.</li>
            <li>The actual shampoo was good, though.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After the first wash, everything was fine.</li>
            <li>I have pretty fine hair.</li>
            <li>Will be brand loyal going forward</li>
            <li>I have struggled to find the right shampoo and conditioner for my thick hair and this product is the best!</li>
            <li>you can get something better for the price, or would rather spend a little more for a better product.</li>
            <li>but I didn’t want to change my normal routine because I wanted to be able to truly compare this product to others out there.</li>
            <li>This shampoo has made my hair look so much more shiny and not dull like it was.</li>
            <li>Its a good shampoo, but probably you will need to change  it after finishing the bottle to protect your hair because your hair will get dry.</li>
            <li>My daughter has been using this for several months and she really liked it.</li>
            <li>I really decided to try it when we got our hair cut last time and my hair guy was talking about what good shape my daughter&#x27;s hair was in.</li>
            <li>and this seems to cut down on the oily and leaves my hair amazing for days!</li>
            <li>Dove products are always very nice, especially for people with allergies or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>was a nice consistency, lathered well, and left me with a nice clean feeling and a little softness to my hair (not as much as using conditioner, but a mild feeling like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like most shampoos and it has helped tremendously with my frizz problem.</li>
            <li>Since I started using this, I constantly get compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li>Last week I colored my hair with Preference (great product) and Dove Hair Therapy continues to make my hair still feels healthy and thick.</li>
            <li>in the first wash</li>
            <li>I no longer have to use wads of conditioner to try to get my hair soft and smooth and tangle</li>
            <li>Be sure to check out the Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li>It make my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>And it is so much cheaper then buying it from a store!</li>
            <li>Felt pretty ripped off.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li>Not only was it super easy to brush through, my hair did a complete 180 in terms of how smooth it really</li>
            <li>shampoo helps to prevent tangles (although it is much more effective for us when used with a conditioner) and the shampoo is very affordable relative to other moisturizing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using it everyday for 2 weeks, works great so far.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t wait long to recieve, Im satisfied with product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only has this product made my hair much smoother and way more manageable, it’s also has been more than awesomein helping me get through those days where it’s super windy and after 10 minutes of my hair blowing all over the place, it actually goes back down, pretty much tangle free!</li>
            <li>started from the top and ran the brush down the what feels like 80 feet of hair, right to the bottom.</li>
            <li>can think of absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>So much cheaper to buy through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I wish this product, or any Dove product, worked out for me because they have some really dreamy scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It also has times where it wants to be so oily that I don’t want to leave my house because it looks like I haven’t showered in days.</li>
            <li>/&gt;► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► Fast forward to hair brushing time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very slippery on tile</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and no damage to bottle.</li>
            <li>my hair can just be frizzy once and a while which has been very unhelpful</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>I really do rely on these products for my hair routine.  </li>
            <li>ahead and stock up, since buying it online is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li>But his hair looked greasy all day with the pomade in it anyway, so he didn&#x27;t mind as much.</li>
            <li>It really is unbelievable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Packaged really well with additional safety in case of bottle leaking.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Dove, a brand I trust for being gentle</li>
            <li>I love the way Dove&#x27;s hair products make my hair feel lightweight and soft, while never looking oily like some similar product lines.</li>
            <li>Overall, a very economical shampoo and does what it needs to do quite well.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific product and thanks to Amazon the price was right!</li>
            <li>Removes any product (I use hair forming cream from American Crew) in the first wash and leaves hair feeling moist and fresh.</li>
            <li>I still had a whole head of hair left to do but never has a brush slid through my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li>I always have needed more moisturizer than the average person.</li>
            <li>Because I’ve been let down before with many products, I tend to think everything else</li>
            <li>I live in an area where the winters leace my hair really dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;Drying TIme: I don’t blow dry my hair unless I’m in a huge rush and maybe that’s part of the problem as to why my hair is so tangled</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a decent shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many products all the way up to salon products, so much money wasted.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My hair is so soft after shampoos!!</li>
            <li>Good shampoo, but not great shampoo.</li>
            <li>give this two stars because I love the scent of the Dove Shampoo, and my husband, who has fairly thick hair and puts pomade in his hair everyday actually liked this shampoo somewhat.</li>
            <li>With this new product, it’s suppose to make your hair 5 times smoother</li>
            <li>But live and learn.</li>
            <li>This is not the first or the last time I will purchase this product!</li>
            <li>Thanks to the reviews, I did and I am SO happy that I tired this!!</li>
            <li>Not to mention, when I got caught in a bit of a rain storm, my hair wasn’t frizzy and tangled once it dried either.in helping me get through those days where it’s super windy and after 10 minutes of my hair blowing all over the place, it actually goes back down, pretty much tangle free!</li>
            <li>always complains about shampoo and how it messes up her hair (she&#x27;s got curly hair and if she doesn&#x27;t use the right shampoo it leaves her hair dry and</li>
            <li>It’s very wavy/curly, very long, tangled and can get super dry.</li>
            <li>This is by far cheaper than any of those products.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li>My hair is soooo soft</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling so soft and never any frizz.</li>
            <li>I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>you can find a larger bottle at sams club for just a few dollard  more</li>
            <li>Finding a good shampoo and conditioner can be difficult.</li>
            <li>and after I tried to save as much as I could I ended up with less than a full bottle and after explaining that when I got it I have heard nothing back</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly/wavy hair and during the winter, my hair gets crazy frizzy and full of static.</li>
            <li>Mind you, she hasn&#x27;t complained either, but I expected her to be very satisfied with this shampoo</li>
            <li>Dries my hair out, but to be fair, I have VERY dry hair to start with, and VERY hard water.  </li>
            <li>So I put a normal slab of shampoo in my hand, rubbed it in (first thing I noticed, I could have used less) then washed it out.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to try something different due to the increase in price (not that it was ever cheap) and letting my hair go gray.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This was experimented on my hair on days where no other products were used in my hair.</li>
            <li>While my hair still has a tiny, TINY bit of static, I blame the clothing more than my once crazy dry hair.</li>
            <li>I wash my hair everyday, so the second day I started to feel my hair less clean and more stiff.</li>
            <li>I have very long hair that gets dried out/static easily, but those problems disappear when I use this regularly!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m an avid user of dove have been using for years ass with that being said i love the feel of freshness and the fact that it leave little behind weather</li>
            <li>The conditioner deserves a whole other realm of praise.</li>
            <li>On the fourth day, my hair looked greasy and I could barely get a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After washing my hair at 7 in the morning, my hair would look weighed down and very greasy by about 1pm.</li>
            <li>and this really cleans it with out striping it down and drying it out.</li>
            <li>and this dove was all mess up with my whole box</li>
            <li>Just because I’m odd, I quickly put my head under the water for a second just to let the water run down and rub the conditioner</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and moisturizers for my hair, but this TAKES THE CAKE!</li>
            <li> the smell is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Great item, got it cheap</li>
            <li> Smells kind of flowery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I’ll be honest.</li>
            <li> all nice like.</li>
            <li> Nice curls and waves.</li>
            <li> I used to work for a very popular beauty supply and every month we would get an abundance of free products.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, gentil and soft to the hair</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine hair</li>
            <li> good smell and wash my hair clean</li>
            <li> Great item cheap when you have free shipping</li>
            <li> I got this one for my younger sister, as her experience, this was really nice product and best conditioner.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt clean the hair so good.</li>
            <li> Once I started using this, when I get out of the shower my hair feels very smooth</li>
            <li> Dove leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable, the smell is amazing and for the price &#x3D; score!!</li>
            <li> It was a great price and large size.</li>
            <li> Everyone has been complimenting me on how healthy my hair looks and that was not the case before.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been more sure of a hair product in my life.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products.</li>
            <li> I love how it makes my hair look silkier and healthier.</li>
            <li> with shipping and sealed at the top for leakage purposes.</li>
            <li> and she has lots of curls :)</li>
            <li> My hair feels thicker and seems to have more volume.</li>
            <li> i love the shampoo....</li>
            <li> No matter how many raving reviews.</li>
            <li> comes with cap collapsed, needs better cushion.</li>
            <li> Will continue to buy from Amazon every time I need more.</li>
            <li> I have seen so many of the commercials about how these shampoos and conditioners can help strengthen, detangle and defrizz your hair</li>
            <li> and I decide to never pay more than $3.00 for shampoo or conditioner again – thank heavens for Dollarama, huh?</li>
            <li> is a bit more, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo but it came to me with the lids off and no way to save all of the shampoo</li>
            <li> It gives a healthy look to hair.</li>
            <li> I love all the product by Dove .</li>
            <li> Smells good and just makes my hair feel fresh and</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling lightweight, silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> Smells great and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> This will always be my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Ok Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love what it does to my hair.</li>
            <li> It does the trick :-)</li>
            <li> So does because I love the smell of doce conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love Dove conditioner.</li>
            <li> I also love the smell.</li>
            <li> and I feel no frizz anymore :)</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this great product for under $5!</li>
            <li> am so glad that I bought this product.</li>
            <li> Love the company &amp; the products.</li>
            <li> It arrived on dated promised as most Prime shipments do.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo to use.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, fresh feeling clean that I like to use.</li>
            <li> Its made my hair soft, and it smells really good!</li>
            <li> and Dove is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Good clean and fresh smelling</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel so soft with a great neutral smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> a good one at a ​very reasonable cost</li>
            <li> She continuously used more than 3 months and for me price for this item is more worthy.</li>
            <li> Great buy on prime day big bottle for very cheap</li>
            <li> The conditioner allows me to easily comb my hair.</li>
            <li> hair easily breaks</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair smelling great and super soft!!</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair</li>
            <li> I get comments on how my hair looks super healthy, even my split ends.</li>
            <li> The bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> used this product paired with the Intensive repair shampoo and just after one wash, I can notice a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works great on mine and my daughters hair which are two totally different types.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you could find better if you went salon level and wanted to drop a lot more money, but as far as drugstore brands go, Dove will always be my go-to for hair care.</li>
            <li> My hair feels lighter and tangle free.</li>
            <li> hair feels different in a good way, love the smell</li>
            <li> Rich and creamy.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!</li>
            <li> When I was approached with this review, I was excited</li>
            <li> the lather is so rich and creamy that you can  feel that your hair is clean</li>
            <li> and then I have clean hair</li>
            <li> It leaves your hair feeling silky and clean.</li>
            <li> I love how much faster success this has given me!</li>
            <li> This is a pretty decent shampoo, but the real deal is the price (which makes for a great price to quality ratio).</li>
            <li> I am told several times a week that my hair smells good</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White color is good for white hair.</li>
            <li> Amazon had this Shampoo at a good price, especially with the coupon.</li>
            <li> The actual shampoo was good, though.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the first wash, everything was fine.</li>
            <li> I have pretty fine hair.</li>
            <li> Will be brand loyal going forward</li>
            <li> I have struggled to find the right shampoo and conditioner for my thick hair and this product is the best!</li>
            <li> you can get something better for the price, or would rather spend a little more for a better product.</li>
            <li> but I didn’t want to change my normal routine because I wanted to be able to truly compare this product to others out there.</li>
            <li> This shampoo has made my hair look so much more shiny and not dull like it was.</li>
            <li> Its a good shampoo, but probably you will need to change  it after finishing the bottle to protect your hair because your hair will get dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter has been using this for several months and she really liked it.</li>
            <li> I really decided to try it when we got our hair cut last time and my hair guy was talking about what good shape my daughter&#x27;s hair was in.</li>
            <li> and this seems to cut down on the oily and leaves my hair amazing for days!</li>
            <li> Dove products are always very nice, especially for people with allergies or sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> was a nice consistency, lathered well, and left me with a nice clean feeling and a little softness to my hair (not as much as using conditioner, but a mild feeling like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like most shampoos and it has helped tremendously with my frizz problem.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, I constantly get compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  </li>
            <li> Last week I colored my hair with Preference (great product) and Dove Hair Therapy continues to make my hair still feels healthy and thick.</li>
            <li> in the first wash</li>
            <li> I no longer have to use wads of conditioner to try to get my hair soft and smooth and tangle</li>
            <li> Be sure to check out the Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> It make my hair smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> And it is so much cheaper then buying it from a store!</li>
            <li> Felt pretty ripped off.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is good for everyday use.</li>
            <li> Not only was it super easy to brush through, my hair did a complete 180 in terms of how smooth it really</li>
            <li> shampoo helps to prevent tangles (although it is much more effective for us when used with a conditioner) and the shampoo is very affordable relative to other moisturizing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using it everyday for 2 weeks, works great so far.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wait long to recieve, Im satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only has this product made my hair much smoother and way more manageable, it’s also has been more than awesomein helping me get through those days where it’s super windy and after 10 minutes of my hair blowing all over the place, it actually goes back down, pretty much tangle free!</li>
            <li> started from the top and ran the brush down the what feels like 80 feet of hair, right to the bottom.</li>
            <li> can think of absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to buy through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I wish this product, or any Dove product, worked out for me because they have some really dreamy scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also has times where it wants to be so oily that I don’t want to leave my house because it looks like I haven’t showered in days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► Fast forward to hair brushing time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very slippery on tile</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and no damage to bottle.</li>
            <li> my hair can just be frizzy once and a while which has been very unhelpful</li>
            <li> and I really like it.</li>
            <li> I really do rely on these products for my hair routine.  </li>
            <li> ahead and stock up, since buying it online is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> But his hair looked greasy all day with the pomade in it anyway, so he didn&#x27;t mind as much.</li>
            <li> It really is unbelievable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Packaged really well with additional safety in case of bottle leaking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Dove, a brand I trust for being gentle</li>
            <li> I love the way Dove&#x27;s hair products make my hair feel lightweight and soft, while never looking oily like some similar product lines.</li>
            <li> Overall, a very economical shampoo and does what it needs to do quite well.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product and thanks to Amazon the price was right!</li>
            <li> Removes any product (I use hair forming cream from American Crew) in the first wash and leaves hair feeling moist and fresh.</li>
            <li> I still had a whole head of hair left to do but never has a brush slid through my hair so quickly.</li>
            <li> I always have needed more moisturizer than the average person.</li>
            <li> Because I’ve been let down before with many products, I tend to think everything else</li>
            <li> I live in an area where the winters leace my hair really dry.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;Drying TIme: I don’t blow dry my hair unless I’m in a huge rush and maybe that’s part of the problem as to why my hair is so tangled</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a decent shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many products all the way up to salon products, so much money wasted.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft after shampoos!!</li>
            <li> Good shampoo, but not great shampoo.</li>
            <li> give this two stars because I love the scent of the Dove Shampoo, and my husband, who has fairly thick hair and puts pomade in his hair everyday actually liked this shampoo somewhat.</li>
            <li> With this new product, it’s suppose to make your hair 5 times smoother</li>
            <li> But live and learn.</li>
            <li> This is not the first or the last time I will purchase this product!</li>
            <li> Thanks to the reviews, I did and I am SO happy that I tired this!!</li>
            <li> Not to mention, when I got caught in a bit of a rain storm, my hair wasn’t frizzy and tangled once it dried either.in helping me get through those days where it’s super windy and after 10 minutes of my hair blowing all over the place, it actually goes back down, pretty much tangle free!</li>
            <li> always complains about shampoo and how it messes up her hair (she&#x27;s got curly hair and if she doesn&#x27;t use the right shampoo it leaves her hair dry and</li>
            <li> It’s very wavy/curly, very long, tangled and can get super dry.</li>
            <li> This is by far cheaper than any of those products.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and luxurious.</li>
            <li> My hair is soooo soft</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling so soft and never any frizz.</li>
            <li> I have naturally oily hair</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> you can find a larger bottle at sams club for just a few dollard  more</li>
            <li> Finding a good shampoo and conditioner can be difficult.</li>
            <li> and after I tried to save as much as I could I ended up with less than a full bottle and after explaining that when I got it I have heard nothing back</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly/wavy hair and during the winter, my hair gets crazy frizzy and full of static.</li>
            <li> Mind you, she hasn&#x27;t complained either, but I expected her to be very satisfied with this shampoo</li>
            <li> Dries my hair out, but to be fair, I have VERY dry hair to start with, and VERY hard water.  </li>
            <li> So I put a normal slab of shampoo in my hand, rubbed it in (first thing I noticed, I could have used less) then washed it out.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to try something different due to the increase in price (not that it was ever cheap) and letting my hair go gray.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This was experimented on my hair on days where no other products were used in my hair.</li>
            <li> While my hair still has a tiny, TINY bit of static, I blame the clothing more than my once crazy dry hair.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair everyday, so the second day I started to feel my hair less clean and more stiff.</li>
            <li> I have very long hair that gets dried out/static easily, but those problems disappear when I use this regularly!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m an avid user of dove have been using for years ass with that being said i love the feel of freshness and the fact that it leave little behind weather</li>
            <li> The conditioner deserves a whole other realm of praise.</li>
            <li> On the fourth day, my hair looked greasy and I could barely get a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After washing my hair at 7 in the morning, my hair would look weighed down and very greasy by about 1pm.</li>
            <li> and this really cleans it with out striping it down and drying it out.</li>
            <li> and this dove was all mess up with my whole box</li>
            <li> Just because I’m odd, I quickly put my head under the water for a second just to let the water run down and rub the conditioner</li>
            <li> , I just think that it hits a strange middle ground.</li>
            <li> and my hair brush is no longer full of broken</li>
            <li> It cleans well, but even though it says &amp;#34;moisturizing,&amp;#34; it left my hair a bit dry.  </li>
            <li> for a bottle was expensive in my book, especially that the bottles seemed kind of small (not small per say, but small for</li>
            <li> I had no idea it was getting so long.</li>
            <li> It’s such a pain that after I get out of the shower and brush scrape through my hair and half of it is in the brush, I just put it up in a pony tail and leave it until the next day</li>
            <li> Overall, my hair is softer and less frizzy than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way and a bottle should last you for quite some time.</li>
            <li> I did have a few snags here and there because my hair was a complete ball of a tangled mess before I washed it</li>
            <li> The price is beyond reasonable, it&#x27;s almost criminal; the quality of it lacks words.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hearbreaking to think of all the money spent on products that severely shortfell on their promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I personally like the results of a clarifying shampoo and a heavy conditioner combo of Garnier and Herbal Essence.</li>
            <li> I did this for a few months and when I finally did try to do something with my hair, it was like a foot longer!</li>
            <li> Once my hair was completely dried, I brushed through it and it was a synch.</li>
            <li> I purchased for a girl in the military.</li>
            <li> I have long hair down to my waist and it is a bit damaged.</li>
            <li> I do recommend using a clarifying shampoo once a week though due to build-up.</li>
            <li> : I read the instructions very carefully, just in case there is anything else I need to ensure I do while I’m shampooing and conditioning</li>
            <li> I thought it was maybe because I didn&#x27;t take the time to blow dry my hair in the morning, but that turned out to make my hair just a little frizzy towards the ends in comparison to my slicked down grease ball roots in the afternoon.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo after giving birth because I noticed that my hair dried out, which is pretty common after you have your baby for your hair to get dry and thin out.</li>
            <li> so I have been using anti-breakage shampoos for as long as I can remember with very little satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I also no longer have an itchy scalp like I did with my previous shampoo.</li>
            <li> There is a slight smell but is not overbearing or flowery.</li>
            <li> u are washing in cold or hot water</li>
            <li> had to wash every single thing i ordered some of them is busted open very sad with my last package</li>
            <li> I still have bounce also, my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down or oily at all!</li>
            <li> It’s not cheap to buy these products</li>
            <li> Not to mention, when I got caught in a bit of a rain storm, my hair wasn’t frizzy and tangled once it dried either.</li>
            <li> so I guess I have to just eat the cost of the wasted shampoo</li>
            <li> so please let my wasted money help you from wasting your money.</li>
            <li> Hydrates the hair and scalp and repaired my hair from using a harsh clariol shampoo.</li>
            <li> The moisturizing can be felt in a few days.</li>
            <li> I am so relieved that I finally have a product I can stand behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After the shampoo rinse, I put a small amount of conditioner in my hand and put it on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed with its results.</li>
            <li> now I know that this is what my hair was missing!</li>
            <li> I usually use Herbal Essence but lately it has made my head itch and is drying out my hair.</li>
            <li> Before this shampoo, my hair was dull and lifeless.</li>
            <li> product works so well that my hair is hardly breaking now</li>
            <li> But lately it seems like it has been tangling my hair to the point that i can not get a brush through my hair without being in pain.</li>
            <li> shampoo is so thick that you will think you have the conditioner in your hand by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> (and I mean SUPPLE) hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;-Soft</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it is a bad price overall</li>
            <li> ( I find it creepy ppl are smelling my hair but at least its a compliment).</li>
            <li> Received this broken and spilled.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend started using it because it helps tame his crazy hair.</li>
            <li> Overall a terrible look.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> so when they don’t work, I’m mad</li>
            <li> It was very sad got my package ordered a lot of stuff</li>
            <li> and I bought this moisturizing shampoo as recommended by her hair stylist to prevent painful</li>
            <li> Hate the smell!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great shampoo. Leaves hair looking great</li>
            <li> I really love this shampoo! I usually use Herbal Essence but lately it has made my head itch and is drying out my hair. I found a great deal on this Dove shampoo on here, so I decided to give it a try. I am really impressed with it. I have long hair down to my waist and it is a bit damaged. This shampoo has made my hair look so much more shiny and not dull like it was. Everyone has been complimenting me on how healthy my hair looks and that was not the case before. I also no longer have an itchy scalp like I did with my previous shampoo. I a now a Dove fan!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been more sure of a hair product in my life. Usually good products come with a hefty price tag, but this is just perfect all around. The price is beyond reasonable, it&#x27;s almost criminal; the quality of it lacks words. It&#x27;s hearbreaking to think of all the money spent on products that severely shortfell on their promises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Supple (and I mean SUPPLE) hair texture.&lt;br /&gt;-Soft results, leaves hair feeling silky as hell.&lt;br /&gt;-No frizz. I repeat: NO FRIZZ.&lt;br /&gt;-Feels heathier. I just got my split ends trimmed, but still.&lt;br /&gt;-Smell: beautiful. It&#x27;s Dove.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I can think of absolutely nothing. Do your self and your wallet a favor and skip the pricey bunk and get yourself some Dove.</li>
            <li> great product for the price. you can find a larger bottle at sams club for just a few dollard  more</li>
            <li> It was very sad got my package ordered a lot of stuff and this dove was all mess up with my whole box had to wash every single thing i ordered some of them is busted open very sad with my last package</li>
            <li> Feel like I&#x27;m at the salon. Rich and creamy.  Leaves my hair feeling and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Just what we needed.  Shipping took a while but oh well</li>
            <li> Good product for a great price.</li>
            <li> So much cheaper to buy through Amazon. I love Dove products. I am told several times a week that my hair smells good ( I find it creepy ppl are smelling my hair but at least its a compliment).</li>
            <li> Great product. I recommend it to both men and women</li>
            <li> Its shampoo does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Since I started using this, I constantly get compliments on how healthy my hair looks.  I love it to bits and pieces and it smells great.  Even my boyfriend started using it because it helps tame his crazy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was so damaged from perms and colors. This product works great. I love how it makes my hair look silkier and healthier. Last week I colored my hair with Preference (great product) and Dove Hair Therapy continues to make my hair still feels healthy and thick.</li>
            <li> great amount for price</li>
            <li> Great buy on prime day big bottle for very cheap</li>
            <li> This is a terrific product and thanks to Amazon the price was right! No probs. with shipping and sealed at the top for leakage purposes. Great job Amazon! A. Boz.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products! This shampoo works great on mine and my daughters hair which are two totally different types.  Mine being on the oily side and she has lots of curls :) This is not the first or the last time I will purchase this product!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very fine hair and I bought this moisturizing shampoo as recommended by her hair stylist to prevent painful tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo helps to prevent tangles (although it is much more effective for us when used with a conditioner) and the shampoo is very affordable relative to other moisturizing shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will definitely buy this shampoo again in the future.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money! I have very long hair that gets dried out/static easily, but those problems disappear when I use this regularly! My hair feels thicker and seems to have more volume. Won&#x27;t be switching shampoos any time soon!</li>
            <li> i love the shampoo....wonderful fresh fragrance!!</li>
            <li> Finding a good shampoo and conditioner can be difficult. You have to try a LOT before you can find something that works for you. No matter how many raving reviews. I can personally say that I have tried hundreds of different hair products. I used to work for a very popular beauty supply and every month we would get an abundance of free products. This is by far cheaper than any of those products. And I prefer this! It doesn&#x27;t dry my hair out like most shampoos and it has helped tremendously with my frizz problem. A little goes a very long way and a bottle should last you for quite some time.</li>
            <li> it makes my hair softer and shiner. I love its smell too!</li>
            <li> Good product, I will purchase again</li>
            <li> comes with cap collapsed, needs better cushion.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years</li>
            <li> This shampoo smells great and provides a lot of moisture. I do recommend using a clarifying shampoo once a week though due to build-up.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo!!  Will continue to buy from Amazon every time I need more.</li>
            <li> I wish this product, or any Dove product, worked out for me because they have some really dreamy scents!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the first wash, everything was fine. I wash my hair everyday, so the second day I started to feel my hair less clean and more stiff. On the third day, my hair looked greasy. On the fourth day, my hair looked greasy and I could barely get a comb through it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was experimented on my hair on days where no other products were used in my hair. This leads me to believe that this shampoo and conditioner duo, like all Dove shampoos and conditioners do to me, left product build up within my tresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good look, but to each their own. I personally like the results of a clarifying shampoo and a heavy conditioner combo of Garnier and Herbal Essence. Works wonders for me, but definitely not Dove.</li>
            <li> Love this product and a great price!</li>
            <li> Smells kind of flowery.</li>
            <li> My hair isn’t the bes when it comes to managing it in any way shape or form. It’s very wavy/curly, very long, tangled and can get super dry. It also has times where it wants to be so oily that I don’t want to leave my house because it looks like I haven’t showered in days. It’s such a pain that after I get out of the shower and brush scrape through my hair and half of it is in the brush, I just put it up in a pony tail and leave it until the next day I take a shower. I did this for a few months and when I finally did try to do something with my hair, it was like a foot longer! I had no idea it was getting so long.I have seen so many of the commercials about how these shampoos and conditioners can help strengthen, detangle and defrizz your hair but I have never had the luxury of these things doing the job they said they would. It’s not cheap to buy these products so when they don’t work, I’m mad and I decide to never pay more than $3.00 for shampoo or conditioner again – thank heavens for Dollarama, huh? I go through 4 bottles of conditioner to every one bottle of shampoo - that gets expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll be honest. When I was approached with this review, I was excited butI figured it would be just the same as the others. They claim to do something they won’t. With this new product, it’s suppose to make your hair 5 times smoother* in the first wash (*when using shampoo and conditioner system vs non-conditioning shampoo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TEST DAY: I read the instructions very carefully, just in case there is anything else I need to ensure I do while I’m shampooing and conditioning like, you know, let it stand for 30 minutes before you rinse out the shampoo then another 30 minute wait for the conditioner. So I put a normal slab of shampoo in my hand, rubbed it in (first thing I noticed, I could have used less) then washed it out. Mmmm smelled good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the shampoo rinse, I put a small amount of conditioner in my hand and put it on the ends of my hair. I then laughed because the rest of the conditioner in my hand (the size of a toonie) was meant for the rest of my head. It worked. It actually lathered through my hair and covered everything. Amazing! Just because I’m odd, I quickly put my head under the water for a second just to let the water run down and rub the conditioner is a bit more, just in case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► ► ► ► ► ► ► ► Fast forward to hair brushing time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started from the top and ran the brush down the what feels like 80 feet of hair, right to the bottom. I was impressed. I still had a whole head of hair left to do but never has a brush slid through my hair so quickly. I did have a few snags here and there because my hair was a complete ball of a tangled mess before I washed it so I gave this product the benefit of the doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Drying TIme: I don’t blow dry my hair unless I’m in a huge rush and maybe that’s part of the problem as to why my hair is so tangled but I didn’t want to change my normal routine because I wanted to be able to truly compare this product to others out there. Once my hair was completely dried, I brushed through it and it was a synch. Not only was it super easy to brush through, my hair did a complete 180 in terms of how smooth it really was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sceptic in me: Because I’ve been let down before with many products, I tend to think everything else out there is just a lie and no product is ever how they say it is, I thought maybe it was just by chance this happened so I continued for the next 5 days and it was the same experience I had at day 5 that I had at day 1, 2, 3 and 4. And the best part about it….I STILL have the same bottle of shampoo and conditioner that I started with! I no longer have to use wads of conditioner to try to get my hair soft and smooth and tangle free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only has this product made my hair much smoother and way more manageable, it’s also has been more than awesomein helping me get through those days where it’s super windy and after 10 minutes of my hair blowing all over the place, it actually goes back down, pretty much tangle free! Not to mention, when I got caught in a bit of a rain storm, my hair wasn’t frizzy and tangled once it dried either.in helping me get through those days where it’s super windy and after 10 minutes of my hair blowing all over the place, it actually goes back down, pretty much tangle free!

            <li> This is a pretty decent shampoo, but the real deal is the price (which makes for a great price to quality ratio).</li>
            <li> I love the way Dove&#x27;s hair products make my hair feel lightweight and soft, while never looking oily like some similar product lines. I get comments on how my hair looks super healthy, even my split ends. Dove obviously can&#x27;t &amp;#34;fix&amp;#34; them, but now people don&#x27;t even notice them.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sure you could find better if you went salon level and wanted to drop a lot more money, but as far as drugstore brands go, Dove will always be my go-to for hair care.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using suave professionals for years. But lately it seems like it has been tangling my hair to the point that i can not get a brush through my hair without being in pain. I do use alot of conditioner but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be helping. After one use of this shampoo i can already feel a difference. My hair feels lighter and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. Its made my hair soft, and it smells really good! Its helping my damaged ends. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> Dove is always the best. good smell and wash my hair clean</li>
            <li> Smells good and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> a good one at a ​very reasonable cost</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m an avid user of dove have been using for years ass with that being said i love the feel of freshness and the fact that it leave little behind weather u are washing in cold or hot water it gives the same result</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price.  Be sure to check out the Dove Damage Therapy Daily Moisture Conditioner as well.</li>
            <li> Great seller aarrived safely perfect  no damage Awesome shampoo can&#x27;t beat the price Thank you</li>
            <li> Dove leaves my hair feeling soft and manageable, the smell is amazing and for the price &#x3D; score!!</li>
            <li> Love it!! My hair is so soft after shampoos!!</li>
            <li> I love the shampoo but it came to me with the lids off and no way to save all of the shampoo so I paid for 2 bottles and after I tried to save as much as I could I ended up with less than a full bottle and after explaining that when I got it I have heard nothing back so I guess I have to just eat the cost of the wasted shampoo so please let my wasted money help you from wasting your money.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a great shampoo! It makes my hair feel so soft with a great neutral smell.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, especially if you have to deal with humid climates.&lt;br /&gt;Nice price too!</li>
            <li> Very slippery on tile</li>
            <li> works well and doesn&#x27;t leave hair greasy</li>
            <li> Makes my wife&#x27;s hair even more beautiful!</li>
            <li> The conditioner is good for everyday use. It gives a healthy look to hair.</li>
            <li> This is basically a miracle worker. It makes my hair feel soft and luxurious. It brings my hair to life! I can&#x27;t recommend this enough.</li>
            <li> Using it everyday for 2 weeks, works great so far. Removes any product (I use hair forming cream from American Crew) in the first wash and leaves hair feeling moist and fresh. I&#x27;ll update with a follow-up when the bottle finishes about how it changed my hair + any effects from not using it over a couple days.</li>
            <li> I love all the product by Dove . They smell so great.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo and I put it in my hair and rinse it out and then I have clean hair</li>
            <li> Good value. Came on time.</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo salon quality at a fraction of the cost. Hydrates the hair and scalp and repaired my hair from using a harsh clariol shampoo. Smells good and just makes my hair feel fresh and all nice like. I look forward to using it and all Dove products they make good s***.</li>
            <li> I got this for my beau and he says he likes it.</li>
            <li> hair feels different in a good way, love the smell</li>
            <li> Awesome shampoo. Excellent quality.  Leaves hair feeling lightweight, silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> Excellent shampoo. Smells great and lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t wait long to recieve, Im satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> This will always be my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Ok Shampoo. Will not reorder.</li>
            <li> Great item cheap when you have free shipping</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. Have bought this before,and will continue to buy. Shipping was fast and no damage to bottle.</li>
            <li> WI&#x27;ll never go back to another shampoo!  My hair is soooo soft</li>
            <li> Excellent product, gentil and soft to the hair</li>
            <li> My only issue with this is that it&#x27;s not sulfate free./</li>
            <li> Been using it for about a year. Love what it does to my hair. But now I&#x27;ve become allergic to it, with scabby, itchy spots on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White color is good for white hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s shampoo. It does the trick :-)</li>
            <li> Smells like Nair hair removal lotion! Hate the smell!!! So does because I love the smell of doce conditioner.</li>
            <li> Smells great and I can feel a difference in my hair after 2 to 3 washes</li>
            <li> Solid shampoo for day-to-day use. Overall, a very economical shampoo and does what it needs to do quite well. The moisturizing can be felt in a few days.</li>
            <li> very effective, love the smell</li>
            <li> I purchased this from Amazon. Because of the great price. I love Dove conditioner. It leaves my hair feeling so soft and never any frizz. I also love the smell. My hair feels and smells like it was just washed all day.</li>
            <li> I purchased for a girl in the military. She asked for Dove. It was a great price and large size.</li>
            <li> Great smelling, fresh feeling clean that I like to use. Big bottle so last a while. Goes great with it&#x27;s Conditioner</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have damaged hair... my hair can just be frizzy once and a while which has been very unhelpful cause I&#x27;ve been trying to grow it longer. Once I started using this, when I get out of the shower my hair feels very smooth and I feel no frizz anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;My hair seems to be growing at a faster pace to because when I brush it I feel the roots... I love how much faster success this has given me!</li>
            <li> I got this one for my younger sister, as her experience, this was really nice product and best conditioner. She continuously used more than 3 months and for me price for this item is more worthy. Only Amazon provide cheapest Rate !</li>
            <li> Its a good shampoo, but probably you will need to change  it after finishing the bottle to protect your hair because your hair will get dry.</li>
            <li> I have to start by saying I have used Pureology for years. I finally decided to try something different due to the increase in price (not that it was ever cheap) and letting my hair go gray. My daughter has been using this for several months and she really liked it. I really decided to try it when we got our hair cut last time and my hair guy was talking about what good shape my daughter&#x27;s hair was in. I told him it was Dove and his mouth hit the floor. So I have been using for about one week and I really like it. There is a slight smell but is not overbearing or flowery. The conditioner allows me to easily comb my hair. Overall, my hair is softer and less frizzy than it has ever been. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great price. i can use it daily and does not make my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> Dries my hair out, but to be fair, I have VERY dry hair to start with, and VERY hard water.  I always have needed more moisturizer than the average person.</li>
            <li> Dove products are always very nice, especially for people with allergies or sensitive skin.  Amazon had this Shampoo at a good price, especially with the coupon.</li>
            <li> This was recommended in a product testing article in Prevention magazine.  It cleans well, but even though it says &amp;#34;moisturizing,&amp;#34; it left my hair a bit dry.  The bottle is HUGE.</li>
            <li> Great value and excellent product. I bought it for the guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years now and it still works like a charm. It leaves your hair feeling silky and clean. The conditioner deserves a whole other realm of praise. I really do rely on these products for my hair routine.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> I regularly buy this great product for under $5! Can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
            <li> Even with the tax, the price cannot be beat.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, same item as what you can get everywhere else they sell shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Plan ahead and stock up, since buying it online is so much cheaper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this a 3.5 if I could.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a couple for my wife as part of a practical mother&#x27;s day present.&lt;br /&gt;She always complains about shampoo and how it messes up her hair (she&#x27;s got curly hair and if she doesn&#x27;t use the right shampoo it leaves her hair dry and tangled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall she loves Dove products. I thought these would be a knock out of the park.&lt;br /&gt;Well, they are a good product, but she has not raved about them as I thought she would. Mind you, she hasn&#x27;t complained either, but I expected her to be very satisfied with this shampoo and that didn&#x27;t happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it twice myself to see what it was like (shhh, don&#x27;t tell her because her shampoo is strictly off limits to me and the kids).&lt;br /&gt;It was shampoo. Good shampoo, but not great shampoo. But that is also the man in me talking. I&#x27;m happy with Suave.&lt;br /&gt;It was a nice consistency, lathered well, and left me with a nice clean feeling and a little softness to my hair (not as much as using conditioner, but a mild feeling like that).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my take away:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely a decent shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;$5 for a bottle was expensive in my book, especially that the bottles seemed kind of small (not small per say, but small for a $5 bottle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it is a bad price overall, I just think that it hits a strange middle ground. If you don&#x27;t care (like me) you can get shampoo cheaper. If you do care (like my wife) you can get something better for the price, or would rather spend a little more for a better product.</li>
            <li> Can always count on Dove Shampoo :D</li>
            <li> Its very good  it leaves your hair  feeling good  the lather is so rich and creamy that you can  feel that your hair is clean</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo after giving birth because I noticed that my hair dried out, which is pretty common after you have your baby for your hair to get dry and thin out. I was pretty disappointed with its results. I have pretty fine hair. After washing my hair at 7 in the morning, my hair would look weighed down and very greasy by about 1pm. I thought it was maybe because I didn&#x27;t take the time to blow dry my hair in the morning, but that turned out to make my hair just a little frizzy towards the ends in comparison to my slicked down grease ball roots in the afternoon. Overall a terrible look.&lt;br /&gt;I give this two stars because I love the scent of the Dove Shampoo, and my husband, who has fairly thick hair and puts pomade in his hair everyday actually liked this shampoo somewhat. But his hair looked greasy all day with the pomade in it anyway, so he didn&#x27;t mind as much. He would have the same grease look to his hair in the afternoon on weekends he doesn&#x27;t do his hair though.</li>
            <li> I have struggled to find the right shampoo and conditioner for my thick hair and this product is the best! It make my hair smooth and soft. I have naturally oily hair and this seems to cut down on the oily and leaves my hair amazing for days!</li>
            <li> I have really fine hair and this really cleans it with out striping it down and drying it out.</li>
            <li> It is possible with this Dove Shampoo. Before this shampoo, my hair was dull and lifeless. Now it feels and looks great. It really is unbelievable.&lt;br /&gt;My hair easily breaks so I have been using anti-breakage shampoos for as long as I can remember with very little satisfaction.&lt;br /&gt;This product works so well that my hair is hardly breaking now and my hair brush is no longer full of broken hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have only washed my hair 2X with this shampoo and my hair fall has dropped dramatically.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is so thick that you will think you have the conditioner in your hand by mistake.&lt;br /&gt;I am so glad that I bought this product.I just wish that I had tried it sooner. Smells great as well!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo for protecting my hair against heat and pollution</li>
            <li> Good value but it doesnt clean the hair so good.</li>
            <li> Love this brand! Leaves my hair smelling great and super soft!!</li>
            <li> Love the company &amp; the products. The advertising is spot on. For this reason alone I tried the products. I am pleased I have a great product to stand by.</li>
            <li> Packaged really well with additional safety in case of bottle leaking. It arrived on dated promised as most Prime shipments do. Price was terrific.</li>
            <li> Great item, got it cheap and Dove is pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> Another good Dove product. Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Excellent - works well and I&#x27;m happy.  Will be brand loyal going forward</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo to use. Glad to get it on subscribe and save!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! And it is so much cheaper then buying it from a store!</li>
            <li> Good clean and fresh smelling</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> Still wanting to use.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and excellent seller, from Venezuela recommend it!</li>
            <li> Dove has a great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos and moisturizers for my hair, but this TAKES THE CAKE! I have naturally curly/wavy hair and during the winter, my hair gets crazy frizzy and full of static. I live in an area where the winters leace my hair really dry.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product paired with the Intensive repair shampoo and just after one wash, I can notice a HUGE difference. While my hair still has a tiny, TINY bit of static, I blame the clothing more than my once crazy dry hair. I never thought that I would need an &amp;#34;damage therapy&amp;#34; product, but now I know that this is what my hair was missing! I still have bounce also, my hair isn&#x27;t weighed down or oily at all! Nice curls and waves. I will definitely be buying this product from now on! I am so relieved that I finally have a product I can stand behind. I&#x27;ve tried so many products all the way up to salon products, so much money wasted. I wish I would have tried this before! But live and learn. And learn I did. Try this product! Thanks to the reviews, I did and I am SO happy that I tired this!! Oh... and the smell... the smell is fantastic!!</li>
            <li> GREAT SHAMPOOO I LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Dove, a brand I trust for being gentle and it was inexpensive with the Subscribe and Save, which is why I purchase it.</li>
            <li> Received this broken and spilled. Still using what was left. Felt pretty ripped off. The actual shampoo was good, though.</li>
