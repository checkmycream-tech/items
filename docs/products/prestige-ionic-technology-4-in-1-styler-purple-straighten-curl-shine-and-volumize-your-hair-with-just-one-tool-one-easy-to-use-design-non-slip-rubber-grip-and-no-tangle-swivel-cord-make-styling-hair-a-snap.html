            <li>Perfect.</li>

            <li>I tried hers and was so impressed I bought one for myself and 2 friends.</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s the best part-With hair like mine it used to take me 45 minutes to make it fabulous-now it takes 10 minutes!  </li>
            <li>and it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Great product and great price!</li>
            <li>but if you play around with it you will see incredible results.</li>

            <li>I had (and LOVED)</li>
            <li>all is good</li>
            <li>I still have to play with it more to see how much more curl I can get from this product!!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it bought it!</li>
            <li>have come to love this styler!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like it quite as well as the Perfecter because it does not slide through the hair quite as nicely.</li>
            <li>so nice to have a styler that smooths and lifts</li>
            <li>A friend who&#x27;s a model was using this and her hair was gorgeous and healthy-</li>
            <li>The good news is, it has a two year warranty and they will replace it for free.</li>
            <li>When I 1st received this, I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it.  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair</li>
            <li>so it was great to have something that actually worked anit curls great to iI</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a good curl from this product, however it gives my hair a beautiful shine when I use it as a brush and curls the end of my long hair under nicely.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Love the way it curls.</li>
            <li>Love what this product does....</li>
            <li>This one was much better priced.</li>
            <li>They love it too.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I just wish I had bought more</li>
            <li>an sell the other on craigslist or something :D</li>
            <li>This product does curl your hair, but I think it would work better on longer hair, since I have short hair, but it does give curl &amp; lift to the top of my head where I wanted it to be lifted ,&amp; curled at!!  </li>
            <li>If you just want to add volume and &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; it works just fine.</li>
            <li>...can make hair curly or smooth.  </li>
            <li>First curling brush I&#x27;ve ever used and beats using a blow dryer/round brush!!</li>
            <li>Other wise am satisfied</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s doing it right!  </li>
            <li>and I was wanting body on top crown but straight on sides</li>
            <li>and it is cool to the touch.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it you can do it by wrapping your hand around the brush part and twirling it.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky because my model friend is from the south</li>
            <li>what you do&amp;#34; and gave me all the quick tips.</li>
            <li>/&gt;One of my friends has super curly, ringletty hair and she damaged it blowing it out.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed on occasion, when plugging in, the light blinks fast &amp; doesn&#x27;t heat up.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I kept it is because of the nice shine I get when I use it.</li>
            <li>The only reason I kept it is because of the nice shine I get when I use it.</li>
            <li>might work for someone who has easy to curl hair or who wants straight hair</li>
            <li>Very much like this curling iron.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I actually bought this to give my thinning hair more volume and body where my hair is shortest and thinning on top.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
            <li>I really like it!  </li>
            <li>Really like this product!  </li>
            <li>and first I do a &amp;#</li>
            <li>one time, then, I section it off and take more time playing with wand getting different effects.</li>
            <li>She did say it works even faster if you put a balm product in first.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s also SILENT which I love</li>
            <li>Kinky, some-what frizzy is probably a better description and the back of my hair falls well below my shoulders, shorter on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It does get hot, but you can still touch the barrel of the brush as long as you do not touch the metal barrel part of the brush, so stays cool to the touch, but still hot on the hair to get the correct curl from the ionic brush!!</li>
            <li>This thing works great my only complaint is its easy to accidentally turn off while using.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got sooo many curling irons, flat irons and many other hot curling tools and this styler</li>
            <li>she was worried but now LOVES how soft it makes her hair and how quickly it straightens her curls without damaging her hair.</li>
            <li>The Barrel is to large.  </li>
            <li>I have short fine hair</li>
            <li>but everywhere else it does nothing much really</li>
            <li>That makes is so much easier to curl my hair.</li>
            <li>So I have it packed and ready to return.</li>
            <li>You have to have tension the whole time.</li>
            <li>#34;don&#x27;t get greedy&amp;#34; which means don&#x27;t take too much hair at once-if you do it might get stuck</li>
            <li>It is gentle on your hair; gets the job done and you can handle the rod/teeth as you curl and straighten.</li>
            <li>Used to have 3x as much as I do now, but getting on up there in age is taking care of that.  </li>
            <li>I was so excited because my sister had wanted something similar for $100</li>
            <li>Love the function of this product-just wish there was more tension between the 2 heat settings---they are so easy to slide from one next to the other that sometimes I only want low but realize I am on the high heat setting.</li>
            <li>hair is not thin, not thick.  </li>
            <li>All of a sudden, I find myself reaching for this instead of any other hair tools I have, and I&#x27;ve got so many!  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve shown it to two more friends who have long hair (you&#x27;ll do the same when you get one!)</li>
            <li>dose not get hot enough to work</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight, short hair, limp as a rag.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering my second one because I forgot and left the first one on for 3 hours, so one of the spikey things came unglued.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and all I can say is they didn&#x27;t have the right technique when they used it.</li>
            <li>I do use only the high setting</li>
            <li>Now it only takes about 5 minutes to complete my style from a blow dried state and it leaves my chemically treated hair, smooth and shiny without the use of any leave in product.  </li>
            <li>The heat on high is not hot enough to do a decent job.</li>
            <li>Had had a previous curler so was aware that they can be temperamental about turning on.  </li>
            <li>I have a serious neck injury and it is light weight</li>

            <li> May work on long hair but not short.</li>
            <li> I recommend it to be used with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> So so - difficult to curl with this product, even though they say you can, and so easy to get your hair tangled.  </li>
            <li> I found that the &amp;#34;ionic action&amp;#34; just makes my hair seem greasy rather than shiny which is not much help since I just want to fluff up my day old style after sleeping on it all night.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed to tame a new perm.  </li>
            <li> This one is also a little sensitive but does work.</li>
            <li> Other than the little hot spot created by the missing spikey thing, it still works like a charm after a couple of years.</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair with very tight natural curls.</li>
            <li> So when you&#x27;re curling down or up or away you have to pull it away from your head just enough to have it be taut.</li>
            <li> However this is the third one I have purchased due to the breakage of the bristles in less than a year.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
            <li> Under the impression it was used on wet hair.</li>
            <li> I used it while my hair was wet</li>
            <li> My hair has no definition - not curly, not straight.  </li>
            <li> I have long, thick, wavy, blonde hair and</li>
            <li> I was disappointed I can&#x27;t get more beachy waves from it.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed I can&#x27;t get more beachy waves from it.</li>
            <li> this review helps some other lady decide.</li>
            <li> Do not burn my neck or hands as I did with other curling irons.</li>
            <li> I had to order this one because I dropped the other one and some of the teeth came out.</li>
            <li> Not worth a penny.  </li>
            <li> Not like a curling iron or whatever that would fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;You can get A LOT of volume or straighten it down sleekly depending on which direction and how you do it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> and after I sleep on it it becomes silkier and tame.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this styler brush that is supposed to be for all hair lengths because the barrel is way too big for those with short hair.  </li>
            <li> usually end up burning my hands</li>
            <li> - I was having the problem of hitting the &#x27;off&#x27; switch, but I placed a small piece of tape over it and no more problems.  </li>
            <li> the plus side, you can put your hands on the hard plastic bristles and not get burned and you can try to hold your hair section around the barrel somewhat.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s using the highest setting, which, per instructions, is not for thin or damaged hair types.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it warms up when it chooses and not as it should.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the teeth are falling out on me</li>
            <li> I am disappointed how it works on my hair.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Did not like product. Not as described. May work on long hair but not short.</li>
            <li> STILL TESTING IT. NEED TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT.</li>
            <li> Does not do what it is advertised to do.  Not worth a penny.  Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Did not notice it does not have automatic shut off.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  I owned 1 before, but after a year, the tines started to break off.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get a good curl from this product, however it gives my hair a beautiful shine when I use it as a brush and curls the end of my long hair under nicely. The only reason I kept it is because of the nice shine I get when I use it. I was disappointed I can&#x27;t get more beachy waves from it.

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work like show on TV&lt;br /&gt;Iron dose not get hot enough to work</li>
            <li> This is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for to use in between shampoos.  My hair is medium length and I can turn under the bottom and redo areas I slept on.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> So so - difficult to curl with this product, even though they say you can, and so easy to get your hair tangled.  If you just want to add volume and &amp;#34;straighten&amp;#34; it works just fine.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this styler brush that is supposed to be for all hair lengths because the barrel is way too big for those with short hair.  Mine isn&#x27;t even all that short; about 3&amp;#34; at the shortest and 41/2&amp;#34; at the longest part.  The problem is that the barrel is so big you cannot wrap the hair fully around it in order for a curl to be formed.  In the longest portion of my hair I can get it to curl under but everywhere else it does nothing much really and that&#x27;s using the highest setting, which, per instructions, is not for thin or damaged hair types.  I actually bought this to give my thinning hair more volume and body where my hair is shortest and thinning on top.&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, you can put your hands on the hard plastic bristles and not get burned and you can try to hold your hair section around the barrel somewhat.  I found that the &amp;#34;ionic action&amp;#34; just makes my hair seem greasy rather than shiny which is not much help since I just want to fluff up my day old style after sleeping on it all night.&lt;br /&gt;This might work for someone who has easy to curl hair or who wants straight hair but it doesn&#x27;t do what I expected it to do for me.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review helps some other lady decide.</li>
            <li> Love the function of this product-just wish there was more tension between the 2 heat settings---they are so easy to slide from one next to the other that sometimes I only want low but realize I am on the high heat setting. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this item yesterday at my local big box retailer - so if I didn &#x27;t like it I could return it without any hassle ... I really like it!  It was just what I needed to tame a new perm.  It cut the time needed to style my hair in 1/2.  Now it only takes about 5 minutes to complete my style from a blow dried state and it leaves my chemically treated hair, smooth and shiny without the use of any leave in product.  I&#x27;m currently growing my hair out from a pixie style cut.  I&#x27;m glad it bought it!</li>
            <li> Under the impression it was used on wet hair.</li>
            <li> This product does curl your hair, but I think it would work better on longer hair, since I have short hair, but it does give curl &amp; lift to the top of my head where I wanted it to be lifted ,&amp; curled at!!  I still have to play with it more to see how much more curl I can get from this product!!  It does get hot, but you can still touch the barrel of the brush as long as you do not touch the metal barrel part of the brush, so stays cool to the touch, but still hot on the hair to get the correct curl from the ionic brush!!</li>
            <li> This is the only styling tool I need. I love it. I hope you continue to keep making them. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. I have a serious neck injury and it is light weight and I can hold it on the bristles or the handle. That makes is so much easier to curl my hair. My stylist gave me this curling iron to help me feel wonderful and put together because I could do my hair. Thank you!</li>
            <li> Very much like this curling iron.  Do not burn my neck or hands as I did with other curling irons. Would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The Barrel is to large.  Need a smaller size.  Other wise am satisfied</li>
            <li> I have shoulder length hair with very tight natural curls. I need a tool to take some of the curl out of my hair and to take the frizz out. I had (and LOVED) the Perfecter Fusion Styler and it stopped working after only 1 year. So I decided to give this one a try. It works great for the price. I don&#x27;t like it quite as well as the Perfecter because it does not slide through the hair quite as nicely. Other than that it is great.</li>
            <li> Really like this product!  First curling brush I&#x27;ve ever used and beats using a blow dryer/round brush!!</li>
            <li> This actually does add volume to my hair. I recommend it to be used with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> Love the way it curls. However this is the third one I have purchased due to the breakage of the bristles in less than a year. The good news is, it has a two year warranty and they will replace it for free. After the third one broke I called the company and they said ship it back and we will replace. So I have it packed and ready to return.</li>
            <li> Great product and great price!</li>
            <li> I have fine, straight, short hair, limp as a rag.  This styler gives my hair body and curl without damage.  I&#x27;m ordering my second one because I forgot and left the first one on for 3 hours, so one of the spikey things came unglued.  Other than the little hot spot created by the missing spikey thing, it still works like a charm after a couple of years.</li>
            <li> Love what this product does....when it works properly....Unfortunately it warms up when it chooses and not as it should.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one that I had wore out.  This one was much better priced.</li>
            <li> so nice to have a styler that smooths and lifts...can make hair curly or smooth.  Mailed well.</li>
            <li> works well all is good</li>
            <li> I am disappointed how it works on my hair.  I have very fine hair and I was wanting body on top crown but straight on sides and I&#x27;ve tried but can&#x27;t get that affect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought 3 of these. I have long, thick, wavy, blonde hair and usually the first day I wash my hair it&#x27;s biggish and wavy and after I sleep on it it becomes silkier and tame. A friend who&#x27;s a model was using this and her hair was gorgeous and healthy-when I asked what she was doing she told me about Instyler. I tried hers and was so impressed I bought one for myself and 2 friends. They love it too. I do use only the high setting and first I do a &amp;#34;pass through&amp;#34;. I just go through all the hair one time, then, I section it off and take more time playing with wand getting different effects. There&#x27;s a tricky thing that makes ALL the difference with this product. You have to have tension the whole time. So when you&#x27;re curling down or up or away you have to pull it away from your head just enough to have it be taut. Once you get the hang of it you can do it by wrapping your hand around the brush part and twirling it.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky because my model friend is from the south so she said &amp;#34;here&#x27;s what you do&amp;#34; and gave me all the quick tips. She also taught me &amp;#34;don&#x27;t get greedy&amp;#34; which means don&#x27;t take too much hair at once-if you do it might get stuck but it&#x27;s no biggie - you just stop, pull your hair away, and start again. Not like a curling iron or whatever that would fry your hair.&lt;br /&gt;You can get A LOT of volume or straighten it down sleekly depending on which direction and how you do it. Here&#x27;s the best part-With hair like mine it used to take me 45 minutes to make it fabulous-now it takes 10 minutes!  I can&#x27;t go on forever but if you play around with it you will see incredible results. Then just hit with hairspray if you need to hold it to go out.&lt;br /&gt;One of my friends has super curly, ringletty hair and she damaged it blowing it out. When I gave her the instyler she was worried but now LOVES how soft it makes her hair and how quickly it straightens her curls without damaging her hair. She did say it works even faster if you put a balm product in first.  I haven&#x27;t needed to do that but I thought I&#x27;d pass that along.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also SILENT which I love and it is cool to the touch. I&#x27;ve had mine since February, use it about once a week and it works perfectly. I&#x27;ve saved hundreds of dollars on blow-outs and I&#x27;m getting the face framing curls without an iron.  I&#x27;ve shown it to two more friends who have long hair (you&#x27;ll do the same when you get one!) and they&#x27;re both converts now too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the other reviews and all I can say is they didn&#x27;t have the right technique when they used it. Look at the picture of the girl on the box she&#x27;s doing it right!  Definitely try it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the difference is  in this one and the IN-STYLER . They look and are designed the same. I had to order this one because I dropped the other one and some of the teeth came out. I love this product. It is gentle on your hair; gets the job done and you can handle the rod/teeth as you curl and straighten.</li>
            <li> The heat on high is not hot enough to do a decent job. I have short fine hair so shouldn&#x27;t be a problem</li>
            <li> When the product finally arrived it did not work. I had to pay the return shipping and am still waiting for replacement or refund.</li>
            <li> Had had a previous curler so was aware that they can be temperamental about turning on.  This one is also a little sensitive but does work. the last one I taped on the on position so I didn&#x27;t have to play around with it. This come turns on 90% of the time. like it when it works immediately.</li>
            <li> This thing works great my only complaint is its easy to accidentally turn off while using. I found these at a second hand store for $5 YES FIVE I was so excited because my sister had wanted something similar for $100 so I figures I&#x27;d buy it to try it out an see if its any good its great I used it while my hair was wet an it did the job I just brushed it through my hair for awhile in sections an it worked.  I have thick curly hair so it was great to have something that actually worked anit curls great to iI usually end up burning my hands but this doesn&#x27;t hurt when you touch it I just wish I had bought more I&#x27;m going to give my sis one an sell the other on craigslist or something :D</li>
            <li> When I 1st received this, I wasn&#x27;t sure I liked it.  All of a sudden, I find myself reaching for this instead of any other hair tools I have, and I&#x27;ve got so many!  I&#x27;ve learned it takes practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is not thin, not thick.  Used to have 3x as much as I do now, but getting on up there in age is taking care of that.  My hair has no definition - not curly, not straight.  Kinky, some-what frizzy is probably a better description and the back of my hair falls well below my shoulders, shorter on the top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have come to love this styler!  Unfortunately, the teeth are falling out on me but I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as possible.  Would I purchase another one?  You bet!  I&#x27;ve got sooo many curling irons, flat irons and many other hot curling tools and this styler is my fave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh - I was having the problem of hitting the &#x27;off&#x27; switch, but I placed a small piece of tape over it and no more problems.  When needed, I&#x27;ll put another piece of scotch tape over it.  I have also noticed on occasion, when plugging in, the light blinks fast &amp; doesn&#x27;t heat up.  I now know to unplug it and plug back in and poof!  works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were to have 1 wish for this, it would be a smaller barrel for smaller curls.</li>
