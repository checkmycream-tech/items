            <li>But I really liked the added shine and softness</li>
            <li>If you spray it on your hair, it goes all over and hits the floor and makes the floor nice and slippery.</li>

            <li>i have tried so many things</li>
            <li>Even better than the Biolage Detangling product.</li>
            <li>Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I bought this product after being very impressed with the shampoo and conditioner of the same line.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for several years and it is the best!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I love this Shine milk.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s also SUPER knotty when I get out of the shower ( no matter what kind of shampoo and conditioner I use).</li>
            <li>Great product that leaves my hair soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Best when used on wet hair.</li>
            <li>it works best when your hair is wet</li>
            <li>Makes hair shiny and soft, great for detangling too.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says its does, love this stuff, perfect if you have damaged hair, or areas that are damaged, you will find after you spray this on those areas it completely helps smooth it out.</li>
            <li>So excited that I was able to find the Matrix Biolage Smoothing Shine Milk online.....</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that rarely sees a styling product or blow dryer.  </li>
            <li>I received the product very quickly and that was important because I needed it before I had to leave for vacation</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair that gets frizzy with any hint of humidity.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and A LOT of it</li>
            <li>it makes it super slippery!</li>
            <li>Worth every penny ( and I don&#x27;t generally spend a great deal on hair products :)</li>
            <li>Leaves my fine and frizzy hair shiny bouncy and free of tangles.</li>
            <li>Then as I used it, it didn&#x27;t help my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re not worried about toxins in your body care products you might be happy enough with this product.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair shiny and smooth</li>
            <li>so I paid the $14 now to buy it and got the shampoo and conditioner for free.</li>
            <li>It also really adds a nice shine to my hair as well</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>just a small amount catches fly aways and gives my hair a nice finished look and shine.</li>
            <li>Everything is dry in Colorado, so while good, could use more shine ingredients here.</li>
            <li>and i cant say enough good things about it .My</li>
            <li>so I assumed this would hold true for the smoothing shine milk as well.</li>
            <li>Not a bad smell though, and</li>
            <li>I have super frizzy, curly hair.</li>
            <li>This is a great detangler without weighing my hair down.</li>
            <li>Also it smells so pretty!</li>
            <li>but once I started using this product it made it much smoother and shinier looking!!</li>
            <li>This product is ok, but with all the rave reviews I thought it would be better, perhaps helps with detangling, but not much shine.</li>
            <li>hair is soft and shiney and beleive me i never thought i would ever find something like this .I will always stick with this for sure</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE HOW SOFT IT LEAVES MY HAIR.</li>
            <li>Well I originally used this item about two or three years ago when my friend purchased it and ended up not liking it very much/didn&#x27;t see any results and gave it to me.</li>
            <li>The brush glides right through.  </li>
            <li>Love this product and absolutely furious over Matrix decision to discontinue with new agave version that does not measure up...  Grabbing up bottles everywhere</li>
            <li>My hairdresser recommended this product and I love it, I really see a difference with my hair when I use it, very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I use this when my hair is still wet and it smoothed it right out and added a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>When I was in high school, all my friends wanted to know how my hair was so soft and healthy-</li>
            <li>The regular one smells better.  </li>
            <li>I still use the hydra-seal leave-in daily, but I won&#x27;t be using any more of this product.</li>
            <li>I first used this in the salon and when i felt my hair</li>
            <li>but this product leaves no residue and it makes combing my hair after a shower much, much easier!</li>
            <li>Sure enough, this one is meeting the bin now.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>This Smoothing Shine Milk did exactly that:  </li>
            <li>Actually I LOVE this product, but what I got when I received this order was the Blue Agave version.</li>
            <li>THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FROM BIOLAGE.</li>
            <li>This stuff is wonderful at helping me get a brush through my hair ( don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li>I have tried SO many products over the years and this is the only thing that has ever really worked...</li>
            <li>As others have mentioned, try not to get it on the floor, as it makes it very slippery.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t notice that.</li>
            <li>This stuff really helps.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>it left my hair smooth, shiny, and silky.  </li>
            <li>Really helps restore shininess and blocks out frizz while volumizing hair.</li>
            <li>This really did not do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li>and when I ran out I wasn&#x27;t really up</li>
            <li>I recently went in to buy shampoo and it as a Buy 1 Get 2 Free thing</li>
            <li>It looked like something straight out of a classic banana peel slip scene.</li>
            <li>Just spray a little after towel drying my hair, brush out, and I am good to go (no blow drying necessary)!</li>
            <li>and I absolutely can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>When sprayed on to your hair after shampooing and a light towel dry, it eliminates any tangles.  </li>
            <li>This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually makes it manageable and able to style.</li>
            <li>I love spraying this on to comb through my wet hair for a natural look that has shine.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It gives you a wet but not wet/shiny look because it has a light hold.</li>
            <li>I really like this product, it makes my hair so soft without ending up greasy.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t remotely consider this to be a &#x27;light&#x27; hold spray, or something that helps with frizz.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t the normal smell of the product.</li>
            <li>My mother actually couldn&#x27;t wait until the day I could brush my own hair when I was a little girl because she couldn&#x27;t stand all of the tangles</li>
            <li>It is ok but seems to be too heavy for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li>Not sure why they call it Shine Milk though; I would say it works better as a detangler than anything.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair shiny and soft and smell amazaing!</li>
            <li>I spritz it pretty liberally before I air dry or blow dry my hair and after it dries it is incredibly soft, silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>and I live in Texas, which means half the time I look like I stuck my finger in a light socket by the end of the day.</li>
            <li>I have very thick hair that seems to have a mind of it&#x27;s own somedays</li>
            <li>I have been using shine milk for nearly 10 years now</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>it was soft and shinny</li>
            <li>and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li>hair feels soft afterward.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft, no frizzies and has a soft hold.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>i have very curly hair that i often flat iron.</li>
            <li>After all the great reviews, and continual searches for a product that can tame my thick, dry, frizzy hair, I was really looking forward to trying this.</li>
            <li>Whatever happened to it over the past few years has not been good to it.</li>
            <li>My hair is long and tends to get very tangled after you wash it, even with a conditioner.</li>
            <li>Makes your hair sliky smooth and frizzless, however matrix changed the bottle and im not sure</li>
            <li>I have used leave in conditioners and de-tanglers but they always left my fine hair looking greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t get the version of the product pictured, instead I received the blue topped bottle which is the new agave version.</li>
            <li>For others like me who are looking for the specific formula that isn&#x27;t the new one with agave.</li>
            <li>I have thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li>Not only does this make my hair silky soft</li>
            <li>its the same formula, the new bottle is blue and has blue alge in the name..</li>
            <li>I have very frizzy,dry, middle aged hair.</li>
            <li>there are still knots but 90% less of them) and it drys light and airy, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it greasy looking.</li>
            <li>When dry, my hair is soft, shiny and feels like there is no product in it at all.  </li>
            <li>my hair is dry since i&#x27;ve been using this my hair is shinnier, feels soft and look healthier</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t expect much from hair products, but this one surprised me.</li>
            <li>I am Asian with super thick  hair that frizzes  out.</li>
            <li>was wondering where the smell was coming from (I live in a college dorm with zero animals) because I was getting whiffs of wet dog!</li>

            <li> Actually I LOVE this product, but what I got when I received this order was the Blue Agave version.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FROM BIOLAGE.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful at helping me get a brush through my hair ( don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> I have tried SO many products over the years and this is the only thing that has ever really worked...</li>
            <li> As others have mentioned, try not to get it on the floor, as it makes it very slippery.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t notice that.</li>
            <li> This stuff really helps.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> it left my hair smooth, shiny, and silky.  </li>
            <li> Really helps restore shininess and blocks out frizz while volumizing hair.</li>
            <li> This really did not do anything for my hair.</li>
            <li> and when I ran out I wasn&#x27;t really up</li>
            <li> I recently went in to buy shampoo and it as a Buy 1 Get 2 Free thing</li>
            <li> It looked like something straight out of a classic banana peel slip scene.</li>
            <li> Just spray a little after towel drying my hair, brush out, and I am good to go (no blow drying necessary)!</li>
            <li> and I absolutely can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> When sprayed on to your hair after shampooing and a light towel dry, it eliminates any tangles.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually makes it manageable and able to style.</li>
            <li> I love spraying this on to comb through my wet hair for a natural look that has shine.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It gives you a wet but not wet/shiny look because it has a light hold.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it makes my hair so soft without ending up greasy.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t remotely consider this to be a &#x27;light&#x27; hold spray, or something that helps with frizz.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t the normal smell of the product.</li>
            <li> My mother actually couldn&#x27;t wait until the day I could brush my own hair when I was a little girl because she couldn&#x27;t stand all of the tangles</li>
            <li> It is ok but seems to be too heavy for my naturally curly hair.</li>
            <li> Not sure why they call it Shine Milk though; I would say it works better as a detangler than anything.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair shiny and soft and smell amazaing!</li>
            <li> I spritz it pretty liberally before I air dry or blow dry my hair and after it dries it is incredibly soft, silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> and I live in Texas, which means half the time I look like I stuck my finger in a light socket by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I have very thick hair that seems to have a mind of it&#x27;s own somedays</li>
            <li> I have been using shine milk for nearly 10 years now</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> it was soft and shinny</li>
            <li> and my hair feels so soft.</li>
            <li> hair feels soft afterward.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft, no frizzies and has a soft hold.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> i have very curly hair that i often flat iron.</li>
            <li> After all the great reviews, and continual searches for a product that can tame my thick, dry, frizzy hair, I was really looking forward to trying this.</li>
            <li> Whatever happened to it over the past few years has not been good to it.</li>
            <li> My hair is long and tends to get very tangled after you wash it, even with a conditioner.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair sliky smooth and frizzless, however matrix changed the bottle and im not sure</li>
            <li> I have used leave in conditioners and de-tanglers but they always left my fine hair looking greasy and heavy.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the version of the product pictured, instead I received the blue topped bottle which is the new agave version.</li>
            <li> For others like me who are looking for the specific formula that isn&#x27;t the new one with agave.</li>
            <li> I have thick but fine hair.</li>
            <li> Not only does this make my hair silky soft</li>
            <li> its the same formula, the new bottle is blue and has blue alge in the name..</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy,dry, middle aged hair.</li>
            <li> there are still knots but 90% less of them) and it drys light and airy, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it greasy looking.</li>
            <li> When dry, my hair is soft, shiny and feels like there is no product in it at all.  </li>
            <li> my hair is dry since i&#x27;ve been using this my hair is shinnier, feels soft and look healthier</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t expect much from hair products, but this one surprised me.</li>
            <li> I am Asian with super thick  hair that frizzes  out.</li>
            <li> was wondering where the smell was coming from (I live in a college dorm with zero animals) because I was getting whiffs of wet dog!</li>
            <li> showered and everything like normal, misted my hair, combed it through, blow dried my hair...</li>
            <li> The product I received was the Blue Agave version with the dark blue trim and cap on the bottle, instead of the regular one with a white cap.  </li>
            <li> My hair is long and  tends to be dry, a bit coarse, and fly-away.</li>
            <li> I also use it before restyling dry hair with a flat iron.</li>
            <li> I have used it off and on for a long time now.</li>
            <li> After a conversation with some doctor friends who reminded me that parabens not only mess with our hormones but are also carcinogens, I went back through my grooming products to check.</li>
            <li> I used it on dry hair and the results is hair that DEFINATELY stays in place.  </li>
            <li> dry my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have curly hair that tends to look frizzy and dry...</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> This makes it dry smoother and reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> but then get all frizzy again and dry.</li>
            <li> I just blow dry and go.</li>
            <li> but I use it to pet back stray hairs, add a little extra softness when its dry or even as a mock hairspray!</li>
            <li> I can use this product on my hair and it makes my hair feel so soft and no more friz.  </li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t way down my curls or look producty but still reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> Can use this on dry or wet hair.</li>
            <li> The first time I ever used this stuff was at my local salon and since than I am obsessed with this stuff.</li>
            <li> Like another posting, I will say be careful if you get it on an un-carpeted floor-</li>
            <li> Use it while hair is wet.</li>
            <li> to spent the $17 at the time to have it again.</li>
            <li> and I started smelling wet dog.</li>
            <li> hair smells like wet dog now.</li>
            <li> Alternatively, a small amount of jojoba oil carefully applied to your hair has the same effect.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products before that end up just making my hair look greasy and even messier than before</li>
            <li> Both bottles were a little dirty around the lids and one had a huge sent in it.</li>
            <li> My hair is curly frizzy and thick, and when straightening it would last for a while</li>
            <li> I typically have wavy, frizzy hair that looks like straw.</li>
            <li> Also works well for detangled mess after showering</li>
            <li> sometimes i just need a little something to finish it off and this does the trick.</li>
            <li> This product really keeps my hair from going crazy.</li>
            <li> This stuff got on my floor without me noticing and it made the floor so slippery (after it had dried and sat for a day) that my husband and I both slid across the floor and almost busted our heads.</li>
            <li> even though I blow dried and flat-ironed it-</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I use a few pumps of this spray after I wash my hair</li>
            <li> I use this product after washing my hair along with ApHogee Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizer on my damp hair them straighten it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp or oily.</li>
            <li> My hair had gotten dried out from the Florida Sun and winds.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this item has been discontinued, because I can no longer find it anywhere in stores, that&#x27;s why I have to order it now thru amazon.</li>
            <li> I spray it on after I wash my hair and then style it as usual.</li>
            <li> It even helps on the days I am lazy and don&#x27;t do my hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually use product in my hair-</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for the past five years</li>
            <li> So hard to find as its not sold in stores...</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that loves to friz.  </li>
            <li> I am a man with thick, curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it&#x27;s nothing but hairspray that leaves your hair sticky, and less manageable.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it smelled awful.</li>
            <li> I havbe had a very hard time finding it in the stores</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying, you&#x27;ll be heart broken when you can&#x27;t find replacement!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Biolage/Matrix, so this was really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was getting sick to my stomach</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The product I received was the Blue Agave version with the dark blue trim and cap on the bottle, instead of the regular one with a white cap.  The regular one smells better.  I should have heeded the warnings from over reviewers that had noted that they were also misled and received the Blue Agave version instead of the one in the picture.</li>
            <li> When sprayed on to your hair after shampooing and a light towel dry, it eliminates any tangles.  I stopped using conditioner and now use this product to detangle and add shine.</li>
            <li> Can use this on dry or wet hair. I used it on dry hair and the results is hair that DEFINATELY stays in place.  It has a nice scent too.  It gives you a wet but not wet/shiny look because it has a light hold. But hair stays put and in place. And it doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  This product works great on my hair.  I have thick curly hair that loves to friz.  I can use this product on my hair and it makes my hair feel so soft and no more friz.  I love it.  I received the product very quickly and that was important because I needed it before I had to leave for vacation and I got it a couple days before I was leaving.  I would definately buy again.</li>
            <li> I have very frizzy,dry, middle aged hair. This is the only product I&#x27;ve found that actually makes it manageable and able to style. Worth every penny ( and I don&#x27;t generally spend a great deal on hair products :)</li>
            <li> Great product that leaves my hair soft and shiny.  It seems to have no residue or build up.  It&#x27;s quick and easy to use.  Will buy again, definitely.</li>
            <li> I really like this product, it makes my hair so soft without ending up greasy. But, if you have linoleum floors, beware! This stuff got on my floor without me noticing and it made the floor so slippery (after it had dried and sat for a day) that my husband and I both slid across the floor and almost busted our heads. It looked like something straight out of a classic banana peel slip scene.</li>
            <li> This product is ok, but with all the rave reviews I thought it would be better, perhaps helps with detangling, but not much shine.</li>
            <li> It was everything i wanted</li>
            <li> Conditions and calms hair that tends to be a bit frizzy. Best when used on wet hair. three more words</li>
            <li> I typically have wavy, frizzy hair that looks like straw. Not anymore! Since using this product my hair looks ah-ma-zing! I spritz it pretty liberally before I air dry or blow dry my hair and after it dries it is incredibly soft, silky and smooth. I am not even using a frizz serum anymore, this has done the trick for me. Also it smells so pretty! I will definitely buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Everything is dry in Colorado, so while good, could use more shine ingredients here.</li>
            <li> I use this product every day and I love it.  I am a man with thick, curly hair.  This product makes my hair manageable and stops it from being frizzy, but doesn&#x27;t make it crunchy or sticky like gel or hair spray.  As others have mentioned, try not to get it on the floor, as it makes it very slippery.</li>
            <li> I have been using shine milk for nearly 10 years now and I&#x27;m still in love!  When I was in high school, all my friends wanted to know how my hair was so soft and healthy- even though I blow dried and flat-ironed it- and I told them BIOLAGE SHINE MILK!  It is like J&amp;J No More Tangles on steroids!  I use it when I get out of the shower, and it makes combing my hair a cinch.  When dry, my hair is soft, shiny and feels like there is no product in it at all.  Like another posting, I will say be careful if you get it on an un-carpeted floor- it makes it super slippery!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a few years.  I like the way it makes my hair feel and it smells great.  Most helpful after I broke my wrist and could not blower dry my hair.  I just sprayed it with Milk and combed it into place.  Looked great and helped a lot in my grooming routine.  Would not go without.</li>
            <li> Be sparing with this spray. I am Asian with super thick  hair that frizzes  out. This product really keeps my hair from going crazy. Just spray a little after towel drying my hair, brush out, and I am good to go (no blow drying necessary)!</li>
            <li> I have curly hair that tends to look frizzy and dry... I have tried SO many products over the years and this is the only thing that has ever really worked... This makes my hair shiny and smooth and it looks healthier than ever!</li>
            <li> Not sure if this item has been discontinued, because I can no longer find it anywhere in stores, that&#x27;s why I have to order it now thru amazon. My hair is long and tends to get very tangled after you wash it, even with a conditioner. The first time I ever used this stuff was at my local salon and since than I am obsessed with this stuff. By far the best product out there to detangle your hair. Some people may complain about the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34;. I really don&#x27;t notice that. I use a few pumps of this spray after I wash my hair and I can comb thru it in an instant. Great stuff!</li>
            <li> I like this conditioner. I have used it off and on for a long time now. I did receive the &amp;#34;blue agave&amp;#34; version though.</li>
            <li> Love this product and absolutely furious over Matrix decision to discontinue with new agave version that does not measure up...  Grabbing up bottles everywhere I can.  Don&#x27;t bother buying, you&#x27;ll be heart broken when you can&#x27;t find replacement!</li>
            <li> Seems to dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick i have tried so many things my bathroom vanity looks like a drug stoore .My girl that cuts my hair used it on me and i cant say enough good things about it .My hair is soft and shiney and beleive me i never thought i would ever find something like this .I will always stick with this for sure</li>
            <li> My hairdresser recommended this product and I love it, I really see a difference with my hair when I use it, very soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> Came when advised and happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Excellent product !!!!&lt;br /&gt;Works just as described</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair and I live in Texas, which means half the time I look like I stuck my finger in a light socket by the end of the day. Frizzy hair and flyaways are my nemesis. This stuff really helps. I spray it on after I wash my hair and then style it as usual. It even helps on the days I am lazy and don&#x27;t do my hair.</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for years. Not sure why they call it Shine Milk though; I would say it works better as a detangler than anything. Even better than the Biolage Detangling product. Can&#x27;t comb out my hair without it.</li>
            <li> Leaves my fine and frizzy hair shiny bouncy and free of tangles. I buy two at a time.</li>
            <li> I was sent the blue agave one instead.  I thought I&#x27;d give it a try, it works ok but not as good as the one shown here.</li>
            <li> I love spraying this on to comb through my wet hair for a natural look that has shine. I also use it before restyling dry hair with a flat iron. It gives my hair a beautiful shine.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the thing. I received the item, taped. I didn&#x27;t think to smell it. The first time I used it, it smelled awful. It wasn&#x27;t the normal smell of the product. Then as I used it, it didn&#x27;t help my hair smooth. I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> FREAKING AMAZING! Works great! Makes your hair shiny and soft and smell amazaing!</li>
            <li> Great product that protects hair and creates shine.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Good wrapping. Both bottles were a little dirty around the lids and one had a huge sent in it. Still works great and I for sure would recommend seller!!</li>
            <li> So hard to find as its not sold in stores...i was so have to have found it here.  Best product for my hair i have found and here it was on Amazon.  Thank you so much</li>
            <li> My hair is definitely smoother and straighter. Now I can straighten it in 20 min, it used to take me 40 min. And it looks healthier, aaand it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair oily! It&#x27;s a great product. Glad I tried it.</li>
            <li> After all the great reviews, and continual searches for a product that can tame my thick, dry, frizzy hair, I was really looking forward to trying this. Unfortunately, it&#x27;s nothing but hairspray that leaves your hair sticky, and less manageable. I wouldn&#x27;t remotely consider this to be a &#x27;light&#x27; hold spray, or something that helps with frizz. I&#x27;ve always been a fan of Biolage/Matrix, so this was really disappointing. I still use the hydra-seal leave-in daily, but I won&#x27;t be using any more of this product.</li>
            <li> I have super frizzy, curly hair. This makes it dry smoother and reduce frizz.</li>
            <li> I was given a bottle as a Christmas gift from my sister, and just bought another bottle. I usually don&#x27;t expect much from hair products, but this one surprised me. My hair is long and  tends to be dry, a bit coarse, and fly-away. I use this when my hair is still wet and it smoothed it right out and added a nice shine.  I&#x27;m also &amp;#34;fragrance sensitive&amp;#34; but this doesn&#x27;t bother me. Very light pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> I first used this in the salon and when i felt my hair it was soft and shinny my hair is dry since i&#x27;ve been using this my hair is shinnier, feels soft and look healthier it works best when your hair is wet</li>
            <li> i lov it it its so shineny my hair &amp; smute?</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products out there to help smooth frizzy hair!! I have very thick hair that seems to have a mind of it&#x27;s own somedays but once I started using this product it made it much smoother and shinier looking!! I&#x27;ve tried other products before that end up just making my hair look greasy and even messier than before but this product leaves no residue and it makes combing my hair after a shower much, much easier! I would strongly suggest buying this product!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly frizzy and thick, and when straightening it would last for a while but then get all frizzy again and dry. I use this product after washing my hair along with ApHogee Keratin and Green Tea Restructurizer on my damp hair them straighten it and my hair feels so soft. Tia a great product and I love it</li>
            <li> I ordered this product (bait), but instead received Matrix Biolage Styling &amp;#34;Blue Agave&amp;#34; Smoothing Shine Milk 8.5oz (switch).&lt;br /&gt;They are different.</li>
            <li> So excited that I was able to find the Matrix Biolage Smoothing Shine Milk online.....I havbe had a very hard time finding it in the stores</li>
            <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t way down my curls or look producty but still reduces frizz.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  A little goes a long way.  It appears to nourish and de-tangle my hair.  The brush glides right through.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair limp or oily.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after being very impressed with the shampoo and conditioner of the same line. Both state that they are Paraben-Free so I assumed this would hold true for the smoothing shine milk as well. After a conversation with some doctor friends who reminded me that parabens not only mess with our hormones but are also carcinogens, I went back through my grooming products to check. Sure enough, this one is meeting the bin now.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re not worried about toxins in your body care products you might be happy enough with this product. Alternatively, a small amount of jojoba oil carefully applied to your hair has the same effect. If you don&#x27;t like the idea of putting oil on your hair, Rene Furterer&#x27;s Okara Spray is still the gold standard when it comes to detangling and adding shine.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that rarely sees a styling product or blow dryer.  However, I do like using a leave-on conditioning spray after I&#x27;ve washed my hair.  This Smoothing Shine Milk did exactly that:  it left my hair smooth, shiny, and silky.  It&#x27;s the perfect, low-maintanence product to keep hair in check.</li>
            <li> I am not a big fan of lots of hair products.  This product keeps the front of my hair in place while it figures out what to do on its own.&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
            <li> Actually I LOVE this product, but what I got when I received this order was the Blue Agave version. I did not want that. So my problem with this product is not the product itself, but with what I received. Got a refund and am just going to buy it locally.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair sliky smooth and frizzless, however matrix changed the bottle and im not sure its the same formula, the new bottle is blue and has blue alge in the name..</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FROM BIOLAGE. I REALLY LOVE HOW SOFT IT LEAVES MY HAIR. I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.  :)</li>
            <li> Really helps restore shininess and blocks out frizz while volumizing hair. I highly recommend. Use it while hair is wet.</li>
            <li> I received a different Biolage product, not the one pictured here.&lt;br /&gt;I expect there will be no problem returning it and I do not expect to pay for return postage since the item shipped was the incorrect one.</li>
            <li> This really did not do anything for my hair. Did not help with with frizz at all, which is what I was hoping it would do</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years and it is the best!!! I have platinum blonde hair and I color it and wash my hair daily as well and this means I need extra moisture. Not only does this make my hair silky soft but I use it to pet back stray hairs, add a little extra softness when its dry or even as a mock hairspray! I will never be without it, its the final product that keeps my hair combable. Not to mention smelling fantastic and shiny!! Try this!!</li>
            <li> Love this product! Lightweight works great!</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair that gets frizzy with any hint of humidity. This is the only product I&#x27;ve ever used (and believe me, I&#x27;ve tried them all!) that actually improves the texture of my hair. It makes my hair shiny and smooth and I don&#x27;t even have to style it after I spritz this on! I LOVE this stuff.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the version of the product pictured, instead I received the blue topped bottle which is the new agave version. Just FYI For others like me who are looking for the specific formula that isn&#x27;t the new one with agave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. I bought it hope it would smell like the shampoo and conditioner, but it doesn&#x27;t. Not a bad smell though, and hair feels soft afterward.</li>
            <li> I have thick but fine hair. This is a great detangler without weighing my hair down. I use it every time I wash my hair.</li>
            <li> Makes hair shiny and soft, great for detangling too. Doesn&#x27;t leave oily sticky residue like some after shampoo products do.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says its does, love this stuff, perfect if you have damaged hair, or areas that are damaged, you will find after you spray this on those areas it completely helps smooth it out. Also works well for detangled mess after showering</li>
            <li> Well I originally used this item about two or three years ago when my friend purchased it and ended up not liking it very much/didn&#x27;t see any results and gave it to me. I don&#x27;t usually use product in my hair- I just blow dry and go. But I really liked the added shine and softness I noticed when I used it and when I ran out I wasn&#x27;t really up to spent the $17 at the time to have it again. I recently went in to buy shampoo and it as a Buy 1 Get 2 Free thing so I paid the $14 now to buy it and got the shampoo and conditioner for free. I thought I had a great deal until today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I showered and everything like normal, misted my hair, combed it through, blow dried my hair... and I started smelling wet dog. I noticed when I misted my hair it wasn&#x27;t the traditional Biolage scent, but it was still GOOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was wondering where the smell was coming from (I live in a college dorm with zero animals) because I was getting whiffs of wet dog! I was getting sick to my stomach and then when it dawned on me I shut off my blow dryer and smelled my hair and almost puked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair smells like wet dog now. I&#x27;ll be returning this product. Whatever happened to it over the past few years has not been good to it.</li>
            <li> My hair had gotten dried out from the Florida Sun and winds. It is ok but seems to be too heavy for my naturally curly hair. Will move to something different.</li>
            <li> i have very curly hair that i often flat iron. sometimes i just need a little something to finish it off and this does the trick. just a small amount catches fly aways and gives my hair a nice finished look and shine. great stuff.</li>
            <li> Love it, another excellent Biolage product!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this stuff for the past five years and I absolutely can&#x27;t live without it! I have fine hair and A LOT of it and it&#x27;s also SUPER knotty when I get out of the shower ( no matter what kind of shampoo and conditioner I use). My mother actually couldn&#x27;t wait until the day I could brush my own hair when I was a little girl because she couldn&#x27;t stand all of the tangles lol, if that tells you anything! I have used leave in conditioners and de-tanglers but they always left my fine hair looking greasy and heavy. This stuff is wonderful at helping me get a brush through my hair ( don&#x27;t get me wrong there are still knots but 90% less of them) and it drys light and airy, it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or leave it greasy looking. It also really adds a nice shine to my hair as well and I have never found anything that works quite like it! If you have tangly hair, try this stuff...you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this Shine milk. It makes my hair soft, no frizzies and has a soft hold. If you spray it on your hair, it goes all over and hits the floor and makes the floor nice and slippery. So I squirt it into my hand and them run it through my damp hair.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair soft and shiny. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, would recommend to anyone with any type of hair.</li>
