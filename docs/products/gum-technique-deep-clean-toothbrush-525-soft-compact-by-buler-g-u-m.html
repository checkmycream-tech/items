            <li>Its just ok...</li>
            <li>The are many &amp;#34;SOFT&amp;#34; brushes out there, but I was given this by a hygienist who said it does the job without MORE pain.  </li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush.</li>
            <li>My favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Glad to find them somewhere.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been told that my gums and teeth continue to look better.</li>
            <li>Love this toothbrush -</li>
            <li>It is also great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>I found it definitely more effective than my old 0.01mm toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived</li>
            <li>I liked it so much</li>
            <li>if those things are important to you.</li>
            <li>I would subscribe and save to these and forgo any free toothbrush if I could.  </li>
            <li>Cudos to Amazon and Wright Health Products for making them available.</li>
            <li>The special part about this toothbrush is the star shaped head.</li>
            <li>The GUM 525 Soft Compact is awesome for really getting teeth clean while sparing sensitive gums.  </li>
            <li>A true &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li>Shipped and arrived very promptly in appropriate packaging.</li>
            <li>It has a compact head &amp; a good grip that makes it easier to reach further inside the mouth.</li>
            <li>I always liked this particular toothbrush because it was very soft and easy on my gums.</li>
            <li>She was right.  </li>
            <li>The bristles are soft and remove plaque effectively like no other.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!  </li>
            <li>and sometimes I still use it, but this one somehow manages to jump into my hand first.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, my dentist gives me one of these when I visit him.</li>
            <li>I got the first one from my dentist:</li>
            <li>Exactly like ones in dental office &amp; reasonably priced for toothbrush of this caliber.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have not checked to see if it is available at the local drug stores.</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>First off let me start off by saying I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews....</li>
            <li>Like the other reviewers, I had one of these toothbrushes &amp; couldn&#x27;t find more at retail.  </li>
            <li>Makes every other toothbrush feel like I&#x27;m brushing my teeth with a tree limb, and it even works better than my waterpick.</li>
            <li>The bristles flair out and they really massage your gums and get below the gum line, which is very important as you get a little older.  </li>
            <li>The 524 model with the bigger head is MUCH better and works fine even for people with small mouths.</li>
            <li>This toothbrushes is the best, receive from dental office after exams &amp; unable to find locally retail.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It REALLY is soft, and REALLY is compact.  </li>
            <li>It cleans the tooth surfaces &amp; near the gum quite well but gently.</li>
            <li>This is an amazing soft brush, and the long bristles really get into tough areas to clean your teeth.  </li>
            <li>Although a bit more money than I usually spend, it is worth every extra cent!</li>
            <li>I relied on other buyer reviews before ordering from this seller and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive teeth and this just works wonders with them.</li>
            <li>The softest bristles for sensitive gums.</li>
            <li>SOFT TOOTHBRUSH</li>
            <li>It feel soft on your teeth and gums but yet gives you the feeling of well-cleaned teeth.</li>
            <li>It is ABSOLUTELY soft.  </li>
            <li>Gets into hard to clean spaces, under gums, thorough, gentle for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li>There is no other brush that can compare with the comfort and efficiency of this Ultra Soft 525 or 527 toothbrush.</li>
            <li>It gets into all areas easily and effectively, not to mention it&#x27;s soft</li>
            <li>Very gentle on the gums but has stiffer bristles in the center to do the major cleaning.</li>
            <li>If you like extra soft tooth brushes, this is the one.  </li>
            <li>I have always had very sensitive gums and heavy plaque build up no matter how much I brush or floss.</li>
            <li>Awhile back, my dentist switched to another brand and the softness just wasn&#x27;t the same even though it said soft.</li>
            <li>Brush is very very soft so is in the category of specialized for tender gums and dry mouth.</li>
            <li>The only down side is that it will wear fast, so buy two!  </li>

            <li> This is an amazing soft brush, and the long bristles really get into tough areas to clean your teeth.  If you have braces, this brush will do a great job cleaning around the brackets and your teeth.  The rubber handhold also encourages you to hold the brush at a proper 45 degree angle to maximize the cleaning impact of brushing.  It is also great for sensitive teeth.</li>
            <li> This toothbrush is amazing. I have sensitive teeth and this just works wonders with them. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Well, I was introduced to this toothbrush by my dental hygienist.  The reason I am ordering from Amazon is because I can not find this toothbrush anywhere!  The special part about this toothbrush is the star shaped head. The bristles flair out and they really massage your gums and get below the gum line, which is very important as you get a little older.  This toothbrush also does not allow you to brush so hard that you will damage your gums.  I also have had much better dental check-ups when using this brush as opposed to the braun and sonicare brand brushes.  Go figure!</li>
            <li> Fell in love after I got one from my dentist. Now it&#x27;s the only brush I use.</li>
            <li> My dentist gave me one of these tooth brushes as I went home from my last appt.  I liked it so much I found some online and ordered.  I have reseding gums and I feel these brushes do a good job.</li>
            <li> Unlike other &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; brushes, this one actually is SOFT. The softest bristles for sensitive gums. Highly recommend. I won&#x27;t buy any other.</li>
            <li> SOFT TOOTHBRUSH AS DESCRIBED AND BY REVIEWS. MY TEETH HURT AND THIS IS ALOT SOFTER THAN COLGATE BRAND I WAS USING. THE HANDLE IS GOOD AND THE COLOR CORAL.</li>
            <li> Just a mediocre brush to me, doesn&#x27;t even fit in my toothbrush holder with its fat handle. I have to wonder who wrote the reviews. Its just ok...&lt;br /&gt;With those reviews I was expecting awesome!</li>
            <li> I bought it for myself and for my daughter, and we are both very happy with it. I have sonic toothbrush as well and sometimes I still use it, but this one somehow manages to jump into my hand first. It feel soft on your teeth and gums but yet gives you the feeling of well-cleaned teeth.</li>
            <li> If you are having trigeminal issues affecting your teeth, this brush is what you need.  I also am told it is helpful to those patients with other conditions (undergoing chemo, etc). It is ABSOLUTELY soft.  The are many &amp;#34;SOFT&amp;#34; brushes out there, but I was given this by a hygienist who said it does the job without MORE pain.  She was right.  I was under the impression it was only from the dental community, but here it is!!!!!!!  The only down side is that it will wear fast, so buy two!  I have not checked to see if it is available at the local drug stores. Although a bit more money than I usually spend, it is worth every extra cent!</li>
            <li> Love this toothbrush. It REALLY is soft, and REALLY is compact.  Perfect toothbrush if those things are important to you.</li>
            <li> Best toothbrushes ever!! A true &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; toothbrush.</li>
            <li> This toothbrushes is the best, receive from dental office after exams &amp; unable to find locally retail. Exactly like ones in dental office &amp; reasonably priced for toothbrush of this caliber. I relied on other buyer reviews before ordering from this seller and was not disappointed.

            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, my dentist gives me one of these when I visit him.</li>
            <li> Gets into hard to clean spaces, under gums, thorough, gentle for sensitive teeth. My favorite toothbrush.</li>
            <li> soft yet gets into crevices between teeth, this toothbrush is great for everyone in the family! I got the first one from my dentist: it&#x27;s the only toothbrush he recommends. Now I buy 4 at a time.</li>
            <li> Excellent toothbrush.It has a compact head &amp; a good grip that makes it easier to reach further inside the mouth. It cleans the tooth surfaces &amp; near the gum quite well but gently. I found it definitely more effective than my old 0.01mm toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived before estimated time of delivery, average packaging (sold by Wright I got a few bent bristles but not damaged brush). I received blue color.</li>
            <li> This is a great toothbrush. Cannot find them in my pharmacies or grocery stores. Glad to find them somewhere. Work great for getting around the gum area and in between your teeth. Definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> I got one of these brushes from my dentist when I had my teeth cleaned.  When it wore out I looked around to see if I could find one like it in the store. When I could not I ordered them from Amazon.  I gave one to my husband to try. He really likes it.</li>
            <li> The 524 model with the bigger head is MUCH better and works fine even for people with small mouths. You can get it at a local W chain store, probably.</li>
            <li> I ordered these because this is what I got from my dentist for a few years. I always liked this particular toothbrush because it was very soft and easy on my gums. Awhile back, my dentist switched to another brand and the softness just wasn&#x27;t the same even though it said soft. Now I&#x27;m happy and will continue to order more.</li>
            <li> First off let me start off by saying I don&#x27;t normally leave reviews....but this is the best toothbrush that I&#x27;ve ever had. I have always had very sensitive gums and heavy plaque build up no matter how much I brush or floss. At the dentist visits since I&#x27;ve started using this toothbrush I&#x27;ve been told that my gums and teeth continue to look better. At my last visit I hardly had any hard plaque build up and was told that my gums are looking better as well. The only downside to this toothbrush was that I couldn&#x27;t locate it at any store but thankfully the dental hygienist told me to try looking on amazon.</li>
            <li> My dental hygienist is the only one who can get these for me besides Amazon.  I would subscribe and save to these and forgo any free toothbrush if I could.  Love this toothbrush - can&#x27;t go back to any other one after using this one.</li>
            <li> My teeth have some sensitivity, and this removes the plaque without irritating my soft enamel spots.</li>
            <li> Like the other reviewers, I had one of these toothbrushes &amp; couldn&#x27;t find more at retail.  The GUM 525 Soft Compact is awesome for really getting teeth clean while sparing sensitive gums.  Cudos to Amazon and Wright Health Products for making them available.</li>
