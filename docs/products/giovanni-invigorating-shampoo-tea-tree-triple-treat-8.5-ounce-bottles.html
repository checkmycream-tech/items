            <li>These products are amazing and provide him with excellent relief.</li>
            <li>The Giovanni does, however, work great for my husband who has dreadlocks which is why I didn&#x27;t give the shampoo one or two stars.</li>
            <li>Works great as shampoo or body wash.</li>
            <li>Great for all hair types.</li>
            <li>My hair feels cleaner after washing, there&#x27;s a tingly sensation, and the smell is great.     </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>The three-pack saves me money, too, so this greatly exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li>I recommend search around for a lower price on the internet (vitacost has great prices).</li>
            <li>great</li>
            <li>Great tingly feeling is perfect to heal scalp and it smells nice as well.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply to scalp and lengths, smells wonderfully, and leaves hair feeling well cleansed.  </li>
            <li>to Paul Mitchell which isn&#x27;t perfect but a heck of a lot better than this stuff for me.</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo, my hair feels cleaner, thicker and smells great!</li>
            <li>I had already heard good things about but never wanted to try because of the smell).</li>
            <li>Good choice.</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s organic, made in the USA and SLS free is great!</li>
            <li>Even while working it through in the shower you can tell it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the under $8 shampoos.</li>
            <li>This was fairly good shampoo.</li>
            <li>I changed it to organic argan oil shampoo and voi la, in a week I have gorgeous hair using NO conditioner.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>The shampoo (and conditioner) have a very refreshing, almost minty aroma and leave a very pleasant cool feeling on my scalp when I rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>i love that i can buy this in bulk at a great price</li>
            <li>tea tree smells just like peppermints, which I love, but I have been using their shampoo and conditioner for damaged hair and that&#x27;s great too, which smells like oranges.</li>
            <li>It smells great and of course being cruelty free-what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li>smells good, feels good, just wish for more foams.</li>
            <li>This was my first foray into sulfate-free shampoos -- not the best choice.  </li>
            <li>Tea tree has many benefits for your skin in itself!</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>so what more can you ask for!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love the value that the three pack gives!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I am glad I did not do that!</li>
            <li>Refreshing and tingly on the scalp!</li>
            <li>Being a Man working with horses, I need something to strip away the sweat, and this shampoo does it better than anything else I have tried and I especially love the ice cool sensation it leaves afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love the scent and how clean it gets my hair without SLS!!!</li>
            <li>Plus, peppermint felt amazing.</li>
            <li>Both are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li>the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li>I pair this with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>You really do feel tingling and is invigorating, which is especially great in the morning when you are trying to wake up.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t yield the &#x27;tingle&#x27; on the scalp that some tea tree items are apt to do.  </li>
            <li>Nice hair.</li>
            <li>I bought this because my Sisterlock Consultant likes the brand and uses this kind in her salon.</li>
            <li>This fits the bill nicely and leaves my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li>Additionally, this shampoo produces a nice, tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>The peppermint oil really does make my scalp feel somewhat &amp;#34;invigorated,&amp;#34; and, best of all, so for no signs of an itchy, flaky scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo,because it smells good and my hair scurf has gone after using it.</li>
            <li>Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li>maybe once a week when my hair reaches the shoulders) along with a shampoo massage comb that can easily be found on Amazon for a good price.  </li>
            <li>Love this so much and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li>Great quality and quick delivery</li>
            <li>Very strong, cause some irritation.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up very easily.</li>
            <li>Even more amazing?</li>
            <li>The best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>A refreshing shampoo with effective cleansing result and soothing feeling.</li>
            <li>Amazon, as always, was easy with returns!</li>
            <li>Love Love Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li>They work very well on my hair and smell good!</li>
            <li>I tried it and fell in love with it&#x27;s simplicity of scents and consistency.</li>
            <li>thank you so much son hair does well using this and its always a great price have a Blessed Thjanksgiven</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>BETTER results than Selsun.</li>
            <li>Although some people say it may be safe to use every week, at the end of the day, it is still a clarifying shampoo, and most shampoos (safe or not)</li>
            <li>I love the spicy feeling on the head.</li>
            <li>The mint scent is SOOOO refreshing.</li>
            <li>my favorite shampoo...</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have curly hair that tends to be frizzy and love the softness, smoothness and bounce</li>
            <li>I LOVE the tingle I get when I wash and</li>
            <li>I like this one SO much better.</li>
            <li>It smells better and feels better.</li>
            <li>I love Giovanni TTTT Shampoo.  </li>
            <li>It does invigorate the scalp and tingle a bit, which I love.  </li>
            <li>More so than any rx ever did.</li>
            <li>Way better than Wen products.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, no regret at all.</li>
            <li>This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love all of the Giovanni Tea Tree Triple products.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several years and I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure which to believe.</li>
            <li>I love the stuff.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo, my daughter and I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li>Giovanni&#x27;s shampoo is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather a ton, but then, I wouldn&#x27;t want it to. :)</li>
            <li>Most often, this results in a tea tree formula, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li>I did not immediately attribute this upsetting occurrence to the shampoo, after all the ingredients look so wonderful, but having tried it three times and arriving at the same result leaves not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that the shampoo is to blame.</li>
            <li>I love everything about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li>You are probably better off using shampoo with SLS.</li>
            <li>Also, I love the smell of it</li>
            <li>Light and effective without stripping my color-treated hair....</li>
            <li>My fianc√© and I LOVE this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo for here in Texas where we sweat a lot.</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil is refreshing on your scalp.</li>
            <li>Make sure to keep out of your eyes.</li>
            <li>That is not so refreshing.</li>
            <li>Ok to use on dyed hair.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo and may help avoid getting lice.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li>Your hair feels very clean after using it - helps control oil.  </li>
            <li>These are the full size bottles, which is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to see it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>I really love these shampoos, it leaves a refreshing and clean feeling after every use.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I found this product (wish the conditioner was also available, but found it at Target)  </li>
            <li>I love that this product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast, good buy.</li>
            <li>I have bought other shampoos with tea tree oil and mint, but this is the best.</li>
            <li>Great for oily to normal hair, and a good natural shampoo for the relief of dandruff or seborrhea.</li>
            <li>Love the clean smell and the wash</li>
            <li>Gentle on my sensitive scalp, cleans, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a fan of strong smells or anything with a lot of unpronounceable chemicals.</li>
            <li>Product still works fine...</li>
            <li>/&gt;a lot of my fine hair in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gentle but effective and doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly after a shower.</li>
            <li>I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>They used to sell this at Costco in huge vat sizes about 1.5 years ago, but I no longer can find them.</li>
            <li>After doing my research online and reading great reviews, I bought 1 bottle locally to try it and have bought another 3 bottles through Amazon.</li>
            <li>It is for sure worth a try.</li>
            <li>I have acne prone skin, and noticed with non SLS free shampoos</li>
            <li>(I have since switched to SLS free body wash instead of bar soap).</li>
            <li>I bought the big bottle (33.5 oz) from Marshalls (great value)</li>
            <li>so needed a good natural shampoo.</li>
            <li>The natural ingredients appealed to me, and the tingle a bonus given the good reports I saw.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t even feel clean, doesn&#x27;t smell good, isn&#x27;t soft, nothing.</li>
            <li>You can use a much smaller amount than normal and the price per ounce is the best.</li>
            <li>The first time this happened, I requested for another package hoping for better luck.</li>
            <li>Seems this is what clean hair and scalp should feel like.  </li>
            <li>Leads scalp feeling clean without over drying hair.</li>
            <li>It rinses away and feels clean.</li>
            <li>However it doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair feeling clean, no residue, but not drying.</li>
            <li>My hair feels truly clean afterwards, not just laden with perfumes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not great at this reviewing stuff, but I think this is an excellent product and have already bought it for friends (who also LOVE it).</li>
            <li>IT ALSO LEAVES THE HAIR AND SCALP CLEAN.</li>
            <li>By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean.</li>
            <li>B0081UADQM ABBA COLOR PROTECTION SHAMPOO 33.8 OZ (FORMERLY PURE COLOR PROTECT) UNISEX]], which I love.</li>
            <li>Very good at stripping oil from the hair without seeming too harsh.</li>
            <li>(as I do with all shampoos because of the oils in my hair) but the second pump, It really cleaned well, and surprisingly did not strip my hair making it feel like straw like most shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I IMMEDIATELY SWITCHED BACK TO THIS , MAKES MY HAIR MORE MANAGEABLE AND SOFT , ALSO FEELS REFRESHING ON THE SCALP !!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it, love that it&#x27;s Eco friendly</li>
            <li>Luckily, the corresponding conditioner is good enough to fix the frizz.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, the product is great.</li>
            <li>It makes my scalp tingle and makes my hair feel so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>My favorite natural shampoo, sulfate free, not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>Use this product and you might become brand loyal to it.</li>
            <li>THE SMELL OF TEA TREE OIL DISAPATES QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if the formula has changed, as the product label is the same, but the clear stuff I use is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Works great cleaning my scalp with less harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li>I love this because it leaves my hair feeling clean and smells fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li>, I think it does a great job on my hair, which is fairly long and fine, so it tends to get greasy and flat easily.</li>
            <li>Love the smell, not hard on my hair and rinses easily in my water (high mineral content).  </li>
            <li>To my knowledge: 1) sulfate free shampoos don&#x27;t cause as much lather, 2)</li>
            <li>I think that Giovanni has grown in popularity because it&#x27;s widely available at Wal-mart and Target for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>Great cleansing power, but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is not invigorating, doesn&#x27;t do anything for dandruff (the line sells a dandruff shampoo), and I don&#x27;t like the ingredients since I am more into natural shampoos.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh light scent and doesn&#x27;t tingle too much.</li>
            <li>This is the 4th shampoo (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to say; this is a super product, leaves your scalp tingling and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very nice (even for a guy) and relatively inexpensive for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I have 4B textured hair and use a lot of oils and product during the week and this really gets it clean to start fresh each week.</li>
            <li>Good shampoo and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in my hair like other shampoos.  </li>
            <li>The smell also doesn&#x27;t seem right, and the bottle is overflowing and watery.</li>
            <li>for oily hair, but hair really feels clean when done</li>
            <li>most of the time and use a moisturizing shampoo once a month to get rid of build-up, but now that I am about to take swimming lessons, I learned something new about clarifying shampoos and how important it is to use every once in awhile in place of your moisturizing shampoos because even those particular shampoos do not do its job to clean the scalp if there is still build up of natural oils and moisturizers in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying again for certain!</li>
            <li>It appears to be a cheap knock-off of the real thing in the real thing&#x27;s bottle.</li>
            <li>While your price is lower than in the store, it does little good if the product leaks while being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I have no complaints as of now and am happy with my purchase as hard as it was to find.</li>
            <li>Works great for living in a hard water area, which has given me dandruff.</li>
            <li>I only use tea tree shampoo and this is my favorite of the seven brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>I first started using this shampoo about 10 years ago when Costco sold it.  </li>
            <li>I made that mistake at first and almost stop using the products all together.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately they no longer carry this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s unusual in today&#x27;s shampoo !</li>
            <li>However product smells exactly like polo mints.</li>
            <li>and he really likes the shampoo!</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo - shipped the next day!</li>
            <li>We used to buy it at Walmart, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey 8 Oz for 7/8$.</li>
            <li>Bought this at my local Target store and love it.</li>
            <li>I used to use this product a good deal last year and it left my hair clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>If you really want the full benefit of a scalp circulation shampoo, but you have curly hair and can&#x27;t really brush it like those with straight hair, I really recommend a shampoo massager for use when lathering.  </li>
            <li>I do notice that it is more of a clarifying shampoo and not moisturizing so it does feel really dry after I wash</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning and manageability worked fine, but by about the second time around my scalp began to itch, and from that point on the itch worsened with each application.  </li>
            <li>A pretty decent shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Giovanna products for a while, but this was the first time I used this particular shampoo.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo if you&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different brands and aren&#x27;t satisfied with one in particular.  </li>
            <li>I thought to myself this had better be worth it for all of this trouble to find, and indeed it was.</li>
            <li>Shippers need to be more careful in packing to avoid leaking</li>
            <li>I rubbed the (REALLY foamy) liquid into my scalp and massaged.</li>
            <li>and it really balances out my hair.</li>
            <li>I will know in time how I will really feel about it.</li>
            <li>The shampoos had leaked and the whole package was sticky.</li>
            <li>I use to use whole foods 365 brand shampoo</li>
            <li>but I never felt it really cleaned my hair</li>
            <li>I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li>I think the tea tree oil really hydrates.</li>
            <li>THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT AND THE FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li>Not the real shampoo.  </li>
            <li>it was a gift for my brother, fast shipping</li>
            <li>It is absolutely unsuitable for my hair.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this for guys!</li>
            <li>My hope in this shampoo was to find something gentle on hair color.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The product came quickly, because I happen to live near an Amazon location.  </li>
            <li>It cleans better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li>My hair is left clean</li>
            <li>Also Jason Natural Daily Shampoo Fragrance Free is terrific as well and gives me shiny, clean, frizz-free curls.  </li>
            <li>Aside from the fact it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical additives, not even the &#x27;cleaning&#x27; sulfates and such (and, hence, doesn&#x27;t lather up like many shampoos), it leaves hair shiny, fluffy and just feeling clean.  </li>
            <li>however I follow up with their 50/50 conditioner or smooth as silk and my hair is back to feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Effective and environmental friendly, but the product was opened (presuming due to pressure change) and it leaked a little during shipment.  </li>
            <li>This high demand, I think, has caused them to cut corners on the formula.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>All in all, I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Even high end salon brands haven&#x27;t helped me one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I also add a bit of coconut oil on my ends before blow drying my hair and my hair is so shiny and soft!!</li>
            <li>As a woman with natural 4a hair, my hair is very picky about shampoos.</li>
            <li>Nothing has made my hair feel as silky and soft like Giovanni has, and I have tried absolutely everything.</li>
            <li>and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li>LEAVES IT VERY SHINY AND SOFT.  </li>
            <li>On top of that, this shampoo seems too harsh.  </li>
            <li>I applied the shampoo as normal, but I let it sit on my scalp for around 5 mins</li>
            <li>I tried this shampoo (8.5 oz Giovanni Hair Care) after my favorite national-brand but limited distribution company was acquired by a conglomerate that subsequently stopped producing that particular product.  </li>
            <li>TJ&#x27;s brand always left my hair feeling stripped and dry after using it, but this Giovanni one is much more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>These were sold in a pack of 2 incredibly large shampoos bottles (25 fl oz each) plus equally large conditioner bottle for a total of $16.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It took me forever and a day to find this stuff along with the conditioner and two states (I live on the borderline).</li>
            <li>It worked well in Washington State but in New Orleans gave no body.  </li>
            <li>and I cannot get it where I live</li>
            <li>and this has been a live saver.</li>
            <li>Started ordering it from Amazon when we moved to a new area</li>
            <li>My hair feels super dry when I use this.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It has helped my Dandruff and on the first wash got rid of the oily spot on the back of my head.</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS &#x27;GREEN&#x27; PRODUCT !</li>
            <li>Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Triple shampoo is, so far at least, my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li>When I bought it for the first time, I was worried I would have the same result that I did with salon tea tree oil shampoo.  </li>
            <li>sulfate free shampoos should be less damaging.  </li>
            <li>Because of that, I&#x27;ve only been using this for one wash per week, but, so far, it seems to be working really well!  </li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp, with a tendency towards flaking, and am always on the lookout for &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; natural shampoo remedy.  </li>
            <li>After using products on my hair to define curls and resist heat and damage, I can tell my hair needs a deep clean when it starts to fall flat not work the way I want it to.</li>
            <li>It was only pure luck that these did not leak in transit.  </li>
            <li>- This had a very high shipping cost relative to the purchase price - a 50% premium.  </li>
            <li>Also, it used to be clear.  </li>
            <li>I get from the clear formula.</li>
            <li>I saw these on sale at Whole Foods recently if you&#x27;re looking for a brick and mortar shop.</li>
            <li>I was using Selsun Blue&#x27;s medicated for severe dandruff when I became really bothered by all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>All the ingredients that I read were...98% natural -</li>
            <li>Naturally.    </li>
            <li>As happens frequently at Costco, they stopped carrying it within a year or so</li>
            <li>That has COMPLETELY STOPPED with this product.....</li>
            <li>Oil, Soybean (Glycine Soja) Protein, C12 14 Oleifin Sulfonate (Coconut Derived), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Trace Minerals, Citric Acid (Corn), Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Sodium Chloride (Sea Salt), Grapefruit Seed (Citrus Derived)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have extremely sensitive skin and severe eczema</li>
            <li>, this 3-pack deal beats any sale at a natural grocery store.  </li>
            <li>Whenever I have a headache I shower and use this shampoo it almost always relives my headaches, (which I get frequently).</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny and looks like virgin hair.  </li>
            <li>It contains no harsh ingredients like surfactants (SLS) or parabens.  </li>
            <li>I have a family of sensitive little heads full of curls.  </li>
            <li>I have fluffy/curly hair that I&#x27;ve grown out a few times over the last few years and Giovanni has been the most consistent shampoo of the other often suggested scalp friendly</li>
            <li>Nothing really worked for long, until, 2 or 3 months ago, I got a sample of Giovanni tea tree oil shampoo.</li>
            <li>Like reviewers before me, I noticed the new yellowish color the shampoo has and WILL NOT buy it based on several reviews that I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>Giovanni, on the other hand, does not have any wheat ingredients and is very gentle to my hair.  </li>
            <li>It is very sensitive, and the fact that I live in Michigan, it is easily dry and is always hungry for moisture, so I was concerned about how this shampoo would work out.</li>
            <li>This shampoo is a little more drying than other Giovanni shampoos.</li>
            <li>I have seen a major reduction in scalp itchiness after using this and its accompanying conditioner.</li>
            <li>or I have major problems.  </li>
            <li>It does not contain laurel/laureth sulfates, but it still feels thick &amp; sudsy (sssooo nice when you&#x27;re used to other runny &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos).</li>
            <li>Gentle on my very dry and course hair.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and clean without leaving any icky residue.</li>
            <li>My son developed allergies in his 20s and especially in his scalp area.  </li>
            <li>One bottle was near empty and all over the box, it took me 20 minutes to clean up the mess.</li>
            <li>The tea tree oil also made my scalp itch something fierce the first week I used it, but has since calmed down</li>
            <li>Although it smells great, my hair looked noticeably bad after the first and second try of Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat in comparison to other shampoos&#x27; effects on my wavy, slightly-prone-to-frizz hair.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my two year old who is prone to dry patches on her scalp, and on my five year old because tea tree oil can help repel lice.</li>
            <li>I have used this product twice and already, I am having the exact same problems as some of the other reviewers on here.</li>
            <li>I switched back to my Shikai shampoo and my hair is back to being shiny, soft, curly and frizz-free after using it.  </li>
            <li>I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean, and together with the matching conditioner which makes tangles easily removed by running my fingers through or with a brush.</li>
            <li>I agree with the other reviewer that it does feel a little bit more dry after washing, but I use a conditioner, so it&#x27;s not an issue for me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used almost everything - big name brands (H&amp;S, Garnier, Selsun Blue), generic brands, salicylic acid, lotion, exfoliation, pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, nearly everything.</li>
            <li>I recently bought a huge bottle from an outlet store that should last me several months, at least.</li>
            <li>My sensitive scalp never feels irritated, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry or stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This shampoo is incredible.  </li>
            <li> Anyway it smelled SO GOOD!</li>
            <li> These products are amazing and provide him with excellent relief.</li>
            <li> The Giovanni does, however, work great for my husband who has dreadlocks which is why I didn&#x27;t give the shampoo one or two stars.</li>
            <li> Works great as shampoo or body wash.</li>
            <li> Great for all hair types.</li>
            <li> My hair feels cleaner after washing, there&#x27;s a tingly sensation, and the smell is great.     </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> The three-pack saves me money, too, so this greatly exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo.</li>
            <li> I recommend search around for a lower price on the internet (vitacost has great prices).</li>
            <li> great</li>
            <li> Great tingly feeling is perfect to heal scalp and it smells nice as well.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to apply to scalp and lengths, smells wonderfully, and leaves hair feeling well cleansed.  </li>
            <li> to Paul Mitchell which isn&#x27;t perfect but a heck of a lot better than this stuff for me.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, my hair feels cleaner, thicker and smells great!</li>
            <li> I had already heard good things about but never wanted to try because of the smell).</li>
            <li> Good choice.</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s organic, made in the USA and SLS free is great!</li>
            <li> Even while working it through in the shower you can tell it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the under $8 shampoos.</li>
            <li> This was fairly good shampoo.</li>
            <li> I changed it to organic argan oil shampoo and voi la, in a week I have gorgeous hair using NO conditioner.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The shampoo (and conditioner) have a very refreshing, almost minty aroma and leave a very pleasant cool feeling on my scalp when I rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> i love that i can buy this in bulk at a great price</li>
            <li> tea tree smells just like peppermints, which I love, but I have been using their shampoo and conditioner for damaged hair and that&#x27;s great too, which smells like oranges.</li>
            <li> It smells great and of course being cruelty free-what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> smells good, feels good, just wish for more foams.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into sulfate-free shampoos -- not the best choice.  </li>
            <li> Tea tree has many benefits for your skin in itself!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> so what more can you ask for!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love the value that the three pack gives!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I am glad I did not do that!</li>
            <li> Refreshing and tingly on the scalp!</li>
            <li> Being a Man working with horses, I need something to strip away the sweat, and this shampoo does it better than anything else I have tried and I especially love the ice cool sensation it leaves afterwards.</li>
            <li> I love the scent and how clean it gets my hair without SLS!!!</li>
            <li> Plus, peppermint felt amazing.</li>
            <li> Both are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> the scent is amazing.</li>
            <li> I pair this with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> You really do feel tingling and is invigorating, which is especially great in the morning when you are trying to wake up.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t yield the &#x27;tingle&#x27; on the scalp that some tea tree items are apt to do.  </li>
            <li> Nice hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Sisterlock Consultant likes the brand and uses this kind in her salon.</li>
            <li> This fits the bill nicely and leaves my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li> Additionally, this shampoo produces a nice, tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> The peppermint oil really does make my scalp feel somewhat &amp;#34;invigorated,&amp;#34; and, best of all, so for no signs of an itchy, flaky scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo,because it smells good and my hair scurf has gone after using it.</li>
            <li> Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> maybe once a week when my hair reaches the shoulders) along with a shampoo massage comb that can easily be found on Amazon for a good price.  </li>
            <li> Love this so much and the price is perfect.</li>
            <li> Great quality and quick delivery</li>
            <li> Very strong, cause some irritation.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up very easily.</li>
            <li> Even more amazing?</li>
            <li> The best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> A refreshing shampoo with effective cleansing result and soothing feeling.</li>
            <li> Amazon, as always, was easy with returns!</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> They work very well on my hair and smell good!</li>
            <li> I tried it and fell in love with it&#x27;s simplicity of scents and consistency.</li>
            <li> thank you so much son hair does well using this and its always a great price have a Blessed Thjanksgiven</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> BETTER results than Selsun.</li>
            <li> Although some people say it may be safe to use every week, at the end of the day, it is still a clarifying shampoo, and most shampoos (safe or not)</li>
            <li> I love the spicy feeling on the head.</li>
            <li> The mint scent is SOOOO refreshing.</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo...</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have curly hair that tends to be frizzy and love the softness, smoothness and bounce</li>
            <li> I LOVE the tingle I get when I wash and</li>
            <li> I like this one SO much better.</li>
            <li> It smells better and feels better.</li>
            <li> I love Giovanni TTTT Shampoo.  </li>
            <li> It does invigorate the scalp and tingle a bit, which I love.  </li>
            <li> More so than any rx ever did.</li>
            <li> Way better than Wen products.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, no regret at all.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love all of the Giovanni Tea Tree Triple products.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several years and I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure which to believe.</li>
            <li> I love the stuff.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, my daughter and I have been using it for years.</li>
            <li> Giovanni&#x27;s shampoo is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather a ton, but then, I wouldn&#x27;t want it to. :)</li>
            <li> Most often, this results in a tea tree formula, and I have tried many.  </li>
            <li> I did not immediately attribute this upsetting occurrence to the shampoo, after all the ingredients look so wonderful, but having tried it three times and arriving at the same result leaves not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that the shampoo is to blame.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shampoo.  </li>
            <li> You are probably better off using shampoo with SLS.</li>
            <li> Also, I love the smell of it</li>
            <li> Light and effective without stripping my color-treated hair....</li>
            <li> My fianc√© and I LOVE this shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo for here in Texas where we sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil is refreshing on your scalp.</li>
            <li> Make sure to keep out of your eyes.</li>
            <li> That is not so refreshing.</li>
            <li> Ok to use on dyed hair.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and may help avoid getting lice.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> Your hair feels very clean after using it - helps control oil.  </li>
            <li> These are the full size bottles, which is amazing for the price.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to see it on Amazon!  </li>
            <li> I really love these shampoos, it leaves a refreshing and clean feeling after every use.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product (wish the conditioner was also available, but found it at Target)  </li>
            <li> I love that this product is cruelty free.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, good buy.</li>
            <li> I have bought other shampoos with tea tree oil and mint, but this is the best.</li>
            <li> Great for oily to normal hair, and a good natural shampoo for the relief of dandruff or seborrhea.</li>
            <li> Love the clean smell and the wash</li>
            <li> Gentle on my sensitive scalp, cleans, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a fan of strong smells or anything with a lot of unpronounceable chemicals.</li>
            <li> Product still works fine...</li>
            <li> /&gt;a lot of my fine hair in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gentle but effective and doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly after a shower.</li>
            <li> I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> They used to sell this at Costco in huge vat sizes about 1.5 years ago, but I no longer can find them.</li>
            <li> After doing my research online and reading great reviews, I bought 1 bottle locally to try it and have bought another 3 bottles through Amazon.</li>
            <li> It is for sure worth a try.</li>
            <li> I have acne prone skin, and noticed with non SLS free shampoos</li>
            <li> (I have since switched to SLS free body wash instead of bar soap).</li>
            <li> I bought the big bottle (33.5 oz) from Marshalls (great value)</li>
            <li> so needed a good natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> The natural ingredients appealed to me, and the tingle a bonus given the good reports I saw.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t even feel clean, doesn&#x27;t smell good, isn&#x27;t soft, nothing.</li>
            <li> You can use a much smaller amount than normal and the price per ounce is the best.</li>
            <li> The first time this happened, I requested for another package hoping for better luck.</li>
            <li> Seems this is what clean hair and scalp should feel like.  </li>
            <li> Leads scalp feeling clean without over drying hair.</li>
            <li> It rinses away and feels clean.</li>
            <li> However it doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean, no residue, but not drying.</li>
            <li> My hair feels truly clean afterwards, not just laden with perfumes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not great at this reviewing stuff, but I think this is an excellent product and have already bought it for friends (who also LOVE it).</li>
            <li> IT ALSO LEAVES THE HAIR AND SCALP CLEAN.</li>
            <li> By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean.</li>
            <li> B0081UADQM ABBA COLOR PROTECTION SHAMPOO 33.8 OZ (FORMERLY PURE COLOR PROTECT) UNISEX]], which I love.</li>
            <li> Very good at stripping oil from the hair without seeming too harsh.</li>
            <li> (as I do with all shampoos because of the oils in my hair) but the second pump, It really cleaned well, and surprisingly did not strip my hair making it feel like straw like most shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I IMMEDIATELY SWITCHED BACK TO THIS , MAKES MY HAIR MORE MANAGEABLE AND SOFT , ALSO FEELS REFRESHING ON THE SCALP !!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it, love that it&#x27;s Eco friendly</li>
            <li> Luckily, the corresponding conditioner is good enough to fix the frizz.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, the product is great.</li>
            <li> It makes my scalp tingle and makes my hair feel so clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li> My favorite natural shampoo, sulfate free, not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> Use this product and you might become brand loyal to it.</li>
            <li> THE SMELL OF TEA TREE OIL DISAPATES QUICKLY.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if the formula has changed, as the product label is the same, but the clear stuff I use is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Works great cleaning my scalp with less harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I love this because it leaves my hair feeling clean and smells fresh and natural.  </li>
            <li> , I think it does a great job on my hair, which is fairly long and fine, so it tends to get greasy and flat easily.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, not hard on my hair and rinses easily in my water (high mineral content).  </li>
            <li> To my knowledge: 1) sulfate free shampoos don&#x27;t cause as much lather, 2)</li>
            <li> I think that Giovanni has grown in popularity because it&#x27;s widely available at Wal-mart and Target for a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> Great cleansing power, but not for everyday use.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is not invigorating, doesn&#x27;t do anything for dandruff (the line sells a dandruff shampoo), and I don&#x27;t like the ingredients since I am more into natural shampoos.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh light scent and doesn&#x27;t tingle too much.</li>
            <li> This is the 4th shampoo (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say; this is a super product, leaves your scalp tingling and feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very nice (even for a guy) and relatively inexpensive for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have 4B textured hair and use a lot of oils and product during the week and this really gets it clean to start fresh each week.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in my hair like other shampoos.  </li>
            <li> The smell also doesn&#x27;t seem right, and the bottle is overflowing and watery.</li>
            <li> for oily hair, but hair really feels clean when done</li>
            <li> most of the time and use a moisturizing shampoo once a month to get rid of build-up, but now that I am about to take swimming lessons, I learned something new about clarifying shampoos and how important it is to use every once in awhile in place of your moisturizing shampoos because even those particular shampoos do not do its job to clean the scalp if there is still build up of natural oils and moisturizers in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying again for certain!</li>
            <li> It appears to be a cheap knock-off of the real thing in the real thing&#x27;s bottle.</li>
            <li> While your price is lower than in the store, it does little good if the product leaks while being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I have no complaints as of now and am happy with my purchase as hard as it was to find.</li>
            <li> Works great for living in a hard water area, which has given me dandruff.</li>
            <li> I only use tea tree shampoo and this is my favorite of the seven brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I first started using this shampoo about 10 years ago when Costco sold it.  </li>
            <li> I made that mistake at first and almost stop using the products all together.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately they no longer carry this wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s unusual in today&#x27;s shampoo !</li>
            <li> However product smells exactly like polo mints.</li>
            <li> and he really likes the shampoo!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo - shipped the next day!</li>
            <li> We used to buy it at Walmart, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey 8 Oz for 7/8$.</li>
            <li> Bought this at my local Target store and love it.</li>
            <li> I used to use this product a good deal last year and it left my hair clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> If you really want the full benefit of a scalp circulation shampoo, but you have curly hair and can&#x27;t really brush it like those with straight hair, I really recommend a shampoo massager for use when lathering.  </li>
            <li> I do notice that it is more of a clarifying shampoo and not moisturizing so it does feel really dry after I wash</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning and manageability worked fine, but by about the second time around my scalp began to itch, and from that point on the itch worsened with each application.  </li>
            <li> A pretty decent shampoo for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Giovanna products for a while, but this was the first time I used this particular shampoo.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo if you&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different brands and aren&#x27;t satisfied with one in particular.  </li>
            <li> I thought to myself this had better be worth it for all of this trouble to find, and indeed it was.</li>
            <li> Shippers need to be more careful in packing to avoid leaking</li>
            <li> I rubbed the (REALLY foamy) liquid into my scalp and massaged.</li>
            <li> and it really balances out my hair.</li>
            <li> I will know in time how I will really feel about it.</li>
            <li> The shampoos had leaked and the whole package was sticky.</li>
            <li> I use to use whole foods 365 brand shampoo</li>
            <li> but I never felt it really cleaned my hair</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo</li>
            <li> I think the tea tree oil really hydrates.</li>
            <li> THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT AND THE FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> Not the real shampoo.  </li>
            <li> it was a gift for my brother, fast shipping</li>
            <li> It is absolutely unsuitable for my hair.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this for guys!</li>
            <li> My hope in this shampoo was to find something gentle on hair color.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> The product came quickly, because I happen to live near an Amazon location.  </li>
            <li> It cleans better than any other shampoo.</li>
            <li> My hair is left clean</li>
            <li> Also Jason Natural Daily Shampoo Fragrance Free is terrific as well and gives me shiny, clean, frizz-free curls.  </li>
            <li> Aside from the fact it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical additives, not even the &#x27;cleaning&#x27; sulfates and such (and, hence, doesn&#x27;t lather up like many shampoos), it leaves hair shiny, fluffy and just feeling clean.  </li>
            <li> however I follow up with their 50/50 conditioner or smooth as silk and my hair is back to feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Effective and environmental friendly, but the product was opened (presuming due to pressure change) and it leaked a little during shipment.  </li>
            <li> This high demand, I think, has caused them to cut corners on the formula.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> All in all, I highly recommend this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Even high end salon brands haven&#x27;t helped me one bit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I also add a bit of coconut oil on my ends before blow drying my hair and my hair is so shiny and soft!!</li>
            <li> As a woman with natural 4a hair, my hair is very picky about shampoos.</li>
            <li> Nothing has made my hair feel as silky and soft like Giovanni has, and I have tried absolutely everything.</li>
            <li> and I really like it so far.</li>
            <li> LEAVES IT VERY SHINY AND SOFT.  </li>
            <li> On top of that, this shampoo seems too harsh.  </li>
            <li> I applied the shampoo as normal, but I let it sit on my scalp for around 5 mins</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo (8.5 oz Giovanni Hair Care) after my favorite national-brand but limited distribution company was acquired by a conglomerate that subsequently stopped producing that particular product.  </li>
            <li> TJ&#x27;s brand always left my hair feeling stripped and dry after using it, but this Giovanni one is much more moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> These were sold in a pack of 2 incredibly large shampoos bottles (25 fl oz each) plus equally large conditioner bottle for a total of $16.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It took me forever and a day to find this stuff along with the conditioner and two states (I live on the borderline).</li>
            <li> It worked well in Washington State but in New Orleans gave no body.  </li>
            <li> and I cannot get it where I live</li>
            <li> and this has been a live saver.</li>
            <li> Started ordering it from Amazon when we moved to a new area</li>
            <li> My hair feels super dry when I use this.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It has helped my Dandruff and on the first wash got rid of the oily spot on the back of my head.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS &#x27;GREEN&#x27; PRODUCT !</li>
            <li> Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Triple shampoo is, so far at least, my absolute favorite.  </li>
            <li> When I bought it for the first time, I was worried I would have the same result that I did with salon tea tree oil shampoo.  </li>
            <li> sulfate free shampoos should be less damaging.  </li>
            <li> Because of that, I&#x27;ve only been using this for one wash per week, but, so far, it seems to be working really well!  </li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp, with a tendency towards flaking, and am always on the lookout for &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; natural shampoo remedy.  </li>
            <li> After using products on my hair to define curls and resist heat and damage, I can tell my hair needs a deep clean when it starts to fall flat not work the way I want it to.</li>
            <li> It was only pure luck that these did not leak in transit.  </li>
            <li> - This had a very high shipping cost relative to the purchase price - a 50% premium.  </li>
            <li> Also, it used to be clear.  </li>
            <li> I get from the clear formula.</li>
            <li> I saw these on sale at Whole Foods recently if you&#x27;re looking for a brick and mortar shop.</li>
            <li> I was using Selsun Blue&#x27;s medicated for severe dandruff when I became really bothered by all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> All the ingredients that I read were...98% natural -</li>
            <li> Naturally.    </li>
            <li> As happens frequently at Costco, they stopped carrying it within a year or so</li>
            <li> That has COMPLETELY STOPPED with this product.....</li>
            <li> Oil, Soybean (Glycine Soja) Protein, C12 14 Oleifin Sulfonate (Coconut Derived), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Trace Minerals, Citric Acid (Corn), Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Sodium Chloride (Sea Salt), Grapefruit Seed (Citrus Derived)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have extremely sensitive skin and severe eczema</li>
            <li> , this 3-pack deal beats any sale at a natural grocery store.  </li>
            <li> Whenever I have a headache I shower and use this shampoo it almost always relives my headaches, (which I get frequently).</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny and looks like virgin hair.  </li>
            <li> It contains no harsh ingredients like surfactants (SLS) or parabens.  </li>
            <li> I have a family of sensitive little heads full of curls.  </li>
            <li> I have fluffy/curly hair that I&#x27;ve grown out a few times over the last few years and Giovanni has been the most consistent shampoo of the other often suggested scalp friendly</li>
            <li> Nothing really worked for long, until, 2 or 3 months ago, I got a sample of Giovanni tea tree oil shampoo.</li>
            <li> Like reviewers before me, I noticed the new yellowish color the shampoo has and WILL NOT buy it based on several reviews that I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> Giovanni, on the other hand, does not have any wheat ingredients and is very gentle to my hair.  </li>
            <li> It is very sensitive, and the fact that I live in Michigan, it is easily dry and is always hungry for moisture, so I was concerned about how this shampoo would work out.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a little more drying than other Giovanni shampoos.</li>
            <li> I have seen a major reduction in scalp itchiness after using this and its accompanying conditioner.</li>
            <li> or I have major problems.  </li>
            <li> It does not contain laurel/laureth sulfates, but it still feels thick &amp; sudsy (sssooo nice when you&#x27;re used to other runny &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos).</li>
            <li> Gentle on my very dry and course hair.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and clean without leaving any icky residue.</li>
            <li> My son developed allergies in his 20s and especially in his scalp area.  </li>
            <li> One bottle was near empty and all over the box, it took me 20 minutes to clean up the mess.</li>
            <li> The tea tree oil also made my scalp itch something fierce the first week I used it, but has since calmed down</li>
            <li> Although it smells great, my hair looked noticeably bad after the first and second try of Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat in comparison to other shampoos&#x27; effects on my wavy, slightly-prone-to-frizz hair.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my two year old who is prone to dry patches on her scalp, and on my five year old because tea tree oil can help repel lice.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice and already, I am having the exact same problems as some of the other reviewers on here.</li>
            <li> I switched back to my Shikai shampoo and my hair is back to being shiny, soft, curly and frizz-free after using it.  </li>
            <li> I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean, and together with the matching conditioner which makes tangles easily removed by running my fingers through or with a brush.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that it does feel a little bit more dry after washing, but I use a conditioner, so it&#x27;s not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used almost everything - big name brands (H&amp;S, Garnier, Selsun Blue), generic brands, salicylic acid, lotion, exfoliation, pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, nearly everything.</li>
            <li> I recently bought a huge bottle from an outlet store that should last me several months, at least.</li>
            <li> My sensitive scalp never feels irritated, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry or stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve washed my hair exclusively with it for the past six years and would not consider using any other product - the feeling of clean is pervasive.</li>
            <li> this shampoo and have used a long time&lt;br /&gt;but notice over last months&lt;</li>
            <li> Your hair is so soft &amp; manageable without being weighed down.</li>
            <li> He occasionally gets dry scalp, and this takes care of that problem.</li>
            <li> AND THIS WAS THE FIRST SHAMPOO AND CONDITION I HAVE TRIED ON MY VERY LONG AND THICK HAIR..</li>
            <li> I am annoyed by the fact that the product is a little pricey, the smell doesn&#x27;t really stay, and that it foams up SO much (tons of dense bubbles),</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years now, and know that the Tea Tree Triple Threat is a clear color.</li>
            <li> If I remember correctly there was one ingredient that was not natural.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewer that noticed that it is now yellow.  </li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a week and Giovanni&#x27;s regular conditioner the other days.  </li>
            <li> no, the shampoo seems to dry out my hair and cause it to be frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I have greasy roots and dry ends</li>
            <li> If you have dry hair this shampoo is not for you.</li>
            <li> It also seems that my hair is not as dry.</li>
            <li> my back would become irritated quite quickly (due to the suds running down my back when rinsing).</li>
            <li> Considering the very expensive shipping, the seller should have made sure the items were packed</li>
            <li> The 3 bottles were wrapped in plastic this time, rather than loosely packed.  </li>
            <li> It has been difficult to find lately; I looked in local super markets, WalMart and Target, but they only seem to have the yellow stuff.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, a little goes a long way, so a bottle lasts me (I have short hair) about six weeks.  </li>
            <li> I noticed this time that the order is fulfilled by Amazon, without any mention of the previous seller back in March.  </li>
            <li> The wrapper kept it from ruining the entire order, but still there was a little product loss</li>
            <li> It is hard to find a shampoo like this that contains no s. laureath&#x27;s while containing peppermint, as well as comprising of completely natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> This could be a plus or minus, depending on your viewpoint.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree shampoo for a few years since I had heard that it was the same formulation as the Giovanni one.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, so was disappointed to open my package and find that all three bottles have a dark yellowish color.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been harder to find in the stores.</li>
            <li> Unlike other organic hair products it doesn&#x27;t cost $8 to $20 a bottle.  </li>
            <li> One state sold the conditioner, and the other state sold the shampoo.</li>
            <li> The other days, I use [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I use it every other day</li>
            <li> I have greasy hair and wash every other day.  </li>
            <li> The problem with the other shampoo was that it had wheat germ oil in it</li>
            <li> Plus, the day after shower day I&#x27;d always get a few dry patches here and there.     </li>
            <li> I just used the Giovanni Tea Tree Shampoo last week and my hair was dull and frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been flat ironing, curling, coloring and bleaching my hair for at least 6 years now and have extreme damage and dryness.</li>
            <li> The bottles were shipped on their sides, unsecured, with no tape or wrapping holding down the lids.  </li>
            <li> to Amazon: When shipping liquid products like this, please tape down the lids and pack them in shrink-wrap plastic to avoid leaks and spills.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Giovanni shampoo, conditioner and their re-constructor for about a week now, and WOW has it made a dramatic difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> and my scalp seems to be healthier with less dandruff.  </li>
            <li> The Tea Tree gives you a slight tingly sensation when washing your hair.</li>
            <li> Helps itching go away and in about a week or less of doing this routine</li>
            <li> Geovanni is half the cost, and is almost identical to the Paul Mitchel Tea Tree shampoo.</li>
            <li> It does not strip the hair or make it a tangled mess.  </li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that is frizzy and dry.</li>
            <li> Many times at least one of the bottles has leaked all over during shipping. :(</li>
            <li> Every time I use it, I end up with a head full of horrible dandruff that takes a couple of weeks to clear.</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells, and it makes my scalp tingle a little.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Giovanni Tea Tree Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for a few years now</li>
            <li> a waste of money.</li>
            <li> The ONLY con for this product, other than the weird new yellow color is that it DOES and WILL sting like crazy if you get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li> Much better results an no more bad hair days!</li>
            <li> I have very thick long hair, which requires lots of conditioner, so we go through quite a bit of it.</li>
            <li> Side note: an 8.5 oz bottle of shampoo is SMALL.</li>
            <li> I usually use the 50:50.</li>
            <li> Leave conditioner on a few minutes at least.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll order from here again.</li>
            <li> Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes.</li>
            <li> DOESN&#x27;T DULL THE HAIR.  </li>
            <li> With this shampoo, however, it comes out looking dull.</li>
            <li> I would never hesitate at purchasing this little gem!!</li>
            <li> I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is really thick and curly</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s shampoo</li>
            <li> I really mean tangles.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a waste and very disappointing.</li>
            <li> I need to use a lot to get it to cover my scalp (the consistency of the product is weird), and I still feel like my hair&#x27;s a little greasy when I&#x27;m done.   </li>
            <li> However, the last shipment I received was badly damaged.</li>
            <li> I have used crazy chemical shampoos from the pharmacy and crazy expensive natural shampoos from fancy health stores.</li>
            <li> The least expensive option should have also been offered.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;VERY POOR AMAZON PACKING.</li>
            <li> My hair got so much worse.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just too expensive for something not requiring priority service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just wanted to warn the ones who have oily roots and dry hair: this shampoo is the worst thing i&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, all three bottles had to end up in the trash can!</li>
            <li> Triple Treat will give you dandruff so bad, you&#x27;ll have flakes everywhere, from your shoulders, to your pillow at night.</li>

            <li> But, it&#x27;s still a bummer! :(</li>

            <li> I suffered with terrible itching scalp until I found this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Literally the worst shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used in my life.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I only use tea tree shampoo and this is my favorite of the seven brands I have tried. You can use a much smaller amount than normal and the price per ounce is the best.</li>
            <li> My son developed allergies in his 20s and especially in his scalp area.  These products are amazing and provide him with excellent relief.</li>
            <li> This was my first foray into sulfate-free shampoos -- not the best choice.  To my knowledge: 1) sulfate free shampoos don&#x27;t cause as much lather, 2) sulfate free shampoos should be less damaging.  For this shampoo: 1) yes, the lather is weaker than shampoos with sulfates, 2) no, the shampoo seems to dry out my hair and cause it to be frizzy.  Luckily, the corresponding conditioner is good enough to fix the frizz.  The tea tree oil also made my scalp itch something fierce the first week I used it, but has since calmed down and my scalp seems to be healthier with less dandruff.  I&#x27;m a fan of the tea tree oil, but will be switching lines after I finish this three-pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I saw these on sale at Whole Foods recently if you&#x27;re looking for a brick and mortar shop.</li>
            <li> Only problem was the packaging.  It just came in a box and the product itself was in bags of three.  Effective and environmental friendly, but the product was opened (presuming due to pressure change) and it leaked a little during shipment.  Product still works fine...I mean it&#x27;s shampoo, how are you going to screw that up?</li>
            <li> This shampoo is a little more drying than other Giovanni shampoos. This shampoo leaves the hair feeling tangled even after conditioner is used. i prefer 50:50 shampoo.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is excellent!  Your hair feels very clean after using it - helps control oil.  You really do feel tingling and is invigorating, which is especially great in the morning when you are trying to wake up.  It does not strip the hair or make it a tangled mess.  After doing my research online and reading great reviews, I bought 1 bottle locally to try it and have bought another 3 bottles through Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have a flaky itchy scalp. I have used crazy chemical shampoos from the pharmacy and crazy expensive natural shampoos from fancy health stores. Nothing really worked for long, until, 2 or 3 months ago, I got a sample of Giovanni tea tree oil shampoo. I tried it and fell in love with it&#x27;s simplicity of scents and consistency. Plus, peppermint felt amazing. No flakiness or itchiness noted. I bought a bottle and now, after it&#x27;s just finished, I bought another one. This inexpensive, zero sulfates shampoo does the best job on my hair.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my experience was that this product is like many others: it immediately worsened my scalp condition.  I used it twice and my scalp itches and flakes.&lt;br /&gt;Back to Paul Mitchell which isn&#x27;t perfect but a heck of a lot better than this stuff for me.</li>
            <li> thank you so much son hair does well using this and its always a great price have a Blessed Thjanksgiven</li>
            <li> This shampoo is incredible.  Aside from the fact it doesn&#x27;t have the chemical additives, not even the &#x27;cleaning&#x27; sulfates and such (and, hence, doesn&#x27;t lather up like many shampoos), it leaves hair shiny, fluffy and just feeling clean.  Seems this is what clean hair and scalp should feel like.  It doesn&#x27;t yield the &#x27;tingle&#x27; on the scalp that some tea tree items are apt to do.  This could be a plus or minus, depending on your viewpoint.  The wife loves it as well.  I&#x27;ll be buying again for certain!</li>
            <li> I bought this and the conditioner. Combined it saved me almost 50% if I would have purchased the bottles at the store. Cleanses the hair and helps with oil control without drying out the hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> My favorite natural shampoo, sulfate free, not tested on animals. Leads scalp feeling clean without over drying hair. Tea tree has many benefits for your skin in itself! Could help dandruff, although I didn&#x27;t have that problem so I can&#x27;t say for sure.</li>
            <li> I think that Giovanni has grown in popularity because it&#x27;s widely available at Wal-mart and Target for a reasonable price.  Unlike other organic hair products it doesn&#x27;t cost $8 to $20 a bottle.  This high demand, I think, has caused them to cut corners on the formula.  I used to use this product a good deal last year and it left my hair clean and soft.  Also, it used to be clear.  I agree with the other reviewer that noticed that it is now yellow.  I just used the Giovanni Tea Tree Shampoo last week and my hair was dull and frizzy.  Also, the ends looked ruffled.  I have kinky, curly 3c hair.      On top of that, this shampoo seems too harsh.  If any accidentally drips into my eyes, it stings horribly and has me scrambling for a towel before I&#x27;m done!  I switched back to my Shikai shampoo and my hair is back to being shiny, soft, curly and frizz-free after using it.  I won&#x27;t be using Tea Tree Triple Threat again.  Also Jason Natural Daily Shampoo Fragrance Free is terrific as well and gives me shiny, clean, frizz-free curls.  The Giovanni does, however, work great for my husband who has dreadlocks which is why I didn&#x27;t give the shampoo one or two stars.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo! It leaves my hair soft and clean without leaving any icky residue. I would suggest this to anyone!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo. Shippers need to be more careful in packing to avoid leaking</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a scalp plagued by severe dandruff since I was a kid. I&#x27;ve used almost everything - big name brands (H&amp;S, Garnier, Selsun Blue), generic brands, salicylic acid, lotion, exfoliation, pyrithione zinc, selenium sulfide, nearly everything. I was using Selsun Blue&#x27;s medicated for severe dandruff when I became really bothered by all the chemicals. I&#x27;m not a greenie by any means, but I couldn&#x27;t stand the chemical smell. Plus, the day after shower day I&#x27;d always get a few dry patches here and there.     Anyway, I decided to get this on a whim. Just saw it on Wal-Mart&#x27;s shelf and noticed the tea tree oil ingredient(which I had already heard good things about but never wanted to try because of the smell). I was pessimistic, but sold. Good choice. All the ingredients that I read were...98% natural - If I remember correctly there was one ingredient that was not natural. Anyway it smelled SO GOOD! Like peppermint! Wow! I rubbed the (REALLY foamy) liquid into my scalp and massaged. It rinses away and feels clean. Even more amazing? BETTER results than Selsun. Maybe it just worked for me but DANG! It is for sure worth a try. I recently got and now use the hair reconstructor as a conditioner. Nice hair. Naturally.    I am annoyed by the fact that the product is a little pricey, the smell doesn&#x27;t really stay, and that it foams up SO much (tons of dense bubbles), but for the results it really isn&#x27;t a big deal. I&#x27;m getting my third bottle in two days.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been using Giovanni Tea Tree Shampoo &amp; Conditioner for a few years now and it&#x27;s excellent!! Your hair is so soft &amp; manageable without being weighed down. I have greasy roots and dry ends and it really balances out my hair. The Tea Tree gives you a slight tingly sensation when washing your hair. Plus it&#x27;s organic so what more can you ask for!</li>
            <li> As a woman with natural 4a hair, my hair is very picky about shampoos. It is very sensitive, and the fact that I live in Michigan, it is easily dry and is always hungry for moisture, so I was concerned about how this shampoo would work out. I co-wash (wash with conditioner) most of the time and use a moisturizing shampoo once a month to get rid of build-up, but now that I am about to take swimming lessons, I learned something new about clarifying shampoos and how important it is to use every once in awhile in place of your moisturizing shampoos because even those particular shampoos do not do its job to clean the scalp if there is still build up of natural oils and moisturizers in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me forever and a day to find this stuff along with the conditioner and two states (I live on the borderline). One state sold the conditioner, and the other state sold the shampoo. I thought to myself this had better be worth it for all of this trouble to find, and indeed it was. I had to run through my hair twice though (as I do with all shampoos because of the oils in my hair) but the second pump, It really cleaned well, and surprisingly did not strip my hair making it feel like straw like most shampoos do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve seen reviews of how this did not work for some but noticed they have been using this every week. Although some people say it may be safe to use every week, at the end of the day, it is still a clarifying shampoo, and most shampoos (safe or not) are only meant to be used once or twice out of the month. Just thought I might say that for those who are using this twice a week or weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving this a four star only because I&#x27;ve only used it once. I will know in time how I will really feel about it. But I have no complaints as of now and am happy with my purchase as hard as it was to find.</li>
            <li> I love the spicy feeling on the head. Wakes you up!</li>
            <li> I use this once or twice a week and Giovanni&#x27;s regular conditioner the other days.  They work very well on my hair and smell good!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Trader Joe&#x27;s tea tree shampoo for a few years since I had heard that it was the same formulation as the Giovanni one. When I finished up my last bottle of the TJ&#x27;s brand, I decided to get the Giovanni one -- and there is a world of difference!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The TJ&#x27;s brand always left my hair feeling stripped and dry after using it, but this Giovanni one is much more moisturizing.  My sensitive scalp never feels irritated, and it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling dry or stripped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On days when I use this, I also use the matching Giovanni conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is also Curly-Girl-friendly for those who don&#x27;t use sulfates or silicones on their hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another reviewer mentioned that this ended up damaging her hair and her boyfriend&#x27;s hair, so I&#x27;m worried about long-term use.  Because of that, I&#x27;ve only been using this for one wash per week, but, so far, it seems to be working really well!  The other days, I use [[ASIN:B0081UADQM ABBA COLOR PROTECTION SHAMPOO 33.8 OZ (FORMERLY PURE COLOR PROTECT) UNISEX]], which I love.</li>
            <li> for oily hair, but hair really feels clean when done</li>
            <li> Love the smell, not hard on my hair and rinses easily in my water (high mineral content).  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I first started using this shampoo about 10 years ago when Costco sold it.  As happens frequently at Costco, they stopped carrying it within a year or so and I stopped using it when i ran out.  I was so excited to see it on Amazon!  The shampoo (and conditioner) have a very refreshing, almost minty aroma and leave a very pleasant cool feeling on my scalp when I rinse it out.  My hair is left clean (I use a lot of product, including wax), with body and shine. As an added bonus, a little goes a long way, so a bottle lasts me (I have short hair) about six weeks.  Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> The shampoos had leaked and the whole package was sticky. The first time this happened, I requested for another package hoping for better luck. But, I was disappointed. Amazon, as always, was easy with returns! But, it&#x27;s still a bummer! :(</li>
            <li> I like the way this smells, and it makes my scalp tingle a little. However it doesn&#x27;t get my hair clean. I need to use a lot to get it to cover my scalp (the consistency of the product is weird), and I still feel like my hair&#x27;s a little greasy when I&#x27;m done.   Side note: an 8.5 oz bottle of shampoo is SMALL.</li>
            <li> The best natural shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used. I missed bubbles when washing my hair. I use to use whole foods 365 brand shampoo but I never felt it really cleaned my hair and I swim 3/4 days a week so needed a good natural shampoo.</li>
            <li> Works great cleaning my scalp with less harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> Works great as shampoo or body wash. Great tingly feeling is perfect to heal scalp and it smells nice as well. Great price and quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo if you&#x27;ve tried a bunch of different brands and aren&#x27;t satisfied with one in particular.  I have fluffy/curly hair that I&#x27;ve grown out a few times over the last few years and Giovanni has been the most consistent shampoo of the other often suggested scalp friendly choices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this (and the companion conditioner maybe once a week when my hair reaches the shoulders) along with a shampoo massage comb that can easily be found on Amazon for a good price.  If you really want the full benefit of a scalp circulation shampoo, but you have curly hair and can&#x27;t really brush it like those with straight hair, I really recommend a shampoo massager for use when lathering.  Since using this routine my scalp hasn&#x27;t been overly itchy.</li>
            <li> I am a licensed hairdresser, and find this to one of my favourite shampoos.  It does the job well, leaving you scalp invigorated.  I would never hesitate at purchasing this little gem!!</li>
            <li> The mint scent is SOOOO refreshing.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair feeling clean, no residue, but not drying. Great for all hair types. Would recommend to every one to use.</li>
            <li> my favorite shampoo...its the only one i use&lt;br /&gt;and i love that i can buy this in bulk at a great price</li>
            <li> I really like this shampoo, I think it does a great job on my hair, which is fairly long and fine, so it tends to get greasy and flat easily. I use it every other day and I don&#x27;t feel like it leaves a residue.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my Sisterlock Consultant likes the brand and uses this kind in her salon. She recommended it as a dandruff shampoo. The shampoo is not invigorating, doesn&#x27;t do anything for dandruff (the line sells a dandruff shampoo), and I don&#x27;t like the ingredients since I am more into natural shampoos. My hair feels super dry when I use this.</li>
            <li> Overall I think the product delivers as advertised. My hair feels cleaner after washing, there&#x27;s a tingly sensation, and the smell is great.     I agree with the other reviewer that it does feel a little bit more dry after washing, but I use a conditioner, so it&#x27;s not an issue for me.</li>
            <li> A refreshing shampoo with effective cleansing result and soothing feeling. All in all, I highly recommend this shampoo. Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Giovanni shampoo, conditioner and their re-constructor for about a week now, and WOW has it made a dramatic difference in my hair. I&#x27;ve been flat ironing, curling, coloring and bleaching my hair for at least 6 years now and have extreme damage and dryness. Nothing has made my hair feel as silky and soft like Giovanni has, and I have tried absolutely everything. Even high end salon brands haven&#x27;t helped me one bit.&lt;br /&gt;The tea tree smells just like peppermints, which I love, but I have been using their shampoo and conditioner for damaged hair and that&#x27;s great too, which smells like oranges. Both are amazing and I would recommend them to anyone.</li>
            <li> I have been frantic trying to find the \\&quot;old\\&quot; formula. Like reviewers before me, I noticed the new yellowish color the shampoo has and WILL NOT buy it based on several reviews that I&#x27;ve read. That being said....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have curly hair that tends to be frizzy and love the softness, smoothness and bounce I get from the clear formula. It has been difficult to find lately; I looked in local super markets, WalMart and Target, but they only seem to have the yellow stuff. I don&#x27;t really know if the formula has changed, as the product label is the same, but the clear stuff I use is wonderful. I LOVE the tingle I get when I wash and the scent is amazing. My hair feels truly clean afterwards, not just laden with perfumes. The fact that it&#x27;s organic, made in the USA and SLS free is great! I have acne prone skin, and noticed with non SLS free shampoos my back would become irritated quite quickly (due to the suds running down my back when rinsing). That has COMPLETELY STOPPED with this product.....(I have since switched to SLS free body wash instead of bar soap). I&#x27;m not great at this reviewing stuff, but I think this is an excellent product and have already bought it for friends (who also LOVE it). The ONLY con for this product, other than the weird new yellow color is that it DOES and WILL sting like crazy if you get it in your eyes!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this shampoo. He occasionally gets dry scalp, and this takes care of that problem. I also use it on my two year old who is prone to dry patches on her scalp, and on my five year old because tea tree oil can help repel lice. It&#x27;s gentle but effective and doesn&#x27;t smell too strongly after a shower. I love the value that the three pack gives!</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with the product.  It is the same as the one found on the grocery store shelves.  BUT I do have an issue with how the seller - Herbspro - shipped the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EXPENSIVE - This had a very high shipping cost relative to the purchase price - a 50% premium.  The seller shipped this through USPS Priority Service, which was not needed.  The least expensive option should have also been offered.  Priority service added $7.50 to a $15.00 purchase.  That&#x27;s just too expensive for something not requiring priority service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;POORLY SHIPPED - The items were 3 plastic shampoo bottles with snap-on lids.  The bottles were shipped on their sides, unsecured, with no tape or wrapping holding down the lids.  It was only pure luck that these did not leak in transit.  Considering the very expensive shipping, the seller should have made sure the items were packed properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this product again, but NOT from this seller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* * * UPDATE * * * (26 July 2014)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four mounts after my initial purchase, I reordered.  I noticed this time that the order is fulfilled by Amazon, without any mention of the previous seller back in March.  The product came quickly, because I happen to live near an Amazon location.  The 3 bottles were wrapped in plastic this time, rather than loosely packed.  BUT, this time the bottles leaked.  The wrapper kept it from ruining the entire order, but still there was a little product loss and I had to wash the shampoo off the bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note to Amazon: When shipping liquid products like this, please tape down the lids and pack them in shrink-wrap plastic to avoid leaks and spills.  While your price is lower than in the store, it does little good if the product leaks while being shipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VERY POOR AMAZON PACKING.</li>
            <li> A pretty decent shampoo for the price. I&#x27;m not a fan of strong smells or anything with a lot of unpronounceable chemicals. This fits the bill nicely and leaves my hair feeling nice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Giovanna products for a while, but this was the first time I used this particular shampoo. I usually use the 50:50. I actually ordered this by accident when I thought I was ordering the 50:50. I like this one SO much better. It smells better and feels better. I don&#x27;t even need to use conditioner as often. I think the tea tree oil really hydrates. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have bought other shampoos with tea tree oil and mint, but this is the best. Great for oily to normal hair, and a good natural shampoo for the relief of dandruff or seborrhea. Triple treat will make your scalp tingle and the smell of mint will awaken your senses!</li>
            <li> I have seen a major reduction in scalp itchiness after using this and its accompanying conditioner. The smell is very nice (even for a guy) and relatively inexpensive for all natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> peppermint scalp feeling</li>
            <li> I love Giovanni TTTT Shampoo.  It is very easy to apply to scalp and lengths, smells wonderfully, and leaves hair feeling well cleansed.  It does invigorate the scalp and tingle a bit, which I love.  It definitely does what it claims to and uses organic ingredients to boot!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I&#x27;ve found yet in combination with their conditioner for psoriasis of the scalp. Shampoo just maybe once every three days but condition nightly. Leave conditioner on a few minutes at least. Helps itching go away and in about a week or less of doing this routine I noticed a huge difference. More so than any rx ever did. Love this so much and the price is perfect. Way better than Wen products.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, no regret at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, my hair feels cleaner, thicker and smells great! I highly recommend it, love that it&#x27;s Eco friendly</li>
            <li> Although it smells great, my hair looked noticeably bad after the first and second try of Giovanni Tea Tree Triple Treat in comparison to other shampoos&#x27; effects on my wavy, slightly-prone-to-frizz hair. Probably won&#x27;t use it again...a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product is fantastic! I have thick curly hair that is frizzy and dry. After using products on my hair to define curls and resist heat and damage, I can tell my hair needs a deep clean when it starts to fall flat not work the way I want it to. Giovanni to the rescue! I will advise- this is not to be used daily if you have drier hair. I made that mistake at first and almost stop using the products all together. I am glad I did not do that! I purchased the 5050 shampoo and use that daily. Much better results an no more bad hair days!</li>
            <li> This shampoo will make you feel invigorated, no doubt - it might be the peppermint in it.  It is hard to find a shampoo like this that contains no s. laureath&#x27;s while containing peppermint, as well as comprising of completely natural ingredients.  They used to sell this at Costco in huge vat sizes about 1.5 years ago, but I no longer can find them. These were sold in a pack of 2 incredibly large shampoos bottles (25 fl oz each) plus equally large conditioner bottle for a total of $16.  Unfortunately they no longer carry this wonderful product.  If I could buy a life time supply, I would.  Use this product and you might become brand loyal to it.</li>
            <li> too drying -- that&#x27;s unusual in today&#x27;s shampoo !</li>
            <li> Love the clean smell and the wash</li>
            <li> Love all of the Giovanni Tea Tree Triple products.  Additionally, this shampoo produces a nice, tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> I devolved an allergy to shampoos with sodium laurel sulfate. I suffered with terrible itching scalp until I found this shampoo. I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo for several years and I&#x27;m very happy with it</li>
            <li> I have a family of sensitive little heads full of curls.  Those in the know I really mean tangles.  This product works well for the entire family, no buildup, not too drying and even helps with dandruff.</li>
            <li> It worked well in Washington State but in New Orleans gave no body.  It burns the eyeswhen it is used.</li>
            <li> Great quality and quick delivery</li>
            <li> smells good, feels good, just wish for more foams.</li>
            <li> I started getting Dandruff all of a sudden and had this oily spot on the back of my head that would not go away. I got this shampoo at Target and paid $7 for the bottle. I applied the shampoo as normal, but I let it sit on my scalp for around 5 mins and then I rinsed it out. I do not like the tea tree oil conditioner, so I use another brand. I also add a bit of coconut oil on my ends before blow drying my hair and my hair is so shiny and soft!! This shampoo is amazing!!!! It has helped my Dandruff and on the first wash got rid of the oily spot on the back of my head. If you have dry hair this shampoo is not for you. I have greasy hair and wash every other day.  I think the key is to let it sit on your head for several mins, that is when you feel the tingling and the oils doing the job!!</li>
            <li> I was looking on Drugstore.com, and the ingredients for this shampoo are completely different from what&#x27;s listed here on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Drugstore ingredients:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua (Purifed) Water, Tea Tree (Melaleuca Alternifolia) Oil, Peppermint (Mentha Piperita) Oil, Eucalyptus Citriodora (Lemon Eucalyptus) Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Extract, Nettle (Urtica Dioica) Oil, Thyme (Thymus Vulgaris) Oil, Birch (Butela Alba) Leaf Oil, Chamomilla (Anthemis Nobilis) Flower, Clary (Salvia Sclarea), Lavandula Angustifolia (Lavender), Coltsfoot Leaf (Tussilago Fargara), Yarrow (Achillea Millefolium) Oil, Mallow (Malya Sylvestris), Horsetail (Equisetum Arvense) Oil, Soybean (Glycine Soja) Protein, C12 14 Oleifin Sulfonate (Coconut Derived), Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Tocopherol (Natural Vitamin E), Trace Minerals, Citric Acid (Corn), Sodium Hydroxymethylglycinate, Sodium Chloride (Sea Salt), Grapefruit Seed (Citrus Derived)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not even sure which to believe.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, so was disappointed to open my package and find that all three bottles have a dark yellowish color. I&#x27;ve used this shampoo for a few years now, and know that the Tea Tree Triple Threat is a clear color. The smell also doesn&#x27;t seem right, and the bottle is overflowing and watery. I will be returning this.</li>
            <li> Literally the worst shampoo &amp; conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used in my life. $13 a bottle you&#x27;d think it would be alright but I have never used a product this awful. My hair doesn&#x27;t even feel clean, doesn&#x27;t smell good, isn&#x27;t soft, nothing. Even while working it through in the shower you can tell it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as the under $8 shampoos. I will NEVER buy this again and advise others to do the same.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS &#x27;GREEN&#x27; PRODUCT ! I JUST RECENTLY BECAME ECO-FRIENDLY AND THIS WAS THE FIRST SHAMPOO AND CONDITION I HAVE TRIED ON MY VERY LONG AND THICK HAIR.. DECIDED TO TRY NATURES GATE AND WAS SO DISPLEASED! I IMMEDIATELY SWITCHED BACK TO THIS , MAKES MY HAIR MORE MANAGEABLE AND SOFT , ALSO FEELS REFRESHING ON THE SCALP !! THANKS FOR THE PRODUCT AND THE FAST DELIVERY</li>
            <li> I bought the big bottle (33.5 oz) from Marshalls (great value) and I really like it so far. It has a fresh light scent and doesn&#x27;t tingle too much. I have 4B textured hair and use a lot of oils and product during the week and this really gets it clean to start fresh each week. I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is really thick and curly and it works well. I do notice that it is more of a clarifying shampoo and not moisturizing so it does feel really dry after I wash however I follow up with their 50/50 conditioner or smooth as silk and my hair is back to feeling soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Cleans well without stripping all moisture from your hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shampoo since 2010-helps keeps my seborrheic dermatitis in check so that&#x27;s the only reason I purchase.</li>
            <li> USE THIS SHAMPOO ALL THE TIME.  DOESN&#x27;T DULL THE HAIR.  LEAVES IT VERY SHINY AND SOFT.  THE SMELL OF TEA TREE OIL DISAPATES QUICKLY.  IT ALSO LEAVES THE HAIR AND SCALP CLEAN.</li>
            <li> I get 3 of these monthly through subscribe and save. Many times at least one of the bottles has leaked all over during shipping. :( It&#x27;s such a waste and very disappointing. I love the stuff. This is my favorite shampoo and I cannot get it where I live so I just keep dealing with the leakage. Hopefully they&#x27;ll figure out a way to seal up the lid for shipping. Other than that, the product is great.</li>
            <li> Every time I washed my hair my pores were,in for a treat! It also seems that my hair is not as dry.</li>
            <li> Not the real shampoo.  Different color and does work as well as the one you purchase in the store.  It appears to be a cheap knock-off of the real thing in the real thing&#x27;s bottle.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast, good buy.</li>
            <li> Great product. However product smells exactly like polo mints. If you don&#x27;t like the smell of polo mints, stay away. Otherwise buy it!</li>
            <li> May order something different.&lt;br /&gt;Love this shampoo and have used a long time&lt;br /&gt;but notice over last months&lt;br /&gt;a lot of my fine hair in the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Some have commented about this being&lt;br /&gt;done with this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;Am going to order something different this time&lt;br /&gt;but another Giovanni Shampoo</li>
            <li> I ordered shampoo, but conditioner was delivered.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, great price, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo, my daughter and I have been using it for years. We have extremely sensitive skin and severe eczema and this has been a live saver. Started ordering it from Amazon when we moved to a new area and it&#x27;s been harder to find in the stores. However, the last shipment I received was badly damaged. One bottle was near empty and all over the box, it took me 20 minutes to clean up the mess. I tried to contact Amazon about a replacement but never heard anything and to ship back was a pain. Not sure I&#x27;ll order from here again.</li>
            <li> Giovanni&#x27;s shampoo is simply the best I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve washed my hair exclusively with it for the past six years and would not consider using any other product - the feeling of clean is pervasive.</li>
            <li> Love Love Love this shampoo!</li>
            <li> It performs as you&#x27;d expect a cleaner shampoo to do. It doesn&#x27;t lather a ton, but then, I wouldn&#x27;t want it to. :)</li>
            <li> I love this because it leaves my hair feeling clean and smells fresh and natural.  I pair this with the Giovanni Smooth as Silk conditioner and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for my brother, fast shipping and he really likes the shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp, with a tendency towards flaking, and am always on the lookout for &amp;#34;the best&amp;#34; natural shampoo remedy.  Most often, this results in a tea tree formula, and I have tried many.  Giovanni&#x27;s Tea Tree Triple shampoo is, so far at least, my absolute favorite.  It does not contain laurel/laureth sulfates, but it still feels thick &amp; sudsy (sssooo nice when you&#x27;re used to other runny &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; shampoos). The peppermint oil really does make my scalp feel somewhat &amp;#34;invigorated,&amp;#34; and, best of all, so for no signs of an itchy, flaky scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, this 3-pack deal beats any sale at a natural grocery store.  stock up!</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo - shipped the next day!</li>
            <li> Over the last four years, I tried giving this shampoo a go three times. Unfortunately, all three bottles had to end up in the trash can! It is absolutely unsuitable for my hair. Every time I use it, I end up with a head full of horrible dandruff that takes a couple of weeks to clear. I did not immediately attribute this upsetting occurrence to the shampoo, after all the ingredients look so wonderful, but having tried it three times and arriving at the same result leaves not a shadow of a doubt in my mind that the shampoo is to blame. Beware! Tea Tree Triple Treat will give you dandruff so bad, you&#x27;ll have flakes everywhere, from your shoulders, to your pillow at night. I will never buy it again.</li>
            <li> Very strong, cause some irritation.</li>
            <li> I love everything about this shampoo.  It makes my scalp tingle and makes my hair feel so clean and fresh.  I even use it to wash my face and it totally cleared up my skin.  I&#x27;m an optometrist and we prescribe Tea Tree Oil cleansers for people who have eyelid infections...this shampoo is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice and already, I am having the exact same problems as some of the other reviewers on here. Before using this shampoo, I just used standard Head and Shoulders dandruff shampoo. I always showered with cold water and my hair came out looking nice and shiny every time. With this shampoo, however, it comes out looking dull. It has that same yellowish color that keeps getting mentioned here. Please avoid this shampoo. You are probably better off using shampoo with SLS.</li>
            <li> Works great for living in a hard water area, which has given me dandruff. Gentle on my very dry and course hair. I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shampoo, it makes your hair clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells like peppermint, tea tree oil, and eucalyptus.  Feels tingly when applied to your melon, stings a lot if you get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> Good shampoo and doesn&#x27;t leave a residue in my hair like other shampoos.  Also, I love the smell of it</li>
            <li> Refreshing and tingly on the scalp!</li>
            <li> I am so glad I found this product (wish the conditioner was also available, but found it at Target)  It smells great and of course being cruelty free-what more could you ask for?</li>
            <li> The only shampoo I use! Light and effective without stripping my color-treated hair....The three-pack saves me money, too, so this greatly exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> My fianc√© and I LOVE this shampoo &amp; conditioner. Whenever I have a headache I shower and use this shampoo it almost always relives my headaches, (which I get frequently). I never knew shampoo could make your head tingle. We used to buy it at Walmart, but it&#x27;s pretty pricey 8 Oz for 7/8$. here we get three bottles for under $20. And I don&#x27;t have to travel out of town to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is, I wish they came in different sizes. I have very thick long hair, which requires lots of conditioner, so we go through quite a bit of it. But I still highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This was fairly good shampoo. I normally only buy Redken, but decided to give this a try.</li>
            <li> I always buy this shampoo. I love the scent and how clean it gets my hair without SLS!!! Buy it!</li>
            <li> I really love these shampoos, it leaves a refreshing and clean feeling after every use. I would highly recommend this for guys!</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo for here in Texas where we sweat a lot.</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo. Gentle on my sensitive scalp, cleans, and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> I tried this shampoo (8.5 oz Giovanni Hair Care) after my favorite national-brand but limited distribution company was acquired by a conglomerate that subsequently stopped producing that particular product.  My hope in this shampoo was to find something gentle on hair color. leaving it manageable without need for conditioner (something my hair allows).  The natural ingredients appealed to me, and the tingle a bonus given the good reports I saw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning and manageability worked fine, but by about the second time around my scalp began to itch, and from that point on the itch worsened with each application.  However, my wife tried it, loves it, and is still with it months later.  My guess is I&#x27;ve an allergy to something in the formula.</li>
            <li> Bought this at my local Target store and love it. It cleans better than any other shampoo. I was looking for a Paul Mitchel Tea Tree alternative because it so expensive,which is around $12.00 a bottle. Geovanni is half the cost, and is almost identical to the Paul Mitchel Tea Tree shampoo. Being a Man working with horses, I need something to strip away the sweat, and this shampoo does it better than anything else I have tried and I especially love the ice cool sensation it leaves afterwards.</li>
            <li> Always a great shampoo, delivered way ahead of promised time!! thanks</li>
            <li> This is the 4th shampoo (including EO, Alba) and this is by far my favorite. I only need to use a small amount on my long thick hair, and my hair feels clean, and together with the matching conditioner which makes tangles easily removed by running my fingers through or with a brush. By the end of the day, my hair still feels clean. This Tea Tree Triple Treat has a minty scent, and when it gets in your eyes, it can be uncomfortable with a minty feel - definitely, not what you would want in your eyes. I love that this product is cruelty free. I recommend search around for a lower price on the internet (vitacost has great prices).</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo. The tea tree oil is refreshing on your scalp. Make sure to keep out of your eyes. That is not so refreshing. Ok to use on dyed hair.</li>
            <li> Have used for years... great</li>
            <li> Great cleansing power, but not for everyday use. Very good at stripping oil from the hair without seeming too harsh.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo,because it smells good and my hair scurf has gone after using it.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to say; this is a super product, leaves your scalp tingling and feeling clean.  I swear by the Tea Tree Shampoo.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to lather up very easily. Overall though it is a solid product.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo I use now.  It makes my hair soft and shiny and looks like virgin hair.  When I bought it for the first time, I was worried I would have the same result that I did with salon tea tree oil shampoo.  The problem with the other shampoo was that it had wheat germ oil in it and I have a wheat allergy.  I cannot use anything topically or eat anything with wheat in it or I have major problems.  Giovanni, on the other hand, does not have any wheat ingredients and is very gentle to my hair.  It contains no harsh ingredients like surfactants (SLS) or parabens.  I recently bought a huge bottle from an outlet store that should last me several months, at least.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and may help avoid getting lice.</li>
            <li> These are the full size bottles, which is amazing for the price. This is my favorite shampoo.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to warn the ones who have oily roots and dry hair: this shampoo is the worst thing i&#x27;ve ever tried. My hair got so much worse. I changed it to organic argan oil shampoo and voi la, in a week I have gorgeous hair using NO conditioner. This brand is just not for me.</li>
