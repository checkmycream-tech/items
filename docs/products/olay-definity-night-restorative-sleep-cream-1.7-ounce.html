            <li>Very nice</li>
            <li>/&gt;This cream has a nice texture, it feels good, smells nice but nothing impressive.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for the price.  </li>
            <li>But this night cream provides good overnight moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>I loved the silky whipped creamy consistency.</li>
            <li>This product is so good for your skin.</li>
            <li>It feels nice, moisturizes great and its cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>I just started using this...as advised on the [...] skin consult...and love it!  </li>
            <li>I just purchased this night cream, and I love it!  </li>
            <li>When I tried it again for one more night, I got another!</li>
            <li>The smell is overwhelming!  </li>
            <li>Another issue I have with this product is that it has a very strong perfume smell that kind of stings my skin</li>
            <li>Love Olay! :)</li>
            <li>Just love love this product!</li>
            <li>It is light weight, provides good moisture, smooths on easily and just feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know which one is more effective but the combination of them has worked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]].</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first night cream i&#x27;ve been happy to use nightly.</li>
            <li>It goes on very smooth,</li>
            <li>The red blotches have disappeared and my skin looks wonderful!</li>
            <li>Glad I did.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the product every night but most nights I do.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t love the price tag</li>
            <li>My skin is looking clearer and more hydrated.  </li>
            <li>My skin tone looks more even.  </li>
            <li>I like the over the counter price with the better than prescription results---and no breakouts/oily films/dryness.</li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid fan of Olay Products, I have noticed a remarkable difference in my skin.  </li>
            <li>After applying a layer of this cream, I find myself having to top off with a thicker cream like Eucerin to seal in precious moisture.  </li>
            <li>but, truthfully, I don&#x27;t intend to purchase another unless Olay starts marketing a fragrance-free version, like they have for the Regenerist serum and which I also love.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>My favorite night cream</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this cream, I can already see the spots on my forehead from pimples fading.</li>
            <li>I will continue to order this product on amazon until the discontinued stock is depleted. :)</li>
            <li>Works Great, need to get the whole set recommended via Olay website</li>
            <li>I love this.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also tried so many products geared towards reducing hyper-pigmentation, including this one, that seem to work on others but do nothing for</li>
            <li>more.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve never given yourself a peel at home, try it, you will LOVE it.</li>
            <li>Its ok</li>
            <li>This company is great, very responsive and they offer a lot of information on their site.  </li>
            <li>This company is great, very responsive and they offer a lot of information on their site.  </li>
            <li>Although I THOUGHT I ordered the Intense Moisture, this corrective night cream is very very nice.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very rich and creamy, not oily or sticky...</li>
            <li>I love the light feeling and the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I got the whole sequence of products, this is just one step, and I loved it</li>
            <li>With that much perfume, I can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s good for ANY types</li>
            <li>but, because I am treating my more noticeable brown spots with the anti-spot treatment, those brown spots are shrinking significantly.  </li>
            <li>I love them, they are convenient, cheap and have made a huge difference on my skin.  </li>
            <li>So, you should definitely try this cream as it is a perfect choice for specially who wants to start using Night creams!</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and seems to give me a glow.</li>
            <li>It makes my face feel so smooth and hydrated, and I like the scent.</li>
            <li>oh so light fragrance, and</li>
            <li>The cream goes on light and immediately softens your skin.</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and your skin feels like silk afterwards.</li>
            <li>Not the best moisturizer, I moisturize before hand, but has high spf, doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze or make my eyes tear</li>
            <li>As much as I use SPF daily, I still tend to have very fair skin which burns and freckles easily.</li>
            <li>but this is the one product that I am willing to spend a bit more on.</li>
            <li>but I think I will try another brand first and see it that works better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, it spreads on very easily, and makes my skin feel smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li>I am 26 years old and use this product with the definity tinted moisturizer and I love both!</li>
            <li>Olay generally has the best facial care products with a more reasonable pricetag.  </li>
            <li>I Love it so much, I use it in the daytime as well.</li>
            <li>The texture of the cream is also pretty smooth and we really liked it as we are very picky in choosing creams with good texture (Not too dry, not too sticky).</li>
            <li>However, to be fair, perhaps I too need to compare pre-cream/post-cream photos of myself, like that other reviewer did, before I can see the true effects of</li>
            <li>a peel neutralizer, (you don&#x27;t need one for the acid peels, they dilute in water, and you can make your own at home with simple products,</li>
            <li>I use it as a hand cream now cuz i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as my other moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li>Just right.</li>
            <li>I use this all over my face right after I wash</li>
            <li>I have had a variety of results from creams that were simply too oily or comedogenic to serums that actually dried my skin---this is the best cream that I have used: both prescription and over the counter.</li>
            <li>It was a great experience with Olay Night Restorative Sleep Cream as the skin feels fantastically soft and vibrant the next morning.</li>
            <li>First time ordering creams.  </li>
            <li>Received in time and exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely lov this product!   </li>
            <li>First and foremost, I purchased and started using this product about a month ago hoping to reduce brown age spots.</li>
            <li>so I was willing to give this Definity line Night Cream a try.  </li>
            <li>The cream is quite light with no greasy feel and my skins feels soft and supple after application.</li>
            <li>Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li>Starting out, make sure its BUFFERED.</li>
            <li>Starting out, make sure its BUFFERED.</li>
            <li>When I first used this product I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works.  </li>
            <li>cream is not thick or greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>B002RZKFAQ Nutra Sonic 1020 Professional 4 Speed Face and Body Cleansing System, Lavender]] to clean and exfoliate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Most moisturizers make my skin feel like it is suffocating, but this one feels good and leaves my skin feeling velvety.</li>
            <li>I have had problems with a slight reddening of my fair skin as I&#x27;ve grown older and</li>
            <li>it soaks in so quickly leaving a soft, almost powder like feel to my face.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin that gets irritated easily and use the sensitive brush head.  </li>
            <li>I was very hopeful that maybe it would reduce or get rid of my sun spots on my cheeks which was the main reason I bought this product and was willing to spend $30</li>
            <li>this product, in combination with the foaming moisturizer, eye treatement, and cream and mousse cleansers from the Definity line has made a real difference.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say much about the product&#x27;s effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I really did not use the item as I should have.</li>
            <li>They are too much money for a temporary solution.  </li>
            <li>and It really helped lighten my skin and erase my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>I really like Olay products</li>
            <li>My skin is normally very sensitive to products but this one has been very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li>Most products treat one or the other.  </li>
            <li>In addition, the cost is less for better effects.</li>
            <li>Will be back in the future for better deals.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this particular product since July 2008 (about 5 mos.)</li>
            <li>I mainly use this cream for preventative maintenance as I am in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few and this has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li>The thick cream does disappear into the skin and provide adequate moisturizing but for the cost difference I&#x27;ve found the Olay Total Effects to provide better moisturizing for both day and night, and it comes unfragranced.</li>
            <li>It does not make your skin oily, but just very soft.</li>
            <li>Cause, ladies, I&#x27;ll be frank, I&#x27;m young, and when I get into bed with my husband, I don&#x27;t want to be reminding him of his grandmother!</li>
            <li>I have had more people complement me on my skin, very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li>The product makes other claims, but I found it mostly combats dry skin.  </li>
            <li>This cream, although touted as containing the most glycerin compared to all the other Definity line products, is still WAY too light-weight for someone with extremely dry skin (like me)</li>
            <li>skin is clear.</li>
            <li>(I figured this is because I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I really think my skin looks different now.</li>
            <li>I was having some problems with old acne marks and discoloration and after using these two products for over 2 months I feel like I don&#x27;t even need makeup.</li>
            <li>My skin feels soft after using it, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li>Each morning when I apply my makeup, there is a glow to my mature skin.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;It has a slight cucumber-melon scent which is not unpleasant, although i could live without</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the newer Olay products are starting to smell a lot better than in the past...</li>
            <li>But gave this product a 3/5 because it did make my skin soft and smooth with use and also didn&#x27;t get breakouts (like I usually do) since I eat chocolate a lot.</li>
            <li>I started a new facial routine with the Olay Definity line and included this Night Restorative Sleep Cream.</li>

            <li> So, you should definitely try this cream as it is a perfect choice for specially who wants to start using Night creams!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and seems to give me a glow.</li>
            <li> It makes my face feel so smooth and hydrated, and I like the scent.</li>
            <li> oh so light fragrance, and</li>
            <li> The cream goes on light and immediately softens your skin.</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and your skin feels like silk afterwards.</li>
            <li> Not the best moisturizer, I moisturize before hand, but has high spf, doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze or make my eyes tear</li>
            <li> As much as I use SPF daily, I still tend to have very fair skin which burns and freckles easily.</li>
            <li> but this is the one product that I am willing to spend a bit more on.</li>
            <li> but I think I will try another brand first and see it that works better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick, it spreads on very easily, and makes my skin feel smooth, not sticky.</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old and use this product with the definity tinted moisturizer and I love both!</li>
            <li> Olay generally has the best facial care products with a more reasonable pricetag.  </li>
            <li> I Love it so much, I use it in the daytime as well.</li>
            <li> The texture of the cream is also pretty smooth and we really liked it as we are very picky in choosing creams with good texture (Not too dry, not too sticky).</li>
            <li> However, to be fair, perhaps I too need to compare pre-cream/post-cream photos of myself, like that other reviewer did, before I can see the true effects of</li>
            <li> a peel neutralizer, (you don&#x27;t need one for the acid peels, they dilute in water, and you can make your own at home with simple products,</li>
            <li> I use it as a hand cream now cuz i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as my other moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li> Just right.</li>
            <li> I use this all over my face right after I wash</li>
            <li> I have had a variety of results from creams that were simply too oily or comedogenic to serums that actually dried my skin---this is the best cream that I have used: both prescription and over the counter.</li>
            <li> It was a great experience with Olay Night Restorative Sleep Cream as the skin feels fantastically soft and vibrant the next morning.</li>
            <li> First time ordering creams.  </li>
            <li> Received in time and exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely lov this product!   </li>
            <li> First and foremost, I purchased and started using this product about a month ago hoping to reduce brown age spots.</li>
            <li> so I was willing to give this Definity line Night Cream a try.  </li>
            <li> The cream is quite light with no greasy feel and my skins feels soft and supple after application.</li>
            <li> Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> Starting out, make sure its BUFFERED.</li>
            <li> Starting out, make sure its BUFFERED.</li>
            <li> When I first used this product I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works.  </li>
            <li> cream is not thick or greasy and absorbs quickly.</li>

            <li> Most moisturizers make my skin feel like it is suffocating, but this one feels good and leaves my skin feeling velvety.</li>
            <li> I have had problems with a slight reddening of my fair skin as I&#x27;ve grown older and</li>
            <li> it soaks in so quickly leaving a soft, almost powder like feel to my face.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin that gets irritated easily and use the sensitive brush head.  </li>
            <li> I was very hopeful that maybe it would reduce or get rid of my sun spots on my cheeks which was the main reason I bought this product and was willing to spend $30</li>
            <li> this product, in combination with the foaming moisturizer, eye treatement, and cream and mousse cleansers from the Definity line has made a real difference.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say much about the product&#x27;s effect on wrinkles.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I really did not use the item as I should have.</li>
            <li> They are too much money for a temporary solution.  </li>
            <li> and It really helped lighten my skin and erase my wrinkles.  </li>
            <li> I really like Olay products</li>
            <li> My skin is normally very sensitive to products but this one has been very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> Most products treat one or the other.  </li>
            <li> In addition, the cost is less for better effects.</li>
            <li> Will be back in the future for better deals.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this particular product since July 2008 (about 5 mos.)</li>
            <li> I mainly use this cream for preventative maintenance as I am in my 20&#x27;s</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few and this has been my favorite.  </li>
            <li> The thick cream does disappear into the skin and provide adequate moisturizing but for the cost difference I&#x27;ve found the Olay Total Effects to provide better moisturizing for both day and night, and it comes unfragranced.</li>
            <li> It does not make your skin oily, but just very soft.</li>
            <li> Cause, ladies, I&#x27;ll be frank, I&#x27;m young, and when I get into bed with my husband, I don&#x27;t want to be reminding him of his grandmother!</li>
            <li> I have had more people complement me on my skin, very few wrinkles.</li>
            <li> The product makes other claims, but I found it mostly combats dry skin.  </li>
            <li> This cream, although touted as containing the most glycerin compared to all the other Definity line products, is still WAY too light-weight for someone with extremely dry skin (like me)</li>
            <li> skin is clear.</li>
            <li> (I figured this is because I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I really think my skin looks different now.</li>
            <li> I was having some problems with old acne marks and discoloration and after using these two products for over 2 months I feel like I don&#x27;t even need makeup.</li>
            <li> My skin feels soft after using it, which is also a plus.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I only use this product when I am not able to get enough sleep, so I don&#x27;t use it daily but it sure works wonders when I do use it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25 years old and have been using anti-aging/age-defying products for the past year and a half, as preventative measures. I&#x27;ve used quite a few different brands and always come back to Olay. It&#x27;s inexpensive and still delivers! I just started using Olay&#x27;s Difinity Night Cream and I absolutely love it! It&#x27;s very rich and creamy, not oily or sticky...I have sensetive skin and am prone to breakouts, this doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and hasn&#x27;t made me break out at all. And it smells absolutley wonderful! Cause, ladies, I&#x27;ll be frank, I&#x27;m young, and when I get into bed with my husband, I don&#x27;t want to be reminding him of his grandmother! I&#x27;ve noticed that the newer Olay products are starting to smell a lot better than in the past...but this one is just awesome! It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and seems to give me a glow. I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this each night, along with the ProX moisturizer with SPF30 during the day.  The combination has made a big difference in how my skin looks.  It now looks younger and fresher.  The red blotches have disappeared and my skin looks wonderful!</li>
            <li> This product feels like velvet when you put it on and smells wonderful. My skin is normally very sensitive to products but this one has been very gentle on my skin.</li>
            <li> First time ordering creams.  Glad I did. Received in time and exactly what I needed.  Will be back in the future for better deals.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Absolutely lov this product!   It works for me. moisturizing... Smoothing...   n blemish control all in one pack! Love Olay! :)</li>
            <li> I use it as a hand cream now cuz i don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s as good as my other moisturizer for the face.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I am only 29 years old but my skin was beginning to darken around my mouth and chin area; this is a common occurrence amongst the women in my family. I have been using this particular product since July 2008 (about 5 mos.). I no longer have that darkening around my mouth or chin. I even wonder if it was ever there but reviewing pictures shows me that it was actually there. I don&#x27;t use the product every night but most nights I do. I don&#x27;t love the price tag but this is the one product that I am willing to spend a bit more on.</li>
            <li> I like this product. I like to use it with Regenerist serum. Apply the serum first then after a few minutes appy Restorative night Cream. I had compliments when using this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at the suggestion of Olay web site for help in decreasing age spot appearance.  I&#x27;ve used it for 6 weeks and see no evidence of change in the spots.  I&#x27;ve found the fragrance over powering and annoying for overnight use.  The thick cream does disappear into the skin and provide adequate moisturizing but for the cost difference I&#x27;ve found the Olay Total Effects to provide better moisturizing for both day and night, and it comes unfragranced. In addition, the cost is less for better effects.</li>
            <li> Disappointed with the product. Tried it for 3 months now. I was very hopeful that maybe it would reduce or get rid of my sun spots on my cheeks which was the main reason I bought this product and was willing to spend $30 but it doesn&#x27;t work. My spots are still there. I don&#x27;t think it made it lighter either. But gave this product a 3/5 because it did make my skin soft and smooth with use and also didn&#x27;t get breakouts (like I usually do) since I eat chocolate a lot. I would buy this product again if it cost $10 or less because I think I should be using a night cream or something but I think I will try another brand first and see it that works better.</li>
            <li> Actually I didn&#x27;t buy this product.  It appears to be tested on animals and this goes against my morals.  I don&#x27;t know why I&#x27;ve been asked to rate it.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I purchased and started using this product about a month ago hoping to reduce brown age spots. So far, I have seen absolutely no results. Another issue I have with this product is that it has a very strong perfume smell that kind of stings my skin (I figured this is because I have sensitive skin). I will be looking for a cheaper alternative that works and does not sting.</li>
            <li> I really think my skin looks different now. I got the whole sequence of products, this is just one step, and I loved it</li>
            <li> I am 26 years old and use this product with the definity tinted moisturizer and I love both! I was having some problems with old acne marks and discoloration and after using these two products for over 2 months I feel like I don&#x27;t even need makeup. It doesn&#x27;t break me out at all. It is perfect!</li>
            <li> As much as I use SPF daily, I still tend to have very fair skin which burns and freckles easily. There is a brown sun spot on my cheek that I wanted to lighten, so I figured I would give this product a try. I used it for 6 months and nothing changed. My skin was hydrated, but the hyper-pigmentation spot is still there. If you are looking to lighten those pesky, brown, sun damage spots, it might be best to try something else. I was disappointed as I have never had a bad experience with any Olay products before this. I have been a faithful user of Olay for over 20 years.</li>
            <li> This product is great for night time use.  It is heavy enough to offer heavy duty moisturizing but not too greasy to make you uncomfortable to put your cheek on the pillow. It also doesn&#x27;t clog my pores like other moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 6 weeks now.  My skin is looking clearer and more hydrated.  My skin tone looks more even.  I will definitely continue using this product.</li>
            <li> I have used various types of prescription and non prescription moisturizers/creams to stave off the aging process. I have had a variety of results from creams that were simply too oily or comedogenic to serums that actually dried my skin---this is the best cream that I have used: both prescription and over the counter. I like the over the counter price with the better than prescription results---and no breakouts/oily films/dryness. Just right.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for the price.  It works best for dryness.  The product makes other claims, but I found it mostly combats dry skin.  My skin feels soft after using it, which is also a plus.</li>
            <li> Olay generally has the best facial care products with a more reasonable pricetag.  The Definity line tends to be slightly more expensive than the others.  But this night cream provides good overnight moisturizing.  I get many compliments on my skin and I use Olay day and night products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid fan of Olay Products, I have noticed a remarkable difference in my skin.  My skin is radiant with a sun kissed appearence.  Just love love this product!</li>
            <li> I just started using this...as advised on the [...] skin consult...and love it!  Amazon has about the best price I&#x27;ve found, as well.  Works great with the starter kit that comes with the products in this line all in one great kit for a great price savings (eye serum, tinted face moisturizer with sunscreen and cleanser).  I use the products in the kit during the day and the cleanser and night cream at night.</li>
            <li> I am 60 and have relatively wrinkle-free skin. However i have rosacea on my cheeks, nose, and forehead, and i have some dark spots from sun exposure without sunscreen. Plus my skin is getting drier with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for 3 weeks - the package says that it takes 8 weeks for noticeable effects. I&#x27;ve already seen decrease in redness and improvement in my skin&#x27;s texture. One of my larger dark areas is lightening, although in other areas not as much yet - but i still have 5 weeks to go and it is giving me hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream is not thick or greasy and absorbs quickly. Most moisturizers make my skin feel like it is suffocating, but this one feels good and leaves my skin feeling velvety. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and it doesn&#x27;t exacerbate oiliness in my T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a slight cucumber-melon scent which is not unpleasant, although i could live without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first night cream i&#x27;ve been happy to use nightly.</li>
            <li> I started a new facial routine with the Olay Definity line and included this Night Restorative Sleep Cream. I Love it so much, I use it in the daytime as well. It makes my face feel so smooth and hydrated, and I like the scent. I have definately noticed a difference in my facial skin health since beginning using the Olay Definity line products approximately two months ago.</li>
            <li> I just purchased this night cream, and I love it!  It isn&#x27;t too heavy and you just need a little at a time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product after christmas...and too be quite frank i have not seen any reduction in age spots and no lines being diminished. I read today on the internet that plain yogurt removes age spots...i can get 8 oz of that for 50 cents...will let you kn how that works....</li>
            <li> Me and my wife were looking for a night cream as beginners as we are in our late 20s and we never tried a night cream or any anti- wrinkle cream before. It was a great experience with Olay Night Restorative Sleep Cream as the skin feels fantastically soft and vibrant the next morning. The texture of the cream is also pretty smooth and we really liked it as we are very picky in choosing creams with good texture (Not too dry, not too sticky). So, you should definitely try this cream as it is a perfect choice for specially who wants to start using Night creams!</li>
            <li> Always use this moisturizer. My skin loves it!</li>
            <li> I have been working hard on my on my skin trying to repair recent sun damage.  I have been using a variety of serums, spf&#x27;s, and moisturzers by estee lauder and olay with great results. As soon as I applied this to my skin, I loved it! I loved the silky whipped creamy consistency. Unfortunately, in the morning it had created a huuuuuuuuge painful blister like pimple. When I tried it again for one more night, I got another! I gave it to hubby-hopefully he has better luck :( $30 gone :(</li>
            <li> I admit I have been very impressed with the Olay Definity Anti-spot treatment that treats age/brown spots so I was willing to give this Definity line Night Cream a try.  This cream, although touted as containing the most glycerin compared to all the other Definity line products, is still WAY too light-weight for someone with extremely dry skin (like me) whose dry skin problem is worsen by 14 years of living in the Southwestern desert.  After applying a layer of this cream, I find myself having to top off with a thicker cream like Eucerin to seal in precious moisture.  If I didn&#x27;t, I would wake up with tight, parched skin and likely break out in eczema, even with a humidifier running all night in my bedroom.  As for the cream&#x27;s ability to even out the skin tone, I haven&#x27;t noticed any difference (yet?) but, because I am treating my more noticeable brown spots with the anti-spot treatment, those brown spots are shrinking significantly.  However, to be fair, perhaps I too need to compare pre-cream/post-cream photos of myself, like that other reviewer did, before I can see the true effects of this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My biggest dislike about this cream is the perfume.  The smell is overwhelming!  With that much perfume, I can&#x27;t imagine that it&#x27;s good for ANY types skin, much less dry skin since perfume is mostly alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll (try to) finish up this tub I have but, truthfully, I don&#x27;t intend to purchase another unless Olay starts marketing a fragrance-free version, like they have for the Regenerist serum and which I also love.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very happy with this night cream. I have had problems with a slight reddening of my fair skin as I&#x27;ve grown older and this product, in combination with the foaming moisturizer, eye treatement, and cream and mousse cleansers from the Definity line has made a real difference. The cream is quite light with no greasy feel and my skins feels soft and supple after application. Use of these products has eliminated all my dry skin issues and improved the feel, texture and appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> O lay has stopped making this cream so when I found it here I stocked up on it as it is the only cream that I can wear.  Shop around before you make a purchase.</li>
            <li> I only used it a few times and it made my skin itch(sometimes I had to wash it off), so if you have a sensitive skin be careful. I can&#x27;t judge its&#x27; anti-aging benefits b/c of short-term use.</li>
            <li> Of all the night creams I have ever used, Olay&#x27;s Definity is the best ever.  Each morning when I apply my makeup, there is a glow to my mature skin.  Thanks Olay!</li>
            <li> I have been using this night cream for over a year and I like the way it applies. It&#x27;s not thick, it spreads on very easily, and makes my skin feel smooth, not sticky. During the winter months, sometimes I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s thick enough (face feels dry later), but in the warmer months, I really like it. I have tried other creams but then I end up going back to this one.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It is light weight, provides good moisture, smooths on easily and just feels good on your skin.</li>
            <li> Although I THOUGHT I ordered the Intense Moisture, this corrective night cream is very very nice.  It goes on very smooth, oh so light fragrance, and it soaks in so quickly leaving a soft, almost powder like feel to my face.  Very nice and I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> My favorite night cream</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 4 months now and love it. I definitely noticed the darkness around my mouth evening out and an overall brightness with my skin. The cream goes on light and immediately softens your skin. I mainly use this cream for preventative maintenance as I am in my 20&#x27;s so I can&#x27;t say much about the product&#x27;s effect on wrinkles. My skin has a noticeably smoother look with smaller pores. I would definitely recommend this as a well-priced skin brightening nightly moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast. I really did not use the item as I should have. I did not put it on every night I did like that it was not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I love this cream, I can already see the spots on my forehead from pimples fading. I will continue to order this product on amazon until the discontinued stock is depleted. :)</li>
            <li> This product is so good for your skin. Goes on smooth and your skin feels like silk afterwards. Leave it as it is.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let this crap get in your hair by accident! It&#x27;ll make your hair thin out, and you&#x27;ll wind up with a bald spot!</li>
            <li> Works Great, need to get the whole set recommended via Olay website</li>
            <li> I love this. It does not make your skin oily, but just very soft. I have had more people complement me on my skin, very few wrinkles. skin is clear. I am 63 and my skin looks so much younger</li>
            <li> I get hyper-pigmentation around my eyes, (melasma), that comes out anytime I get sun on my face because I have \\&quot;hyperactive melanocytes\\&quot;.  One day I go without sunblock and it comes back or it deepens.  Sometimes it looks like someone beat me. :)  Once it appears, its an ordeal to diminish it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried photofacials that remove it but, like I said, it takes one day out in the sun without sunblock or sunblock thats worn off and its back. They are too much money for a temporary solution.  I&#x27;ve also tried so many products geared towards reducing hyper-pigmentation, including this one, that seem to work on others but do nothing for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream has a nice texture, it feels good, smells nice but nothing impressive. It didn&#x27;t do anything for my spots.  I actually like  [[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]] more. It feels nice, moisturizes great and its cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your dark spots are mild, given from the other reviewers experience, this might work for you.  If you, like me, have tried everything out there and nothing seems to work, this probably won&#x27;t work either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has worked for me and has helped me finally control it, with time and patience, has been a combination of things. Melasma can be found on the surface layer of the skin (epidermis) or inner layer (dermis) but is usually a combination of both.  Most products treat one or the other.  Of all the things I use I don&#x27;t know which one is more effective but the combination of them has worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-[[ASIN:B002RZKFAQ Nutra Sonic 1020 Professional 4 Speed Face and Body Cleansing System, Lavender]] to clean and exfoliate my skin.  I have sensitive skin that gets irritated easily and use the sensitive brush head.  I only use it once a day at night.&lt;br /&gt;-Arbutin Serum by Himistry.  (I got it on amazon but they no longer seem to carry it).  I use this all over my face right after I wash it.&lt;br /&gt;-[[ASIN:B005FPN1KQ philosophy Miracle Worker Dark Spot Corrector, 1 Ounce]]- I use this after the serum only on the dark spots.  Its pricey but you use a very little amount.&lt;br /&gt;-[[ASIN:B00700H128 Hydrating Repair Peptide Wrinkle Cream (Post Peel) - Enhanced with Matrixyl® 3000, Argireline®, Hyaluronic Acid &amp; Natural Botanical Extracts]] as a night cream.&lt;br /&gt;-[[ASIN:B004ZF75LS Ole Henriksen Protect the Truth Sunscreen SPF 50+-1.7 oz]]. Sunblock is a must!  I&#x27;ve tried a few and this has been my favorite.  Not the best moisturizer, I moisturize before hand, but has high spf, doesn&#x27;t leave a white haze or make my eyes tear up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also give myself facial peels at home every 7-10 days.  I love them, they are convenient, cheap and have made a huge difference on my skin.  If you&#x27;ve never given yourself a peel at home, try it, you will LOVE it. I started with the mildest peels and over time have worked myself slowly to the higher level peels.  Its your skin, you have to be careful with it and not get overzealous.  I have had no problems, only benefits. I started out with a lactic 50%, then a lactic 70%, then a glycolic 35%, then a glycolic 50%, then a glyclolic 70%.  Now I alternate between lactic one week, glycolic the next because they treat different layers of the skin.  Glycolic penetrates just a little deeper than lactic but it doesn&#x27;t compare to the moisturizing qualities of lactic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) buy a brush like this one:&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004NMF63W Taklon Fan Mask Brush Acid Applicator for Glycolic Lactic TCA Skin Peel / Masques (Small)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) a peel neutralizer, (you don&#x27;t need one for the acid peels, they dilute in water, and you can make your own at home with simple products, I just like having one as an extra precaution. I am using this one [[ASIN:B000VEN3RW Neutralizer skin pH balancer helps balance the pH of your skin for the safe and effective neutralization after peeling.]]. Its ok but I am going to look for another one that I like more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) and I recommend you start with this peel. [[ASIN:B000PNXBU8 Lactic Acid 50% Gel Peel, 30ml (Professional)]] Starting out, make sure its BUFFERED. This company is great, very responsive and they offer a lot of information on their site.  They also sell a 35% one on their site if you want to start even milder.  I would say the 50% lactic feels like a 20% glycolic peel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lactic acid is one of the mildest peels, a great humectant, and it helps with surface pigmentation.  Use it once a week at night, build up the time you leave it on to a max of 4 minutes. Neutralize, wash off, add the above mentioned night cream and the next morning your face will feel sooo soft and supple. With a few uses, you will see a reduction in your spots.  If you do the peels, it is imperative that you wear sunblock or it will be for naught.m going to look for another one that I like more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) and I recommend you start with this peel.

            <li> When I first used this product I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it works.  I&#x27;m 64 and It really helped lighten my skin and erase my wrinkles.  I felt like I had a mini face lift!  I can&#x27;t believe that Olay no longer sells this.  They are making a big mistake!!</li>
            <li> I really like Olay products</li>
            <li> I have been using the cream about 1 month.  I love the light feeling and the fragrance.  It&#x27;s advertised as a restorative cream.  I do feel that my skin is smoother and a little clearer since I began using the cream.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
