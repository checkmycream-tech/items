            <li>I have not had any more problems with mammogram check ups.</li>
            <li>I was glad to find this online.</li>
            <li>that nothing&#x27;s been able to do for me except birth control, so</li>
            <li>more words.  </li>
            <li>It is still better than nothing</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t 100% happy with this, but I&#x27;m surprised it did anything at all</li>
            <li>Thanks Arbonne for making me feel better and well balanced!</li>
            <li>was pleased to find it here very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li>I can not say enough about this product I am feeling so happy again.</li>
            <li>If any one has an extra I would greatly and always be in your debt if you could send me one thank you.</li>
            <li>Anything that can do that is worth the price!</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t seem like the original; the lotion seemed watery</li>
            <li>Now, after 5 weeks, flashes are completely GONE, headaches are mostly gone and I am sleeping MUCH better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first time around it was great, my acne lightened up considerably, entirely went away at some point, and I got my period after about a month of doing one pump a day.</li>
            <li>I have had a full hysterectomy.  </li>
            <li>I am feeling much better and I highly recommend this product to all women.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s my own personal experience.</li>
            <li>I believe my body was estrogen dominant, and Phyto Prolief restored a more natural balance.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re having some kind of similar issue, I do suggest trying it.</li>
            <li>Since I started the cream I have noticed a decrease in hot flashes, to one to two flashes per day and my mind has cleared and is tracking better, not as emotional.</li>
            <li>Used to use prolief, but switched to this to help with periodic hot flashes at night.  </li>
            <li>Really works!</li>
            <li>This cream seems to help lessen the severity and the frequency of my hot flashes.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in hot flashes.</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more in the future.</li>
            <li>It took about 3-4 weeks for the effects to really sink in but it was worth the wait.  </li>
            <li>My wife loves this product says it does wonders for her hot flashes.</li>
            <li>so I knew exactly what to expect...</li>
            <li>Keeps my hot flashes away.</li>
            <li>I got my energy back, feel much calmer and more balanced, and lost some inches around my stomach area.</li>
            <li>Tried going without it to see if it really is helpful</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>I instead found a menopause doctor for real help.</li>
            <li>I immediately saw results, it really made a difference.</li>
            <li>and I get light to moderate cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I have never experienced a hot flash and also is helpful in getting a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li>So far no relief from hot flashes.</li>
            <li>Coffee is good for you, then not good for you.  </li>
            <li>Soy is good for women, not good for women.  </li>
            <li>My night sweats are completely gone and it has lessened the intensity of my hot flashes.</li>
            <li>She said there was really nothing more she could do for me since I&#x27;m already taking Estrodial low dose on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>I have not been able to lose any weight since having my baby a year and a half ago despite all efforts.</li>
            <li>Sometimes it&#x27;d only last one or two days, sometimes more, but it just wasn&#x27;t normal.</li>
            <li>Sad day from my happy cream</li>
            <li>At first I applied the cream twice per day and have cut back to once per day.</li>
            <li>I was feeling drained, emotional, and having about 10 severe hot flashes a day.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now 15 years later I am using the Phytoprolief to again keep cycles balanced but also to help with night sweats and hot flashes as well....</li>
            <li>Since I started using this product, my hot flashes are back</li>
            <li>So glad I found it here because it&#x27;s hard to find a rep in Maui.</li>
            <li>This product is a natural progesterone, not a synthetic one, which a doctor wanted to prescribe for me.  </li>
            <li>My hot flashes are so minor now.</li>
            <li>I have to say that Phyto Prolief has completely stopped my hotflashes, I&#x27;m sleeping through the night now, and I&#x27;m not dragging every day.  </li>
            <li>I am 51 years old</li>
            <li>My symptoms started in my early 40&#x27;s</li>
            <li>also like that it is a natural product.</li>
            <li>this product was rancid and old..</li>
            <li>I bought this a while ago to deal with the fact that I don&#x27;t get a period naturally</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25 and have never had a naturally occurring cycle.)&lt;br</li>
            <li>you Arbonne Phytoprolief Natural Balancing Cream</li>
            <li>I have passed out once due to the severity of my hot flashes.</li>
            <li>I have been using the Prolief since my early 30&#x27;s, at the time to balance my cycle back to 28 days instead of everyother week being on my period.</li>
            <li>I use to suffer from hot flashes all the time and feeling run down and not getting a restful sleep.</li>
            <li>I recently had a full hysterectomy including ovaries and have used this product in the past for menopausal symptoms.  </li>

            <li> you Arbonne Phytoprolief Natural Balancing Cream</li>

            <li> I have been using the Prolief since my early 30&#x27;s, at the time to balance my cycle back to 28 days instead of everyother week being on my period.</li>

            <li> I recently had a full hysterectomy including ovaries and have used this product in the past for menopausal symptoms.  </li>
            <li> and i feel normal again with my mood swings and no more night sweats.</li>
            <li> I still have a long way to go</li>
            <li> The cream takes a long time to absorb into the skin.</li>
            <li> I started last week and am already down over 5 pounds.</li>
            <li> Prior to using I was having 12-15 flashes a day, almost daily headaches and very little sleep.</li>
            <li> and that is my final word on the subject called Arbonne Phytoprolief Balancing Cream</li>
            <li> My doctor will not let me use this product due to they have already found cancer</li>
            <li> I have contacted the seller twice due to needing to return the two bottles.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first about the product.</li>
            <li> not they was my other cream</li>
            <li> I had gone to doctor and complained and he simply said i have to deal with it.  </li>
            <li> I have been let down by the product.  </li>
            <li> I have been let down by the seller.  </li>
            <li> I have been let down by amazon.</li>
            <li> It started to work about 2 and a half weeks in.</li>
            <li> Then it  began working less &amp; less.  </li>
            <li> I think the cream helped a little bit with mood swings.</li>
            <li> and I would even lose a little water weight while using.  </li>
            <li> Little did I know it would also CURE me of my chronic migranes.....</li>
            <li> My hot flashes and night sweats were so bad.</li>
            <li> My hot flashes were so bad that i would be standing in line at the store or wherever</li>
            <li> There is even a cream by Arbonne for women who experience difficult cycles, such as cramps, excessive bleeding and tension.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is working.</li>
            <li> No more feeling depressed.  </li>
            <li> has smelled in the past.</li>
            <li> I used to take birth control for years to handle this, but with recent plan changes that just became too expensive for me.</li>
            <li> Makes ovulation and cramps hardly even noticeable</li>
            <li> This requirement of 15 words is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Product is too expensive to waste.</li>
            <li> My mind was cloudy, I actually felt stupid.</li>
            <li> I have been forced to be unable to buy anymore</li>
            <li> Synthetic is not good for you!</li>
            <li> So I was so skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> and i would just radiate heat and sweat like crazy.</li>
            <li> /&gt; was as bad as being depressed.</li>
            <li> the smell was very unpleasant...</li>
            <li> and I was miserable!</li>

            <li> Love the product, but the pump didn&#x27;t work. Product is too expensive to waste.</li>
            <li> Used this many times - works for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been taking it for about a month. So far no relief from hot flashes. I think the cream helped a little bit with mood swings.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I feel like myself again.</li>
            <li> I started this product at the beginning of Dec. At first I applied the cream twice per day and have cut back to once per day. I was feeling drained, emotional, and having about 10 severe hot flashes a day. My mind was cloudy, I actually felt stupid. Since I started the cream I have noticed a decrease in hot flashes, to one to two flashes per day and my mind has cleared and is tracking better, not as emotional. I&#x27;m still having some problems, but have only been using the cream for one month and feel I will continue to improve if I continue to use the cream. I would like to use the cream twice per day, as that is when I saw the best results, but 36.00 per month puts a stain on my budget. So I guess the cost is my only concern. I am feeling much better and I highly recommend this product to all women. There is even a cream by Arbonne for women who experience difficult cycles, such as cramps, excessive bleeding and tension. That cream works great too. I wish I had had it when I was younger. I hope this was helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Flash</li>
            <li> Used to use prolief, but switched to this to help with periodic hot flashes at night.  It helps regularate my hormones.  Makes ovulation and cramps hardly even noticeable</li>
            <li> Wonderful product/have used to a number of years.  Most importantly, the customer service  for this product was wonderful.  The packaging for product failed, however, the   selling vendor provided wonderful customer sevice and provided restitution for  the failed packaging.  I&#x27;m most grateful.</li>
            <li> Super product!!!  Really works!</li>
            <li> Coffee is good for you, then not good for you.  Soy is good for women, not good for women.  Heard it all, been to tons of doctors, both internationally and in the US.  This product is a natural progesterone, not a synthetic one, which a doctor wanted to prescribe for me.  Synthetic is not good for you! I&#x27;m 49, and have researched this product and progesterone in detail.  I have used this product for 5 months, and it has changed my life.  I got my energy back, feel much calmer and more balanced, and lost some inches around my stomach area. That&#x27;s my own personal experience. I believe my body was estrogen dominant, and Phyto Prolief restored a more natural balance.  My sister has had the same results.  A friend recommended it to me and said she knows many women my age who have used it with great success for pre-menopausal symptoms.  Manufacturers need to put disclaimers on their product, especially if any form of it can somehow cause cancer.  Estrogen has been found to cause cancer, too, by the way, in prescription form.  READ, and be informed.  That&#x27;s the best advice.</li>
            <li> Relieves a lot of symptoms</li>
            <li> My hot flashes and night sweats were so bad. Id wake up drenched. My hot flashes were so bad that i would be standing in line at the store or wherever and i would just radiate heat and sweat like crazy. Im talking dripping sweat. I have passed out once due to the severity of my hot flashes. I had gone to doctor and complained and he simply said i have to deal with it.  So I was so skeptical about this product. After trying it for a week i almost threw the bottle out but decided to hang on and continue using it . It started to work about 2 and a half weeks in. Im so glad i continued to use it. My night sweats are completely gone and it has lessened the intensity of my hot flashes. For those who want to try i suggest to hang in there and give it 2-3 weeks before it kicks in and you will be glad you did. I have now been using it for 3 months and i feel normal again with my mood swings and no more night sweats. My hot flashes are so minor now.</li>
            <li> This cream seems to help lessen the severity and the frequency of my hot flashes.  Anything that can do that is worth the price!</li>
            <li> I recently had a full hysterectomy including ovaries and have used this product in the past for menopausal symptoms.  When I get the product in I noticed the label looks different from when I last purchase it.  On the lable it states \\&quot;ingredients have shown to cause cancer in California\\&quot;. My doctor will not let me use this product due to they have already found cancer and it is too risky.   I have contacted the seller twice due to needing to return the two bottles.  I have got no response from the seller.  Amazon keeps telling me to contact the seller.  I have been let down by the product.  I have been let down by the seller.  I have been let down by amazon.</li>
            <li> It is great to have an alterative to perscription meds. This product definately works, I know if I don&#x27;t use it. Thx</li>
            <li> Love this product. Tried going without it to see if it really is helpful and I was miserable! Give yourself several weeks to notice a difference.</li>
            <li> I can not say enough about this product I am feeling so happy again. Our sex life was coming back as well as our marriage. Without this product I thought that going through menopause&lt;br /&gt; was as bad as being depressed. The economy has cause me to need to scale back I have been forced to be unable to buy anymore, I have nothing but good things to say about this product. If any one has an extra I would greatly and always be in your debt if you could send me one thank you. Yolonda Mckinzie 3415 Oro Dam Blvd E #217 Oroville Ca.95966. I feel so sad to have to ask but it is worth a shot again thank you so much it really is a miracle worker, even on relationships.You have no idea how embarrassing this is.</li>
            <li> Love this product ! I use it regularly. But the bottom was open in the bag. Sad day from my happy cream</li>
            <li> I have not been able to lose any weight since having my baby a year and a half ago despite all efforts. I finally went to a doctor who told me my progesterone was very low. My family members use Arbonne and someone suggested I try this. I didn&#x27;t purchase from Amazon since I could get a discount through them. I started last week and am already down over 5 pounds. I still have a long way to go but it&#x27;s been a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> Prior to using I was having 12-15 flashes a day, almost daily headaches and very little sleep. It took about 2 1/2 weeks to notice any improvement. Now, after 5 weeks, flashes are completely GONE, headaches are mostly gone and I am sleeping MUCH better. Only downside...after 9 months with no period, this product seemed to trigger one. Hoping that is just a one-time hormonal transition thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased this during the time I was using nat progesterone cream.  The product is a good quality, I notice my moods stayed even kill and I would even lose a little water weight while using.  I&#x27;ve just decided to use something else to assist my body in making it&#x27;s own progesterone.</li>
            <li> This product really works. It helped me a lot. And, the best, it is healthy.</li>
            <li> I really liked the product. What more do you want me to say. This requirement of 15 words is ridiculous.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Prolief since my early 30&#x27;s, at the time to balance my cycle back to 28 days instead of everyother week being on my period. Little did I know it would also CURE me of my chronic migranes.....and it did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now 15 years later I am using the Phytoprolief to again keep cycles balanced but also to help with night sweats and hot flashes as well....still cured of migranes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this product!</li>
            <li> I recently ordered Phyto Prolief from Arbonne - What a difference it has made! I use to suffer from hot flashes all the time and feeling run down and not getting a restful sleep. I was skeptical at first about the product. I have to say that Phyto Prolief has completely stopped my hotflashes, I&#x27;m sleeping through the night now, and I&#x27;m not dragging every day.  I knew my hormones were off and told the doctor my symptoms. She said there was really nothing more she could do for me since I&#x27;m already taking Estrodial low dose on a daily basis.  I have had a full hysterectomy.  Thanks Arbonne for making me feel better and well balanced!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any changes in hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is working. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase this again.</li>
            <li> No relief me for.  I instead found a menopause doctor for real help.</li>
            <li> This works well for me. I will be ordering more in the future. Thank you.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t seem like the original; the lotion seemed watery</li>
            <li> I think anyone that&#x27;s struggling with premenopausal symptoms should try this. I immediately saw results, it really made a difference.</li>
            <li> I am 51 years old and I wish I had started using this product sooner.  It has changed my life.  No more hot flashes, or Power Surges as I call them. No more feeling depressed.  It took about 3-4 weeks for the effects to really sink in but it was worth the wait.  My symptoms started in my early 40&#x27;s but everyone told me it wasn&#x27;t menopause.  I truly believe if I had started with the Prolief balancing cream then and then moved into the Phyto Prolief cream the last 10 years would have been alot different for me.  I am doing great now though.</li>
            <li> It has not addressed my symptoms at all. The cream takes a long time to absorb into the skin. Since I started using this product, my hot flashes are back and I haven&#x27;t had any in 4 or 5 years!</li>
            <li> My wife loves this product says it does wonders for her hot flashes.</li>
            <li> Purchased this product after Arbonne dropped the item from their sales line</li>
            <li> The product came as planned, on time and packaged well.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product!  It has relieved my anxiety related to menopause.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it is a natural product. I have been using for atleast one year now.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff but switched to proleif to reduce my breast cancer risk which runs in my family.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using this cream.... I have not had any more problems with mammogram check ups. Good deal.</li>
            <li> I had bought this before through a friend who is a distributor. I was glad to find this online. I use for when I feel hormonal.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this product before so I knew exactly what to expect...this product was rancid and old..the smell was very unpleasant...not they was my other cream has smelled in the past.</li>
            <li> Irritated because Arbonne discontinued this product.</li>
            <li> Been using it for decades. Hope it stays in production in great quality that will benefit the needed users.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while ago to deal with the fact that I don&#x27;t get a period naturally and I get light to moderate cystic acne. I used to take birth control for years to handle this, but with recent plan changes that just became too expensive for me. (FYI: I&#x27;m 25 and have never had a naturally occurring cycle.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time around it was great, my acne lightened up considerably, entirely went away at some point, and I got my period after about a month of doing one pump a day. I did this for another month, however, and I started to get my period about every two weeks. Sometimes it&#x27;d only last one or two days, sometimes more, but it just wasn&#x27;t normal. So I&#x27;ve stopped now, but I&#x27;m thinking of trying it again by lowering the doses to one pump every two days, or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re having some kind of similar issue, I do suggest trying it. I think it&#x27;s a matter of figuring out what dose works for you because no two bodies are the same. I wasn&#x27;t 100% happy with this, but I&#x27;m surprised it did anything at all that nothing&#x27;s been able to do for me except birth control, so I&#x27;m still gonna be recommending it to people with a bit of a head&#x27;s up added on.</li>
            <li> Been using this for years.  Very good product  was pleased to find it here very reasonably priced!</li>
            <li> more words.  I said it all and that is my final word on the subject called Arbonne Phytoprolief Balancing Cream</li>
            <li> have used for years works great</li>
            <li> I loved this Arbonne Phytoprolief for about a year.  Then it  began working less &amp; less.  It is still better than nothing so I&#x27;ll keep purchasing it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this product for years because it works so great with no ill effects. So glad I found it here because it&#x27;s hard to find a rep in Maui.</li>
            <li> Keeps my hot flashes away. Prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and couldn&#x27;t possibly be without. I have never experienced a hot flash and also is helpful in getting a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and I received it very quickly!</li>
            <li> I will definitely order this product again.  It helped with clearing my skin too!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Arbonne Phytoprolief Natural Balancing Cream</li>
