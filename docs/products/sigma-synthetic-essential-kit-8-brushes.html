            <li>The brushes arrived fast and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>I have owned Sigma brushes in the past and the quality was good</li>
            <li>I finally gave in to these particular brushes after watching many reviews on Youtube from makeup artists.</li>
            <li>They are full, luxuriously soft and very dense (which is what I was after).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t find that I like the large brushs for powders</li>
            <li>The Sigmax fibers really make these brushes shine.   </li>
            <li>So after some internet research, I decided to get this whole set, and i adore it.</li>
            <li>Honestly, they have become part of my everyday go to brushes</li>
            <li>Pretty certain it will be hard to find this nice of quality brushes at retailers or elsewhere for this price.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I got it far before the estimated delivery date, which was fantastic because I had a freelancing job consultation the next day</li>
            <li>After paying a lot of money for high end foundation brushes, I finally found something that i enjoy the handling of.</li>
            <li>always had natural bristle brushes, these are my first synthetic brushes that do what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li>This particular series of brushes is a keeper.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Thank you Sigma for making high quality make up brushes at an affordable price.</li>
            <li>I would recommend the Sigma brushes highly.</li>
            <li>We will definitely be completing the set in the very near future! :)</li>
            <li>and i do think every professional got to have !!</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good foundation brush for a long time now, and was never satisfied with the ones I found here in the Drugstores.</li>
            <li>I cannot say a single negative thing about these brushes, they are amazing!</li>
            <li>(and after using countless brands of brushes, I always plan on picking hairs off clients for the first week or two of use).</li>
            <li>I just cant get over how soft and durable these brushes are!</li>
            <li>Professional Brush Set)</li>
            <li>They are soft to the skin and applies make up professionally.</li>
            <li>and soooo soft.</li>
            <li>The whole set has become essential for my makeup routine.</li>
            <li>They are dense and soft.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind a retailer trying to make a profit BUT, completely ripping somebody off is just not right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li>because I feel that there are equally decent brushes of that quality at retailers such as Target and Ulta in term of quality and price.</li>
            <li>only complaint is the customer service becuase I emailed 2 times with the review for my first set of brushes and have never heard back regarding my free gift for leaving a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Mac and Sephora still have higher product quality overall, but this specific collection of brushes is solid for the price.    </li>
            <li>No regrets!</li>
            <li>Dense and super soft - they are top quality and far less expensive than MAC brushes.</li>
            <li>I live in the UK and found it A LOT cheaper to order it from the States rather than sourcing them locally (even including international shipping!).</li>
            <li>She absolutely loves them and they work extremely well.</li>

            <li> After paying a lot of money for high end foundation brushes, I finally found something that i enjoy the handling of.</li>
            <li> always had natural bristle brushes, these are my first synthetic brushes that do what they are supposed to.</li>
            <li> This particular series of brushes is a keeper.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Thank you Sigma for making high quality make up brushes at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the Sigma brushes highly.</li>
            <li> We will definitely be completing the set in the very near future! :)</li>
            <li> and i do think every professional got to have !!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good foundation brush for a long time now, and was never satisfied with the ones I found here in the Drugstores.</li>
            <li> I cannot say a single negative thing about these brushes, they are amazing!</li>
            <li> (and after using countless brands of brushes, I always plan on picking hairs off clients for the first week or two of use).</li>
            <li> I just cant get over how soft and durable these brushes are!</li>
            <li> Professional Brush Set)</li>
            <li> They are soft to the skin and applies make up professionally.</li>
            <li> and soooo soft.</li>
            <li> The whole set has become essential for my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> They are dense and soft.</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind a retailer trying to make a profit BUT, completely ripping somebody off is just not right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed.  </li>
            <li> because I feel that there are equally decent brushes of that quality at retailers such as Target and Ulta in term of quality and price.</li>
            <li> only complaint is the customer service becuase I emailed 2 times with the review for my first set of brushes and have never heard back regarding my free gift for leaving a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Mac and Sephora still have higher product quality overall, but this specific collection of brushes is solid for the price.    </li>
            <li> No regrets!</li>
            <li> Dense and super soft - they are top quality and far less expensive than MAC brushes.</li>
            <li> I live in the UK and found it A LOT cheaper to order it from the States rather than sourcing them locally (even including international shipping!).</li>
            <li> She absolutely loves them and they work extremely well.</li>
            <li> Extremely touching-a-cloud-soft bristles, steady grip,an obvious carefully calculated craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been in cosmetics for over 10 years and have worked for two very high end companies - not to mention that I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and will try any product at least once to see if I should add it to my freelancing kit or personal cosmetic wardrobe.</li>
            <li> The only brush that you need in addition to this set is a loose powder brush for setting rather than buffing.</li>
            <li> I sometimes come across them on Ebay but the price has been hugely inflated which makes me angry.  </li>
            <li> Although they were expensive, they were well worth it!  </li>
            <li> I haven’t found brushes like these in any other big name company.</li>
            <li> Upon their arrival I washed each one (yes it does take a while for them to dry since they are packed so densely) and used them this morning.</li>
            <li> I may have to purchase the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape system to reduce the dry times!</li>
            <li> and i will never use any other brand of makeup brushes on myself or clients.</li>
            <li> i have used other brushes, sponges, fingers, but this</li>
            <li> They are very thick and take about 7+ hours to dry.</li>
            <li> but I use the small one for eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on make-up brushes that I hated and I was a little skeptical to buy another set online</li>
            <li> &amp; it&#x27;s too difficult to find</li>
            <li> Also, it is quite difficult to get hold of stockists this end.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I cannot say a single negative thing about these brushes, they are amazing! A great buy and investment. Love them!</li>
            <li> I love all of my Sigma Brushes!  This is my second order and I love them.  I would highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> I love this set of brushes, is a must have. It arrived on time and exactly as describe.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is the customer service becuase I emailed 2 times with the review for my first set of brushes and have never heard back regarding my free gift for leaving a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am hoping by the 3rd time they will send me my gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise this is a great purchase.</li>
            <li> i got my sigma kabuki kit, the brush bristles are a very good quality for flawless makeup application. i highly recommend this for all the girls who wants to invest for good makeup brushes! &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I purchased these for my wife for her birthday. She had seen them being used on all of those YouTube Videos and was beyond excited to receive them. They were her #1 wish list item...They came on time, looked great, and she said she loves them. Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> These brushes are a solid buy!  Feel great, great density.  Arrived really quickly.  Pretty certain it will be hard to find this nice of quality brushes at retailers or elsewhere for this price.  This particular series of brushes is a keeper.  Mac and Sephora still have higher product quality overall, but this specific collection of brushes is solid for the price.    Beware tho, while this collection is great, I did return the other collection (Sigma Beauty 12pcs. Professional Brush Set) because I feel that there are equally decent brushes of that quality at retailers such as Target and Ulta in term of quality and price.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes! They are so so soft and it gives me an amazing spread of my fondation. This was my first time using Sigma brushes and they are now my absolute favorite. Amazing quality!</li>
            <li> Sigma is my favorite brand when it comes to make up brushes and these brushes are no exceptions. All 8 brushes are useful and can be used for all sorts of stuff. They are soft to the skin and applies make up professionally. I think is a great price for the deal you are getting. No regrets!</li>
            <li> I love my new Sigma synthetic face brushes! They make my mornings better and easier as they blend my foundation and concealer seamlessly and effortlessly. I own a lot of face brushes from a lot of different companies and these are by far my favorite face brushes to work with. Thank you Sigma for making high quality make up brushes at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Great brushes and good service!</li>
            <li> I ordered these brushes after a makeup artist introduced me to them.  They are, without a doubt, the best I have used.  They produce a flawless finish and do not shed.</li>
            <li> I am a cometologist and i will never use any other brand of makeup brushes on myself or clients. If you are thinking of buying any makeup brushes, this is worth the investment  ;)</li>
            <li> My husband ordered me this brush set for valentine&#x27;s day, and they are absolutely AMAZING! I finally gave in to these particular brushes after watching many reviews on Youtube from makeup artists. The brushes are dense, soft, and give a flawless finish. For the price, this set is definitely a bang for its buck! Sigma has always impressed me with their affordable brushes and have yet failed me :)</li>
            <li> I have spent lots of money on make-up brushes that I hated and I was a little skeptical to buy another set online but I did my research and Sigma brushes I found were popular in demand. I just received them today and I absolutely love them. The flat top kabuki works great for foundation application! I am so happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I bought this set of brushes after hearing rave reviews from numerous beauty bloggers. I have owned Sigma brushes in the past and the quality was good but these are outstanding. For reference, I have the Sigma Make Me Crazy set in purple. I had some issues with about three of the brushes from that kit shedding a lot. When I contacted Sigma they quickly sent me replacement brushes which have held up better.   This kit is nothing like the quality of the Make Me Crazy set. The brushes are densely packed, super soft and give you a flawless finish. The Sigmax fibers really make these brushes shine.   Upon their arrival I washed each one (yes it does take a while for them to dry since they are packed so densely) and used them this morning. I mostly use Bare Mineral foundation and these brushes made my foundation look worlds better than any brushes I have ever tried, including the brushes B.E. provides you. I am very pleased with my purchase so far. I can honestly say my makeup looks fantastic today but very natural. I was concerned with the dense fibers they would cake on makeup, but they don&#x27;t.   The only draw back I see to these brushes is cleaning them. They are very thick and take about 7+ hours to dry. I may have to purchase the Sigma Dry&#x27;n Shape system to reduce the dry times!</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good foundation brush for a long time now, and was never satisfied with the ones I found here in the Drugstores. So after some internet research, I decided to get this whole set, and i adore it. After paying a lot of money for high end foundation brushes, I finally found something that i enjoy the handling of. Makeup applies like a dream, and no streaks WHATSOEVER! and soooo soft. The precision ones are just awesome for my concealer and paint pots. The whole set has become essential for my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> am so happy I bought these brushes and I have to thank the makeup gurus on You tube for recommending these brushes.  The are so soft to the touch, easy to use and blends effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I am now writing my review because I wanted to get some wear into them. I can now say I am very impressed with the quality. The craftsmanship  and quality of the materials are definitely the best I&#x27;ve seen and used. The densely packed duo hairs /fiber stands work great for applying high/low pigmented makeup. No shedding and easy clean up and modestly priced.  Way more brush for your money compared to MAC.  I currently use MAC and Real Techniques, which are also great brushes.  I  can now say I have a well diversified brush collection .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Kendra</li>
            <li> I have recently bought sigma through Amazon.com, I received it in short time.&lt;br /&gt;Sigma: it&#x27;s the best brush&#x27;s ever, natural, quality is amazing &amp; it&#x27;s too difficult to find, I search in several countries but I didn&#x27;t find, so I suggest any girl/women to buy sigma brush&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a birthday gift for my fiancee who had mentioned wanting to expand her brush collection. She absolutely loves them and they work extremely well. We will definitely be ordering Sigma Beauty products in the future.</li>
            <li> They are dense and soft. I don&#x27;t find that I like the large brushs for powders but I use the small one for eyeshadow. They are all great for full coverage foundation or concealer. This was a great buy, especially for the price.</li>
            <li> I got this amazing brush does really work as a precision brush the makeup look flawless i love it and i do think every professional got to have !! I recomend this also to any womam who likes a makeup[[ASIN:B005V247N8 Sigma Beauty Synthetic Essential Kit]]</li>
            <li> This is the first time I own any Sigma product and I am very very happy and impressed, the quality of the brushes is incredible and the shipment was very fast even though I live in South America. Very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> Very good quality, but you really don&#x27;t need all of them... get a smaller set!</li>
            <li> My granddaughter requested these for Xmas.  She had done a lot of investigation on them but had never used them.  Now that she has used them she has given them 2 big thumbs up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how thrilled I was when I received my synthetic essential kit by sigma! First of all, I got it far before the estimated delivery date, which was fantastic because I had a freelancing job consultation the next day so I was pleasantly surprised. Secondly, I&#x27;m beyond impressed with the quality of the brushes....especially for the price. I&#x27;ve been in cosmetics for over 10 years and have worked for two very high end companies - not to mention that I&#x27;m a makeup junkie and will try any product at least once to see if I should add it to my freelancing kit or personal cosmetic wardrobe. The brushes are easy to clean, a great length not only to handle but to tote along either in your brush belt or train case, saturate beautifully with creme, liquid and powder products, but they leave a flawless finish as well. No problems with shedding at ALL either (and after using countless brands of brushes, I always plan on picking hairs off clients for the first week or two of use). I&#x27;m definitely going to be expanding my Sigma wardrobe, and have already been telling fellow artists I work with about them. Yay!! :)</li>
            <li> My daughter and I just bought 2 sets of brushes.  Although they were expensive, they were well worth it!  We just absolutely love them!  They DO NOT shed and that&#x27;s the reason we bought them.  They are perfect for all parts of the face and give a flawless, smooth application. We will definitely be completing the set in the very near future! :)</li>
            <li> This amazing company makes absolutely THE perfect make up brushes ever!!!!!! i have used other brushes, sponges, fingers, but this has really change the way i apply my make up from now on. :-)</li>
            <li> I loved these brushes Help me to get a soft skin, These brushes save my time in the morning  before going to work This brush is very soft I love it, Recommend</li>
            <li> These are the best brushes for liquid products that I have ever used. I use cream and mousse blushes, highlighters, correctors, bronzers, etc. And for that kind of products these are amazing. Super dense, soft, hygienic, and good price. I haven’t found brushes like these in any other big name company. I totally recommend them if you like liquid and cream products. For powder formulas they don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I purchased these brushes because of all the good things I have heard about Sigma Brushes! Honestly, they have become part of my everyday go to brushes and I couldn&#x27;t be any happier! They are so easy to clean, and they apply your make up so evenly. I love the P82, F86 and the P86 those are my most favorite out of the set!I always had natural bristle brushes, these are my first synthetic brushes that do what they are supposed to. I just cant get over how soft and durable these brushes are! I want to purchase this set again as a back up!</li>
            <li> I cannot express my joy,really. I just got my brushes this morning in my mail box and as soon as I opened the package I was starstruck!&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the each brush stunned me. Extremely touching-a-cloud-soft bristles, steady grip,an obvious carefully calculated craftsmanship.&lt;br /&gt;Very excited and very satisfied with my order (which,by the way, arrived surprisingly soon). By far the best brushes in my collection. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase my dream set (the \\&quot;make me crazy\\&quot; kit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sigma! &lt;3</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been lusting after these brushes for ages, having heard about them on several make-up blogs and forums.  I decided to order them from Amazon.com (USA). I live in the UK and found it A LOT cheaper to order it from the States rather than sourcing them locally (even including international shipping!). Also, it is quite difficult to get hold of stockists this end. I sometimes come across them on Ebay but the price has been hugely inflated which makes me angry.  I don&#x27;t mind a retailer trying to make a profit BUT, completely ripping somebody off is just not right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with the brushes.  Expectations exceeded!!  They are full, luxuriously soft and very dense (which is what I was after).  I also appreciate the fact that they have synthetic filaments which I find ideal for my sensitive skin.  They have been very well made and the packaging was very cute too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very impressed with the service I received from this Amazon retailer (Sigma Beauty).  I was astounded with how quickly the products reached me.  I ordered them on the weekend and it is now Tuesday and I have them in my hands!  That is the fastest I have ever received a product I have ordered from across the pond!  All-round happy customer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Sigma!</li>
            <li> I bought these for my sister who is a cosmetologist. She was floored that i got such a good deal on such great brushes. She said they are top of the line!</li>
            <li> I like it very excellent soft and high quality .... I advise you to buy it is wonderful i like it</li>
            <li> I have quite a makeup collection....many different brands.  I have done makeup for weddings, friends and love to experiment with new looks.  These brushes are great quality.  A must-have for your collection!</li>
            <li> These Sigma brushes are my new favorite way to apply all powder makeup products. Dense and super soft - they are top quality and far less expensive than MAC brushes. The only brush that you need in addition to this set is a loose powder brush for setting rather than buffing. Great price and super fast shipping from Sigma Beauty (definitely worth the shipping cost)</li>
            <li> These brushes are great.  I use the big ones to apply my foundation, and the smaller ones to apply cream eye shadow and blend my concealer. They are now my favorite foundation brushes.</li>
            <li> The brushes arrived fast and exactly as described.  They brushes are soft and don&#x27;t shed.  I own numerous MAC brushes and the Sigma brushes are superior AND a better value.  I also purchased the tapered face brush F25 and the eyes kit.  I would recommend the Sigma brushes highly.</li>
