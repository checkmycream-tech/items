    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>excellent produit, je suis très satisfaite</li>
            <li>I was very impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  </li>
            <li>Its a very nice dense cream that wears beautifully under makeup in the morning</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>Great price and seems to be helping spider veins at ankles area.</li>
            <li>Ok so this product does work, which I am happy about.</li>
            <li>I liked this product, but preferred Reviva vitamin K cream better.</li>
            <li>I will know better after 30 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just beginning to see a reduction in many of my spider veins.</li>
            <li>I feel confident this product will work if applied correctly.</li>
            <li>You might be able to get it cheaper somewhere else.  </li>
            <li>When applying make sure to rub it in well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered 2 jars (better value), and I will not be able to use it by the expiration date.</li>
            <li>Since it is a cream and somewhat dense it should not be able to spill out when you tilt the jar, but it did.</li>
            <li>But with the brochure they say to hydrate the areas first with warm water and then apply by rubbing briskly in a circular motion.</li>
            <li>Its light weight and non greasy.</li>
            <li>i have a few days with this product and its wonderful started working after 3 days!!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s superior to the Swanson version in that it clearly states the concentration of Vitamin K</li>
            <li>My spider veins on my face were reduced significantly.</li>
            <li>but It may be too rich for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I am very impressed so far but have only just noticed a change in appearance.</li>
            <li>Not too sure it really helps on spider veins.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you need to use it every day and really rub it in.</li>
            <li>so its efficacy is not bad</li>
            <li>I have tried many many different creams/treatments/serums and nothing</li>
            <li>so i hope this review help people, I have been using this product for two months now, the cream is lightweight and evaporates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to stay on the skin to work well, and it contains parabens, which it didn&#x27;t say on the website.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten older I bruise easily on my arms.</li>
            <li>Even better, it also has faded an old bruise that I&#x27;ve had for months</li>
            <li>I iced it right after it happened and applied the Pro K.</li>
            <li>, the burned area has almost healed now and i have been using it 2-3 times daily after softening the area with warm water and the capillaries look exactly like they were before using it.</li>
            <li>but I have used it more on bad bruises and for that it is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Though at first I *thought*</li>
            <li>I have used religiously for a month and it is OK.</li>
            <li>One needs to be extremely consistent when using this product, and you need to thoroughly wet your face with WARM WATER before applying.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t notice results in the first couple weeks, remain consistent.</li>
            <li>the first 2-3 times I used it</li>
            <li>Not gone but definitely faded.  :-)</li>
            <li>Though I wish I looked into a K cream a long time ago, I&#x27;m glad I did and found this one.  </li>
            <li>This container is not as large as the blurb says.  </li>
            <li>Tried twice a day was too much went to once a day and has somewhat worked.</li>
            <li>I could find on the internet at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>it works, but very slow.....not as advertised</li>
            <li>then i had the whole area chemically burned thinking that it will increase the absorption of the product, and it did nothing</li>
            <li>It really helped with fading and itchy skin.</li>
            <li>The product was very pricey</li>
            <li>and I felt it didn&#x27;t really work well.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for bruises.</li>
            <li>I really like this cream.</li>
            <li>Doesnt really work, i havent seen any difference.....</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>The product brochure FAQ mentions that most people do not see a reduction in the first few weeks but by week 7 or 8 of application their spider veins have healed &amp; disappeared.</li>
            <li>If there is a difference it is subtle but the cream does feel good on my face</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product after doing much research online.  </li>
            <li>Not sure it works to be honest.</li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a reflection on this particular brand of Vitamin K cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not an instant remedy, but it sure makes a big difference.</li>
            <li>This says it helps with brown spots also, but I didn&#x27;t find it works particularly noticeably.  </li>
            <li>That has received high ratings online</li>
            <li>I tend to use more on trouble spots which also seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li>I was expecting new product, which should not expire in 5 months from ordering.</li>
            <li>The spider vein has remained exactly the same even though I continued applying the cream as indicated.</li>
            <li>The small veins on my face are diminished and the sore spots heal much better.</li>
            <li>Tried the cream to clear up Schamburg&#x27;s Purpura.</li>
            <li>so in general it&#x27;s a light everyday moisturizing cream, but it doesn&#x27;t work for healing, redness nor capillaries.</li>
            <li>Normally my bruises will last months.</li>
            <li>Decided to buy refill, and at the same time will try something new.</li>
            <li>When I opened the jar it appeared only half full</li>
            <li>Not so lucky me with small spider veins on and around my nose &amp; rosacea - hereditary in my Irish/fare-skinned family.  </li>
            <li>I used this particular product religiously twice daily for about three months and saw absolutely no difference.  </li>

            <li> Works well sometimes, but generally not permanently.</li>
            <li> I thought that I would look on line to see if I could find it for less and order it directly.  </li>
            <li> So far it seems to be fading after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> it faded the color of the capillaries a little bit, after that the red color came back just like it was, these capillaries are on my face so the skin thickness is not a major factor ( compared to using it on the body).</li>
            <li> I followed instructions very carefully and applied this cream on a tiny spider vein twice a day, every day for over 3 months.</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way, especially on the face.</li>
            <li> The black and blue disappeared within a day and so did the soreness.</li>
            <li> been using for 1 month no real change.</li>
            <li> and there is absolutely no change.</li>
            <li> but no thanks to this cream.</li>
            <li> but then again not much else has.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t appear tho do anything other than moisturize.</li>
            <li> This product has brought down my overall facial redness and faded my broken caps.</li>
            <li> has worked for my dark circles.</li>
            <li> Will likely re-order at least once to see if improvement continues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for couple months now and noticed that the spider veins started to look less noticable, as of they started to fade out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 5 weeks and have noticed a slight lightening, as well as decrease in size of affected area.</li>
            <li> A waste of almost $30.</li>
            <li> It has been 15 days of using it everyday.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> What a waste of my $&#x27;s and time.</li>
            <li> wasted my money on this product</li>
            <li> I got it for a few spider veins and it does help</li>
            <li> waste of money i think....</li>
            <li> I learned the cream should have a high concentrate of Vitamin K.  VERY skeptical despite reviews (which I don&#x27;t trust either).  </li>
            <li> If you have really bad varicose or spider veins; you will need to have medical intervention to correct them but for minor issues, bruises etc...</li>
            <li> I have one small vein that I was hoping to get rid of just under my nostril.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure the length of time needed to see a change</li>
            <li> Husband trying it for skin bruising (with age) but not sure it is helping.</li>
            <li> On small spider veins at least.  </li>
            <li> When I applied it to my  clean face it beaded up and looked like I was shedding dead skin, it was disgusting.  </li>
            <li> I use it but not sure if it is making a difference in my spider veins or not!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro K for 3 weeks and have definately noticed a fading of my small broken capillaries on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> That is not to say that it is not a good product</li>
            <li> The Pro K Vitamin K Cream is very slowly working.</li>
            <li> I suffer from erythemic and telangiectasic Rosacea, so I am no stranger to redness and broken capillaries.</li>
            <li> What a waste and disappointment.  </li>
            <li> uses -- under eyes, broken capillaries</li>
            <li> Recently, I got a very painful bump in my forehead.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> For those people who post here that this cream is useless, I think they&#x27;re saying a Vitamin K cream isn&#x27;t doing anything for them</li>
            <li> But unfortunately that made me break out around my eyes.  </li>
            <li> maybe I got a bad batch but</li>
            <li> I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> It swelled up and was a nasty color....</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Works great. My spider veins on my face were reduced significantly. Its light weight and non greasy. I was skeptical but it proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> Tried twice a day was too much went to once a day and has somewhat worked. But not totally sold on product been using for 1 month no real change.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to be fading after a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for couple months now and noticed that the spider veins started to look less noticable, as of they started to fade out. Decided to buy refill, and at the same time will try something new.</li>
            <li> Took two weeks but did the job of clearing up skin problems.</li>
            <li> This cream is the highest concentration Vitamin K I could find on the internet at a reasonable price. It&#x27;s superior to the Swanson version in that it clearly states the concentration of Vitamin K but it&#x27;s also more expensive. Been using for about a month to reduce redness and it has helped. For those people who post here that this cream is useless, I think they&#x27;re saying a Vitamin K cream isn&#x27;t doing anything for them, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a reflection on this particular brand of Vitamin K cream.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for a month.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  I have one small vein that I was hoping to get rid of just under my nostril.  It hasn&#x27;t even diminished the appearance of it.  A waste of almost $30.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product after doing much research online.  I have tried many many different creams/treatments/serums and nothing has worked for my dark circles. I used this particular product religiously twice daily for about three months and saw absolutely no difference.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting miracles or anything but after all that work and dedication I wanted Some indication that it was working...So I stopped using this and ordered \\&quot;Makeup Artists Choice Vitamin K cream\\&quot;.  That has received high ratings online and you can order a generous sample size for $3.50. But unfortunately that made me break out around my eyes.  Its a very nice dense cream that wears beautifully under makeup in the morning but It may be too rich for my skin.  If you need that extra moisture around the eye area I would definitely look in to that product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month now but don&#x27;t see noticeable differences. I&#x27;m not sure the length of time needed to see a change but I&#x27;m going to keep on using it to see if there is any progression.</li>
            <li> I followed instructions very carefully and applied this cream on a tiny spider vein twice a day, every day for over 3 months. Though at first I *thought* the spider vein was beginning to fade away, the effect lasted only one or two days. The spider vein has remained exactly the same even though I continued applying the cream as indicated.</li>
            <li> The Pro K Vitamin K Cream is very slowly working. It has been 15 days of using it everyday. I will know better after 30 days.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of mixed reviews for this product. I&#x27;m just beginning to see a reduction in many of my spider veins. The product brochure FAQ mentions that most people do not see a reduction in the first few weeks but by week 7 or 8 of application their spider veins have healed &amp; disappeared. If you apply as the label mentions it may not work so well. But with the brochure they say to hydrate the areas first with warm water and then apply by rubbing briskly in a circular motion. This needs to be done twice a day which is what I am doing. I am very impressed so far but have only just noticed a change in appearance. I feel confident this product will work if applied correctly. I plan to update here and let others know the results either way.</li>
            <li> it works, but very slow.....not as advertised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 5 weeks and have noticed a slight lightening, as well as decrease in size of affected area. Will likely re-order at least once to see if improvement continues.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream a month before my wedding and used it every day to reduce veins on my cheeks. Did not work. Some say you have to keep using it for several weeks before you see any results, but I gave up.</li>
            <li> Ik didend work as aspect</li>
            <li> Husband trying it for skin bruising (with age) but not sure it is helping.</li>
            <li> Tried the cream to clear up Schamburg&#x27;s Purpura. Had no impact. That is not to say that it is not a good product it just does not provide the results we were looking for in this application.</li>
            <li> Use this almost every night and sometimes during the day. Seems to help but must keep up applications to maintain results. I tend to use more on trouble spots which also seems to make a difference. Would purchase again</li>
            <li> excellent produit, je suis très satisfaite</li>
            <li> This container is not as large as the blurb says.  You might be able to get it cheaper somewhere else.  I bought if for my aunt while she was in a nursing home to help heal the bruises along her arm from all the procedures she had.  It worked well for that.  I used it on some spider veins on my leg that had been there for years, and those went away as well so its efficacy is not bad, it just isn&#x27;t a big jar for the price I paid.</li>
            <li> Not sure it works to be honest. I have used religiously for a month and it is OK. I would go see a dermo instead.....</li>
            <li> Ok so this product does work, which I am happy about. However, it takes time (about a month) to see results. I suffer from erythemic and telangiectasic Rosacea, so I am no stranger to redness and broken capillaries. This product has brought down my overall facial redness and faded my broken caps. One needs to be extremely consistent when using this product, and you need to thoroughly wet your face with WARM WATER before applying. When applying make sure to rub it in well.  Even if you don&#x27;t notice results in the first couple weeks, remain consistent. A little of this product goes a long way, especially on the face.</li>
            <li> I use it but not sure if it is making a difference in my spider veins or not! If there is a difference it is subtle but the cream does feel good on my face so I keep using it!</li>
            <li> so i hope this review help people, I have been using this product for two months now, the cream is lightweight and evaporates quickly so it doesn&#x27;t get a chance to stay on the skin to work well, and it contains parabens, which it didn&#x27;t say on the website. the first 2-3 times I used it it faded the color of the capillaries a little bit, after that the red color came back just like it was, these capillaries are on my face so the skin thickness is not a major factor ( compared to using it on the body). then i had the whole area chemically burned thinking that it will increase the absorption of the product, and it did nothing, the burned area has almost healed now and i have been using it 2-3 times daily after softening the area with warm water and the capillaries look exactly like they were before using it. I have also tried it on some bruises on my face and didn&#x27;t work at all. so in general it&#x27;s a light everyday moisturizing cream, but it doesn&#x27;t work for healing, redness nor capillaries. so don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
            <li> The cream helped with the tiny spider veins that appear over the years. It really helped with fading and itchy skin. I will order again.</li>
            <li> I have used this before and it has always worked well for me. My under eye area is already brighter and smoother.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten older I bruise easily on my arms. I&#x27;ve used Pro K for years. Applying Pro K daily definitely speeds removal of the unsightly discoloration. It&#x27;s not an instant remedy, but it sure makes a big difference.</li>
            <li> As you age and your skin thins and anything you bump into bruises you, this is a miricle cream... Apply daily and it goes away.</li>
            <li> I tried it very several weeks but could not see any difference in the veins on sides of my nose or face.  I finally had them treated at the doctor&#x27;s office.</li>
            <li> I was expecting new product, which should not expire in 5 months from ordering. I ordered 2 jars (better value), and I will not be able to use it by the expiration date. I haven&#x27;t started using the product because I was finishing up another product before starting this one.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to use on my bruises. Normally my bruises will last months. This cream got rid of a recent bruise on my leg within 3 or 4 days. I was very impressed. Even better, it also has faded an old bruise that I&#x27;ve had for months so it&#x27;s almost no longer visible. I&#x27;m very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work.  I have used it faithfully since I had it and there is absolutely no change. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> Not so lucky me with small spider veins on and around my nose &amp; rosacea - hereditary in my Irish/fare-skinned family.  Though I wish I looked into a K cream a long time ago, I&#x27;m glad I did and found this one.  I learned the cream should have a high concentrate of Vitamin K.  VERY skeptical despite reviews (which I don&#x27;t trust either).  I&#x27;m here to say it works.  I used as instructed twice a day (a.m. &amp; p.m.) on damp skin especially watching one predominant vein to measure its actual effectiveness.  Yes.  It works.  On small spider veins at least.  Not gone but definitely faded.  :-)</li>
            <li> I ordered some pro k cream and recieved it about 2 weeks ago. I use pro k cream and have always purchased it from my dermatologist for my facial rosea. I thought that I would look on line to see if I could find it for less and order it directly.  What a waste and disappointment.  When I opened the jar it appeared only half full but that&#x27;s just the start of it. Since it is a cream and somewhat dense it should not be able to spill out when you tilt the jar, but it did. When I applied it to my  clean face it beaded up and looked like I was shedding dead skin, it was disgusting.  Keep in mind that I use this product on a regular basis and it should not be doing this. What a waste of my $&#x27;s and time.</li>
            <li> maybe I got a bad batch but it&lt;br /&gt;goes on clumpy doesn&#x27;t blend into your skin&lt;br /&gt;I wasted my money on this product</li>
            <li> Works well sometimes, but generally not permanently.</li>
            <li> I liked this product, but preferred Reviva vitamin K cream better.</li>
            <li> The product was very pricey and I felt it didn&#x27;t really work well.  I would never use this product again.</li>
            <li> i have a few days with this product and its wonderful started working after 3 days!!! uses -- under eyes, broken capillaries and it works</li>
            <li> Works very well for bruises. Not too sure it really helps on spider veins. They did diminish somewhat.</li>
            <li> My grandmother uses this cream and while it works wonders for her, I feel it is a bit overpriced for the size of the container.</li>
            <li> I ordered this stuff because I had spider veins that appeared on me during my pregnancy and I wanted them to go away, I used this stuff religiously and it never worked. My spider veins did go away after I had my daughter but no thanks to this cream.</li>
            <li> I really like this cream. I got it for a few spider veins and it does help but I have used it more on bad bruises and for that it is wonderful! Recently, I got a very painful bump in my forehead. It swelled up and was a nasty color....I iced it right after it happened and applied the Pro K. The black and blue disappeared within a day and so did the soreness. If you have really bad varicose or spider veins; you will need to have medical intervention to correct them but for minor issues, bruises etc...this cream does the trick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro K for 3 weeks and have definately noticed a fading of my small broken capillaries on my cheeks.  I have a ruddy complexion and this works well to lighten that also.  I would definately recommend this, have just ordered by second jar.</li>
            <li> Doesnt really work, i havent seen any difference.....waste of money i think....</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too impressed.  It didn&#x27;t seem to work for me but then again not much else has.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for several weeks and haven&#x27;t seen any change in the spider veins.  I don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This says it helps with brown spots also, but I didn&#x27;t find it works particularly noticeably.  I&#x27;m sure you need to use it every day and really rub it in.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t appear tho do anything other than moisturize.</li>
            <li> Pro K Cream is a soothing finish to my rosacea treatment.  The small veins on my face are diminished and the sore spots heal much better.</li>
            <li> i would not recommend this product to anyone.  It is chalky when applied and i saw no visible results. thanks</li>
            <li> Great price and seems to be helping spider veins at ankles area.Takes awhile,month or so to begin seeing results.I plan to reorder soon.</li>
