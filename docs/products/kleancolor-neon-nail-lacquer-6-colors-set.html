            <li>that didn&#x27;t stop me from loving this set!&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
            <li>It is a nice set</li>
            <li>You do, however, have to use about 3 coats to get the colors fully effective.</li>
            <li>These are really nice colors</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful &amp; the shipping was quick..</li>
            <li>the colors are really great and vibrant and packaging was great as well.  </li>
            <li>Very cool, bright nail polish set.</li>
            <li>I ordered this thinking &amp;#34; Okay it&#x27;s probably going to be some cheap polish kus of the great price for all of them&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>All colors are very bold and bright..</li>
            <li>This is by far one of the best polishes I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>These are beautiful colors, awesome and heavy glass bottles, well made.</li>
            <li>They are very colorful and they were a good price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really easy to put on (for me, that&#x27;s saying something!).  </li>
            <li>They were so excited with the bright colors.</li>
            <li>As long as she was happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li>I find the consistency perfect, it applies with ease and only need one coat.</li>
            <li>but the bottle is still able to close</li>
            <li>okay...</li>
            <li>and I love this product.</li>
            <li>I will purchase from this seller again gladly.</li>
            <li>Lovely colors.. vibrate colors..</li>
            <li>I get compliments ALL the time on my toes :)</li>
            <li>I know though she is going to love them.</li>
            <li>, I love it.</li>
            <li>I like it better than OPI or China Glaze or Orly...</li>
            <li>I will be buying in EVERY color :)</li>
            <li>: The handles tend to pop off the brush that screws into the top of the jar.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to apply it more than once</li>
            <li>I love Kleancolor now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap nail polish and appears to get the  job done.</li>
            <li>shall be buying more Kleancolor polishes.</li>
            <li>I love the colors.</li>
            <li>I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Any ways, it was okay.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase and the colors are definitely neon, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li>I love these  colors.  </li>
            <li>Kleancolor is one of my favorite nail polish brands.</li>
            <li>one has to read in a hurry when you can’t see well any more - like keys.</li>
            <li>I love these colors...</li>
            <li>Excellent coverage, only takes one or two coats to get the job done!</li>
            <li>Love the colors and packing-</li>
            <li>my niece will love this</li>
            <li>I am so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li>so I am in love.</li>
            <li>I really love this nail polish...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered it...</li>
            <li>Maybe 3-4 days at the most.</li>
            <li>find something of better quality.</li>
            <li>and I love wearing them.</li>
            <li>most of my polishes do anyways.</li>
            <li>and you can almost guarantee most of it will be flaked off by the end.</li>
            <li>If you purchased these in a store you could very well expect to pay 7.00 to 10.00 dollars a bottle or more!!</li>
            <li>and when I got my package I was VERY excited.</li>
            <li>While I haven&#x27;t used them myself, she was very excited about them.</li>
            <li>Love the fact that I get so many bright polishes for such a good price.</li>
            <li>They are so bright an pretty.  </li>
            <li>This is pretty good nail polish.</li>
            <li>packaging was pretty good except for one thing,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m excited to be giving this as a gift!</li>
            <li>The colors seemed bold and nice.  </li>
            <li>Even without a top coat it doesn&#x27;t chip easily if you buff and prepare your nails before applying it.</li>
            <li>My daughter (who is easy to please) fell head over heals in love with all of the colors.  </li>
            <li>Kleancolor is a very good brand, but i  can get this product at my flea market for 1.00 a bottle , i would take a look at your local flea market.</li>
            <li>They are cheap but still pretty good quality.</li>
            <li>These colors are extremely bright, fun, bold, and</li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li>Other than that I am highly impressed with the quality of this nail polish.</li>
            <li>I love these colors they are so fun!</li>
            <li>other than that, great product!</li>
            <li>im in love &lt;3 and will not buy any other brand from now on!!</li>
            <li>because the polish chips a bit too easily in just a day or two.</li>
            <li>but once I saw the package with all the gorgeous colors, I went and bought them a different kind and kept these ones for myself.</li>
            <li>Has strong odor.</li>
            <li>I hope they stay available to keep up the fun! :)</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li>A nice, large size, too...</li>
            <li>They are bright and look really cute on toes or short nails.</li>
            <li>People enJOY</li>
            <li>All in all, this set is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re such a great value.</li>
            <li>importantly, if you can&#x27;t read, you can always see color.  </li>
            <li>The package was wrapped well &amp; secure...</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Nice and thick almost like nail hardener and the colors are so beautiful</li>
            <li>i was so excited to get these</li>
            <li>The Kleancolor Neon Nail Laquer has a nice assortment of vivid colors that goes on evenly and smoothly</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if the packaging issue was Amazon&#x27;s or the original seller (I bought it Prime, and it was shipped to me from Amazon)</li>
            <li>The best part about these polishes is that they are dark enough with one swipe that you don&#x27;t need multiple coats &#x3D; a mother&#x27;s best friend.  </li>
            <li>Most lacquers I&#x27;ve used before require two or more coats for colors to become completely opaque but</li>
            <li>Luckily my favorite colors are orange and green, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect every customer to be happy with the mix up.</li>
            <li>The colors were bright and beautiful and carefully packaged individually.  </li>
            <li>These are just as bright and neon as the photo, so far the colors have held up very well, not chipping easily.</li>
            <li>I should&#x27;ve have known better for the right price and the right color..</li>
            <li>I gave it a 4/5 because I wish that the blue and purple were as bright and shiny as the rest of the colors.</li>
            <li>Bright colors that will last you awhile.</li>
            <li>These bright colors go on opaque with only 2 coats.</li>
            <li>The red almost looks like a bright Orange</li>
            <li>Although Kleancolor is not well known their nail lacquers recieved tons of good feed back so that along with the price made me order this product.</li>
            <li>I like the quality and colors of these polishes and they are pretty true to to color, and for the price I would like to own the whole collection.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell of this nail polish is pretty strong</li>
            <li>It also chips pretty easily.</li>
            <li>Other than that, the end product looks great.</li>
            <li>The package shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>key features include affordability, great colour and also fairly fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want something super pricey</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kudos to Amazon for resolving the issue so quickly and with no hassle to me.  </li>
            <li>Even with high quality top coat.</li>
            <li>They may have a long drying time, but with a good quick drying topcoat it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li>Bought these nail polishes for my teenage sisters and she was absolutely thrilled by the rich colours of this product.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with this product, except when I received it, the blue nail polish was cracked, and leaking.</li>
            <li>and I have a nice top polish that doesn&#x27;t chip with other nail polishes.</li>
            <li>Very pretty.</li>
            <li>very very stinky!</li>
            <li>it does not peel off easily and it goes on very smoothe.</li>
            <li>What you see is what you get; the color is vibrant even after it drys, adding a clear coat was the cherry on top : )</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering more Kleancolor Nail Lacquer sets!</li>
            <li>I love these nail polishes they are great for any occasion especially when in a rush they are a timely dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my nail lacquer on for about 2 days now (with a clear top coat)</li>
            <li>Worth the money</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the pink because it has some kind of glitter or something in it that makes it go on not so smooth.</li>
            <li>Each bottle came individually wrapped in its own paper.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I really love doing crazy stuff with my nails, so when I saw this set, it was just perfect for me</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but only for a day or so.</li>
            <li>I decided that it might be worth trying.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so ridiculously fun to wear.  </li>
            <li>Another product that is a lot of fun to use.  </li>
            <li>i figured if i use 3 coats of clear over coat it does better.</li>
            <li>The blue is significantly darker than the picture, and I was hoping that the reddish color would be more orange-y.</li>
            <li>They can chip kind of easily but for less than $2 a bottle, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>Even though the price is just right...</li>
            <li>and once it is on and drys, it just peels right off.</li>
            <li>She loves the bright colors and these do seem to dry relatively fast.  </li>
            <li>they arrived quickly and were individually wrapped for safe shipping.  </li>
            <li>(lucky me i have no exhaust fans in my house and most of my windows are painted shut) or outside if weather permits.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very delayed, they came over a week after the expected time, the packaging was secure if not a bit excessive, overall very great colors and nice nail polish just do not order if you expect them quickly.</li>
            <li>This does not pose a spillage problem, as it is only the handle to the brush, it&#x27;s just something to be aware may need a quick dab of superglue :)</li>
            <li>so my nail polish usually chips pretty easily, but so far this stuff has worked out great.</li>
            <li>The top where the cap screws on was snapped right off, and there was red nail polish everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Kleancolor has good coverage in vivid colors, and is (for us) a long wearing nail polish.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so used to needing to apply 2-3 coats to get true, opaque, vibrant coverage, but ONE COAT did it with this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, my favorite color of the whole set, Neon Orange, had a frayed brush, but that is barely a problem!</li>
            <li>The colors are great in the bottle but dull on your nails.</li>
            <li>This was our first experiance with the Kleancolor brand</li>
            <li>The Kleancolor brand is the first I have found that will stay on their nails for 24 hours, chewing and all.</li>
            <li>Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li>I really like the colors in this set!</li>
            <li>I got this nail polish for my friend and one for myself and the yellow is ok with the sign I would suggest you to get it</li>
            <li>But overall I LOVE THEM</li>
            <li>the colors are pretty</li>
            <li>my daughter loves all the pretty colors and the quality of the paint.</li>
            <li>These chip within the first day of using them--</li>
            <li>My favorite use is for my various strengths levels of reading glasses (computer screen reading verses sewing etc).  </li>
            <li>These were exactly the colors I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and you must have to put them on more than twice on nails to get the final color.</li>
            <li>the colors are so pretty, i would buy it again</li>
            <li>The colors are pretty, but they don&#x27;t stay on your nails.</li>
            <li>if that&#x27;s what you like to do ; )</li>
            <li>Colors are great, but the polish does not last very long.</li>
            <li>FAST shipment and VERY VERY well packaged.</li>
            <li>My niece on the other hand, is one of those pre-teen girls who has basically everything, was extremely happy with the lacquers and said the blue color that was included was \\&quot;perfect.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The polish starts to peel or crack off pretty fast.</li>
            <li>But other then that they are great especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li>The colors are very vibrant and pigmented.</li>
            <li>The polish is ok, it takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves this product although I think that the smell is extra strong.</li>
            <li>A single coat with a transparent top coat and voila, all set.</li>
            <li>but I certainly will not get it again.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy the green mettallic - for sure!  </li>
            <li>Other than the green being more of a transparent/glittery polish-I love em!</li>
            <li>better than I expected..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used them for sponged on gradients and as water marbles, and they really pop.  </li>
            <li>What is in this where it stains so much like this?  </li>
            <li>There had been an issue with the order but the customer service representative was very helpful.  </li>
            <li>The reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I bought these for my daughter for Christmas and can&#x27;t really say how well they go on or</li>
            <li>Covers very well.</li>
            <li>I liked the colors except for the yellow one its a big transparent.</li>
            <li>They arrived nicely wrapped, but differently wrapped from order to order like they came from different locations?  </li>
            <li>We loved the colors, but takes way to long to dry</li>
            <li>Not exactly konad special polish result, but still very sharp and bright images.</li>
            <li>I could smell the polish before opening the package, way too strong and it lingers a long time without even opening the bottles.</li>
            <li>This nail polish was a gift for my daughter and niece who are totally into keeping their nails looking hip, fresh and funky!</li>
            <li>Not neon at all but still pretty colors and go on relatively thick which is nice</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t actually see this product since I had it sent directly to my 11 year old grand daughter in Kansas</li>
            <li>I decided I wanted a new color!</li>
            <li>Colors are as vibrant as they are in the bottle</li>
            <li>The colors are as vibrant as they appear on the site.  </li>
            <li>I really love the red, blue, and purple colors in this.</li>
            <li>The pink is like a neon pink which i loved</li>
            <li>loved the colors and they shipped fast and none were broken.</li>
            <li>Very bring and vivid.</li>
            <li>This is seriously the best nail polish i have ordered in such a long time.</li>
            <li>To me, the smell is not that strong though it does stink just like any other nail polish does.</li>
            <li>I loved these colors immediately, especially the reddish-pink and green!</li>
            <li>I was tired of buying good nail polish at the store for $6 a bottle, so I decided after reading reviews on these colors to order them.</li>
            <li>The lacquer is nice because it is thick and goes on well.</li>
            <li>Boy was I wrong, this is very nice, high quality nail polish.</li>
            <li>I rated this product a 3 star because the applicator brush isn&#x27;t the best quality - several bristles became stray and needed to be trimmed, some brushes had bristles that were longer on one end than the other which required trimming, and they didn&#x27;t help spread the polish as much as you&#x27;d expect - they were similar to the stiff bristles on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li>how well they last right now.</li>
            <li>It only took a little cleanup with some nail polish remover, so definitely still worth getting! :)</li>
            <li>it is my hobby to paint nails, and do nail design, so when I saw these new colors, I was stoked.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was a gift for her newly done bedroom.  </li>
            <li>It does take a long time to dry if you apply more than one coat.</li>
            <li>The purple and green are super pretty shimmers.</li>
            <li>It was completely opaque in ONE coat!  </li>
            <li>so not only is it torture for my nose and head for me to put it on, its not even worth it for the whole 3 hours of use i get before i have to take it off and reapply a different brand.</li>
            <li>, I found out the colors are thick, so with only one generous coat I was ready to go (I really liked that)</li>
            <li>they dry FAST!!</li>
            <li>no worse than pure ice dry time.</li>
            <li>but I only need to apply one coat and it will go on smooth and won&#x27;t dry clumpy</li>
            <li>I do my 4 and 7 year old daughters nails A LOT and within the day the paint will chip or (by no fault of any company) get chewed off.</li>
            <li>I bought these for my 8 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The only downside, and the reason for only 4 stars, was that I received a metallic green and a bright orange in lue of the pictured red and purple.</li>
            <li>I was surprised to find them grouped together.</li>
            <li>My 12 and 14 year old granddaughters wanted neon color nail polish for christmas.</li>
            <li>The colors are nice, but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li>smells very strongly of thinners like toluene... not pleasant to inhale at all.</li>
            <li>These colors are SO VIVID, with MAJOR coverage.</li>
            <li>The first time after about 45 minutes it still wasn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the packaging was shrink-wrapped, so the red polish did not lead out and get all over the other items in the shipping box, but there was a pungent polish smell even before I opened</li>
            <li>Pretty colors some reqire several coats to be opaque while others only require one coat.</li>
            <li>I was okay with that since other reviews warned that it was rather dark.</li>
            <li>I threw all of the bottles in the trash because the smell was so strong &amp; potent that it have me a headache and made me feel sick.</li>
            <li>The red top was kinda hard to twist off.</li>
            <li>and I wanted something that I hoped would dry fast.  </li>
            <li>I bought these a few weeks ago, they came quickly with no damage during shipping.</li>
            <li>and while the colors are pretty and vibrant (at least the only one ive used thus far is... metallic blue) and it dries reasonably fast..</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering another set for myself and younger daughter to share, since this set is leaving with my older daughter next week!</li>
            <li>The only bottle that was a problem for me was the pink, it leaked just a little from getting liquid on the top then as I opened it, falling around the rim.</li>
            <li>The glitter barely comes off the brush, and when I use a tool to move the glitter specks around, it eats through my bottom layer of polish.  </li>
            <li>Some people have complained of a strong smell but they smell like all regular polishes to me.</li>
            <li>, they take a few more minutes to dry than other brands tho.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color lasts so long even without a protective clear coat.  </li>
            <li>both did our nails first in the Metallic Green #163.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is that the color isnt as vibrant as i expected.</li>
            <li>I had a delayed shipping issue, but seriously it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li>BUT the light colors are hard to manage because i had to keep putting them on and they don&#x27;t dry quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it does seem to take a little longer to dry - worth the extra waiting time though.</li>

            <li> It is a nice set</li>

            <li> I find the consistency perfect, it applies with ease and only need one coat.</li>
            <li> but the bottle is still able to close</li>
            <li> okay...</li>
            <li> and I love this product.</li>
            <li> I will purchase from this seller again gladly.</li>

            <li> , I love it.</li>
            <li> I like it better than OPI or China Glaze or Orly...</li>
            <li> I will be buying in EVERY color :)</li>
            <li> : The handles tend to pop off the brush that screws into the top of the jar.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have to apply it more than once</li>
            <li> I love Kleancolor now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap nail polish and appears to get the  job done.</li>
            <li> shall be buying more Kleancolor polishes.</li>
            <li> I love the colors.</li>
            <li> I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Any ways, it was okay.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and the colors are definitely neon, which I LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love these  colors.  </li>
            <li> Kleancolor is one of my favorite nail polish brands.</li>
            <li> one has to read in a hurry when you can’t see well any more - like keys.</li>
            <li> I love these colors...</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, only takes one or two coats to get the job done!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and packing-</li>
            <li> my niece will love this</li>
            <li> I am so glad I made this purchase.</li>
            <li> so I am in love.</li>
            <li> I really love this nail polish...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ordered it...</li>
            <li> Maybe 3-4 days at the most.</li>
            <li> find something of better quality.</li>
            <li> and I love wearing them.</li>
            <li> most of my polishes do anyways.</li>
            <li> and you can almost guarantee most of it will be flaked off by the end.</li>
            <li> If you purchased these in a store you could very well expect to pay 7.00 to 10.00 dollars a bottle or more!!</li>
            <li> and when I got my package I was VERY excited.</li>
            <li> While I haven&#x27;t used them myself, she was very excited about them.</li>
            <li> Love the fact that I get so many bright polishes for such a good price.</li>
            <li> They are so bright an pretty.  </li>
            <li> This is pretty good nail polish.</li>
            <li> packaging was pretty good except for one thing,&lt;br /&gt;the</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m excited to be giving this as a gift!</li>
            <li> The colors seemed bold and nice.  </li>
            <li> Even without a top coat it doesn&#x27;t chip easily if you buff and prepare your nails before applying it.</li>
            <li> My daughter (who is easy to please) fell head over heals in love with all of the colors.  </li>
            <li> Kleancolor is a very good brand, but i  can get this product at my flea market for 1.00 a bottle , i would take a look at your local flea market.</li>
            <li> They are cheap but still pretty good quality.</li>
            <li> These colors are extremely bright, fun, bold, and</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> Other than that I am highly impressed with the quality of this nail polish.</li>
            <li> I love these colors they are so fun!</li>
            <li> other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> im in love &lt;3 and will not buy any other brand from now on!!</li>
            <li> because the polish chips a bit too easily in just a day or two.</li>
            <li> but once I saw the package with all the gorgeous colors, I went and bought them a different kind and kept these ones for myself.</li>
            <li> Has strong odor.</li>
            <li> I hope they stay available to keep up the fun! :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m super satisfied.</li>
            <li> A nice, large size, too...</li>
            <li> They are bright and look really cute on toes or short nails.</li>
            <li> People enJOY</li>
            <li> All in all, this set is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re such a great value.</li>
            <li> importantly, if you can&#x27;t read, you can always see color.  </li>
            <li> The package was wrapped well &amp; secure...</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Nice and thick almost like nail hardener and the colors are so beautiful</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get these</li>
            <li> The Kleancolor Neon Nail Laquer has a nice assortment of vivid colors that goes on evenly and smoothly</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if the packaging issue was Amazon&#x27;s or the original seller (I bought it Prime, and it was shipped to me from Amazon)</li>
            <li> The best part about these polishes is that they are dark enough with one swipe that you don&#x27;t need multiple coats &#x3D; a mother&#x27;s best friend.  </li>
            <li> Most lacquers I&#x27;ve used before require two or more coats for colors to become completely opaque but</li>
            <li> Luckily my favorite colors are orange and green, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect every customer to be happy with the mix up.</li>
            <li> The colors were bright and beautiful and carefully packaged individually.  </li>
            <li> These are just as bright and neon as the photo, so far the colors have held up very well, not chipping easily.</li>
            <li> I should&#x27;ve have known better for the right price and the right color..</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4/5 because I wish that the blue and purple were as bright and shiny as the rest of the colors.</li>
            <li> Bright colors that will last you awhile.</li>
            <li> These bright colors go on opaque with only 2 coats.</li>
            <li> The red almost looks like a bright Orange</li>
            <li> Although Kleancolor is not well known their nail lacquers recieved tons of good feed back so that along with the price made me order this product.</li>
            <li> I like the quality and colors of these polishes and they are pretty true to to color, and for the price I would like to own the whole collection.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell of this nail polish is pretty strong</li>
            <li> It also chips pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the end product looks great.</li>
            <li> The package shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> key features include affordability, great colour and also fairly fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want something super pricey</li>
            <li> /&gt;Kudos to Amazon for resolving the issue so quickly and with no hassle to me.  </li>
            <li> Even with high quality top coat.</li>
            <li> They may have a long drying time, but with a good quick drying topcoat it&#x27;s not a problem.</li>
            <li> Bought these nail polishes for my teenage sisters and she was absolutely thrilled by the rich colours of this product.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this product, except when I received it, the blue nail polish was cracked, and leaking.</li>
            <li> and I have a nice top polish that doesn&#x27;t chip with other nail polishes.</li>
            <li> Very pretty.</li>
            <li> very very stinky!</li>
            <li> it does not peel off easily and it goes on very smoothe.</li>
            <li> What you see is what you get; the color is vibrant even after it drys, adding a clear coat was the cherry on top : )</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering more Kleancolor Nail Lacquer sets!</li>
            <li> I love these nail polishes they are great for any occasion especially when in a rush they are a timely dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my nail lacquer on for about 2 days now (with a clear top coat)</li>
            <li> Worth the money</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the pink because it has some kind of glitter or something in it that makes it go on not so smooth.</li>
            <li> Each bottle came individually wrapped in its own paper.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I really love doing crazy stuff with my nails, so when I saw this set, it was just perfect for me</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but only for a day or so.</li>
            <li> I decided that it might be worth trying.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so ridiculously fun to wear.  </li>
            <li> Another product that is a lot of fun to use.  </li>
            <li> i figured if i use 3 coats of clear over coat it does better.</li>
            <li> The blue is significantly darker than the picture, and I was hoping that the reddish color would be more orange-y.</li>
            <li> They can chip kind of easily but for less than $2 a bottle, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Even though the price is just right...</li>
            <li> and once it is on and drys, it just peels right off.</li>
            <li> She loves the bright colors and these do seem to dry relatively fast.  </li>
            <li> they arrived quickly and were individually wrapped for safe shipping.  </li>
            <li> (lucky me i have no exhaust fans in my house and most of my windows are painted shut) or outside if weather permits.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very delayed, they came over a week after the expected time, the packaging was secure if not a bit excessive, overall very great colors and nice nail polish just do not order if you expect them quickly.</li>
            <li> This does not pose a spillage problem, as it is only the handle to the brush, it&#x27;s just something to be aware may need a quick dab of superglue :)</li>
            <li> so my nail polish usually chips pretty easily, but so far this stuff has worked out great.</li>
            <li> The top where the cap screws on was snapped right off, and there was red nail polish everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Kleancolor has good coverage in vivid colors, and is (for us) a long wearing nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so used to needing to apply 2-3 coats to get true, opaque, vibrant coverage, but ONE COAT did it with this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, my favorite color of the whole set, Neon Orange, had a frayed brush, but that is barely a problem!</li>
            <li> The colors are great in the bottle but dull on your nails.</li>
            <li> This was our first experiance with the Kleancolor brand</li>
            <li> The Kleancolor brand is the first I have found that will stay on their nails for 24 hours, chewing and all.</li>
            <li> Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors in this set!</li>
            <li> I got this nail polish for my friend and one for myself and the yellow is ok with the sign I would suggest you to get it</li>
            <li> But overall I LOVE THEM</li>
            <li> the colors are pretty</li>
            <li> my daughter loves all the pretty colors and the quality of the paint.</li>
            <li> These chip within the first day of using them--</li>
            <li> My favorite use is for my various strengths levels of reading glasses (computer screen reading verses sewing etc).  </li>
            <li> These were exactly the colors I was looking for.</li>
            <li> and you must have to put them on more than twice on nails to get the final color.</li>
            <li> the colors are so pretty, i would buy it again</li>
            <li> The colors are pretty, but they don&#x27;t stay on your nails.</li>
            <li> if that&#x27;s what you like to do ; )</li>
            <li> Colors are great, but the polish does not last very long.</li>
            <li> FAST shipment and VERY VERY well packaged.</li>
            <li> My niece on the other hand, is one of those pre-teen girls who has basically everything, was extremely happy with the lacquers and said the blue color that was included was \\&quot;perfect.\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The polish starts to peel or crack off pretty fast.</li>
            <li> But other then that they are great especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li> The colors are very vibrant and pigmented.</li>
            <li> The polish is ok, it takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product although I think that the smell is extra strong.</li>
            <li> A single coat with a transparent top coat and voila, all set.</li>
            <li> but I certainly will not get it again.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy the green mettallic - for sure!  </li>
            <li> Other than the green being more of a transparent/glittery polish-I love em!</li>
            <li> better than I expected..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used them for sponged on gradients and as water marbles, and they really pop.  </li>
            <li> What is in this where it stains so much like this?  </li>
            <li> There had been an issue with the order but the customer service representative was very helpful.  </li>
            <li> The reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I bought these for my daughter for Christmas and can&#x27;t really say how well they go on or</li>
            <li> Covers very well.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors except for the yellow one its a big transparent.</li>
            <li> They arrived nicely wrapped, but differently wrapped from order to order like they came from different locations?  </li>
            <li> We loved the colors, but takes way to long to dry</li>
            <li> Not exactly konad special polish result, but still very sharp and bright images.</li>
            <li> I could smell the polish before opening the package, way too strong and it lingers a long time without even opening the bottles.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was a gift for my daughter and niece who are totally into keeping their nails looking hip, fresh and funky!</li>
            <li> Not neon at all but still pretty colors and go on relatively thick which is nice</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually see this product since I had it sent directly to my 11 year old grand daughter in Kansas</li>
            <li> I decided I wanted a new color!</li>
            <li> Colors are as vibrant as they are in the bottle</li>
            <li> The colors are as vibrant as they appear on the site.  </li>
            <li> I really love the red, blue, and purple colors in this.</li>
            <li> The pink is like a neon pink which i loved</li>
            <li> loved the colors and they shipped fast and none were broken.</li>
            <li> Very bring and vivid.</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best nail polish i have ordered in such a long time.</li>
            <li> To me, the smell is not that strong though it does stink just like any other nail polish does.</li>
            <li> I loved these colors immediately, especially the reddish-pink and green!</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying good nail polish at the store for $6 a bottle, so I decided after reading reviews on these colors to order them.</li>
            <li> The lacquer is nice because it is thick and goes on well.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong, this is very nice, high quality nail polish.</li>
            <li> I rated this product a 3 star because the applicator brush isn&#x27;t the best quality - several bristles became stray and needed to be trimmed, some brushes had bristles that were longer on one end than the other which required trimming, and they didn&#x27;t help spread the polish as much as you&#x27;d expect - they were similar to the stiff bristles on a toothbrush.</li>
            <li> how well they last right now.</li>
            <li> It only took a little cleanup with some nail polish remover, so definitely still worth getting! :)</li>
            <li> it is my hobby to paint nails, and do nail design, so when I saw these new colors, I was stoked.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was a gift for her newly done bedroom.  </li>
            <li> It does take a long time to dry if you apply more than one coat.</li>
            <li> The purple and green are super pretty shimmers.</li>
            <li> It was completely opaque in ONE coat!  </li>
            <li> so not only is it torture for my nose and head for me to put it on, its not even worth it for the whole 3 hours of use i get before i have to take it off and reapply a different brand.</li>
            <li> , I found out the colors are thick, so with only one generous coat I was ready to go (I really liked that)</li>
            <li> they dry FAST!!</li>
            <li> no worse than pure ice dry time.</li>
            <li> but I only need to apply one coat and it will go on smooth and won&#x27;t dry clumpy</li>
            <li> I do my 4 and 7 year old daughters nails A LOT and within the day the paint will chip or (by no fault of any company) get chewed off.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 8 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The only downside, and the reason for only 4 stars, was that I received a metallic green and a bright orange in lue of the pictured red and purple.</li>
            <li> I was surprised to find them grouped together.</li>
            <li> My 12 and 14 year old granddaughters wanted neon color nail polish for christmas.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but the quality is poor.</li>
            <li> smells very strongly of thinners like toluene... not pleasant to inhale at all.</li>
            <li> These colors are SO VIVID, with MAJOR coverage.</li>
            <li> The first time after about 45 minutes it still wasn&#x27;t dry.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the packaging was shrink-wrapped, so the red polish did not lead out and get all over the other items in the shipping box, but there was a pungent polish smell even before I opened</li>
            <li> Pretty colors some reqire several coats to be opaque while others only require one coat.</li>
            <li> I was okay with that since other reviews warned that it was rather dark.</li>
            <li> I threw all of the bottles in the trash because the smell was so strong &amp; potent that it have me a headache and made me feel sick.</li>
            <li> The red top was kinda hard to twist off.</li>
            <li> and I wanted something that I hoped would dry fast.  </li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago, they came quickly with no damage during shipping.</li>
            <li> and while the colors are pretty and vibrant (at least the only one ive used thus far is... metallic blue) and it dries reasonably fast..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m ordering another set for myself and younger daughter to share, since this set is leaving with my older daughter next week!</li>
            <li> The only bottle that was a problem for me was the pink, it leaked just a little from getting liquid on the top then as I opened it, falling around the rim.</li>
            <li> The glitter barely comes off the brush, and when I use a tool to move the glitter specks around, it eats through my bottom layer of polish.  </li>
            <li> Some people have complained of a strong smell but they smell like all regular polishes to me.</li>
            <li> , they take a few more minutes to dry than other brands tho.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color lasts so long even without a protective clear coat.  </li>
            <li> both did our nails first in the Metallic Green #163.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is that the color isnt as vibrant as i expected.</li>
            <li> I had a delayed shipping issue, but seriously it was well worth the wait!</li>
            <li> BUT the light colors are hard to manage because i had to keep putting them on and they don&#x27;t dry quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it does seem to take a little longer to dry - worth the extra waiting time though.</li>
            <li> The paint last long on your nails.</li>
            <li> In the time it took for my nails to dry I could have rebuilt a motorcycle engine using only a plastic twist-tie.</li>
            <li> the Blue and Pink only required one coat.</li>
            <li> The pink, red, and blue colors are closer to neon than the others.</li>
            <li> I mainly use the colors to touch up painted surfaces around the house such as the chipped places on my blue bicycle &amp; the black chips on my black coffee table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and if you don&#x27;t wait for dry time it gets VERY clumpy not a very likable product!</li>
            <li> The red an pink kinda look a like when put on nail.</li>
            <li> I put a big blue dot (where it won&#x27;t show while wearing)  for my 1.00 glasses, a green dot for my 1.25 glasses, and a red dot for my 1.75 glasses.</li>
            <li> The only color I was disappointed with was the yellow, which had to be layered on a few times to get a good shade.</li>
            <li> However they take too long to dry.</li>
            <li> barely stays on for half a day.</li>
            <li> Takes long time to dry..</li>
            <li> I like the flat wide brush &amp; thickness of the polish.</li>
            <li> and i wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about it, but it takes some time to dry, but i found out that if you wait around 2 minutes then dip your nails in ice water, it drys around 5x faster.</li>
            <li> but the colors i got were pink, red, lime green, dirty yellow, light blue, and a dark navy blue.</li>
            <li> Polish applies too thick to dry as fast as other brands (OPI, Sally, China Glaze, etc.)</li>
            <li> it goes on dark enough but wash dishes once</li>
            <li> The colors were pretty but don&#x27;t appreciate that i recieved a broken product.</li>
            <li> nail color lasted for two weeks before having to touch up.. only complaint would have to be the sapphire blue. .</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no chipping.</li>
            <li> Another bottle, the pink, was chipped.</li>
            <li> This set is not really a neon nail lacquer set.</li>
            <li> But the yellow and green colors are not at all neon.</li>
            <li> pink nail polish had leaked out a bit and made a mess.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li> They were wrapped carefully so they wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> not only can I not return this set, but I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> It smells similar to a dead animal dipped in banana pudding.</li>
            <li> I live in Hawaii where its difficult to ship things that are fragile, but all the bottle were in tact</li>
            <li> Other than that, i&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave it 3 stars rather than 5 is due to the colors.</li>
            <li> Along with some of the other reviews, the colors just seem off.</li>
            <li> hopefully the company does something to remedy the smell, other than that</li>
            <li> One dry, it wastes no time chipping off of your fingers, so don&#x27;t wave your hands in the air like you don&#x27;t care</li>
            <li> for.&lt;br /&gt;I can find something wrong with this if I want to, but really, there&#x27;s no</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m surprised nothing was broken.</li>
            <li> but it looks really dark in the bottle, almost black.</li>
            <li> It appears in the picture almost lime green, but came more of a neon green. :(</li>
            <li> The colors of the polish are not exactly like the picture and the polish is thick, which takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li> it seems as though the bottom half of the cover broke off.</li>
            <li> The Orange, Yellow, and Green required at least two coats to become opaque.</li>
            <li> I recommend Sally Hansen Insta-Dri anti-chip topcoat, cuts drying time almost in half.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little dark, but thats all.</li>
            <li> When you decide to take it off the nail polish its not a clean removal..</li>
            <li> but once they are on they looked watered down and the yellow nail polish was broken and over the rest of the nail polish</li>
            <li> Maybe just for little kids playing.</li>
            <li> I usually have to pain my nails every other day</li>
            <li> I myself, am very hard on my nails and have the same problem, but it stays put on me as well!</li>
            <li> The green is way off.</li>
            <li> I was not required to return the item, so I threw out the broken bottle and cleaned up the others, and my daughter used some of the polish last night.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this brand.</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving a bad review is due to upon receiving the package the yellow polish was broke and when i stuck my hand in to grab the polishes my hang got covered in the yellow polish and stayed like that all day.</li>
            <li> Chipped in less than 24 hours after taking a shower!</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most dreadful nail polish in existence.</li>
            <li> That stuff stained our nails pretty bad.  </li>
            <li> A icky yellow, almost like we were heavy smokers for years or something worse.  </li>
            <li> Very thick and goopy  don&#x27;t dry well at all</li>
            <li> i only needed two thin coats!</li>
            <li> : after trying a few kleancolor colors, this stuff sucks.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed with that shade because I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it, but I just use it on my daughter&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> , I have to say, I was really surprised when I got the package, each nail polish was wrapped in a way it was practically impossible for them to break, once I opened and tried them ALL</li>
            <li> I think if I ever want to use this again, I&#x27;ll go sniff a rotting chicken carcass and color my nails with a Sharpie (which will provide longer lasting color).</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are on the thick side</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really thick</li>
            <li> but it does get thick..  </li>
            <li> Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> I was nervous at first because I read some reviews that the bottles leaked and that the product smelled very bad.</li>
            <li> I have seen other reviews that said they smelled bad, but that is NOT true!!</li>
            <li> I was a bit disappointed that they did not come boxed but individually wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> The lacquer is very thick, viscous and would probably cover your nails well also ...</li>
            <li> despite the poor packaging, I like the colors.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time, but one of the bottles inside the package was broken.  </li>
            <li> I stil find it a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who is currently obsessed with painting her nails.  </li>
            <li> They smell awful and are really hard to remove.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try them out before giving them to her just in case they were bad.</li>
            <li> It chips bad.</li>
            <li> So it couldn&#x27;t have been a bad bottle.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, I am giving these a bad review, just because there was no warning on these.  </li>
            <li> I seen that some reviews mention about the smell, but mine doesn&#x27;t smell bad...</li>
            <li> I applied the lacquer in my dorm room and after a couple of minutes felt sick from the smell</li>
            <li> I am afraid to put this stuff on our nails again!  </li>
            <li> And the smell is horrible!  </li>
            <li> Horrible polish.</li>
            <li> I am appalled!!!  </li>
            <li> But this brand of nail polish smells HORRIBLE..</li>
            <li> these colors are awful and of terrible quality.</li>
            <li> This nail polish is horrible.</li>
            <li> so I use all brands of nail polish and this one was horrible.</li>
            <li> the smell is so so so very bad!</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> These nail polishes are on the thick side but I only need to apply one coat and it will go on smooth and won&#x27;t dry clumpy like I thought it would! I love these nail polishes they are great for any occasion especially when in a rush they are a timely dry.</li>
            <li> loved the colors and they shipped fast and none were broken. I gave it a 4/5 because I wish that the blue and purple were as bright and shiny as the rest of the colors.</li>
            <li> I guess the polish is good- don&#x27;t know because I gave it as a gift.  The colors seemed bold and nice.  I was a bit disappointed that they did not come boxed but individually wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Ripping of people you can get this nail polish at the swap meet for $1 each I bought this probably like a month ago and went to the swap meet and found them I felt like they ripped me off! You can find this nail polish at any swapmeet!</li>
            <li> I ordered these polishes from pandora collection and I&#x27;m super satisfied. The polishes arrived in a perfect condition from this seller all the way to Norway. The set came in one of the best packaging I&#x27;ve ever seen. Love the fact that I get so many bright polishes for such a good price. They may have a long drying time, but with a good quick drying topcoat it&#x27;s not a problem. This is by far one of the best polishes I&#x27;ve used. I find the consistency perfect, it applies with ease and only need one coat. I&#x27;ve tried them for stamping as well. Not exactly konad special polish result, but still very sharp and bright images.</li>
            <li> I got this gift for my daughters and they absolutely love it!! But, they said when you put the purple it&#x27;s a little dark, but thats all. Other than that, it&#x27;s great!!</li>
            <li> Packaging Problems&lt;br /&gt;I did TONS of research before I actually purchased this product. Although Kleancolor is not well known their nail lacquers recieved tons of good feed back so that along with the price made me order this product. Shipping went well and when I got my package I was VERY excited. Everything was intact except the Purple nail lacquer...it seems as though the bottom half of the cover broke off. Because I couldn&#x27;t find the piece that broke off in the box or bubble wrap I figured that the seller must have dropped the bottle and the bottom of the cover fell off and they still shipped it, even though it was damaged. I wasn&#x27;t too happy about that but the bottle is still able to close so I guess its okay...that what prevented me from giving this product 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this nail polish is pretty strong so I suggest opening a window. I applied the lacquer in my dorm room and after a couple of minutes felt sick from the smell so you should definitely open a window or vent or something. Most lacquers I&#x27;ve used before require two or more coats for colors to become completely opaque but the Blue and Pink only required one coat. The Orange, Yellow, and Green required at least two coats to become opaque. I haven&#x27;t tried out the purple yet but it looks really dark in the bottle, almost black. I was okay with that since other reviews warned that it was rather dark. I&#x27;ve had my nail lacquer on for about 2 days now (with a clear top coat) and I have absolutely no chipping. Colors are as vibrant as they are in the bottle and I love this product. I will definitely be ordering more Kleancolor Nail Lacquer sets!</li>
            <li> These are beautiful colors, awesome and heavy glass bottles, well made. I am very very happy with these polishes. If you purchased these in a store you could very well expect to pay 7.00 to 10.00 dollars a bottle or more!! FAST shipment and VERY VERY well packaged. I will purchase from this seller again gladly.</li>
            <li> I ordered these as a Christmas present...they arrived quickly and were individually wrapped for safe shipping.  The colors are as vibrant as they appear on the site.  A nice, large size, too... I&#x27;m excited to be giving this as a gift!</li>
            <li> Lovely colors.. vibrate colors..</li>
            <li> I get compliments ALL the time on my toes :) People enJOY the colors and it&#x27;s really easy to put on (for me, that&#x27;s saying something!).  I hope they stay available to keep up the fun! :)</li>
            <li> Not neon at all but still pretty colors and go on relatively thick which is nice</li>
            <li> The package shipped quickly.  The colors were bright and beautiful and carefully packaged individually.  I haven&#x27;t used them yet as they are a Christmas gift for my pre teen daughter. I know though she is going to love them. I bought 2 sets as I know my middle daughter would swipe them from her sister.</li>
            <li> I bought these a few weeks ago, they came quickly with no damage during shipping. The colors are WONDERFUL and very bright! This was our first experiance with the Kleancolor brand and I have to admit, I love it. I like it better than OPI or China Glaze or Orly... Here is why... I do my 4 and 7 year old daughters nails A LOT and within the day the paint will chip or (by no fault of any company) get chewed off. The Kleancolor brand is the first I have found that will stay on their nails for 24 hours, chewing and all. I myself, am very hard on my nails and have the same problem, but it stays put on me as well! I didn&#x27;t have to re paint my toes when I finally did it... I decided I wanted a new color! This is the nail polish I have been waiting for! Kleancolor has good coverage in vivid colors, and is (for us) a long wearing nail polish. I will be buying in EVERY color :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Note: The handles tend to pop off the brush that screws into the top of the jar. This does not pose a spillage problem, as it is only the handle to the brush, it&#x27;s just something to be aware may need a quick dab of superglue :)</li>
            <li> Bought these nail polishes for my teenage sisters and she was absolutely thrilled by the rich colours of this product. key features include affordability, great colour and also fairly fast shipping.</li>
            <li> So! All of these colors are PERFECT, they are very bright. The purple and green are super pretty shimmers. The shipping was great. I live in Hawaii where its difficult to ship things that are fragile, but all the bottle were in tact Sadly, my favorite color of the whole set, Neon Orange, had a frayed brush, but that is barely a problem! All in all, this set is great, especially for the price!</li>
            <li> These nail polishes are very bright, beautiful colors. I was very pleased with this product, except when I received it, the blue nail polish was cracked, and leaking. Another bottle, the pink, was chipped. They didn&#x27;t pack the product properly, and they got banged around. Other than that, i&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Very cool, bright nail polish set. Bright colors that will last you awhile. Worth the money and i recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was tired of buying good nail polish at the store for $6 a bottle, so I decided after reading reviews on these colors to order them. I wear it every day and absolutely love it! It has great coverage and I don&#x27;t have to apply it more than once which is a big bonus. Even without a top coat it doesn&#x27;t chip easily if you buff and prepare your nails before applying it. I do a lot of cleaning so my nail polish usually chips pretty easily, but so far this stuff has worked out great. Will definitely be buying more.</li>
            <li> This set is not really a neon nail lacquer set. The pink, red, and blue colors are closer to neon than the others. But the yellow and green colors are not at all neon. The lacquer is nice because it is thick and goes on well. But the colors just don&#x27;t match up to the advertising. I do like the colors but I wanted neon colors and this just doesn&#x27;t work for my needs. They should call this set something else so as not to mislead people.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used all the colors yet but the ones I have are great and bright.</li>
            <li> it is my hobby to paint nails, and do nail design, so when I saw these new colors, I was stoked.&lt;br /&gt;when i received the package, I could instantly smell the nail polish, yes it was leaking....&lt;br /&gt;but despite the poor packaging, I like the colors. BUT the light colors are hard to manage because i had to keep putting them on and they don&#x27;t dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you get what you are paying for.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my 8 year old granddaughter for Christmas.  While I haven&#x27;t used them myself, she was very excited about them.</li>
            <li> Really nice, bright colors in medium-sized bottles. Coat well, shiny. A single coat with a transparent top coat and voila, all set. Buy without hesitation!</li>
            <li> This nail polish was above and beyond what I expected as far as color goes. It does take a long time to dry if you apply more than one coat. It also chips pretty easily. It was a good buy for the price, though.</li>
            <li> I really love the red, blue, and purple colors in this. They are bright and look really cute on toes or short nails. I haven&#x27;t used the green or yellow, since those aren&#x27;t really in my taste, but I can see myself using them at some point. I don&#x27;t like the pink because it has some kind of glitter or something in it that makes it go on not so smooth. Almost feels sand-papery once it dries. I was disappointed with that shade because I wasn&#x27;t really expecting it, but I just use it on my daughter&#x27;s nails.</li>
            <li> I really like the colors in this set! Other than the green being more of a transparent/glittery polish-I love em!</li>
            <li> the colors are absolutely amazing and i wouldn&#x27;t change a thing about it, but it takes some time to dry, but i found out that if you wait around 2 minutes then dip your nails in ice water, it drys around 5x faster.</li>
            <li> We loved the colors, but takes way to long to dry and if you don&#x27;t wait for dry time it gets VERY clumpy not a very likable product!</li>
            <li> I like the quality and colors of these polishes and they are pretty true to to color, and for the price I would like to own the whole collection. I will be ordering from amazon again!</li>
            <li> I love Kleancolor now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheap nail polish and appears to get the  job done. Each bottle came individually wrapped in its own paper.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are indeed bright, and I can&#x27;t complain because that&#x27;s what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;I can find something wrong with this if I want to, but really, there&#x27;s no point.&lt;br /&gt;I shall be buying more Kleancolor polishes.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t actually see this product since I had it sent directly to my 11 year old grand daughter in Kansas but she wrote \\&quot;Thank you for the nail polish too!  It&#x27;s so cool!\\&quot;  As long as she was happy, I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I loved these colors immediately, especially the reddish-pink and green! However they take too long to dry. Polish applies too thick to dry as fast as other brands (OPI, Sally, China Glaze, etc.) I recommend Sally Hansen Insta-Dri anti-chip topcoat, cuts drying time almost in half. I rated this product a 3 star because the applicator brush isn&#x27;t the best quality - several bristles became stray and needed to be trimmed, some brushes had bristles that were longer on one end than the other which required trimming, and they didn&#x27;t help spread the polish as much as you&#x27;d expect - they were similar to the stiff bristles on a toothbrush. Other than that, the end product looks great.</li>
            <li> I love the colors. They smell awful and are really hard to remove. It&#x27;s really thick so a thinner makes it a lot easier to apply.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors except for the yellow one its a big transparent. The pink is like a neon pink which i loved</li>
            <li> The reason I am giving a bad review is due to upon receiving the package the yellow polish was broke and when i stuck my hand in to grab the polishes my hang got covered in the yellow polish and stayed like that all day. The colors were pretty but don&#x27;t appreciate that i recieved a broken product.</li>
            <li> This nail polish was a gift for my daughter and niece who are totally into keeping their nails looking hip, fresh and funky! My daughter (who is easy to please) fell head over heals in love with all of the colors.  My niece on the other hand, is one of those pre-teen girls who has basically everything, was extremely happy with the lacquers and said the blue color that was included was \\&quot;perfect.\\&quot;  The items were delivered in enough time for Christmas.  One suggetion, is to add/or make a neon orange availble. I am totally satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Even though the price is just right... I stil find it a bit expensive. Any ways, it was okay. I should&#x27;ve have known better for the right price and the right color..</li>
            <li> This is pretty good nail polish. It lasts and doesnt chip.The only thing is that the color isnt as vibrant as i expected.</li>
            <li> I got this nail polish for my friend and one for myself and the yellow is ok with the sign I would suggest you to get it but I certainly will not get it again.</li>
            <li> They were packaged well and arrived very quickly, which was great.    The reason I gave it 3 stars rather than 5 is due to the colors. The blue is significantly darker than the picture, and I was hoping that the reddish color would be more orange-y. It&#x27;s just a straight-up red. Good, long-lasting polishes though. But if the product says \\&quot;neon\\&quot;, it makes sense that what you receive should be neon.</li>
            <li> I Recieved my polishes today and I am very excited to try them with my crackle nail polish that should hopefully, be arriving tomorrow! Thank you! Very great protective packaging everything was in perfect condition. The colors are very vibrant and pigmented. I Will definantly be buying from the seller again!</li>
            <li> Along with some of the other reviews, the colors just seem off. The blue is darker. The yellow looks like mustard. The purple is lighter. The green is way off. It appears in the picture almost lime green, but came more of a neon green. :( I also wish that they would list the number and color of each polish so you know when you get them, it&#x27;s the same thing that you ordered.</li>
            <li> I really love doing crazy stuff with my nails, so when I saw this set, it was just perfect for me, I have to say, I was really surprised when I got the package, each nail polish was wrapped in a way it was practically impossible for them to break, once I opened and tried them ALL, I found out the colors are thick, so with only one generous coat I was ready to go (I really liked that), they take a few more minutes to dry than other brands tho.&lt;br /&gt;Overall they&#x27;re good, and for that price I could&#x27;ve not asked for more.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter, who is currently obsessed with painting her nails.  She is 4, so I didn&#x27;t want something super pricey and I wanted something that I hoped would dry fast.  She loves the bright colors and these do seem to dry relatively fast.  The best part about these polishes is that they are dark enough with one swipe that you don&#x27;t need multiple coats &#x3D; a mother&#x27;s best friend.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase and the colors are definitely neon, which I LOVE. The only reason my rating is lacking one star is because I put them on acrylic nails and the color bled a tiny bit as they were drying. It only took a little cleanup with some nail polish remover, so definitely still worth getting! :)</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of glitter, called Decades of Bond.  The glitter barely comes off the brush, and when I use a tool to move the glitter specks around, it eats through my bottom layer of polish.  This is my second try with this stuff too.  The first time after about 45 minutes it still wasn&#x27;t dry.  I bumped a nail and all of the polish came off where it was bumped at.  And the smell is horrible!  Never, ever again with this brand.</li>
            <li> I have tried all 6 colors and love them all! If you are looking for bright colors with a good price try these polishes.</li>
            <li> These colors are extremely bright, fun, bold, and beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was pretty good except for one thing,&lt;br /&gt;the pink nail polish had leaked out a bit and made a mess.&lt;br /&gt;But that didn&#x27;t stop me from loving this set!&lt;br /&gt;...but it did stop me for, giving 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I love these  colors.  They are so bright an pretty.  But now you get what you paid for. There is some defaults. The red an pink kinda look a like when put on nail. The red top was kinda hard to twist off. But overall I LOVE THEM ♡♥ I cant wait till my nail art dotting kit comes in.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very delayed, they came over a week after the expected time, the packaging was secure if not a bit excessive, overall very great colors and nice nail polish just do not order if you expect them quickly.</li>
            <li> bought this for my niece the colors are pretty but once they are on they looked watered down and the yellow nail polish was broken and over the rest of the nail polish</li>
            <li> Kleancolor is one of my favorite nail polish brands. They are cheap but still pretty good quality. They can chip kind of easily but for less than $2 a bottle, I can&#x27;t complain. These bright colors go on opaque with only 2 coats. Some people have complained of a strong smell but they smell like all regular polishes to me.</li>
            <li> All colors are very bold and bright.. better than I expected.. nail color lasted for two weeks before having to touch up.. only complaint would have to be the sapphire blue. . When you decide to take it off the nail polish its not a clean removal.. the polish remover rubs the  color all over your fingers... so it takes more&lt;br /&gt;than one or two attempts to remove that color</li>
            <li> my daughter loves all the pretty colors and the quality of the paint. it does not peel off easily and it goes on very smoothe. thank you</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, but only for a day or so. The polish starts to peel or crack off pretty fast. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this brand.</li>
            <li> good color collection,  price was great and arrived in timely fashion....No complaints</li>
            <li> These chip within the first day of using them-- and I have a nice top polish that doesn&#x27;t chip with other nail polishes. Don&#x27;t do it!</li>
            <li> My daughter received this as a gift, and immediately painted her nails blue.  The COVERAGE with this polish is LITERALLY unlike any polish I&#x27;ve ever seen.  It was completely opaque in ONE coat!  I&#x27;m so used to needing to apply 2-3 coats to get true, opaque, vibrant coverage, but ONE COAT did it with this stuff.  I&#x27;m ordering another set for myself and younger daughter to share, since this set is leaving with my older daughter next week!</li>
            <li> These colors are just awesome. I am 16 and I bought them cause I like having colorfull nailpolish as accessories with my looks. And I have to say that they are just perfect! I would recomend that for everybody who loves bright and colorfull nailpolish.</li>
            <li> After researching Kleancolor on YouTube and Google I decided that it might be worth trying. I had never heard of the brand, but am happy I tried it out. The product is great (VERY BRIGHT as promised) and covers well. The only downside, and the reason for only 4 stars, was that I received a metallic green and a bright orange in lue of the pictured red and purple. Luckily my favorite colors are orange and green, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect every customer to be happy with the mix up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with these.  They&#x27;re so ridiculously fun to wear.  I&#x27;ve used them for sponged on gradients and as water marbles, and they really pop.  They&#x27;re such a great value.</li>
            <li> I like the flat wide brush &amp; thickness of the polish. I mainly use the colors to touch up painted surfaces around the house such as the chipped places on my blue bicycle &amp; the black chips on my black coffee table.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, if you can&#x27;t read, you can always see color.  My favorite use is for my various strengths levels of reading glasses (computer screen reading verses sewing etc).  Without the glasses, I can&#x27;t read the strengths.  I put a big blue dot (where it won&#x27;t show while wearing)  for my 1.00 glasses, a green dot for my 1.25 glasses, and a red dot for my 1.75 glasses. This also works in the shower for similar looking bottles of conditioner verses shampoo or anything else one has to read in a hurry when you can’t see well any more - like keys.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get these but the colors i got were pink, red, lime green, dirty yellow, light blue, and a dark navy blue. They work well but they should give a propper discription.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my younger sister but I decided to try them out before giving them to her just in case they were bad. The only color I was disappointed with was the yellow, which had to be layered on a few times to get a good shade. I was nervous at first because I read some reviews that the bottles leaked and that the product smelled very bad. To me, the smell is not that strong though it does stink just like any other nail polish does. The only bottle that was a problem for me was the pink, it leaked just a little from getting liquid on the top then as I opened it, falling around the rim. Other than that I am highly impressed with the quality of this nail polish.</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors. Great price for the set!!!</li>
            <li> Horrible polish. Chipped in less than 24 hours after taking a shower! I do not recommend it. Maybe just for little kids playing.</li>
            <li> I had a delayed shipping issue, but seriously it was well worth the wait! i got the neon 6 pack and the colors are bright and absolutly amazing! even the yellow i only needed two thin coats! im in love &lt;3 and will not buy any other brand from now on!!</li>
            <li> The color is very bright and stays very nicely. I haven&#x27;t seen any chipping but I only used two coats. I enjoy the colors and think this is a great product to give as a gift or stocking stuffers!</li>
            <li> I love these colors...I only need one coat...would have given 5 stars but it does get thick..  and I had to keep shaking</li>
            <li> Pretty colors some reqire several coats to be opaque while others only require one coat. It is a nice set</li>
            <li> These are just as bright and neon as the photo, so far the colors have held up very well, not chipping easily. Beautiful bright colors.</li>
            <li> Excellent coverage, only takes one or two coats to get the job done! Great bright colors! I am keeping my eyes out for another deal on another set of colors!</li>
            <li> I could smell the polish before opening the package, way too strong and it lingers a long time without even opening the bottles. My bottles arrived intact but they weren&#x27;t packaged well, I&#x27;m surprised nothing was broken. The polish is ok, it takes a while to dry.</li>
            <li> The colors are gorgeous. Very pretty. Very bring and vivid. Downfall? It chips bad. Had it on for one day. But I work with my hand at work so it may differ for you.</li>
            <li> Nice and thick almost like nail hardener and the colors are so beautiful</li>
            <li> This is seriously the best nail polish i have ordered in such a long time. The color lasts so long even without a protective clear coat.  I bought this originally as a present for someone else but once I saw the package with all the gorgeous colors, I went and bought them a different kind and kept these ones for myself.</li>
            <li> The Kleancolor Neon Nail Laquer has a nice assortment of vivid colors that goes on evenly and smoothly but it does seem to take a little longer to dry - worth the extra waiting time though.</li>
            <li> Ordered two nail polish sets on August 9th, still have not received it.  E-mailed the company and I got no response.</li>
            <li> Wanted to purchase inexpensive brightly colored nail polish for my niece for Christmas gift.  She loved it.  Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Love the colors and packing- great job- will be using them for gifts since they arrived after i need them</li>
            <li> I love these colors they are so fun! The paint last long on your nails. Defiantly a good buy! They lasted me about a year before they expired in quality.</li>
            <li> my niece will love this</li>
            <li> I bought my daughter alot of these polishes.  It was a gift for her newly done bedroom.  They arrived nicely wrapped, but differently wrapped from order to order like they came from different locations?  Not sure.&lt;br /&gt;We both did our nails first in the Metallic Green #163.  2 days later we took it off to try another color.  Both us ended up with yellow nails once the polish was removed.  It was gross.  A icky yellow, almost like we were heavy smokers for years or something worse.  I am afraid to put this stuff on our nails again!  What is in this where it stains so much like this?  I am appalled!!!  I wouldn&#x27;t buy the green mettallic - for sure!  That stuff stained our nails pretty bad.  Oh - and we both used different bottles because I accidently ordered 2 of the metallics so I kept a set for myself.  She painted with her bottle and I did mine with a different bottle.  So it couldn&#x27;t have been a bad bottle.  That would be too odd.&lt;br /&gt;What is in this polish where it would do this?  Will we have to literally grow our nails out to get the color to go away?  I would never go without polish - its so gross looking now, I would have to cover it up with a color to block the yellow stain.  Oh its gross!!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I am giving these a bad review, just because there was no warning on these.  its rediculous!!!  I am thinking of reporting to Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this thinking &amp;#34; Okay it&#x27;s probably going to be some cheap polish kus of the great price for all of them&amp;#34;. Boy was I wrong, this is very nice, high quality nail polish. I love the bright colors. What you see is what you get; the color is vibrant even after it drys, adding a clear coat was the cherry on top : )</li>
            <li> Awesome my daughter loves it</li>
            <li> Another product that is a lot of fun to use.  The colors are very bright.  You do, however, have to use about 3 coats to get the colors fully effective.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time, but one of the bottles inside the package was broken.  The top where the cap screws on was snapped right off, and there was red nail polish everywhere.  Fortunately the packaging was shrink-wrapped, so the red polish did not lead out and get all over the other items in the shipping box, but there was a pungent polish smell even before I opened the Amazon packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon and they promptly refunded my money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if the packaging issue was Amazon&#x27;s or the original seller (I bought it Prime, and it was shipped to me from Amazon) but I notice another review with a damaged bottle, so it looks like this situation isn&#x27;t unique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos to Amazon for resolving the issue so quickly and with no hassle to me.  I was not required to return the item, so I threw out the broken bottle and cleaned up the others, and my daughter used some of the polish last night.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor is a very good brand, but i  can get this product at my flea market for 1.00 a bottle , i would take a look at your local flea market.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I made this purchase. great price, amazing neon colors, and the polish stays on for about 5-7 days with two coats. I usually have to pain my nails every other day so I am in love. I will be also ordering the metallic now!</li>
            <li> I put in my order on October 1st &amp; I received my order October 9th... The package was wrapped well &amp; secure... I really love this nail polish...I seen that some reviews mention about the smell, but mine doesn&#x27;t smell bad... The colors are so cute/beautiful.. I think I&#x27;m a fan of Kleancolor polish now... I&#x27;m glad I ordered it... I&#x27;ll add some pictures...</li>
            <li> Great item and it was great doing business with you.</li>
            <li> These colors are SO VIVID, with MAJOR coverage. One coat and your nails look like the bottle color! Shiny.and they dry FAST!! Very low odor! I have seen other reviews that said they smelled bad, but that is NOT true!!</li>
            <li> They are very colorful and they were a good price. Made a good Christmas gift. They were wrapped carefully so they wouldn&#x27;t break.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves this product although I think that the smell is extra strong. I have her do her nails outside now and that helps!</li>
            <li> These were exactly the colors I was looking for. I was surprised to find them grouped together. I like shiny nail polish!</li>
            <li> colors are nor desirable as it shown in the picture and you must have to put them on more than twice on nails to get the final color.</li>
            <li> Colors are great, but the polish does not last very long. Maybe 3-4 days at the most.</li>
            <li> The colors of the polish are not exactly like the picture and the polish is thick, which takes longer to dry.</li>
            <li> I recently ordered these as a gift for my daughter and she loves them.  The quality of the product is very good.  There had been an issue with the order but the customer service representative was very helpful.  She understood and resolved the problem.  Thank You!</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful &amp; the shipping was quick.. But this brand of nail polish smells HORRIBLE.. I threw all of the bottles in the trash because the smell was so strong &amp; potent that it have me a headache and made me feel sick.</li>
            <li> The colors of these nail polishes caught my eye while browsing online.  I am very pleased that they are just as bright and beautiful when they arrived at my home.  The reason I gave this product 4 stars is because I bought these for my daughter for Christmas and can&#x27;t really say how well they go on or how well they last right now. Can&#x27;t wait for her to try them and let me know what she thinks.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors stain your nails. But other then that they are great especially for the price!!!</li>
            <li> Got on a deal from ebay. I have about 20 some of these colors. I had never heard of kleancolor before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It chips within 24 hours for me. And yes like others have said, funky smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might resell these.</li>
            <li> I got this for my teenage niece and she loved it. No complaints. Good quality and value!</li>
            <li> love it! the colors are so pretty, i would buy it again</li>
            <li> The colors look great haven&#x27;t had a chance to use but well soon i k they well make my nails amazing</li>
            <li> if I could I would leave zero stars. not only can I not return this set, but I wasted my money. these colors are awful and of terrible quality. barely stays on for half a day. don&#x27;t waste your money. find something of better quality.</li>
            <li> I put on the nail polish and almost a week later it look as if i put it on yesterday! I really recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Very thick and goopy  don&#x27;t dry well at all</li>
            <li> the colors are really great and vibrant and packaging was great as well.  i gave it a 4 star though because the polish chips a bit too easily in just a day or two. i figured if i use 3 coats of clear over coat it does better. other than that, great product!</li>
            <li> Has strong odor. Chips within 2 days. Takes long time to dry.. Hates it .. Waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This nail polish is horrible. It is just like plastic and once it is on and drys, it just peels right off. The colors are pretty, but they don&#x27;t stay on your nails. I threw them away. I wouldn&#x27;t waste your money on this brand. I design nails so I use all brands of nail polish and this one was horrible.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the most dreadful nail polish in existence. It smells similar to a dead animal dipped in banana pudding. The colors are great in the bottle but dull on your nails. In the time it took for my nails to dry I could have rebuilt a motorcycle engine using only a plastic twist-tie. One dry, it wastes no time chipping off of your fingers, so don&#x27;t wave your hands in the air like you don&#x27;t care -- you&#x27;ll wave the polish off into some unsuspecting person&#x27;s eye probably causing lawsuit-provoking eyeball damage. I think if I ever want to use this again, I&#x27;ll go sniff a rotting chicken carcass and color my nails with a Sharpie (which will provide longer lasting color).</li>
            <li> My 12 and 14 year old granddaughters wanted neon color nail polish for christmas. They received them in their stockings They were so excited with the bright colors.</li>
            <li> These are really nice colors and I love wearing them. The red almost looks like a bright Orange and I love it! they are great.</li>
            <li> Goes on gloppy and chips just about immediately. Even with high quality top coat. The colors are nice, but the quality is poor. Doesnt qualify for a refund so your stuck looking at them til you decide to throw them out.</li>
            <li> Beeeerrriiiiiitttte. Very bright and colorful. Covers very well. I use them to mark my tools so I can tell a 5 mm from a 6 mm hex wrench at a glance.The lacquer is very thick, viscous and would probably cover your nails well also ... if that&#x27;s what you like to do ; )</li>
            <li> didnt order this set but i did order about 22 bottles on ebay (holo and metallic) and while the colors are pretty and vibrant (at least the only one ive used thus far is... metallic blue) and it dries reasonably fast.. no worse than pure ice dry time. the smell is so so so very bad! smells very strongly of thinners like toluene... not pleasant to inhale at all. so definitely want to be using this in a well ventilated room (lucky me i have no exhaust fans in my house and most of my windows are painted shut) or outside if weather permits. very very stinky! no idea what the chip resistance is like since i only just applied it but for the money i paid, i wont be too fussy if it starts chipping off the next day. most of my polishes do anyways. hopefully the company does something to remedy the smell, other than that though, i have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: after trying a few kleancolor colors, this stuff sucks. it goes on dark enough but wash dishes once and you can almost guarantee most of it will be flaked off by the end. so not only is it torture for my nose and head for me to put it on, its not even worth it for the whole 3 hours of use i get before i have to take it off and reapply a different brand.</li>
            <li> Great combination of colors.</li>
