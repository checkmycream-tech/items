            <li>So effective; so efficient.</li>
            <li>Since I start doing nails on my own again, I got this to make my life easier.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and non drying for your nails!</li>
            <li>I love this removes polish nicely doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as a lot of polish removers</li>
            <li>I love this polish/lacquer remover.  </li>
            <li>It removes most of the gel polish at once.  </li>
            <li>Work better that others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s works pretty good.</li>
            <li>I was not disappointed!</li>
            <li>My wife thinks it&#x27;s the best thing in the world other than me &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; ....</li>
            <li>:  It removes very quickly  Con:  </li>
            <li>This remover seems to work more quickly than the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; acetone removers I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>When using it to take off gel polish be sure to file the tops of the nails first before applying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m never disappointed with OPI.</li>
            <li>However the polish was pretty effective on gel, and I presume it would be fabulous on normal nail polish.</li>
            <li>Smells good and removes polish instantly.</li>
            <li>OPI takes it all off quickly without any leftovers.</li>
            <li>This polish remover does not have a strong smell and works fast.</li>
            <li>Not like the the other kind I used before...that one would leave red traces which meant I used more polish remover and more cotton pads!&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>This remover easily takes away old polish and doesn&#x27;t strip your nails and skin of all traces of moisture.</li>
            <li>It was my first time to do that, and I still have residue.</li>
            <li>I love my gel nails but trying to get rid of the polish can be a long wait.  </li>
            <li>Buy the large size here; much cheaper than in a beauty supply.</li>
            <li>It costs a little more than the drugstore brands, but is well worth it.  </li>
            <li>and it works much faster.  </li>
            <li>The good side of this product besides it&#x27;s easy to remove, it also moisturizes the skin to make it less harsh.  </li>
            <li>But in terms of how much is needed to effectively remove polish, very little.  </li>
            <li>It takes red nail polish right off!</li>
            <li>I give this remover 5 stars because I can take a full mani (base/color/top) off with only 2 cotton pads.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this for all your nail polish removing needs.</li>
            <li>Also I find my nails super dry after using this nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few different nail polish removers as of late and this is by far the very best.</li>
            <li>I was a little skeptical, but bought this based on the excellent reviews.</li>
            <li>I always try to go organic with my nail polish and removers, but have yet to find one that is even close to OPI&#x27;s professional level quality.  </li>
            <li>Yes, it costs a bit more but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>Requires very little so it tends to last longer than most polish removers.  </li>
            <li>And, despite soaking my nails for 10 minutes or more, it did not dry out or negatively affect my nails at all.</li>
            <li>Does job quick ,  Takes  off all color with little work.  </li>
            <li>Nail polish comes off quickly, no white film (that&#x27;s what other nail polish removers did to my nails at least) and fairly moisturizing.</li>
            <li>I found out within minutes that the pen completely peeled into a different color.  </li>
            <li>Keep the lid on tightly, though, as it tends to evaporate quickly if the lid is left off for too long.  </li>

            <li> Conventional nail polisher remover doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  </li>
            <li> I can use a little to clean all my nails, but the smell is really bad.</li>

            <li> Hands down!</li>
            <li> Other removers required using half a bag of cotton and still leave traces of color behind.</li>

            <li> It is hard to ignore.    </li>
            <li> Removes polish off with very little effort- even salon pedicure polish!  </li>
            <li> The downside of that is, it&#x27;s very hard to remove unless you leave it on for at least one week.  </li>

            <li> I wish I would have known about this remover a long time ago! It takes red nail polish right off! Not like the the other kind I used before...that one would leave red traces which meant I used more polish remover and more cotton pads!&lt;br /&gt;Will stick with this one from now on. Saves money and time!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical, but bought this based on the excellent reviews. I was not disappointed! This remover easily takes away old polish and doesn&#x27;t strip your nails and skin of all traces of moisture. You can actually remove your polish without feeling like you are killing your nails and skin in the process. Great product!</li>
            <li> I can use a little to clean all my nails, but the smell is really bad. Also I find my nails super dry after using this nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I thought all acetone based nail polishes were the same but was I wrong. Nail polish comes off quickly, no white film (that&#x27;s what other nail polish removers did to my nails at least) and fairly moisturizing. Will never buy drugstore remover again!</li>
            <li> This removes hardened gel nail polish, laquer, etc.  It is the best I have used.  Highly recommend this for all your nail polish removing needs.</li>
            <li> I bought this to remove gel polish. It was my first time to do that, and I still have residue. I won&#x27;t do gel nails again. However the polish was pretty effective on gel, and I presume it would be fabulous on normal nail polish. And, despite soaking my nails for 10 minutes or more, it did not dry out or negatively affect my nails at all. Recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it works ....My wife thinks it&#x27;s the best thing in the world other than me &amp;#34;B&amp;#34; ....</li>
            <li> IF you&#x27;re searching for a good product--this is the one for you.  It&#x27;s easy to use and non drying for your nails!</li>
            <li> I love my gel nails but trying to get rid of the polish can be a long wait.  This remover seems to work more quickly than the &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; acetone removers I&#x27;ve tried.  Yes, it costs a bit more but a little goes a long way and it works much faster.  This is my second bottle</li>
            <li> Works well at taking off polish. Does job quick ,  Takes  off all color with little work.  Would recommend to friends</li>
            <li> This polish remover does not have a strong smell and works fast. I use it to take off nail polish and gel polish. When using it to take off gel polish be sure to file the tops of the nails first before applying.</li>
            <li> This is miraculous, it even takes off the glitter polishes. It also moisturizes your skin as you use it. I swear it&#x27;s true!!! It&#x27;s like a magical elixir that I would give anything for lol! Nailaholics must have this.</li>
            <li> This is the best polish remover I have used.  It costs a little more than the drugstore brands, but is well worth it.  I can remove polish from both hands and only need 2 cotton balls, so it lasts a long time.  But the really great thing is that it removes glitter polish easier than others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Best nail polish remover on the market. Hands down!</li>
            <li> Does the job. Just took a long time to get it.</li>
            <li> I love this polish/lacquer remover.  It removes my regular nail polish in a snap.  Requires very little so it tends to last longer than most polish removers.  Keep the lid on tightly, though, as it tends to evaporate quickly if the lid is left off for too long.  But in terms of how much is needed to effectively remove polish, very little.  Even on the darker colored polishes!</li>
            <li> So effective; so efficient. The OPI nail cloths that go with it make it perfect. I don&#x27;t know if they are cotton or other fiber. But I can get practically three nails cleared with one cloth! This product does not stink and lasts a long time. Buy the large size here; much cheaper than in a beauty supply.</li>
            <li> Pro:  It removes very quickly  Con:  The smell    I love OPI nail polishers for beautiful colors and it&#x27;s durability on nails.  The downside of that is, it&#x27;s very hard to remove unless you leave it on for at least one week.  Conventional nail polisher remover doesn&#x27;t work well at all.  Since I start doing nails on my own again, I got this to make my life easier.    The con of this product, like what someone else said, is the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t stink.  It&#x27;s just a smell that bothers my brain so much that if I leave a wet cotton out every few minutes I&#x27;d be looking for it and think \\&quot;WHAT IS THAT SMELL\\&quot; and want to trash it away as soon as I can.  It is hard to ignore.    *Update*    I finally figured out what that smell is, it&#x27;s some type of an oil.  The good side of this product besides it&#x27;s easy to remove, it also moisturizes the skin to make it less harsh.  It&#x27;s softer than other over the counter products.    *Caution*  Definitely wash areas this remover touches.  I accidentally dropped a french manicure pen into it, and I took it out in less in 1 minute.  I did not wash the pen and just put it aside.  I found out within minutes that the pen completely peeled into a different color.  I have taken 1 star off for safety.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s works pretty good. I leave it on with a cotton ball and foil around each finger for 15 minutes.  It removes most of the gel polish at once.  Some polishes may need a little longer soak.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Work better that others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I love this removes polish nicely doesn&#x27;t smell as strong as a lot of polish removers great size bottle this should last awhile.the laquer remover works great removering the nail polish</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different nail polish removers as of late and this is by far the very best. Smells good and removes polish instantly. Even sparkly nail polish.</li>
            <li> OPI Expert Touch Lacquer Remover 16oz ... order this all the time great for polish remover</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m never disappointed with OPI. Removes polish off with very little effort- even salon pedicure polish!  I always try to go organic with my nail polish and removers, but have yet to find one that is even close to OPI&#x27;s professional level quality.  Maybe someday...</li>
            <li> The fastest polish remover ever!</li>
            <li> I give this remover 5 stars because I can take a full mani (base/color/top) off with only 2 cotton pads. Other removers required using half a bag of cotton and still leave traces of color behind. OPI takes it all off quickly without any leftovers. Great product!</li>
