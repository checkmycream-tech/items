    <ol>
            <li>This is a wonderful product and at a very great price, thank you for that.  </li>
            <li>Your price was the best.  </li>
            <li>This product is perfect and convenient to just step into the shower and refresh my tooties.  </li>
            <li>What a great idea though!</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li>i throw it away never worked very good</li>
            <li>Great price,</li>
            <li>Great product!!Thanks alot Phil</li>
            <li>A great idea</li>
            <li>The product is great -</li>
            <li>Guess I better buy another one though!!</li>
            <li>I was really impressed, as I am sure</li>
            <li>They all laughed.</li>
            <li>This was a good product except that the suction cups on the bottom won&#x27;t hold the item in place on the shower floor.  </li>
            <li>It tickles a bit, but in a good way.</li>
            <li>it all looks good</li>
            <li>but when you try to use it i could not get the thing to stick good to any thing</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>, I wound up dancing and chasing the Easy Feet around the shower, lol.  </li>
            <li>I kind of felt ripped off.</li>
            <li>If you want more bristles, look for the deluxe model.</li>
            <li>so you could not put your foot in it to clean good.</li>
            <li>Mine works fine, but more bristles would be nice.  </li>
            <li>Just in case you were wondering why some of the sellers are selling for so much more.</li>
            <li>I have ordered six of them to give as gifts, that will keep on giving I am sure.  </li>
            <li>I bought mine at Best Buy, not realizing that there was only ONE foot scrubber.</li>
            <li>It will be interesting to see how they hold up with routine usage.</li>
            <li>It would&#x27;ve been faster and more efficient to just use a brush with a handle.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s OK, however I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it online:</li>
            <li>What a rip off it needs more brushes on the top.</li>
            <li>It feels wonderful and makes my feet clean and soft.</li>
            <li>I bought the easy feet for christmas presents for my self and my grown children.</li>
            <li>(it arrived very quickly, by the way), and already I can tell a difference.</li>
            <li>I bought the \\&quot;EASY FEET\\&quot; scrubber for my husband, who can&#x27;t bend over to wash his feet.  </li>
            <li>I found if I stand with one foot on the easy foot, I can still scrub my foot standing up.  </li>
            <li>Why do they call it easy feet</li>
            <li>and if you do also you have to get used to using the Easy Feet.</li>
            <li>and it works fine.</li>
            <li>It is like giving your feet a massage and makes them feel so smooth and refreshed.  </li>
            <li>I enjoy using EasyFeet.  </li>
            <li>I always follow with petrolium jelly because it is cheap   then socks.  </li>
            <li>I think it would work on a smooth bath tub.</li>
            <li>The bristles fit well in between the toes</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a type 1 diabetic for 25 years and foot health is important.  </li>
            <li>this thing does: makes light cleaning easier without bending.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Suction cups are great, should they actually keep the thing in place.</li>
            <li>2nd, they sell a deluxe version which has more bristles (also available on Amazon).  </li>
            <li>Well I got the last laugh because my feet are in wonderful condition and have never been like this in my adult life.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the pumice stone broke in halves the very first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product is good, it doesnt stay suctioned to the floor of the tub very well, but I was ok with that since I had to switch places to do my other foot.</li>
            <li>The Easy Feet product works exactly as advertised and really does clean your feet well.</li>
            <li>Overall, the product works well and feels nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it for myself, but obviously have to continue washing HIS feet.....</li>
            <li>You dont go out and buy just one sock right?</li>
            <li>To remove callous and clean my feet really well.  </li>
            <li>It is made of very sturdy plastic and you must be careful inserting your foot or it will hit the top plastic support and it ain&#x27;t comfortable!</li>
            <li>but they are pretty flexible.</li>
            <li>I really appreciate this product for one reason and that reason is it is such a help when you aren&#x27;t able to wash your feet because of a disability.</li>
            <li>It was a great white elephant present last Christmas.</li>
            <li>so really don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like it</li>
            <li>but it slid around way too much.</li>
            <li>Placing it on tile or fiberglass didn&#x27;t make much difference either.</li>
            <li>The other issue is the top ring.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to bend over in order to use this one, and that the pumice stone is big enough to where you can also rub the soles of your feet without much effort.</li>
            <li>Well, with the same success you could just glue any large foot scrubber to your bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it warned that movement was normal.  </li>
            <li>I did not give it 5 stars ONLY because I have large feet</li>
            <li>The bristles weren&#x27;t long or thick enough, so my foot never got sudsy, therefore I had to keep applying more soap and it took longer to get them clean.  </li>
            <li>Not only have I returned it, but threatened legal action.  </li>
            <li>It does help clear under your feet a lot easier.</li>
            <li>The suction cups can come undone sometimes, but overall they are very helpful in keeping it in place.</li>
            <li>Just wish it would stay fixed to the floor.</li>
            <li>One note, I found the suction cups on the base really didn&#x27;t stick to the tub&#x27;s surface, so make sure you hold onto the hand rail in your shower when using Easy Foot so you don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li>If you get lucky, you can make a few moves without the thing sliding along with your moves.</li>
            <li>Using this thing you can barely touch the pumice stone.</li>
            <li>I have a hard time bending over due to arthritis, so I can&#x27;t use the pumice stones and files or whatever you see in most &#x27;home pedicure&#x27; kits.</li>
            <li>Top brush is useless - you barely touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Top brush is useless - you barely touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried to purchase these elsewhere and the price was a little too high, even the buy one get one free was too expensive.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Easy Feet was too cumbersome and ineffective that it did not live up to the hype.  </li>
            <li> I think the brushes scrape  off the dry skin and stimulates the skin.</li>
            <li> Funny, but frustrating.  </li>
            <li> This thing didn&#x27;t stick at all, and constantly moved around--had to use the other foot to hold it down while trying to use it.  </li>
            <li> After the second time I laid it down, unknowingly my son hung it up and that night it promptly fell and broke (the pumice stone popped out and cracked in half).  </li>
            <li> Not sure how well it will stand up to wear and tear, only time will tell.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice in the past two days</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Do not have to bend down anymore or chance slipping in the tub.</li>
            <li> I recommend this for anyone, but especially people who have a hard time using other tools.</li>
            <li> I even tried replacing the suction cups and it made a little difference, but not much.</li>
            <li> I am wondering if she put a   plastic placemat down they might grab.  </li>
            <li> if you screwed it down to something but in a tub or shower you cant do that</li>
            <li> So, I could have bought 2 from Sally Beauty Supply on Amazon for less money.  </li>
            <li> and I like to give my feet a little soak to wash off the day&#x27;s wear and tear.  </li>
            <li> I bought this item in hopes of finding a reliable tool for everyday foot care.  </li>
            <li> So if you are disabled this product is for you.</li>
            <li> What I missed under \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; in small print was \\&quot;Just Pay ADDITIONAL S&amp;H\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> you dont have one and realy want to know what im talking about just take a hair brush and drop it on slick floor and try to brush your feet your will see how it moves around.</li>
            <li> Pumice stone is useless, because you actually have to scrub your callous hard to make it softer.</li>
            <li> This makes it hard to use as it slides when you are trying to move your foot inside it.  </li>
            <li> Hard to bend knee, so this helps with that foot esp.    </li>
            <li> That said, once you learn not to cram your foot into the device too hard it is a pleasure to use.</li>
            <li> I mean, you do, but the effect is minimum.</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product so far.  </li>
            <li> when you poor body wash on it, it scrubs your foot like if it was a car in a carwash.  </li>
            <li> Get past the naysayers and you will like it believe me!!!</li>
            <li> so it is useless.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s almost impossible to use the scrub part.</li>
            <li> Sadly for me the worst defect was the fact that the darn thing would not stay put.  </li>
            <li> I was very unhappy.</li>
            <li> But, the truly annoying factor is that the day after I ordered from the TV web Site, I started getting those annoying telemarketer calls.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I just received my order.  2 things you should know.      1st, I ordered mine from the TV web address (not Amazon - Big MISTAKE). I got lured in because you get a second brush \\&quot;FREE\\&quot;.  What I missed under \\&quot;FREE\\&quot; in small print was \\&quot;Just Pay ADDITIONAL S&amp;H\\&quot;.  That&#x27;s another $7.99.  The total, with Tax, was $33.83 for the 2 from the TV site.  So, I could have bought 2 from Sally Beauty Supply on Amazon for less money.  But, the truly annoying factor is that the day after I ordered from the TV web Site, I started getting those annoying telemarketer calls.  So, if you want one of these, or even 2, order it from Amazon.    2nd, they sell a deluxe version which has more bristles (also available on Amazon).  Mine works fine, but more bristles would be nice.  Just in case you were wondering why some of the sellers are selling for so much more. You have several choices on Amazon for this product and $9.99 + $5.95 S&amp;H was the cheapest I found and should have gone with.  If you want more bristles, look for the deluxe model.</li>
            <li> I also ordered this off TV, it is the last time I will ever do that for any product, I had a phone call after my order asking for my address. I did not comply, being an online order, I didn&#x27;t understand the call.&lt;br /&gt;IT DOES NOT STICK TO TEXTURED SURFACES, as I have on my bathtub. Would not stick. It was a great white elephant present last Christmas.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product and at a very great price, thank you for that.  It is like giving your feet a massage and makes them feel so smooth and refreshed.  I have ordered six of them to give as gifts, that will keep on giving I am sure.  Really sturdy and heavy enough to stay in place.  I was really impressed, as I am sure the ones I give them to will be.  Thank you.  I have tried to purchase these elsewhere and the price was a little too high, even the buy one get one free was too expensive.  Your price was the best.  Great price, Great product!!Thanks alot Phil</li>
            <li> I enjoy using EasyFeet.  My only problem is not with the product, but with my bath tub.  My tub has a textured floor for non-slippage, therefore, EasyFeet doesn&#x27;t suction to my tub floor.  However, I do put it on the side of my tub and utilize it.  It feels wonderful and makes my feet clean and soft.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Best Buy, not realizing that there was only ONE foot scrubber. Why would you sell only one? I went and re-read the box, and it doesnt say anywhere on there that there is only one. I kind of felt ripped off. You dont go out and buy just one sock right? The product is good, it doesnt stay suctioned to the floor of the tub very well, but I was ok with that since I had to switch places to do my other foot. Overall, the product works well and feels nice. Not sure how well it will stand up to wear and tear, only time will tell. Guess I better buy another one though!!</li>
            <li> Product description states,\\&quot;No Slip Cups that Stick to any surface!\\&quot;  Yeah, sure--if you nail it to the shower floor!  This thing didn&#x27;t stick at all, and constantly moved around--had to use the other foot to hold it down while trying to use it.  That worked.  The other issue is the top ring.  I have size 10 1/2 feet and when using this, combined with it moving around, caught my pinky toe on the edge of the ring and ripped my toenail off.  Not only have I returned it, but threatened legal action.  Stay away from this junk!</li>
            <li> I am disappointed with this product so far.  The suction cups do not stick at all.  I thought maybe it was the texture of the floor, so I tried sticking it to the wall with no luck there either.  It doesn&#x27;t work all that well if it won&#x27;t stay put.</li>
            <li> Every day when I get home from work I kick off my shoes and I like to give my feet a little soak to wash off the day&#x27;s wear and tear.  This product is perfect and convenient to just step into the shower and refresh my tooties.  One note, I found the suction cups on the base really didn&#x27;t stick to the tub&#x27;s surface, so make sure you hold onto the hand rail in your shower when using Easy Foot so you don&#x27;t slip.</li>
            <li> I bought the easy feet for christmas presents for my self and my grown children. They all laughed. Well I got the last laugh because my feet are in wonderful condition and have never been like this in my adult life. I think the brushes scrape  off the dry skin and stimulates the skin. I always follow with petrolium jelly because it is cheap   then socks.  When I ordered them I questioned if there were two in the box or just one.  Two in a box.  My friend bought some as well  and she has a tile shower floor and they won&#x27;t stick.  I am wondering if she put a   plastic placemat down they might grab.  I also use a facial scrub as the for the soap.  Get past the naysayers and you will like it believe me!!!</li>
            <li> A great idea but it will not stick to shower floor so really don&#x27;t work. I have to push it into a corner and can only use it in one direction.  I think it would work on a smooth bath tub.</li>
            <li> I love this! I have a hard time bending over due to arthritis, so I can&#x27;t use the pumice stones and files or whatever you see in most &#x27;home pedicure&#x27; kits. I love the fact that I don&#x27;t have to bend over in order to use this one, and that the pumice stone is big enough to where you can also rub the soles of your feet without much effort. The suction cups can come undone sometimes, but overall they are very helpful in keeping it in place. I&#x27;ve only used it twice in the past two days I&#x27;ve had it (it arrived very quickly, by the way), and already I can tell a difference. I recommend this for anyone, but especially people who have a hard time using other tools.</li>
            <li> This was a good product except that the suction cups on the bottom won&#x27;t hold the item in place on the shower floor.  This makes it hard to use as it slides when you are trying to move your foot inside it.  I do like the brush part and the heel stone.  Just wish it would stay fixed to the floor.</li>
            <li> Purchased this locally at a Bed Bath and Beyond. I really wanted to like it but it slid around way too much. What a great idea though! I even tried replacing the suction cups and it made a little difference, but not much. Placing it on tile or fiberglass didn&#x27;t make much difference either. The only thing that seemed to help was wedging it into a corner. The bristles fit well in between the toes but they are pretty flexible. It will be interesting to see how they hold up with routine usage.</li>
            <li> I bought this item in hopes of finding a reliable tool for everyday foot care.  To remove callous and clean my feet really well.  I&#x27;m a type 1 diabetic for 25 years and foot health is important.  Unfortunately, the Easy Feet was too cumbersome and ineffective that it did not live up to the hype.  The bristles weren&#x27;t long or thick enough, so my foot never got sudsy, therefore I had to keep applying more soap and it took longer to get them clean.  It would&#x27;ve been faster and more efficient to just use a brush with a handle.  Sadly for me the worst defect was the fact that the darn thing would not stay put.  I read the directions before I used it and it warned that movement was normal.  But it would slip inches away from me as I slide my foot back and forth, I wound up dancing and chasing the Easy Feet around the shower, lol.  Funny, but frustrating.  Finally, out of the blue, BAM, it would lose its adhesion and fall off the shower wall.  After the second time I laid it down, unknowingly my son hung it up and that night it promptly fell and broke (the pumice stone popped out and cracked in half).  It is in the garbage now.</li>
            <li> I bought the \\&quot;EASY FEET\\&quot; scrubber for my husband, who can&#x27;t bend over to wash his feet.  He could&#x27;nt stand the tickling feeling. It also wouldn&#x27;t stick to the shower floor.  I liked it for myself, but obviously have to continue washing HIS feet.....</li>
            <li> I really appreciate this product for one reason and that reason is it is such a help when you aren&#x27;t able to wash your feet because of a disability. So if you are disabled this product is for you.</li>
            <li> The product is great - when you poor body wash on it, it scrubs your foot like if it was a car in a carwash.  My personal problem is I have a plastic floorpad built into my shower to make it so that we don&#x27;t slip and the suction cups don&#x27;t suction to anything but porcelian or tile.  I found if I stand with one foot on the easy foot, I can still scrub my foot standing up.  Other than that, it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> Well, with the same success you could just glue any large foot scrubber to your bathtub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this thing does: makes light cleaning easier without bending. And that&#x27;s it. Pumice stone is useless, because you actually have to scrub your callous hard to make it softer. Using this thing you can barely touch the pumice stone. I mean, you do, but the effect is minimum. So you have to do it with another pumice stone still bending to reach your heels. Oh, and the pumice stone broke in halves the very first day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suction cups are great, should they actually keep the thing in place. If you get lucky, you can make a few moves without the thing sliding along with your moves. Top brush is useless - you barely touch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that&#x27;s it. I am using it, it&#x27;s OK, however I wish I didn&#x27;t buy it online: it&#x27;s 14.99 in Sally Beauty Supply.</li>
            <li> I always read the reviews before I buy I was very unhappy. Why do they call it easy feet - It only has one foot. I hung it up on the shower wall like it said and it stayed there for two hours and crashed and broke the stone in the heel. What a rip off it needs more brushes on the top. I feel like I got ripped off paying ten bucks</li>
            <li> Hard to bend knee, so this helps with that foot esp.    It tickles a bit, but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Just the fact that they came up with this idea is something to admire. It does help clear under your feet a lot easier. However, the thing doesn&#x27;t stay still on the surface. It stays attached but not in place, so it keeps sliding from side to side.  So it&#x27;s almost impossible to use the scrub part.</li>
            <li> Do not have to bend down anymore or chance slipping in the tub. Although it tends to not hold well for suction purposes, I just nose the item against the side of the tub and it works fine.</li>
            <li> The Easy Feet product works exactly as advertised and really does clean your feet well. I did not give it 5 stars ONLY because I have large feet and if you do also you have to get used to using the Easy Feet. It is made of very sturdy plastic and you must be careful inserting your foot or it will hit the top plastic support and it ain&#x27;t comfortable! That said, once you learn not to cram your foot into the device too hard it is a pleasure to use. I would not hesitate to buy another one and to recommend it to my friends.</li>
            <li> it all looks good but when you try to use it i could not get the thing to stick good to any thing so you could not put your foot in it to clean good. mabe if you screwed it down to something but in a tub or shower you cant do that so it is useless. plus it took up alot of room in my shower i was always steping on it. i throw it away never worked very good becouse it just keep moving when ya tryed to use it.if you dont have one and realy want to know what im talking about just take a hair brush and drop it on slick floor and try to brush your feet your will see how it moves around.</li>
