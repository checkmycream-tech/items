            <li>It cologne smells good.</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It is however, a nice eau de cologne, and quite wearable.</li>
            <li>no shop charge was nice.</li>
            <li>and I fell in love with the fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love the name,</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>the smell is very good for a second and gone</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a nice, fresh eau de cologne for a lower price this one fits the bill.</li>
            <li>Clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li>Great for social events, gathering and functions.</li>
            <li>You will enjoy the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li>Smells like synthetic cologne something you&#x27;d get for free from a crappy company.</li>
            <li>This is not Jean-Claude Ellena&amp;#34;s Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte, nor is it the original Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte created by Francoise Caron in 1979.</li>
            <li>This fragrance is unlike any other, it is great for summer time and in this packaging it can easily be used for traveling as it meets the TSA size requirements.</li>
            <li>one of the great scents in the world,  clean &amp;  fresh,  day or night,  these little bottles fit anywhere.  </li>
            <li>Now, citrus scents do not last, but Hermes has done a great job of mixing a lovely elixir of longer lasting citrus smells.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery and product description was accurate</li>
            <li>The scent smells like fresh oranges coupled with a hint of lime, it is an extremely fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>nice fresh scent-does not last long-prefer atomizer</li>
            <li>Bought it because the reviews seemed good, but the bottle is super small, it is not a spray and the bottle is plastic.</li>
            <li>The first time that I tried this cologne was abroad while visiting Spain</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an elegant, simple scent.  </li>
            <li>(translation: Green Orange) since it pretty accurately describes the first hit of this perfume.  </li>
            <li>Classic scent.</li>
            <li>The cheap way to a Deluxe Product, which is so powerful that you need only a little bit to go a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Product was sent fast and I will likely buy again!</li>
            <li>I used this for years while flying Delta First Class internationally.  </li>
            <li>Love this fragrance, the bottle is a bit small compared to the price.</li>
            <li>Like an old friend coming back.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s just that I own both the Ellena and Caron versions of Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte and this lacks the strong orange presence and woody base of both - so if anyone is expecting it to be either of these you may be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I only wish this came in a Glass bottle and as anyone would know plastic is not very ideal for perfumes or colognes they loose their potency over time.</li>
            <li> I want to be clear that I AM NOT accusing the seller of selling a fake product, or trying to say it was not produced by Hermes.</li>
            <li> They are small and as small portions are,  then seem a little expensive,  but remember 4-5 oz.  </li>

            <li> This is not Jean-Claude Ellena&amp;#34;s Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte, nor is it the original Eau d&#x27;Orange Verte created by Francoise Caron in 1979. (Ellena&#x27;s version is from  2009) It is however, a nice eau de cologne, and quite wearable. I want to be clear that I AM NOT accusing the seller of selling a fake product, or trying to say it was not produced by Hermes.

            <li> the smell is very good for a second and gone</li>
            <li> Like an old friend coming back.  I used this for years while flying Delta First Class internationally.  And the price was terrific.  I bought 8 bottles.  They meet TSA criteria.</li>
            <li> The cheap way to a Deluxe Product, which is so powerful that you need only a little bit to go a long way!&lt;br /&gt;Product was sent fast and I will likely buy again!</li>

            <li> Excellent product with on time delivery. This Cologne has a wonderful Scent. I only wish this came in a Glass bottle and as anyone would know plastic is not very ideal for perfumes or colognes they loose their potency over time. I will transfer my cologne to a Glass Atomizer. You will enjoy the fragrance of this product.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price and EXCELLENT service! I was at the launch of this product in 1979 at 24 Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré in Paris and was honored to meet Françoise Caron it&#x27;s creator. I&#x27;ve worn it ever since.</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance, the bottle is a bit small compared to the price.</li>
            <li> Smells like synthetic cologne something you&#x27;d get for free from a crappy company.</li>
            <li> The smell was not what I thought it would be.</li>
            <li> one of the great scents in the world,  clean &amp;  fresh,  day or night,  these little bottles fit anywhere.  They are small and as small portions are,  then seem a little expensive,  but remember 4-5 oz.  can cost  close to $100.  these are for gym bag,  carry ons &amp;  the like.  no shop charge was nice.</li>
            <li> nice fresh scent-does not last long-prefer atomizer</li>
            <li> It cologne smells good. I would recommend for all males. Great for social events, gathering and functions. I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought it because the reviews seemed good, but the bottle is super small, it is not a spray and the bottle is plastic. For that I don&#x27;t think its a great deal and the scent didn&#x27;t excite me. No recommendation from me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been on a citrus-smelling cologne adventure.  I bought this on a whim, since it is practically a sample size.  Now, citrus scents do not last, but Hermes has done a great job of mixing a lovely elixir of longer lasting citrus smells.  I love the name, (translation: Green Orange) since it pretty accurately describes the first hit of this perfume.  It&#x27;s an elegant, simple scent.  Love it.</li>
            <li> A great after shave cologne and this one is the perfect size for business travelers.</li>
