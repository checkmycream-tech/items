            <li>Color glides on smoothly and the pigment is just right.</li>
            <li>Great colors that went well with each other.</li>
            <li>The dark colors work great as a liner if you have a liner brush.</li>
            <li>The colors work beautifully for an everyday work or class look.</li>
            <li>I bought these cooler browns from Bare Minerals because I love their foundations.  </li>
            <li>I have really enjoyed Bare Mineral products.  </li>
            <li>I love Bare minerals</li>
            <li>She used this quad in The Truth and it looked so pretty.</li>
            <li>They go on really well too!</li>
            <li>My blue eyes seems to be more pronounced with a neutral shade.  </li>
            <li>This particular eye shadow group was hard to find in my local store.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are perfect for me and leaves no creases in the eyelids.</li>
            <li>Not only is it non-irritating, it stays on all day and is easy to blend.</li>
            <li>tells us this Eye Shadow is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on the upper lid and brow area after eight weeks.</li>
            <li>I went to the BareMinerals store to get matched for foundation and the lady did my whole face.</li>
            <li>The colors are the neutral tones that I love and expected.</li>
            <li>The colors of this palate are very neutral.  </li>
            <li>The shadow stays on all day and the colors blend very well.  </li>
            <li>Provides a very natural and pretty look.</li>
            <li>Colors can be blended together to create more or less shine.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t crease... And easy to go from a daytime look, into a more dramatic evening look.  </li>
            <li>I love all of BM products, but I would have to say, that I really like the solid eyeshadow compared to their loose eyeshadow.</li>
            <li>Product is great, price is a stinker....  </li>
            <li>Long lasting &amp; very evenly applied &amp; easy to use.</li>
            <li>What I mean by that is that I use 2 of the colors more often and need to buy a whole new compact when I run out of those 2 leaving the others in the compact.</li>
            <li>I can safely say that I usually SUCK at applying eyeshadows and making them blend together well.</li>
            <li>I can easily blend the colors for different looks and the colors compliment each other well.</li>
            <li>This quad was developed to give us four perfect base tones that can be used to create any look.</li>
            <li>Eyeshadow Quad is a perfect base tone.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this product for natural looking eyes or the smokey eye look!</li>
            <li>I am a dark blonde, blue eyes, and wear fairly light for my foundation.</li>
            <li>However, I have very oily skin, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would like.  </li>
            <li>So, someone told me to try Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>and it can get all over the place if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>you will definitely need a different applicator brush, but other than that the pigment is exact to what it looks like, the colors blend good, I bought &amp;#34;truth&amp;#34; which can be applied very dramatic, or very natural depending on how you apply it which I like, also the dark color works wonders as eye line.</li>

            <li> only disclaimer is that I am a beginner, therefore I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with other brands.</li>
            <li> I said, I am terrible at blending shadows, but these are super easy to work with.</li>
            <li> Add a simple black liner for your go to look.  </li>

            <li> I may have to try out other color combos</li>
            <li> I add a dark navy or purple pencil to change it up sometimes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also clinically proven to help boost moisture levels in skin on average by 66% after eight weeks for smoother eyes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powered by bareMinerals SeaNutritive Mineral Complex, along with antioxidants, cold-pressed borage oil, caffeine, and cucumber for a softer, smoother, eye area.</li>

            <li> I really hate the outrageous price--I would expect miracles for this cost.  </li>

            <li> These are the best basic colors.  Add a simple black liner for your go to look.  I add a dark navy or purple pencil to change it up sometimes.</li>
            <li> My favorite eyeshadow! Can&#x27;t beat the price! It is so blend-able.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I can safely say that I usually SUCK at applying eyeshadows and making them blend together well. I went to the BareMinerals store to get matched for foundation and the lady did my whole face. She used this quad in The Truth and it looked so pretty. She showed me how to do a day look with clockwise colors 1, 2, and 3, and then a night time look with clockwise colors 1,3, and 4. I was on a budget that day, but vowed to buy this when I could afford it. Found it here for $10 cheaper than at the boutique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I said, I am terrible at blending shadows, but these are super easy to work with. They blend really well and have a nice smooth texture. The colors work beautifully for an everyday work or class look. This is the ONLY eyeshadow that I use. Can&#x27;t say enough about it. It&#x27;s the best...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only disclaimer is that I am a beginner, therefore I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with other brands.</li>
            <li> I found myself to be allergic to makeup I&#x27;ve worn all my life. So, someone told me to try Bare Minerals. Not only is it non-irritating, it stays on all day and is easy to blend. I hope to collect the rest of the makeup line soon.</li>
            <li> I bought these cooler browns from Bare Minerals because I love their foundations.  I like the consistency and ease of application.  However, I have very oily skin, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I would like.  I really hate the outrageous price--I would expect miracles for this cost.  Still, a good product.</li>
            <li> The shadow is of good quality...no powder on my cheeks after application. The colors are earthy brown...not a yellow brown. Provides a very natural and pretty look.</li>
            <li> I like that it gives you four colors.  I have used all of the colors.  It looks good on me.</li>
            <li> you will definitely need a different applicator brush, but other than that the pigment is exact to what it looks like, the colors blend good, I bought &amp;#34;truth&amp;#34; which can be applied very dramatic, or very natural depending on how you apply it which I like, also the dark color works wonders as eye line.</li>
            <li> Great colors that went well with each other. Long lasting, went all day without re applying. Great color depth and just enough shimmer without over powering dat time make up!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing! Love the colors and the product!</li>
            <li> Great colors! They go on really well too! Would definitely recommend this product for natural looking eyes or the smokey eye look!</li>
            <li> I use this quad almost daily. The dark colors work great as a liner if you have a liner brush.</li>
            <li> Nice enough, not that great. Pigments are OK and it stays put with a lid primer. I prefer their 5 in 1 BB eye shadow creams.</li>
            <li> shadow colors are really nice.  applicator is a bit flimsy, the foam parts start moving and slipping off after very little use, but not a big deal if you use other applicators.</li>
            <li> This set of colors is PERFECT! It is easy to use and carry, and looks amazing with my skin tone and blue eyes. I will be buying another one as soon as this compact is finished!</li>
            <li> One of my co-workers walked in to my office the other day and stopped to say &#x27;Wow - I love that eye shadow!!!&#x27; It is easy to apply and stays put all day!</li>
            <li> I love how the colors blend in this compact.  I do wish they were interchangeable.  What I mean by that is that I use 2 of the colors more often and need to buy a whole new compact when I run out of those 2 leaving the others in the compact.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love  this eyeshadow.  Feels like satin, and looks beautiful all day long.  Doesn&#x27;t crease... And easy to go from a daytime look, into a more dramatic evening look.  I can&#x27;t wait to purchase some more!</li>
            <li> I have really enjoyed Bare Mineral products.  This particular eye shadow group was hard to find in my local store.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are perfect for me and leaves no creases in the eyelids.</li>
            <li> Not only did arrive before time , they are beautiful ! Long lasting &amp; very evenly applied &amp; easy to use. I love it !</li>
            <li> I would have probably passed this quad up in the store but after reading the review and seeing a tutorial with them I went ahead and bought them.  They are so beautiful and easy to work with.  I will be purchasing MORE.</li>
            <li> The colors on this palette are great. The eyeshadow glides on smoothly, and stays on all day without creasing.  Colors can be blended together to create more or less shine.</li>
            <li> I love Bare minerals but it&#x27;s a pain to travel with and it can get all over the place if you are not careful. This comes in a cute compact that makes it super easy to use and take anywhere. The colors are the neutral tones that I love and expected. Color glides on smoothly and the pigment is just right. I can easily blend the colors for different looks and the colors compliment each other well. I am a dark blonde, blue eyes, and wear fairly light for my foundation. This was a great set for my coloring.</li>
            <li> The colors of this palate are very neutral.  It includes a diagram of &amp;#34;day&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;night&amp;#34; application.  The shadow stays on all day and the colors blend very well.  No creasing at the fold in the eyelid either.  Product is great, price is a stinker....  however, I think this shadow collection will last a very long time and the colors are timeless.  I am considering buying another color palate.</li>
            <li> I love this eyeshadow pallet. It doesn&#x27;t make a mess of your face, and seems to stay put for a long time. I love all of BM products, but I would have to say, that I really like the solid eyeshadow compared to their loose eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> This is a new go-to eye shadow base shades. Each color in this bareMinerals  Eyeshadow Quad is a perfect base tone. This color is long-wearing and blendable with antiaging benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; All skin types and complexions can wear these shades. The Eyeshadow provides long-wearing color in a silky texture for easy application and blendability. This quad was developed to give us four perfect base tones that can be used to create any look. It&#x27;s powered by bareMinerals SeaNutritive Mineral Complex, along with antioxidants, cold-pressed borage oil, caffeine, and cucumber for a softer, smoother, eye area. It looks like a powder but feels like a cream and delivers a smooth application of long-wearing color.nbareMineral tells us this Eye Shadow is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles on the upper lid and brow area after eight weeks. It&#x27;s also clinically proven to help boost moisture levels in skin on average by 66% after eight weeks for smoother eyes. Quite a promise, I will report back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear each shade alone for a neutral wash of color, or I apply a shade as a  base tone and add other bareMinerals eye colors to create different, more pronounced eye looks.  My blue eyes seems to be more pronounced with a neutral shade.  Love these colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended. prisrob 04-05-14</li>
            <li> Perfect shadow; the colors blend well, it lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s a pretty shade.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Beautiful product- very easy to use on a daily basis- long-wearing</li>
            <li> No matter what product I buy from BE I am always satisfied. I may have to try out other color combos</li>
            <li> Nice shades of nude brown. Lightest color has a glimmer to it and all are long wearing. Will buy again and would like to find a matt set also. Great eyeshadow!</li>
