            <li>and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought more of this product because I am amost out of it - I use it where I need it - face, hands, feet, etc</li>
            <li>Sure it moisturizers</li>
            <li>Love that this can start healing cracked cuticles (and paper cuts) overnight.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the smell as many others did - or even the greasy consistency.  </li>
            <li>think it would work better for the cooler months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>a person sweat more</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly!</li>
            <li>This stuff is awesome for extremely dry skin-I have used it for years</li>
            <li>I was overwhelmed by a strong rancid oily scent when I opened the cap.</li>
            <li>I sampled the original 8 hour cream at the EA counter &amp; couldn&#x27;t stand the strong scent.</li>
            <li>The texture was fantastic though....</li>
            <li>I think the vaseline might be just as effective though for a much lower price.</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because it got high ratings in a popular women&#x27;s magazine.  </li>
            <li>It reminds me of the original Mary Kay hand softener...  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no smell like the original version.</li>
            <li>I tried the fragrance-free because I read the regular fragrance isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li>I was very surprised at how perfect this product is for my &amp;#34;mature dry</li>
            <li>but it takes forever to absorb and stays super sticky until then.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a super lip gloss.  </li>
            <li>A minor thing for such a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>It really lasts and is great for really dry hands, elbows etc.  </li>
            <li>The only one who liked the hand cream was my dog who licked my hands every chance she got.</li>
            <li>It smells kind of like vaseline and is about the same consistancy.</li>
            <li>A bit greasy when first applied, but absorbs quickly</li>
            <li>The only drawback is the smell, it is advertised as fragrance free, which is true, but it isn’t odor free – it has a medicine sort of smell.  </li>
            <li>noticed that with my most recent purchase the taste/smell has changed, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li>That should&#x27;ve been my first warning.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly well and fast on all minor injuries.</li>
            <li>Put it on before bed and the next morning my hands are so much better.</li>
            <li>Three out of the first four are petrolatum (vaseline), Mineral Oil and liquid paraffin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an overall ok cream</li>
            <li>Thanks Elizabeth Arden!</li>
            <li>Great for use at bed time to heal dry chapped skin and minor scrapes and burns.</li>
            <li>It says that it is a skin protectant, but more over it is a skin recovery serum– Dry skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful cream for at least 30 years, as a lip balm every night at bedtime &amp; during the day in dry weather.  </li>
            <li>, I cannot use it), but it moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>It mostly absorbs within a few minutes.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any signs of miraculous new youth on my face, though.</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>Even though this is the fragrant free protectant, it has a slight smell to it.  </li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t do any more than your average regular cream for me.</li>
            <li>It is somewhat greasy and needs a little time to soak in, but once it does, it will last through many hand washes throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It was recommended by a friend who is 70 years old and says people believe she&#x27;s had a face lift, but all she does is use this cream.</li>
            <li>Much cheaper for the same result.</li>
            <li>and there was marked improvement.</li>
            <li>So sad it wasnt good</li>
            <li>skin&amp;#34;...grew up in the sunshine state and have definitely paid the price, but finally found something that really helps!</li>
            <li>I get dry spots on my face &amp; super dry cracked hands during winter.</li>
            <li>Have only used twice so far, used only on one hand to compare to see if it works and after these two times has already made a difference, my hand was real soft and suple.</li>
            <li>I put it on right away and after a few days the wound is nearly healed up.</li>
            <li>The review I read before my purchase said that this would smell odd and they&#x27;re right even though this is fragrance-free.</li>
            <li>, I barely know it’s there.  </li>
            <li>For this reason alone the funky smell and heavy texture are worth the payoff.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I read some other reviews and there are lots of folks who really like it.  </li>
            <li>It goes on like super thick Vaseline.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I use it to help dry skin on my face!</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is Petroleum...</li>
            <li> A pea-sized  dab will handle any area &amp; I use even less for lips &amp; cuticles.  </li>
            <li> I live in an area of cold winters which cause dry hands and feet-using this and covering my feet with socks and my hands with cotton gloves</li>
            <li> I used it for my hands for a few days</li>
            <li> Not great crazy about the light scent (the original s ent is horrible</li>
            <li> but once I put it on I couldn&#x27;t get my hands near my face because the smell was so bad.</li>
            <li> anywhere it will repair, scrapes, scratches, rash – it is unbelievable!  </li>
            <li> The product is super greasy, does not absorb well (stays sticky) and the smell is horrible!</li>
            <li> It was old and stinks sooo bad.</li>
            <li> so I think it&#x27;s basically expensive Vaseline.  </li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my mom who is 80 and has very thin skin.</li>
            <li> I applied a small pea sized amount to both hands &amp; while the salve texture was soothing, the scent was absolutely awful!</li>
            <li> My boyfriend even complained every time I put it on of how awful it smelled.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.  </li>
            <li> I had a collision with a curling iron &amp; got burned terribly.  </li>
            <li> The smell though is the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelled.</li>
            <li> The smell is the worst smell I have ever smelled in a cream.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a very heavy cream and not really necessary now that the weather in my part of the country is hot and humid. I think, however, that come winter I&#x27;ll appreciate the staying power of this moisturizer. It was recommended by a friend who is 70 years old and says people believe she&#x27;s had a face lift, but all she does is use this cream. I don&#x27;t see any signs of miraculous new youth on my face, though. Hmm...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this cream before, and it has no smell. I received this one from amazon today, and today I sent it back. It was old and stinks sooo bad. So sad it wasnt good</li>
            <li> Have only used twice so far, used only on one hand to compare to see if it works and after these two times has already made a difference, my hand was real soft and suple.</li>
            <li> It really lasts and is great for really dry hands, elbows etc.  It reminds me of the original Mary Kay hand softener...  It is somewhat greasy and needs a little time to soak in, but once it does, it will last through many hand washes throughout the day.  It&#x27;s great to use at night with gloves!</li>
            <li> I sampled the original 8 hour cream at the EA counter &amp; couldn&#x27;t stand the strong scent. The texture was fantastic though.... I get dry spots on my face &amp; super dry cracked hands during winter. I came across this fragrance-free version &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. I was overwhelmed by a strong rancid oily scent when I opened the cap. That should&#x27;ve been my first warning. I applied a small pea sized amount to both hands &amp; while the salve texture was soothing, the scent was absolutely awful! Not 5 minutes later did you find me on the computer, requesting a return from Amazon. Never again!</li>
            <li> I bought more of this product because I am amost out of it - I use it where I need it - face, hands, feet, etc and it helps to soften and eliminate dryness.</li>
            <li> I had a collision with a curling iron &amp; got burned terribly.  I immediately used this product per my mother&#x27;s suggestion.  Healed &amp; faded so well you wouldn&#x27;t believe I got burned!</li>
            <li> The smell is almost unbearable. It goes on like super thick Vaseline. Sure it moisturizers but it takes forever to absorb and stays super sticky until then. The smell though is the worst I&#x27;ve ever smelled. I don&#x27;t understand why celebrities would like this product. I will never buy again!</li>
            <li> The product is super greasy, does not absorb well (stays sticky) and the smell is horrible! The smell is the worst smell I have ever smelled in a cream. I used it for my hands for a few days but once I put it on I couldn&#x27;t get my hands near my face because the smell was so bad. It made me want to gag. My boyfriend even complained every time I put it on of how awful it smelled. He could be 5 feet away and knew immediately when I was wearing it. The only one who liked the hand cream was my dog who licked my hands every chance she got.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly well and fast on all minor injuries. I even use it successfully on my cuticles. I can highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure this is worth the hype--seems pretty much like expensive vaseline. I tried the fragrance-free because I read the regular fragrance isn&#x27;t pleasant.</li>
            <li> Love that this can start healing cracked cuticles (and paper cuts) overnight. Put it on before bed and the next morning my hands are so much better.</li>
            <li> The active ingredient is Petroleum... so I think it&#x27;s basically expensive Vaseline.  I bought it because I read some other reviews and there are lots of folks who really like it.  To me it feels like putting grease on my skin.</li>
            <li> Look at the ingredients.  Three out of the first four are petrolatum (vaseline), Mineral Oil and liquid paraffin.  Grease and wax.  Add some mineral oil to vaseline and melt a candle into it.  Much cheaper for the same result.</li>
            <li> It does what it promises. My skin feels great. There&#x27;s no smell like the original version. I use it all over. Lips. Hands. Cuticles. Soles of my feet.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because it got high ratings in a popular women&#x27;s magazine.  But when it  arrived, I read the ingredient list and discovered it is just petroleum jelly.  Very disappointing.  Next time I will buy Vaseline, which is the same thing for a lot less money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the smell as many others did - or even the greasy consistency.  It&#x27;s an overall ok cream but it doesn&#x27;t do any more than your average regular cream for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this wonderful cream for at least 30 years, as a lip balm every night at bedtime &amp; during the day in dry weather.  It&#x27;s also a super lip gloss.  On occasion, I use it for my hands, cuticles, elbows &amp; feet.  A pea-sized  dab will handle any area &amp; I use even less for lips &amp; cuticles.  It mostly absorbs within a few minutes.  About the only things I&#x27;ve used longer are rubbing alcohol &amp; hydrogen peroxide!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed that with my most recent purchase the taste/smell has changed, but it&#x27;s not unpleasant &amp; I&#x27;ve gotten used to it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome for extremely dry skin-I have used it for years and I recommend it highly. I live in an area of cold winters which cause dry hands and feet-using this and covering my feet with socks and my hands with cotton gloves will help re-hydrate them for days. Not cures cracked lips, hands, elbows or feet like this!! I was once burned with scalding water-this helped the skin heal after the initial trauma.</li>
            <li> I bought this cream for my mom who is 80 and has very thin skin. The slightest scratch can tear her skin and leave an open wound. This cream is like a miracle healer. I put it on right away and after a few days the wound is nearly healed up. Thanks Elizabeth Arden!</li>
            <li> Even though this is the fragrant free protectant, it has a slight smell to it.  Not great crazy about the light scent (the original s ent is horrible, I cannot use it), but it moisturizes very well. Good for very cold weather. Probably will stop using once it is warmer out.  Great for hands and elbows too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s oily for my skin type.&lt;br /&gt;I think it would work better for the cooler months.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it will work in the warmer months because it&#x27;s oily and might&lt;br /&gt;make a person sweat more</li>
            <li> The review I read before my purchase said that this would smell odd and they&#x27;re right even though this is fragrance-free. It smells kind of like vaseline and is about the same consistancy. I think the vaseline might be just as effective though for a much lower price.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent!!  It says that it is a skin protectant, but more over it is a skin recovery serum– Dry skin anywhere it will repair, scrapes, scratches, rash – it is unbelievable!  Lips, heels, hands, cuticles…in a word WOW!  I have new kittens, and have a few kitty scratches, I just put some of this “Eight Hour Cream” on it and the next day, I barely know it’s there.  The only drawback is the smell, it is advertised as fragrance free, which is true, but it isn’t odor free – it has a medicine sort of smell.  A minor thing for such a wonderful product.  Oh, and it isn’t a creamy, it is a petrolatum product.</li>
            <li> Great for use at bed time to heal dry chapped skin and minor scrapes and burns. Also used it on my son who gets terribly chapped hands, to the point that the skin cracks. Two days and there was marked improvement. For this reason alone the funky smell and heavy texture are worth the payoff.</li>
            <li> Love this use it for everything! Received in record time price was right and very good product! Goes on smoothly! I use it to help dry skin on my face!</li>
            <li> I was very surprised at how perfect this product is for my &amp;#34;mature dry skin&amp;#34;...grew up in the sunshine state and have definitely paid the price, but finally found something that really helps! A bit greasy when first applied, but absorbs quickly and the results are amazing. I use it during the day, with or without makeup, depending on what I&#x27;m doing for the day. Love it!!</li>
