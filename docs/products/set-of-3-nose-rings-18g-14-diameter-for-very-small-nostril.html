            <li>Received these very quickly and am happy with the quality thus far</li>
            <li>Perfect snug little rings.</li>
            <li>They wouldn&#x27;t fit my nose</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re 5/16 and the metal seems really cheap.</li>
            <li>Maybe fit a babies nose</li>
            <li>Upset at how they fit</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fabulous.</li>
            <li>They are the right size, by the way!</li>

            <li>Rings are extremely too small, better to just go to a store that sells real ones like hot topic or Spencer&#x27;s.</li>

            <li>So small it could fit my 1 year baby sister</li>
