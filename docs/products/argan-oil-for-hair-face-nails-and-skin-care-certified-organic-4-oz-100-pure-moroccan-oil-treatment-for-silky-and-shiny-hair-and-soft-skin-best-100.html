            <li>THANKS FOR THE FREE GIFT.</li>
            <li>This oil is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used in a long, long time.</li>
            <li>Well worth purchasing</li>
            <li>This Argan oil is worth the money.  </li>
            <li>After hearing from some natural girls that it is actually a great oil I gave it a second chance.</li>
            <li>Makes me hair so soft and easy to untangle.</li>
            <li>packaging is very nice, NO LEAKS, which is great, I hate ordering oil and having it leak.</li>
            <li>ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in my hair</li>
            <li>I was amazed at the size of the bottle when it arrived and it has helped my hair feel so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My next plan is to leave it on overnight for more intensive treatment.  </li>
            <li>It makes the skin feel soft and smooth and my hair is so shiny.  </li>

            <li>You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, it only takes a few drops per application.</li>
            <li>I really like that it&#x27;s unscented, and doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li>This one is real.</li>
            <li>This Argan Oil has really made a difference in how my hair feels.  </li>
            <li>Very nourishing and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Absolutely follow the instructions to put the oil on your hair 30 min</li>
            <li>I will definitely be getting more when my current bottle is gone!</li>
            <li>It comes with a convenient dropper so that you can use just the right amount and really make this last.</li>
            <li>High quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it and this seller.</li>
            <li>, at least, before your shower, it&#x27;s a good strong oil to revitalize your hair, but too heavy to be used as a styling product.</li>
            <li>I wish the company much success as they are now starting to build their business.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to argan oil</li>
            <li>we actually used it nutritionally as pure argan oil can help fight cancer!  </li>
            <li>Unless you have really thick hair you don&#x27;t really need more.</li>
            <li>She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair.</li>
            <li>The only thing I did not like was it had a bit of a funny odor.</li>
            <li>I have tried so many that add obvious perfume smells that I did not like, when I buy something and it lists only 1 ingredient, argan, I expect only argan.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much so make sure to use it wisely, as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I used it in my hair and it is so soft, used it on my heels and my feet</li>
            <li>and they feel so soft as well.</li>
            <li>I used it on my natural hair and it leaves my hair well moisturized.  </li>
            <li>makes my hair and skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had the opportunity to sample this product at no cost to me and was surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li>This Argan Oil transformed my hair into a shiny soft and bouncy head of hair.</li>
            <li>I have natural hair, 4a I believe.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, will definitely be a return customer.</li>
            <li>high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair.</li>
            <li>The only reason I give it four stars is because it has a specific smell (like all oils do) that I don&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li>Argon Oil makes my dry, itchy elbows and ankles feel like new!</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend this Organic Argan Oil on natural hair and skin.  </li>
            <li>This large bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li>It does exactly as advertised - soothes and oils/moisturizes the scalp without smelling or making a mess.</li>
            <li>For the hair, during these winter months when my scalp usually gets dry and itchy a few days after washing, the oil is keeping it nice and moist.  </li>
            <li>it has added so much more life to my thin dull hair and unlike the first brand i tried has no over powering scent.</li>

            <li> Absolutely follow the instructions to put the oil on your hair 30 min</li>
            <li> I will definitely be getting more when my current bottle is gone!</li>
            <li> It comes with a convenient dropper so that you can use just the right amount and really make this last.</li>
            <li> High quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it and this seller.</li>
            <li> , at least, before your shower, it&#x27;s a good strong oil to revitalize your hair, but too heavy to be used as a styling product.</li>
            <li> I wish the company much success as they are now starting to build their business.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to argan oil</li>
            <li> we actually used it nutritionally as pure argan oil can help fight cancer!  </li>
            <li> Unless you have really thick hair you don&#x27;t really need more.</li>
            <li> She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair.</li>
            <li> The only thing I did not like was it had a bit of a funny odor.</li>
            <li> I have tried so many that add obvious perfume smells that I did not like, when I buy something and it lists only 1 ingredient, argan, I expect only argan.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much so make sure to use it wisely, as a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I used it in my hair and it is so soft, used it on my heels and my feet</li>
            <li> and they feel so soft as well.</li>
            <li> I used it on my natural hair and it leaves my hair well moisturized.  </li>
            <li> makes my hair and skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to sample this product at no cost to me and was surprised at how well it works.  </li>
            <li> This Argan Oil transformed my hair into a shiny soft and bouncy head of hair.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, 4a I believe.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend, will definitely be a return customer.</li>
            <li> high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair.</li>
            <li> The only reason I give it four stars is because it has a specific smell (like all oils do) that I don&#x27;t really like.  </li>
            <li> Argon Oil makes my dry, itchy elbows and ankles feel like new!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this Organic Argan Oil on natural hair and skin.  </li>
            <li> This large bottle will last me a very long time!</li>
            <li> It does exactly as advertised - soothes and oils/moisturizes the scalp without smelling or making a mess.</li>
            <li> For the hair, during these winter months when my scalp usually gets dry and itchy a few days after washing, the oil is keeping it nice and moist.  </li>
            <li> it has added so much more life to my thin dull hair and unlike the first brand i tried has no over powering scent.</li>
            <li> hair serum before flat ironing (just 2 drops!)&lt;br /&gt;mixing with essential oils</li>
            <li> i like that it is organic too last a long time</li>
            <li> those who came here looking for it for your hair, as a deep conditioning you would want to apply it to dry hair and to the ends only, unless you have a dry scalp, then you can apply to your scalp.</li>
            <li> It had a strong perfume, made my hair feel dry and was really expensive.</li>
            <li> I can not hesitate to recommend that you give it a try for any type of dry scalp/hair condition.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry frizzy hair until I found this Argan oil.</li>
            <li> I air dry my hair</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this oil, I put a few drops in my hand and applied it to my coarse, dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Just a few drops daily works</li>
            <li> A little bit, goes a long way.</li>
            <li> And, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a commercially produced Argan oil in the past that did not give me the results I got from Camille Q&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Due to my oily skin, I cannot use this on my face.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely no fillers or other additives!</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with dry, frizzy hair and leave in products were just not working.  </li>
            <li> I only have to use a little bit to tame the frizz.</li>
            <li> and it did not look weighed down or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> It is less frizzy, easier to brush, and shiny.  </li>
            <li> I guess that is what I should have expected since it is not the perfumed hair products I used in the past.</li>
            <li> considering how little you need of</li>
            <li> I was having some skin troubles for a few weeks before I started using it and the problems have cleared up within a couple of days.</li>
            <li> I have been trying it out for a few weeks before writting my review</li>
            <li> The Argan oil works miracles on hair, and even really scary dry skin like feet and hands.</li>
            <li> If your hair is seeing the bad end of winter this year, this would be the ultimate &amp;#34;spa day&amp;#34; for your hair.</li>
            <li> I was definitely not happy with.</li>
            <li> Poor</li>
            <li> Let me just say that Argan oil is very expensive because of the time consuming processing method.  </li>
            <li> and I hated.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> love this stuff! it has added so much more life to my thin dull hair and unlike the first brand i tried has no over powering scent. ive used it as a treatment before shampooing and sometimes add a drop or two when blowdrying to add some extra shine.</li>
            <li> This oil is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used in a long, long time. I used it in my hair and it is so soft, used it on my heels and my feet and they feel so soft as well. It doesn&#x27;t take much so make sure to use it wisely, as a little goes a long way. Well worth purchasing &amp; I&#x27;d do it again.  High quality. I would recommend it to all my friends and family and actually have.</li>
            <li> It was free and my mother-in-law loved it.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.  I&#x27;ve used a commercially produced Argan oil in the past that did not give me the results I got from Camille Q&#x27;s.  I will definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> This was wonderful &#x3D; we actually used it nutritionally as pure argan oil can help fight cancer!  Now we need to reorder!</li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;hairdresser&amp;#34; said to get it and use it, so I did - reluctantly. It does exactly as advertised - soothes and oils/moisturizes the scalp without smelling or making a mess. I can not hesitate to recommend that you give it a try for any type of dry scalp/hair condition.</li>
            <li> This product has been great for my hair!  Smoothes and shines while making it healthy!  I&#x27;ll order again as gifts and for myself.</li>
            <li> I liked it a lot , good treatment for my hair. The only thing I did not like was it had a bit of a funny odor.</li>
            <li> Always hear Argan oil had a lot of benefits for the skin and hair and is a reality because this product is great...</li>
            <li> The stuff works ok, I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference in my hair like I was hoping. I will continue to use it until the bottle is gone.</li>
            <li> I was just shopping around online one day to see what was being offered for free online.  I really thought this was a joke when I saw that this Organic Argan Oil was being offered for free as a promotion.  I received it two days later and I must say I&#x27;m very pleased with the size and amount for the price.  Let me just say that Argan oil is very expensive because of the time consuming processing method.  This Argan oil is worth the money.  I used it on my natural hair and it leaves my hair well moisturized.  I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s skin for her eczema and clears up her skin in two days.  The only reason I give it four stars is because it has a specific smell (like all oils do) that I don&#x27;t really like.  I would definitely recommend this Organic Argan Oil on natural hair and skin.  Due to my oily skin, I cannot use this on my face.  I tried it on a spot on my face and my skin broke out with acne (and I&#x27;m almost 40- go figure).  I wish the company much success as they are now starting to build their business.</li>
            <li> - I ordered this oil through Amazon and I love it! it works just as well as the more pricey Morroccan Oil, and that is not organic. I have very frizzy, curly stressed hair, and this oil has made it soft and manageable and my curls look great! No firzz!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to argan oil but everyone seems to be using it as a part of their beauty regime. I like this one because it is certified organic. Makes my skin feel smooth. I haven&#x27;t tried it on my hair yet.</li>
            <li> What a great value for 100% pure Argan oil! Absolutely no fillers or other additives! Both my husband and I love it. It smooths our hair and gets rid of the frizz. Highly recommend it and this seller.</li>
            <li> I really love this oil! I was having some skin troubles for a few weeks before I started using it and the problems have cleared up within a couple of days. It comes with a convenient dropper so that you can use just the right amount and really make this last. Absorbs into the skin practically instantly. Highly recommend, will definitely be a return customer.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing !!! ARGAN OIL. makes me feel my hair fantastic, healthy, soft and it gets shine. I also used for my skin. Of course I recommend this product to everybody it is a great purched, the price is lower then others.</li>
            <li> LOVE this Argon oil and the fact that it&#x27;s organic is wonderful! Has a nutty smell but it&#x27;s not bad. makes my hair and skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I like the results I&#x27;m getting using the oil.  Just a few drops daily works well.  The only draw back I can see is the scent, but I guess that is what I should have expected since it is not the perfumed hair products I used in the past.</li>
            <li> Super duper cosmetic aid!    I bought this mostly to use for my nails.  It is definitely smoothing out the ridges which was my biggest desire.  For the hair, during these winter months when my scalp usually gets dry and itchy a few days after washing, the oil is keeping it nice and moist.  I will definitely be getting more when my current bottle is gone!</li>
            <li> Love it. Makes my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Gotta say I love Argan Oil. I have used it in my hair and it looks amazing!</li>
            <li> Most of my hair is gray now, what means it is dryer and coarser. I started using this product and already noticed the difference - it is softer and shinier then ever. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Rafaela</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff! Argon Oil makes my dry, itchy elbows and ankles feel like new! It&#x27;s a great deal, it only takes a few drops per application. This large bottle will last me a very long time! I&#x27;m planning on getting some  more of these for Christmas gifts. :)</li>
            <li> Five Star Product from a Five Star Seller !!! Product is stellar and does what it says it does !!! While most products claim to do this or that, it is refreshing to find a product that actually works !!! Thanks for your business !!! AAA+++</li>
            <li> I received this free with a promotional code. It is truly awesome stuff! I was amazed at the size of the bottle when it arrived and it has helped my hair feel so soft and smooth. I had never heard of it before the promotion, so I am just really very thrilled. I recommend this product!</li>
            <li> As soon as I got this oil, I put a few drops in my hand and applied it to my coarse, dry hair.  It was instantly more silky.  My next plan is to leave it on overnight for more intensive treatment.  I really like that it&#x27;s unscented, and doesn&#x27;t clash with my perfume.</li>
            <li> The BEST argan! This one is real. I have tried so many that add obvious perfume smells that I did not like, when I buy something and it lists only 1 ingredient, argan, I expect only argan. This product has no added scents and that makes me really happy. I use argan for so many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this one and the castor oil from Cammile, and I am very pleased with this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very nice, NO LEAKS, which is great, I hate ordering oil and having it leak. The labeling and the bottle are beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a big bottle, 4 oz is a lot of argan oil considering how little you need of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for&lt;br /&gt;cuticles&lt;br /&gt;deep conditioning&lt;br /&gt;a hair serum before flat ironing (just 2 drops!)&lt;br /&gt;mixing with essential oils I use argan as the carrier oil&lt;br /&gt;massage oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who came here looking for it for your hair, as a deep conditioning you would want to apply it to dry hair and to the ends only, unless you have a dry scalp, then you can apply to your scalp. You can leave it in as long as you want, and wrap your hair in saran wrap for an even more intense conditioning. When you have a good idea of how much to use, you can do it on damp hair. You can mix with coconut oil if you want the benefits of both. Wash it out with a good lathering shampoo after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to use it as a leave in, I recommend just two drops applied to the ends and then the fly aways. I put the drops in my palm and rub my hands together and apply just 2 drops. Unless you have really thick hair you don&#x27;t really need more. This will leave you with really soft, silky, shiny hair that is not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a coupon to try this product out for a huge discount in order to provide feedback and an honest review. I am more than happy with this argan oil, as i have tried others and some I was definitely not happy with.</li>
            <li> Purchased with a promitional code- my daughter is biracial and this has helped her hair alot!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my wife as she wanted to try some argan oil products. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil.  With tihs particular product, she found that her hair less frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This high quality virgin argan oil does wonder for my wife&#x27;s skin and especially her hair. A little bit, goes a long way. She adds this to her hair post shower and it makes for very soft and shiny and flowing hair. I am impressed with the results she has gotten and she is now a big believer in argan oil. More importantly, the argan oil does not negatively impact her coloring and hair treatments, so she is also pleased about that.</li>
            <li> I have been having trouble with dry, frizzy hair and leave in products were just not working.  This Argan Oil has really made a difference in how my hair feels.  It is less frizzy, easier to brush, and shiny.  I also used the leftovers on my hands after application as a skin moisturizer, and it worked exceptionally well.  Even after washing my hands, they felt moisturized and not oily.</li>
            <li> Love argan oil! I use it for everything. It&#x27;s great on skin and hair. Very nourishing and moisturizing. This is a huge bottle as well. Good deal for the price!</li>
            <li> I love the argain by Cammile Q. It keeps my body moisturizerd after a show for the hours. I can&#x27;t wait to start using it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I used to have dry frizzy hair until I found this Argan oil.I only have to use a little bit to tame the frizz. I can now say I have good hair dasys</li>
            <li> I had the opportunity to sample this product at no cost to me and was surprised at how well it works.  I know it is recommended for the hair, but I also used it on my legs and feet.  It makes the skin feel soft and smooth and my hair is so shiny.  I love this stuff.  And, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love organic. Makes me hair so soft and easy to untangle. I received this at a discounted price through Amazon for an honest opinion</li>
            <li> The Argan oil works miracles on hair, and even really scary dry skin like feet and hands. Absolutely follow the instructions to put the oil on your hair 30 min, at least, before your shower, it&#x27;s a good strong oil to revitalize your hair, but too heavy to be used as a styling product. If your hair is seeing the bad end of winter this year, this would be the ultimate &amp;#34;spa day&amp;#34; for your hair.</li>
            <li> makes my hair soft and smooth my skin feels  smooth my hair combs easy now and has a shine to it my hair was lifeless now the life  is back into it  very good Argan oil i like that it is organic too last a long time</li>
            <li> Wow! This Argan Oil transformed my hair into a shiny soft and bouncy head of hair. I never used Argan oil as a Pre-Shower Hair treatment but I&#x27;m so glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oil is 100% Pure and it penetrates deep into your hair giving it the Moisture it needs to make your look and feel healthy bouncy and shiny. I air dry my hair and it did not look weighed down or greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I have natural hair, 4a I believe. I have used this Argan oil as a preepoo and liked it a lot. I have also added it to my Shea butter mix which made it creamer. I dont&#x27;t know if it is because it made it creamier or because it was just me adding extra oil into my mix. Well, what matters is that my hair loved it! My mom gave me a tiny bottle of Argan oil from a different brand from Brazil as a gift last year and I hated. It had a strong perfume, made my hair feel dry and was really expensive. Poor my mom, she thought I wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy Argan oil here. After that I just didn&#x27;t want to try it again. After hearing from some natural girls that it is actually a great oil I gave it a second chance. I&#x27;m so glad I did. This product is organic, affordable and I can&#x27;t wait to give my mom a bottle of it!</li>
            <li> The Argan oil for hair face nails and skin works great! I have been trying it out for a few weeks before writting my review and I love it. its a great use for your money</li>
            <li> If you love glowing skin all the time this is the product for you. I put this product on my sking and it instantly shines and glowes. MUST HAVE!!! THANKS FOR THE FREE GIFT.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff!  I use on my hair and my face and I cannot believe how wonderful it is.  Please try it out, you will love it like me!</li>
            <li> Wonderful.  No odor, easy to use.  Light weight oil I use for my hair.</li>
            <li> Love it!  Couldn&#x27;t stand the thought of having to start wearing wigs. Hair is starting to grow again, and I want  more more more!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. It works great on my hair skin and nails. I love that it doesn&#x27;t have any perfume in the oil .  I will purchase it again</li>
