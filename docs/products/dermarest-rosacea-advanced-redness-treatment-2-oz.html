    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Not too impressed with this product.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful and I use it for a non-rosacea problem.  </li>
            <li>Perfect as described</li>
            <li>He noticed a difference in a day or two and after a couple weeks, his skin looked perfectly normal.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The best luck I have had with controlling that aspect of my rosacea is [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about to mention, I&#x27;d be happy to use this stuff forever.  </li>
            <li>For others, they haven&#x27;t noticed or minded this, and I&#x27;m happy for them.  </li>
            <li>, I thought I could brave the smell.  </li>
            <li>They have a great return policy.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work that great</li>
            <li>Price and delivery of product was great.</li>
            <li>Great seller, but the product is not for me.</li>
            <li>Dermarest is a great moisturizer under any foundation.</li>
            <li>and it works great.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s a but much!!!!!!</li>
            <li>And for a good price too.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>Excellent product and quick shipment.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li>Because it&#x27;s fairly effective</li>
            <li>I am in week 2 of use and it is extremely effective at reducing the redness to almost nothing.  </li>
            <li>When I apply the Dermarest my skin immediately feels better.  </li>
            <li>so you have more breakouts.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used stuff that worked better for me, but Dermarest is better than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also be sure to avoid the sun and wear a hat to avoid sun damage.    </li>
            <li>absolutely LOVE IT</li>
            <li>It works best when you use it daily.</li>
            <li>Burns skin and irritated even more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it works for some, but something in this product didn&#x27;t work well for my skin.  </li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>have a good new year</li>
            <li>and I can see a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>So this is my latest product tryout that was a success.</li>
            <li>this, it is worth the price and more.  </li>
            <li>this cream is worth every penny and more...</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t write many reviews because there just isn&#x27;t anything I usually love THAT much</li>
            <li>To me, it&#x27;s nothing special.</li>
            <li>Before going to bed rinse with a mild soap.  </li>
            <li>I have a mild case of rosacea on my face.</li>
            <li>When I learned that Dermarest had discontinued Advanced Redness Treatment, I came here to stock up, because I very much like the product.  </li>
            <li>was worth a shot though right?!</li>
            <li>This product has made me go from not wanting to leave my house to having normal, healthy looking skin with a minimum of usage: almost overnight.  </li>
            <li>It was oily, and didnt do anything for me, it dint even help calm my skin.</li>
            <li>I did not have success with this product.</li>
            <li>I rarely give 5 stars, but this deserves all 5.  </li>
            <li>I have mildish skin rosacea symptoms wherein my cheeks get flushed and hot.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s really going away!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d put Dermarest in the first category: it does help my symptoms.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, for saving my face, literally!  </li>
            <li>I love Amazon, but doubt they would receive a dud back in this instance.</li>
            <li>I think this product actually works better.</li>
            <li>I tried many different products, some of them pretty pricey and none of them worked as well as this product.</li>
            <li>First time writin a review but hope it helps others  shiped on time and product as described  </li>
            <li>Dermarest Rosacea Advanced Redness Treatment goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a smell and is the only product I have found, including much more expensive ones, that I can use on my whole face either by itself if I&#x27;m in a hurry or under makeup if I&#x27;m dressing up.</li>
            <li>Dermarest Rosacea feels VERY oily on me.  </li>
            <li>I really did not like anything about this product.</li>
            <li>The price is very affordable.</li>
            <li>BUT...I can&#x27;t believe Amazon wants to charge me $29.99 s/h for a $35.00 order...</li>
            <li>Thanks Dermarest for researching and making this product.  </li>
            <li>A+ fast delivery</li>
            <li>I really like Demarest Rosacea Treatment because it&#x27;s gentle and calms the redness.  </li>
            <li>This does absolutely nothing for the redness</li>
            <li>The next day rinse with mild soap and apply a light layer of Dermarest in the morning and throughout the day as necessary.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m surprised that my doctor didn&#x27;t think of just having me try this out first.    </li>
            <li>and I was able to find so much of it for so little money</li>
            <li>I get mild psoriasis on my face; especially during the winter.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Imagine my surprise when I come back today and see the same usurious price being charged for The Magically Regenerating One (Tube)</li>
            <li>We tried many different creams, some commercial, some alternative \\&quot;all</li>
            <li>I was amazed that such an economical product would work much better than more expensive products.    </li>
            <li>Regardless, I wouldn&#x27;t want to come to rely on this product, as when the last of the old tubes are gone, you won&#x27;t likely be able to find more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Because they know that many times you waste money buying a product that ends up not working for you.  </li>
            <li>As someone who has been burned a few times buying products that claim (very convincingly) to be phenomenal, and also as someone who NEVER writes reviews, I felt compelled to write this one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny to rid him of this affliction that has plagued him his ENTIRE life.</li>
            <li>Like you, I try a lot of products and keep trying new ones all the time.  </li>
            <li>After going to a dermatologist and having stronger hydro cortisone prescribed (which really didn&#x27;t do much for me) I ran into this product at a local pharmacy and decided to try it out.    </li>
            <li>As of yesterday (Oct. 1), the price had more than doubled since my last order, and the vendor claimed that only one unit was left.  </li>
            <li>I have oily skin but haven&#x27;t experienced heavy breakouts (I usually wash my skin before applying the product).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised how well this product works on my rosacea</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive, rosacea, dehydrated and or flaky patches this is the solution.  </li>
            <li>Once the product is applied my skin feels smooth after 20 - 30 minutes and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or with a heavy residue.    </li>
            <li>If I have a severe flare-up the following regimen seems to really help:  </li>
            <li>I have been battling this skin condition for years, and the acne flares have waxed and waned for far longer than I have been using this product.</li>
            <li>but this product has been a miracle cure for my 75 year old dad.</li>
            <li>Glad to see there are a few left on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I have only used this sparingly and intend to use it more in the future since I am using other products at this time.</li>
            <li>Dermarest Rosacea ends up being the only thing that works for you, maybe you could brave the greasy feeling and the smell, but you&#x27;ll still be disappointed inthe end, because you won&#x27;t be able to find it in the future, and any you do find will be old and long expired.</li>
            <li>In further fact, I actually bought a case of 20 tubes of Dermarest Rosacea from a guy on eBay, and I paid less for 20 tubes than I normally pay for 2 tubes of my favorite topical solution, something</li>
            <li>I never expected it to work.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several topical solutions over the years; some are pretty effective at controlling my rosacea symptoms, some have little or no effect, and some have made the condition worse.  </li>
            <li>i have rosacea and very sensitive skin - was looking for something to calm it down and tone down the redness.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several topical solutions over the years; some are pretty effective at controlling my rosacea symptoms, some have little or no effect, and some have made the condition worse.  </li>
            <li> i have rosacea and very sensitive skin - was looking for something to calm it down and tone down the redness.  </li>
            <li> Having combination skin, if I use a rich moisturizer, parts of my face break out, yet if I don&#x27;t moisturize heavily and often, other parts are dry and red.  </li>
            <li> This is a very frustrating condition, and I will continue to look for a better solution.</li>
            <li> The whole upper arm is getting less red, though it&#x27;s still rough, and some spots have little patches that are totally normal.</li>
            <li> The product made the appearance of the rosacea diminished, at first, due to its green tint, but the actual condition worsened.</li>
            <li> Although my doctors tell me I am wrong, I have documented in my journal with entries for over 20 years that nuts cause a huge flare up for me.  </li>
            <li> I have really rough Rosacea on my upper arms.</li>
            <li> Other spots all over my face and chin and neck do appear under big flare ups.  </li>
            <li> Previously I have been using the Eucerin skin products for rosacea daily, but I don&#x27;t get that relief feeling with the Eucerin lotions.  </li>
            <li> It came out super greasy, smelled absolutely awful, and made my face /redder/ than it originally was.</li>
            <li> but thankfully my rosacea flare-ups are not very severe and don&#x27;t occur too often.    </li>
            <li> He had no real luck.  </li>
            <li> You know how they say there really is no cure for Rosacea?</li>
            <li> Total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> My skin was very red and itchy in that spot for a few days afterwards.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from red blotches &amp; small broken veins to a barely noticeable tint of red in my skin.  </li>
            <li> I usually begin searching for a new daily product when my condition (facial, ears, neck and chest for me) flares up and becomes difficult to control.  </li>
            <li> Other products I&#x27;ve used were drying.</li>
            <li> But if you have struggled with rosacea and tried expensive salves/creams/ointments and they don&#x27;t really seem to work...</li>
            <li> Dermarest was inexpensive and having been burned before, I thought at least we&#x27;d  only be out $15.  </li>
            <li> Along with my other products that I continue to rotate (Vit K, Turmeric, Miconazol, Prosacea and a few others)</li>
            <li> He has suffered from what he calls \\&quot;bad skin\\&quot; his whole life, it is scaly, broke open and red/</li>
            <li> And the smell fades within a half hour or so.  </li>
            <li> I know I will never get rid of the rosacea but using Demerest makes it less noticeable.</li>
            <li> The slight green tint helps to even out the redness and cover any rosacea blemishes.</li>
            <li> I am also a little concerned that it may be exacerbating the frequency of acne flares that I have, though I am giving it the benefit of the doubt on that for the moment.</li>
            <li> i just tested a little dab of this on one of my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> My Rosacea is redness with minor blistering when it gets out of control..no bulbous bumps or serious blistering</li>
            <li> Waste of money, gave it a week with no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> The green tint does not help in the slightest.</li>
            <li> i knew within a few moments that it was not for me, it was burning my skin</li>
            <li> it stops the outbreak of pimples on my face/neck and calms down the redness unbelievably....</li>
            <li> Well since then, I was not able to find it any where.</li>
            <li> This product is a small wonder.</li>
            <li> There really is no redeeming quality to this product.</li>
            <li> I do have severe redness with my Rosacea and have found very few products that help it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just flat WRONG.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway, I found a tube of this on closeout somewhere about a year ago and forgot to give it to him until a few days ago and he called this morning to say his \\&quot;bad skin\\&quot; is nearly GONE.</li>
            <li> I cannot recommend this at least from my experience.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, at least not for me</li>
            <li> adding this one got by Rosacea back under control from an ugly flare up.  </li>
            <li> The redness/itching was decreased as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was among the least expensive treatmenst for rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, I noticed it in time, and the flare up has not spread to become worse.  </li>
            <li> Product did nothing for my rosacea, in fact it made it worse by drying my skin out.  </li>
            <li> My &amp;#34;hot spot&amp;#34; is under my eyes and around my nose and behind ears.  </li>
            <li> In fact, the product application is akin to smearing green chicken broth on your skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it made the flare up worse!  </li>
            <li> The product is almost as thin as chicken broth.</li>
            <li> all I need is a very thin layer...</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it made it WORSE!!.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very uncomfortable feeling.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t even have rosacea bad.</li>
            <li> I was shocked that it worked.  </li>
            <li> husband had very bad rosacea on his face.  </li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s just absolutely horrible.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s just the evil of Rosacea.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I did not have success with this product. It did not lessen the red on my face at all. But I gave it to a friend and she thinks it&#x27;s working well for her.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a gift from my mother.  I have mildish skin rosacea symptoms wherein my cheeks get flushed and hot.  When I apply the Dermarest my skin immediately feels better.  Previously I have been using the Eucerin skin products for rosacea daily, but I don&#x27;t get that relief feeling with the Eucerin lotions.  I&#x27;m in process of switching to using Dermarest Rosacea as my regular face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product with the hope that it would reduce or eliminate my redness and bumps on my face.  Unfortunately it made it WORSE!!.  I cannot recommend this at least from my experience.</li>
            <li> I have really rough Rosacea on my upper arms. I started using this and it&#x27;s really going away! And for a good price too. The whole upper arm is getting less red, though it&#x27;s still rough, and some spots have little patches that are totally normal. And they just keep getting bigger!</li>
            <li> If you have problems with acne AND rosacea, then this product is not for you.  It makes your skin extra oily so you have more breakouts.  Not too impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on what the reviews said.&lt;br /&gt;This product evened out my skin tone and moisturized it; it did not make it oily at all.  The redness/itching was decreased as well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, at least not for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several topical solutions over the years; some are pretty effective at controlling my rosacea symptoms, some have little or no effect, and some have made the condition worse.  I&#x27;d put Dermarest in the first category: it does help my symptoms.  I&#x27;ve used stuff that worked better for me, but Dermarest is better than average.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, if it wasn&#x27;t for the three humongous negatives I&#x27;m about to mention, I&#x27;d be happy to use this stuff forever.  In further fact, I actually bought a case of 20 tubes of Dermarest Rosacea from a guy on eBay, and I paid less for 20 tubes than I normally pay for 2 tubes of my favorite topical solution, something Amazon doesn&#x27;t carry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the negatives:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  I&#x27;m assuming that Dermarest no longer makes this stuff, as it&#x27;s not mentioned on their website.  Maybe it&#x27;s the same formula as their eczema or psoriasis solutions, and maybe they were just putting the stuff in Rosacea tubes for a while, and they&#x27;ve now stopped that.  Or maybe they just stopped making the rosacea formula.  Regardless, I wouldn&#x27;t want to come to rely on this product, as when the last of the old tubes are gone, you won&#x27;t likely be able to find more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  Dermarest Rosacea feels VERY oily on me.  It&#x27;s a very uncomfortable feeling.  For others, they haven&#x27;t noticed or minded this, and I&#x27;m happy for them.  But for me, I didn&#x27;t like the feel of the stuff at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  O my god, that smell!  To me, it&#x27;s just absolutely horrible.  In fact, a friend could smell it on me from several feet away, and he winced in disgust.  Because it&#x27;s fairly effective and I was able to find so much of it for so little money, I thought I could brave the smell.  And the smell fades within a half hour or so.  But life is just too short to spend an hour a day smelling this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Dermarest Rosacea ends up being the only thing that works for you, maybe you could brave the greasy feeling and the smell, but you&#x27;ll still be disappointed inthe end, because you won&#x27;t be able to find it in the future, and any you do find will be old and long expired.</li>
            <li> I think I initially purchased this product just because I hadn&#x27;t tried it before.  I was shocked that it worked.  Well since then, I was not able to find it any where. Thanks Amazon, for saving my face, literally!  Skeptics - be skeptic no longer - this truly works.</li>
            <li> I really did not like anything about this product. It came out super greasy, smelled absolutely awful, and made my face /redder/ than it originally was. Maybe it&#x27;s different for every person, but it&#x27;s definitely not for me!</li>
            <li> Maybe this product works for some people, but it did not work for me.  I bought it because it was among the least expensive treatmenst for rosacea.  Unfortunately, it made the flare up worse!  Thankfully, I noticed it in time, and the flare up has not spread to become worse.  I just want to know if this has actually worked for someone else?  Wish I could return it!  I should have bought it at Ulta!  They&#x27;ll refund or exchange duds for you!  My mistake!  Buy your cosmetic products at Ulta!  They have a great return policy.  They&#x27;ll let you return a product even after you open and use it!  Because they know that many times you waste money buying a product that ends up not working for you.  I love Amazon, but doubt they would receive a dud back in this instance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised how well this product works on my rosacea given that it&#x27;s not prescription.  My prescription Rosacea medication is no longer being made.  I think this product actually works better.</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s nothing special. It doesn&#x27;t work that great and I don&#x27;t even have rosacea bad. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> I rarely give 5 stars, but this deserves all 5.  My skin has been irritated dehydrated and flaky for months. I tried many different products, some of them pretty pricey and none of them worked as well as this product. If you have sensitive, rosacea, dehydrated and or flaky patches this is the solution.  The price is very affordable.</li>
            <li> I get mild psoriasis on my face; especially during the winter.  This product has made me go from not wanting to leave my house to having normal, healthy looking skin with a minimum of usage: almost overnight.  I&#x27;ve gone from red blotches &amp; small broken veins to a barely noticeable tint of red in my skin.  This product is a small wonder.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and I use it for a non-rosacea problem.  It is NOT geasy as one review stated,  BUT...I can&#x27;t believe Amazon wants to charge me $29.99 s/h for a $35.00 order...that&#x27;s a but much!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It was oily, and didnt do anything for me, it dint even help calm my skin. Waste of money, gave it a week with no difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Having combination skin, if I use a rich moisturizer, parts of my face break out, yet if I don&#x27;t moisturize heavily and often, other parts are dry and red.  Dermarest Rosacea Advanced Redness Treatment goes on smoothly, doesn&#x27;t have too strong of a smell and is the only product I have found, including much more expensive ones, that I can use on my whole face either by itself if I&#x27;m in a hurry or under makeup if I&#x27;m dressing up. I&#x27;m so glad Amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> After going to a dermatologist and having stronger hydro cortisone prescribed (which really didn&#x27;t do much for me) I ran into this product at a local pharmacy and decided to try it out.    I was amazed that such an economical product would work much better than more expensive products.    I have oily skin but haven&#x27;t experienced heavy breakouts (I usually wash my skin before applying the product).  Once the product is applied my skin feels smooth after 20 - 30 minutes and it doesn&#x27;t feel oily or with a heavy residue.    Thanks Dermarest for researching and making this product.  I&#x27;m surprised that my doctor didn&#x27;t think of just having me try this out first.    I&#x27;ve been using this product for well over 4 years now when I need it...but thankfully my rosacea flare-ups are not very severe and don&#x27;t occur too often.    If I have a severe flare-up the following regimen seems to really help:  1. Before going to bed rinse with a mild soap.  2. Apply Dermarest Rosacea treatment.  3. Then apply a generous layer of Eucerin Aquaphor or Eucerin Moisturizing Cream (this helps retain moisture in your skin)    The next day rinse with mild soap and apply a light layer of Dermarest in the morning and throughout the day as necessary.    Also be sure to avoid the sun and wear a hat to avoid sun damage.    That said, this product may not be for everyone...since we all have genetic and cellular differences with varying reactions to medication/chemicals etc.    But if you have struggled with rosacea and tried expensive salves/creams/ointments and they don&#x27;t really seem to work...give this one a try.    It has worked for me and also helped me to cut back on using hydro cortisone too.</li>
            <li> First time writin a review but hope it helps others  shiped on time and product as described  have a good new year</li>
            <li> Price and delivery of product was great. Product did nothing for my rosacea, in fact it made it worse by drying my skin out.  The product made the appearance of the rosacea diminished, at first, due to its green tint, but the actual condition worsened. Great seller, but the product is not for me.</li>
            <li> This did nothing at all for my redness. I do have severe redness with my Rosacea and have found very few products that help it. So this may not be an ineffective product, it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> Dermarest is a great moisturizer under any foundation. The slight green tint helps to even out the redness and cover any rosacea blemishes. This is a must for those women with rosacea.</li>
            <li> When I learned that Dermarest had discontinued Advanced Redness Treatment, I came here to stock up, because I very much like the product.  As of yesterday (Oct. 1), the price had more than doubled since my last order, and the vendor claimed that only one unit was left.  Even so, I bit the bullet and shelled out megabux for what I thought was the last tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine my surprise when I come back today and see the same usurious price being charged for The Magically Regenerating One (Tube) In Stock.  That&#x27;s just flat WRONG.</li>
            <li> This product does almost instantly start to remove the redness associated with rosacea.  I have been using this product for approx 2 weeks daily and I can see a huge improvement.  However, I still have alittle redness but, it is fading. I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect as described A+ fast delivery I would definitely recommend this seller to my friends and associates and look forward to doing business again in the future should a similar item be added</li>
            <li> Like you, I try a lot of products and keep trying new ones all the time.  Why? Because no matter what you find that works, sooner or later, it will stop working.  That&#x27;s just the evil of Rosacea.  So this is my latest product tryout that was a success. I am in week 2 of use and it is extremely effective at reducing the redness to almost nothing.  I usually begin searching for a new daily product when my condition (facial, ears, neck and chest for me) flares up and becomes difficult to control.  Along with my other products that I continue to rotate (Vit K, Turmeric, Miconazol, Prosacea and a few others) adding this one got by Rosacea back under control from an ugly flare up.  My Rosacea is redness with minor blistering when it gets out of control..no bulbous bumps or serious blistering so keep that in mind when selecting.  My &amp;#34;hot spot&amp;#34; is under my eyes and around my nose and behind ears.  Other spots all over my face and chin and neck do appear under big flare ups.  Although my doctors tell me I am wrong, I have documented in my journal with entries for over 20 years that nuts cause a huge flare up for me.  A lot of nuts in my diet and this or any product will not keep the Rosacea at bay.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have a mild case of rosacea on my face. I really like Demarest Rosacea Treatment because it&#x27;s gentle and calms the redness.  Other products I&#x27;ve used were drying. I know I will never get rid of the rosacea but using Demerest makes it less noticeable.</li>
            <li> As someone who has been burned a few times buying products that claim (very convincingly) to be phenomenal, and also as someone who NEVER writes reviews, I felt compelled to write this one.&lt;br /&gt;My husband had very bad rosacea on his face.  We tried many different creams, some commercial, some alternative \\&quot;all natural\\&quot;.  He had no real luck.  Then we sent for Dermarest, instead of a $60 product we saw at the same time.  Dermarest was inexpensive and having been burned before, I thought at least we&#x27;d  only be out $15.  I never expected it to work.&lt;br /&gt;My husbands Rosacea is gone.  He uses this every day.  He noticed a difference in a day or two and after a couple weeks, his skin looked perfectly normal.&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, it is worth the price and more.  Finally, a product that lives up to it&#x27;s claims.</li>
            <li> my wife bought this product...  she said \\&quot;sometimes you find a miracle.....this cream is worth every penny and more...it stops the outbreak of pimples on my face/neck and calms down the redness unbelievably.... I can even put makeup on over it.... all I need is a very thin layer...absolutely LOVE IT...\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This does absolutely nothing for the redness Rosacea sufferers endure. The green tint does not help in the slightest. The product is almost as thin as chicken broth. In fact, the product application is akin to smearing green chicken broth on your skin. There really is no redeeming quality to this product. You know how they say there really is no cure for Rosacea? Well, you won&#x27;t find one here either. I know how it is. I wanted this product to be the one as well. I just don&#x27;t understand how companies can still market snake oil products like this. Total waste of your money.</li>
            <li> I would definately recommend this product to a friend. It works best when you use it daily. I apply mine twice a day and it works great.</li>
            <li> I am giving this product three stars because I think it may be reducing the flaking associated with my type of rosacea, but I have seen no decline in the redness on my skin. I am also a little concerned that it may be exacerbating the frequency of acne flares that I have, though I am giving it the benefit of the doubt on that for the moment. I have been battling this skin condition for years, and the acne flares have waxed and waned for far longer than I have been using this product. The best luck I have had with controlling that aspect of my rosacea is [[ASIN:B001TSJ26A Prosacea Rosacea Treatment Gel -- 0.75 oz]]but I do not have oily skin, and that can be drying, leading to flaky patches on my skin. This is a very frustrating condition, and I will continue to look for a better solution.</li>
            <li> I have only used this sparingly and intend to use it more in the future since I am using other products at this time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Burns skin and irritated even more.</li>
            <li> i have rosacea and very sensitive skin - was looking for something to calm it down and tone down the redness.  i just tested a little dab of this on one of my cheeks.  i knew within a few moments that it was not for me, it was burning my skin and I washed it off shortly after. Perhaps if I had left it on it would have done subsided and been beneficial, but I wasnt going to risk it.  My skin was very red and itchy in that spot for a few days afterwards.  I&#x27;m sure it works for some, but something in this product didn&#x27;t work well for my skin.  was worth a shot though right?!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t write many reviews because there just isn&#x27;t anything I usually love THAT much but this product has been a miracle cure for my 75 year old dad. He has suffered from what he calls \\&quot;bad skin\\&quot; his whole life, it is scaly, broke open and red/raised ALL the time. Nothing has ever helped and he just got home from the Dermatologist a week ago with another steroid cream &amp; lotion that did nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I found a tube of this on closeout somewhere about a year ago and forgot to give it to him until a few days ago and he called this morning to say his \\&quot;bad skin\\&quot; is nearly GONE. He was so upset to call the company and find out that they no longer carry the one thing that has worked in 75 years. Glad to see there are a few left on Amazon. Worth every penny to rid him of this affliction that has plagued him his ENTIRE life. Thank you Dermarest!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and quick shipment.</li>
