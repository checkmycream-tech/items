    <ol>
            <li>AND THIS IS THE BEST</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;After about three weeks of use, I can say without hesitation that this shaver gives me the best shave that I&#x27;ve ever found with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I am one happy customer!</li>
            <li>I was especially pleased by it being included in the Friday specials.   </li>
            <li>price I paid for this shaver is incredible! ...</li>
            <li>Awesome.</li>
            <li>This was one of the best purchases I ever made.  </li>
            <li>And the best part of all....</li>
            <li>This is a great buy guys!</li>
            <li>BUT I&#x27;m so impressed</li>
            <li>Just received yesterday, so I cannot attest to the longevity of this factory refurbished Braun shaver, but what I can say is that its the closest, best shave I have gotten from an electric.</li>
            <li>Works great!  </li>
            <li>While I still believe the closest shave is with a razor, (Mach 3 is awesome), for an electric shaver, the Braun 7505 is</li>
            <li>The Syncro gives the best shave I have ever got!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the best electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li>and it is still working great!</li>
            <li>Was a great deal at a great price!</li>
            <li>He has never felt so good against my face!</li>
            <li>Turned out to be a great buy.  </li>
            <li>Gives a great shave, but it takes a bit longer than the Norelco did.  </li>
            <li>Works great when plugged into AC but won&#x27;t function after about two days in cordless mode (won&#x27;t stay charged) w/normal use.</li>
            <li>Great great razor.</li>
            <li>The razor works great</li>
            <li>This shaver is great, it will not be leaving my home.</li>
            <li>Great shave.</li>
            <li>Great warranty.</li>
            <li>Great value.</li>
            <li>Apart from that it is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>This shaver works great.</li>
            <li>Great for the price.</li>
            <li>reconditoned shaver...is a great deal...</li>
            <li>For the money, the 7505 is a great value.</li>
            <li>yeah, it shaves great.  </li>
            <li>I was scared by the price, but heard it was great.</li>
            <li>There are also great perks to having a self cleaning razor.</li>
            <li>shave: shaves great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li>great construction,</li>
            <li>/&gt;Performance good, battery good, shaving best.</li>
            <li>I get a great, close shave, though it took me a couple of days to get really good results as I got the hang of shaving with an electric.</li>
            <li>Used it more than 10 years, very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy I did, what a close, comfortable shave, and a great deal to boot!</li>
            <li>I had at home pansonic shaver, which some how the feature wise looks not that good compared this, I am going to buy this and throw away  Pansonic</li>
            <li>It looks good, and feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Second, it does a good job of getting all of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>It is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li>I had a Braun before that I bought on sale at Sears in Canada, when the exchange rate was good.</li>
            <li>The Braun shave is maybe as good as the Norelco but the Norelco rotary heads</li>
            <li>I have been using Braun shavers for &gt; 25 years, &amp; this is just another step forward in improving a good product.  </li>
            <li>that the process included a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li>It feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>but this morning I was literally amazed at how good their technology has gotten in the interim.</li>
            <li>Excellent price, great shave, easy clean up and great battery power makes this reconditioned shaver a standout.</li>
            <li>However, it arrived in perfect condition (no way to tell from new) and has worked perfectly for more than two months now.</li>
            <li>no cuts and he just is so very pleased.  </li>
            <li>It is a great shaver, but again it is sealed so the battery would not be able to be changed.</li>
            <li>It shaves very smooth and leaves him with no stubble!</li>
            <li>and I have to say I am very pleased with the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li>Who needs the fancy cleaning accesories, you can do just as good a job on your own.  </li>
            <li>The shavor arrived in perfect condition, and I used it right out of the package.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am very impressed with this razor and would recommend it to anyone interested in trying an electric foil shaver.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful shave, very close, with no allergic reactions (unlike the rotary shavers, which are like taking sandpaper to my face!)</li>
            <li>An outstanding shaver!  </li>
            <li>Guys and girls will enjoy the results!!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic razor at a great price.</li>
            <li>Braun is the electric razor division of Gillette -- an amazing company that has dominated its sector for 100 years</li>
            <li>Always found Braun shavers to be the best at doing what there design to do, shave your face close and fast with minimum irritation.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to know when this was happening.  </li>
            <li>I used to get razor burn with the popular rotary 3 head brand, so I stopped using electric.</li>
            <li>I honestly dont see the need for it.</li>
            <li>Had Braun before and liked the quality.  </li>
            <li>great way to clean the shaver.&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li>At this price this is the best deal going for a high quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li>It arrived to me looking brand new and working great, and at a great price.  </li>
            <li>Like other reviewers it was in great condition and works perfect!</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found no electric razors work as good as a blade, but they&#x27;re convenient, and this one does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>great feel, still looks cool, easy to plug in and charge.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>it cost a trivial amount more than the Microscreen.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>The Norelco battery is much better.  </li>
            <li>And the fact that this is a factory reconditioned unit is not an issue at all-if I didn&#x27;t know this before I would have never been able to guess as the unit is in mint condition.</li>
            <li>I have been pleased with this razor except for one thing that  &lt;</li>
            <li>might not bother most men.  </li>
            <li>I have been able</li>
            <li>After a couple of years, I replaced the foil and cutter block for ~$20 (which should probably be done more often).</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am more than satisfied; I would buy a Braun again.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>I am fully confident in using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>again, a razor will be a better shave, but, you cant beat the convenience of an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I have a Norelco razor that I paid more for, but wanted another that I could keep in my desk at work.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfying result for me at a tremendous price.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice clean shave and I am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>The extendable cutter is really good at keeping sideburns clean, and the whole unit has a nice heft and feel to it, making it a pleasure to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The shaver gives a closer shave, in shorter time and with just as nice of a &amp;quot;look.&amp;quot;  WHile not as ergonomically pleasing, the Braun shaver is an attractive appliance, and I won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li>It works more than fine.</li>
            <li>However, the Norelco, not being rechargeable and not having a battery, is light weight, and better for travel.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly a good value in that you will pay considerably more for a new one.</li>
            <li>Other than books, this is my best amazon purchase to date!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think that would be a easy task the the Braun.  </li>
            <li>It shaves very smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li>Although the name says reconditioned, I found that the product worked as good as new.</li>
            <li>In fact, it looks to be in like-new good condition, with what seems to be a new foil head.  </li>
            <li>Still using product and works as good as new.</li>
            <li>It was about time to get a new razor, and this Braun for $45 was far and away the best value.</li>
            <li>My wife left my first one of these on our truck before a trip through the mountains, so I am very happy to find such a great deal on a replacement.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds a charge well, clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>Clean up is easy.</li>
            <li>, I was hesitant to buy this for my husband as he insists that he has to use a blade for a close shave, but he just loves this and his face is so smooth and</li>
            <li>A great value overall.</li>
            <li>I called the Braun toll free customer service number</li>
            <li>Currently I use a Panasonic 8003W shaver, which is a great shaver.</li>
            <li>Another advantage is that the sound is lower pitched.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean,</li>
            <li>tHIS IS A FAR SUPERIOR PRODUCT TO WHAT I WAS USING</li>
            <li>The Norelco does a fine job of capturing whiskers in the shaving head and keeping you clean.</li>
            <li>Very nice product, and it has held up well after several years of use now.</li>
            <li>and I was pretty happy with it, but it would frequently scratch my neck.</li>
            <li>Brush it clean and run it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li>Clean close shave.</li>
            <li>The Microscreen was a pain to clean, a pain to charge, and the biggest pain came from using it...</li>
            <li>but it was totally clean.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately, the motor noise doesn&#x27;t effect shaving ability, which is adequate.</li>
            <li>As quiet and more effective than the Norelco Quatro without spending money on lotion.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning cartridges last a good amount of time and are cheap to replace.</li>
            <li>My hubby enjoys the clean cut shave.</li>
            <li>It gives me such a good close shave my wife rubs my face and tells me \\&quot;Smooth as a babys ...\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>clean up: a cinch.</li>
            <li>i just followed the recommendation of another reviewer and i just blast  compressed air to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li>I recently tried the Grundig shaver - self proclaimed &amp;quot;The Best Shavers in the World.&amp;quot;  While a nice ergonomic shaver and one that did the job adequately, it is not a Braun.  </li>
            <li>WHAT I PAID FOR THE BRAUN.)A FULL CHARGE</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t save a whole lot of time, but it&#x27;s a neater and more efficient process.</li>
            <li>Very close shave, but not as close as the more pricer Panasonic models in the 8xxx series.</li>
            <li>This razor is extremely superior to my last razor (panasonic wet/dry).  </li>
            <li>The Factory-Reconditioned 7505 was such a good deal</li>
            <li>When I first got the shaver it seemed to have a STRONG motor and still does.</li>
            <li>I can finally say that I get a good, close, comfortable shave for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li>Lucky to have gotten this ... when Amazon had it on sale.</li>
            <li>The battery lasts long and I loved the fact that you can use the power cord also.  </li>
            <li>It was a great deal at less that half of the cost of a perfect new one.</li>
            <li>It gives a fast close shave and it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li>Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li>They were right.</li>
            <li>Well, this one came up as one of my Gold Box items and the price was right.</li>
            <li>because it&#x27;s neat, clean and fast.</li>
            <li>Evidently the Germans put more faith in their products than other nations.. :)</li>
            <li>This one is much more quiet and comfortable, although I&#x27;d like to find an electric shaver even more quiet.</li>
            <li>Although re-conditioned, it came as good as new (If, like one of the reviewers below, you discover dirt, etc - send it back for a replacement!)</li>
            <li>I checked many other websites but nowhere did I find such a good deal.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>Mine worked well the first couple of months, but now it blinks forever and never turns off.  </li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d look there first and found Amazon&#x27;s listing.</li>
            <li>If you are interested in trying a foil based shaver, this is the one to try.  </li>
            <li>First, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li>Extremely soft and smooth ..</li>
            <li>In this case I rather pay more and have the peace of mind that its only my bristles clogged in the machinery.</li>
            <li>My first Braun shaver (5000 series) lasted for 20 years so when it wore out (still shaved but trimer broke</li>
            <li>It is my understanding that the items that are reconditioned are the ones that never worked in the first place so they could not have been used by the consumer.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric shaver and there is no comparison with a razor.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s okay though, not a big deal.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely better than some of the second string brands (I&#x27;m thinking Remington and the like).</li>
            <li>My first was used till it wore out.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I looked it over with a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li>I have used it for over a year and have recently returned to Norelco, a much better product.</li>
            <li>WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I PLACED MY FIRST ORDER WITH YOU.&lt;BR</li>
            <li>HIS FIRST SHAVER, THE TIME FOR HIS FIRST</li>
            <li>The Norelco is now relegated to the desk, and I use this one to shave with on a more regular basis.  </li>
            <li>If you have a thick shave like I do, you will need your handy gillette shaver eventually, to do the fine cleaning under the chin.  </li>
            <li>Also - the shaver was very clean, no signs of prior use, just had the factory refurb sticker on it which I promptly pulled off.</li>
            <li>a full charge of the internal battery, this shaver will easily give me two weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easy to use, gives you a very close shave.</li>
            <li>Both seemed to do a very credible job, perhaps with a minor edge to the Braun.  </li>
            <li>The razor came quickly and looks and works like new.  </li>
            <li>The 7505 was indistinguishable from any new shaver, shaves as close as I got with the Microscreen AND a blade, is easy to clean, gives a &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; shave (doesn&#x27;t redeposit stubble on face), and after 3 weeks of ownership has yet to need to be charged (w/ daily use).  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t quite believe that I could buy a shaver normally retailing for $105 (current Best Buy price) for such a low price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also not nearly as convenient to clean as the Panasonic (which is a wet/dry shaver, so you can just run soapy water over it to clean</li>
            <li>I have used Norelco shavers for the past 33 years and thought they gave a good shave.</li>
            <li>one is definitely a &#x27;Keeper&#x27; and I highly recommend the Factory Reconditioned Braun 7505 Syncro Shaver to anyone who is looking for an outstanding men&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I purchased this electric about 1 year ago, still going strong and still using the same blades.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit on the large side, but works for me as I have large hands.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are true !!</li>
            <li>compressed air works fine enough for me.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR</li>
            <li>The shave is much closer than the Norelco and without irritation.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li>and I saved so much money buying it reconditioned.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely junk, will not buy anything from Braun the rest of my life.</li>
            <li>This razor works really well</li>
            <li>think the price has actually dropped since I purchased, this is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li>I cleaned the whole unit out with alcohol and tried it out.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It already was charged and ready to go, so I took it to the bathroom and gave it a test run.</li>
            <li>had been using a Norelco rotary and was curious which was better.  </li>
            <li>This model is much better than the several year old Braun shaver that I replaced it with.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric razors in the last ten years and they always pulled my hair, and I gave them up right away for a regular razor that was closer &amp; more comfortable.</li>
            <li>Braun will replace the cord under their 2 year warranty, but I don&#x27;t expect the new cord to hold up much longer than the first one.  </li>
            <li>The pop up hair trimmer easily takes care of long hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Love it and use it every other day.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s NiMh rechargable battery, which has no recharge memory like the NiCd battery that most other shavers have.</li>
            <li>Shaving with it the first time, I accidently scrapped the skin of my adams apple because of this unit is much bulkier than my old Braun Intergral 5414.</li>
            <li>Its motor runs MUCH faster, provider a faster shave overall, and the battery charge lasts longer (2 weeks!) and runs the motor at a very consistent pace.</li>
            <li>But even for [the non sale price] it&#x27;s not a bad deal, I&#x27;d just keep an eye open for a sale price, so check the Friday Sale to see if it happens!</li>
            <li>The head moves from side to side as well as up and down, so somehow that makes it more efficiant.</li>
            <li>Works just like a new one!</li>
            <li>I really believe it was new.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I find missing in this product is a elaborate user manual, which I guess will be available in a fully new pack.</li>
            <li>I decided to try the reconditioned 7505 mainly because of the price.</li>
            <li>The cleaner cartridges are costly and need to be changed more frequently than I expected.</li>
            <li>TODAY, I LOOKED AT WAL-MART TO SEE IF THEY HAD THIS PARTICULAR MODEL OF THE BRAUN 7505 SHAVER.  </li>
            <li>Battery life is good (although the lack of even a single measly low battery light is very cheap on Braun&#x27;s part).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>but then I guess normal guys do that</li>
            <li>I initially thought the pivoting head was a gimmick, but I found that it is actually a useful feature.</li>
            <li>It simply does not shave right</li>
            <li>Slight changes in the foil, &amp; the offset head, made it more comfortable &amp; easier to get into curves than previous models.  </li>
            <li>The unit I received looked brand new.</li>
            <li>It arrived in like new condition, no blems.</li>
            <li>I could not tell the difference between what I got and a new razor.</li>
            <li>Did not have to get my face use to the new Braun at all.  </li>
            <li>Mine arrived in brand new condition.  </li>
            <li>&gt;This factory re-conditioned shaver is like brand new and comes with a two year manufacturers warranty.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>My wife bought a new one and it is still going.</li>
            <li>It looked brand new to me.</li>
            <li>Braun battery lasts 2 weeks per charge when new.</li>
            <li>The thing came just like new.  </li>
            <li>When I took this razor out of the box I could not tell it from a brand new machine.  </li>
            <li>However Braun did provide a new blade and foil.</li>
            <li>Braun product was an inexpensive alternative to a brand new model -- I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;cleaning solution\\&quot; kit.  </li>
            <li>I received a new one from you today, so we shall see.</li>
            <li>It looked absolutly brand new.</li>
            <li>It looked bran spanking new.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this unit a new one (and I</li>
            <li>My facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow fast, so I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with shaving per se.  </li>
            <li>Not so great with longer, sparser whiskers on the neck, and nowhere near a match for a sharp blade, but way easier to get the job done vs. a blade while watching small kids or camping.  </li>
            <li>The daily cleaning system makes it feel brand new every time I use it, and the first foil lasted me 18 months.  </li>
            <li>It required fewer passes, and far less burn (and I had a good sharp blade on my 5520)</li>
            <li>big test was the first shave.  </li>
            <li>I believe in reconditioned products from experience, and this one is no different, highly recommended new or reconditioned, Thanks Amazon &amp; Braun....</li>
            <li>With my five year old Norelco overdue for replacement I went hunting for a new razor.</li>
            <li>&gt;The reconditioned unit looks and shaves like a new factory direct unit.&lt;BR&gt;Great price.</li>
            <li>This razor shaves as smooth as a blade in less time, cheaper, and without the nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li>although good value for the money, was getting tired of how long it took to shave and that it really didn&#x27;t shave all that close.  </li>
            <li>IS A FAR CLOSER AND FASTER SHAVE</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt the need to break out the old lather and razor since receiving this product.</li>
            <li>* soft case &lt;br /</li>
            <li>, it does not shave nearly as well as the old Norelco.</li>
            <li>My last Norelco has lasted about 5 years and was ready for replacement.</li>
            <li>but I bought it to replace my old flex integral which was stolen at a party</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t sent it back yet for another replacement because I have no confidence in getting another shaver that will have a reasonable life.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all.  </li>
            <li>Cuts the time it took me to shave with the Braun Flex nearly in 1/2.  </li>
            <li>I have charged it once and have been able to use it everyday for several weeks without recharging it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wanting an electric shaver for awhile, but the good ones are always so expensive.</li>
            <li>What I ordered and recieved was a mint, reconditioned shaver, perfectly clean, no hairs of some unknown soul present, all accessories, two year warranty, etc.</li>
            <li>After using Norelco and Remington electric shavers for several years, and not being satisfied with the shave, I broke down and bought the Braun last year along with the Self Cleaning accessory.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several electric razors in the past and most of them irritate my skin, leaving what looks like a rash.  </li>
            <li>The unit definitely was not in near brand new condition as some of the reviewers said.</li>
            <li>for about a third of the new price.  </li>
            <li>battery power: still relatively new, but this thing seems to last forever in between charges.</li>
            <li>I bought this \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; product after reading the reviews and need to say it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve used, as well as the least expensive.  </li>
            <li>Braun 7505 will last a long time if you methodically keep it clean, recharge the internal battery and replace the foil/cutter block after 18 months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>The refurbished 7505 not only saved me considerable money but its condition and operation could not be determined to be any different than a brand new one.</li>
            <li>For a military man that has to shave every day, this was a real life-saver.</li>
            <li>Compared to the old Panasonic shaver that I used years ago, which is why I despised electric shavers for over ten years, this machine is a gem.  </li>
            <li>The cleanup is the same old routine, but I can not see buying a shaver that has a cleaning stand/solution......</li>
            <li>The printing on the back has faded and some blemishes on the rubber bottom near the charging connector.</li>
            <li>I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing the reconditioned Braun.</li>
            <li>The problem is that this razor is too large to fit into the clean and charge base for the integral.  </li>
            <li>I more or less second the overall opinion expressed in the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>Its supposed to start blinking when the cleaning fluid gets low, and turn off completely after 4-5 days to make you change the cartridge.  </li>
            <li>I have an old worn out Braun that barely runs and still it shaves me with less passes than the new one.</li>
            <li>I have long known that Braun stands for quality, so I was surprised to a Braun shaver at this price.  </li>
            <li>other words, it was well worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li>I checked it carefully and it looks brand new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;First shave took less than 3 minutes and it felt like I used a straight razor ..</li>
            <li>I was a little concerned because people could shave certain body parts and stuff</li>
            <li>First of all, it takes a long time to shave and it leaves a big mess.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> AND THIS IS THE BEST</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;After about three weeks of use, I can say without hesitation that this shaver gives me the best shave that I&#x27;ve ever found with an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I am one happy customer!</li>
            <li> I was especially pleased by it being included in the Friday specials.   </li>
            <li> price I paid for this shaver is incredible! ...</li>
            <li> Awesome.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I ever made.  </li>
            <li> And the best part of all....</li>
            <li> This is a great buy guys!</li>
            <li> BUT I&#x27;m so impressed</li>
            <li> Just received yesterday, so I cannot attest to the longevity of this factory refurbished Braun shaver, but what I can say is that its the closest, best shave I have gotten from an electric.</li>
            <li> Works great!  </li>
            <li> While I still believe the closest shave is with a razor, (Mach 3 is awesome), for an electric shaver, the Braun 7505 is</li>
            <li> The Syncro gives the best shave I have ever got!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the best electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> and it is still working great!</li>
            <li> Was a great deal at a great price!</li>
            <li> He has never felt so good against my face!</li>
            <li> Turned out to be a great buy.  </li>
            <li> Gives a great shave, but it takes a bit longer than the Norelco did.  </li>
            <li> Works great when plugged into AC but won&#x27;t function after about two days in cordless mode (won&#x27;t stay charged) w/normal use.</li>
            <li> Great great razor.</li>
            <li> The razor works great</li>
            <li> This shaver is great, it will not be leaving my home.</li>
            <li> Great shave.</li>
            <li> Great warranty.</li>
            <li> Great value.</li>
            <li> Apart from that it is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great.</li>
            <li> Great for the price.</li>
            <li> reconditoned shaver...is a great deal...</li>
            <li> For the money, the 7505 is a great value.</li>
            <li> yeah, it shaves great.  </li>
            <li> I was scared by the price, but heard it was great.</li>
            <li> There are also great perks to having a self cleaning razor.</li>
            <li> shave: shaves great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> great construction,</li>
            <li> /&gt;Performance good, battery good, shaving best.</li>
            <li> I get a great, close shave, though it took me a couple of days to get really good results as I got the hang of shaving with an electric.</li>
            <li> Used it more than 10 years, very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy I did, what a close, comfortable shave, and a great deal to boot!</li>
            <li> I had at home pansonic shaver, which some how the feature wise looks not that good compared this, I am going to buy this and throw away  Pansonic</li>
            <li> It looks good, and feels good in my hand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, it does a good job of getting all of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I had a Braun before that I bought on sale at Sears in Canada, when the exchange rate was good.</li>
            <li> The Braun shave is maybe as good as the Norelco but the Norelco rotary heads</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun shavers for &gt; 25 years, &amp; this is just another step forward in improving a good product.  </li>
            <li> that the process included a good cleaning.  </li>
            <li> It feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> but this morning I was literally amazed at how good their technology has gotten in the interim.</li>
            <li> Excellent price, great shave, easy clean up and great battery power makes this reconditioned shaver a standout.</li>
            <li> However, it arrived in perfect condition (no way to tell from new) and has worked perfectly for more than two months now.</li>
            <li> no cuts and he just is so very pleased.  </li>
            <li> It is a great shaver, but again it is sealed so the battery would not be able to be changed.</li>
            <li> It shaves very smooth and leaves him with no stubble!</li>
            <li> and I have to say I am very pleased with the performance of this shaver.</li>
            <li> Who needs the fancy cleaning accesories, you can do just as good a job on your own.  </li>
            <li> The shavor arrived in perfect condition, and I used it right out of the package.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am very impressed with this razor and would recommend it to anyone interested in trying an electric foil shaver.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful shave, very close, with no allergic reactions (unlike the rotary shavers, which are like taking sandpaper to my face!)</li>
            <li> An outstanding shaver!  </li>
            <li> Guys and girls will enjoy the results!!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic razor at a great price.</li>
            <li> Braun is the electric razor division of Gillette -- an amazing company that has dominated its sector for 100 years</li>
            <li> Always found Braun shavers to be the best at doing what there design to do, shave your face close and fast with minimum irritation.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to know when this was happening.  </li>
            <li> I used to get razor burn with the popular rotary 3 head brand, so I stopped using electric.</li>
            <li> I honestly dont see the need for it.</li>
            <li> Had Braun before and liked the quality.  </li>
            <li> great way to clean the shaver.&lt;BR&gt;5.</li>
            <li> At this price this is the best deal going for a high quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li> It arrived to me looking brand new and working great, and at a great price.  </li>
            <li> Like other reviewers it was in great condition and works perfect!</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found no electric razors work as good as a blade, but they&#x27;re convenient, and this one does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> great feel, still looks cool, easy to plug in and charge.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> it cost a trivial amount more than the Microscreen.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> The Norelco battery is much better.  </li>
            <li> And the fact that this is a factory reconditioned unit is not an issue at all-if I didn&#x27;t know this before I would have never been able to guess as the unit is in mint condition.</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this razor except for one thing that  &lt;</li>
            <li> might not bother most men.  </li>
            <li> I have been able</li>
            <li> After a couple of years, I replaced the foil and cutter block for ~$20 (which should probably be done more often).</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am more than satisfied; I would buy a Braun again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I am fully confident in using it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> again, a razor will be a better shave, but, you cant beat the convenience of an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco razor that I paid more for, but wanted another that I could keep in my desk at work.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfying result for me at a tremendous price.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice clean shave and I am satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> The extendable cutter is really good at keeping sideburns clean, and the whole unit has a nice heft and feel to it, making it a pleasure to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The shaver gives a closer shave, in shorter time and with just as nice of a &amp;quot;look.&amp;quot;  WHile not as ergonomically pleasing, the Braun shaver is an attractive appliance, and I won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> It works more than fine.</li>
            <li> However, the Norelco, not being rechargeable and not having a battery, is light weight, and better for travel.  </li>
            <li> It is clearly a good value in that you will pay considerably more for a new one.</li>
            <li> Other than books, this is my best amazon purchase to date!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think that would be a easy task the the Braun.  </li>
            <li> It shaves very smoothly and quickly.</li>
            <li> Although the name says reconditioned, I found that the product worked as good as new.</li>
            <li> In fact, it looks to be in like-new good condition, with what seems to be a new foil head.  </li>
            <li> Still using product and works as good as new.</li>
            <li> It was about time to get a new razor, and this Braun for $45 was far and away the best value.</li>
            <li> My wife left my first one of these on our truck before a trip through the mountains, so I am very happy to find such a great deal on a replacement.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds a charge well, clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> Clean up is easy.</li>
            <li> , I was hesitant to buy this for my husband as he insists that he has to use a blade for a close shave, but he just loves this and his face is so smooth and</li>
            <li> A great value overall.</li>
            <li> I called the Braun toll free customer service number</li>
            <li> Currently I use a Panasonic 8003W shaver, which is a great shaver.</li>
            <li> Another advantage is that the sound is lower pitched.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean,</li>
            <li> tHIS IS A FAR SUPERIOR PRODUCT TO WHAT I WAS USING</li>
            <li> The Norelco does a fine job of capturing whiskers in the shaving head and keeping you clean.</li>
            <li> Very nice product, and it has held up well after several years of use now.</li>
            <li> and I was pretty happy with it, but it would frequently scratch my neck.</li>
            <li> Brush it clean and run it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Clean close shave.</li>
            <li> The Microscreen was a pain to clean, a pain to charge, and the biggest pain came from using it...</li>
            <li> but it was totally clean.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately, the motor noise doesn&#x27;t effect shaving ability, which is adequate.</li>
            <li> As quiet and more effective than the Norelco Quatro without spending money on lotion.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning cartridges last a good amount of time and are cheap to replace.</li>
            <li> My hubby enjoys the clean cut shave.</li>
            <li> It gives me such a good close shave my wife rubs my face and tells me \\&quot;Smooth as a babys ...\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> clean up: a cinch.</li>
            <li> i just followed the recommendation of another reviewer and i just blast  compressed air to clean the shaver.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Grundig shaver - self proclaimed &amp;quot;The Best Shavers in the World.&amp;quot;  While a nice ergonomic shaver and one that did the job adequately, it is not a Braun.  </li>
            <li> WHAT I PAID FOR THE BRAUN.)A FULL CHARGE</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t save a whole lot of time, but it&#x27;s a neater and more efficient process.</li>
            <li> Very close shave, but not as close as the more pricer Panasonic models in the 8xxx series.</li>
            <li> This razor is extremely superior to my last razor (panasonic wet/dry).  </li>
            <li> The Factory-Reconditioned 7505 was such a good deal</li>
            <li> When I first got the shaver it seemed to have a STRONG motor and still does.</li>
            <li> I can finally say that I get a good, close, comfortable shave for the first time in years.  </li>
            <li> Lucky to have gotten this ... when Amazon had it on sale.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts long and I loved the fact that you can use the power cord also.  </li>
            <li> It was a great deal at less that half of the cost of a perfect new one.</li>
            <li> It gives a fast close shave and it is easy to handle.</li>
            <li> Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> They were right.</li>
            <li> Well, this one came up as one of my Gold Box items and the price was right.</li>
            <li> because it&#x27;s neat, clean and fast.</li>
            <li> Evidently the Germans put more faith in their products than other nations.. :)</li>
            <li> This one is much more quiet and comfortable, although I&#x27;d like to find an electric shaver even more quiet.</li>
            <li> Although re-conditioned, it came as good as new (If, like one of the reviewers below, you discover dirt, etc - send it back for a replacement!)</li>
            <li> I checked many other websites but nowhere did I find such a good deal.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> Mine worked well the first couple of months, but now it blinks forever and never turns off.  </li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d look there first and found Amazon&#x27;s listing.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in trying a foil based shaver, this is the one to try.  </li>
            <li> First, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
            <li> Extremely soft and smooth ..</li>
            <li> In this case I rather pay more and have the peace of mind that its only my bristles clogged in the machinery.</li>
            <li> My first Braun shaver (5000 series) lasted for 20 years so when it wore out (still shaved but trimer broke</li>
            <li> It is my understanding that the items that are reconditioned are the ones that never worked in the first place so they could not have been used by the consumer.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and there is no comparison with a razor.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s okay though, not a big deal.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely better than some of the second string brands (I&#x27;m thinking Remington and the like).</li>
            <li> My first was used till it wore out.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I looked it over with a magnifying glass.</li>
            <li> I have used it for over a year and have recently returned to Norelco, a much better product.</li>
            <li> WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I PLACED MY FIRST ORDER WITH YOU.&lt;BR</li>
            <li> HIS FIRST SHAVER, THE TIME FOR HIS FIRST</li>
            <li> The Norelco is now relegated to the desk, and I use this one to shave with on a more regular basis.  </li>
            <li> If you have a thick shave like I do, you will need your handy gillette shaver eventually, to do the fine cleaning under the chin.  </li>
            <li> Also - the shaver was very clean, no signs of prior use, just had the factory refurb sticker on it which I promptly pulled off.</li>
            <li> a full charge of the internal battery, this shaver will easily give me two weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easy to use, gives you a very close shave.</li>
            <li> Both seemed to do a very credible job, perhaps with a minor edge to the Braun.  </li>
            <li> The razor came quickly and looks and works like new.  </li>
            <li> The 7505 was indistinguishable from any new shaver, shaves as close as I got with the Microscreen AND a blade, is easy to clean, gives a &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; shave (doesn&#x27;t redeposit stubble on face), and after 3 weeks of ownership has yet to need to be charged (w/ daily use).  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t quite believe that I could buy a shaver normally retailing for $105 (current Best Buy price) for such a low price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also not nearly as convenient to clean as the Panasonic (which is a wet/dry shaver, so you can just run soapy water over it to clean</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for the past 33 years and thought they gave a good shave.</li>
            <li> one is definitely a &#x27;Keeper&#x27; and I highly recommend the Factory Reconditioned Braun 7505 Syncro Shaver to anyone who is looking for an outstanding men&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric about 1 year ago, still going strong and still using the same blades.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit on the large side, but works for me as I have large hands.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are true !!</li>
            <li> compressed air works fine enough for me.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR</li>
            <li> The shave is much closer than the Norelco and without irritation.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> and I saved so much money buying it reconditioned.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely junk, will not buy anything from Braun the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> This razor works really well</li>
            <li> think the price has actually dropped since I purchased, this is a fantastic deal.</li>
            <li> I cleaned the whole unit out with alcohol and tried it out.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It already was charged and ready to go, so I took it to the bathroom and gave it a test run.</li>
            <li> had been using a Norelco rotary and was curious which was better.  </li>
            <li> This model is much better than the several year old Braun shaver that I replaced it with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric razors in the last ten years and they always pulled my hair, and I gave them up right away for a regular razor that was closer &amp; more comfortable.</li>
            <li> Braun will replace the cord under their 2 year warranty, but I don&#x27;t expect the new cord to hold up much longer than the first one.  </li>
            <li> The pop up hair trimmer easily takes care of long hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Love it and use it every other day.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s NiMh rechargable battery, which has no recharge memory like the NiCd battery that most other shavers have.</li>
            <li> Shaving with it the first time, I accidently scrapped the skin of my adams apple because of this unit is much bulkier than my old Braun Intergral 5414.</li>
            <li> Its motor runs MUCH faster, provider a faster shave overall, and the battery charge lasts longer (2 weeks!) and runs the motor at a very consistent pace.</li>
            <li> But even for [the non sale price] it&#x27;s not a bad deal, I&#x27;d just keep an eye open for a sale price, so check the Friday Sale to see if it happens!</li>
            <li> The head moves from side to side as well as up and down, so somehow that makes it more efficiant.</li>
            <li> Works just like a new one!</li>
            <li> I really believe it was new.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I find missing in this product is a elaborate user manual, which I guess will be available in a fully new pack.</li>
            <li> I decided to try the reconditioned 7505 mainly because of the price.</li>
            <li> The cleaner cartridges are costly and need to be changed more frequently than I expected.</li>
            <li> TODAY, I LOOKED AT WAL-MART TO SEE IF THEY HAD THIS PARTICULAR MODEL OF THE BRAUN 7505 SHAVER.  </li>
            <li> Battery life is good (although the lack of even a single measly low battery light is very cheap on Braun&#x27;s part).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> but then I guess normal guys do that</li>
            <li> I initially thought the pivoting head was a gimmick, but I found that it is actually a useful feature.</li>
            <li> It simply does not shave right</li>
            <li> Slight changes in the foil, &amp; the offset head, made it more comfortable &amp; easier to get into curves than previous models.  </li>
            <li> The unit I received looked brand new.</li>
            <li> It arrived in like new condition, no blems.</li>
            <li> I could not tell the difference between what I got and a new razor.</li>
            <li> Did not have to get my face use to the new Braun at all.  </li>
            <li> Mine arrived in brand new condition.  </li>
            <li> &gt;This factory re-conditioned shaver is like brand new and comes with a two year manufacturers warranty.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> My wife bought a new one and it is still going.</li>
            <li> It looked brand new to me.</li>
            <li> Braun battery lasts 2 weeks per charge when new.</li>
            <li> The thing came just like new.  </li>
            <li> When I took this razor out of the box I could not tell it from a brand new machine.  </li>
            <li> However Braun did provide a new blade and foil.</li>
            <li> Braun product was an inexpensive alternative to a brand new model -- I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;cleaning solution\\&quot; kit.  </li>
            <li> I received a new one from you today, so we shall see.</li>
            <li> It looked absolutly brand new.</li>
            <li> It looked bran spanking new.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this unit a new one (and I</li>
            <li> My facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow fast, so I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with shaving per se.  </li>
            <li> Not so great with longer, sparser whiskers on the neck, and nowhere near a match for a sharp blade, but way easier to get the job done vs. a blade while watching small kids or camping.  </li>
            <li> The daily cleaning system makes it feel brand new every time I use it, and the first foil lasted me 18 months.  </li>
            <li> It required fewer passes, and far less burn (and I had a good sharp blade on my 5520)</li>
            <li> big test was the first shave.  </li>
            <li> I believe in reconditioned products from experience, and this one is no different, highly recommended new or reconditioned, Thanks Amazon &amp; Braun....</li>
            <li> With my five year old Norelco overdue for replacement I went hunting for a new razor.</li>
            <li> &gt;The reconditioned unit looks and shaves like a new factory direct unit.&lt;BR&gt;Great price.</li>
            <li> This razor shaves as smooth as a blade in less time, cheaper, and without the nicks and cuts.</li>
            <li> although good value for the money, was getting tired of how long it took to shave and that it really didn&#x27;t shave all that close.  </li>
            <li> IS A FAR CLOSER AND FASTER SHAVE</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt the need to break out the old lather and razor since receiving this product.</li>
            <li> * soft case &lt;br /</li>
            <li> , it does not shave nearly as well as the old Norelco.</li>
            <li> My last Norelco has lasted about 5 years and was ready for replacement.</li>
            <li> but I bought it to replace my old flex integral which was stolen at a party</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t sent it back yet for another replacement because I have no confidence in getting another shaver that will have a reasonable life.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all.  </li>
            <li> Cuts the time it took me to shave with the Braun Flex nearly in 1/2.  </li>
            <li> I have charged it once and have been able to use it everyday for several weeks without recharging it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting an electric shaver for awhile, but the good ones are always so expensive.</li>
            <li> What I ordered and recieved was a mint, reconditioned shaver, perfectly clean, no hairs of some unknown soul present, all accessories, two year warranty, etc.</li>
            <li> After using Norelco and Remington electric shavers for several years, and not being satisfied with the shave, I broke down and bought the Braun last year along with the Self Cleaning accessory.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several electric razors in the past and most of them irritate my skin, leaving what looks like a rash.  </li>
            <li> The unit definitely was not in near brand new condition as some of the reviewers said.</li>
            <li> for about a third of the new price.  </li>
            <li> battery power: still relatively new, but this thing seems to last forever in between charges.</li>
            <li> I bought this \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; product after reading the reviews and need to say it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve used, as well as the least expensive.  </li>
            <li> Braun 7505 will last a long time if you methodically keep it clean, recharge the internal battery and replace the foil/cutter block after 18 months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The refurbished 7505 not only saved me considerable money but its condition and operation could not be determined to be any different than a brand new one.</li>
            <li> For a military man that has to shave every day, this was a real life-saver.</li>
            <li> Compared to the old Panasonic shaver that I used years ago, which is why I despised electric shavers for over ten years, this machine is a gem.  </li>
            <li> The cleanup is the same old routine, but I can not see buying a shaver that has a cleaning stand/solution......</li>
            <li> The printing on the back has faded and some blemishes on the rubber bottom near the charging connector.</li>
            <li> I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing the reconditioned Braun.</li>
            <li> The problem is that this razor is too large to fit into the clean and charge base for the integral.  </li>
            <li> I more or less second the overall opinion expressed in the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Its supposed to start blinking when the cleaning fluid gets low, and turn off completely after 4-5 days to make you change the cartridge.  </li>
            <li> I have an old worn out Braun that barely runs and still it shaves me with less passes than the new one.</li>
            <li> I have long known that Braun stands for quality, so I was surprised to a Braun shaver at this price.  </li>
            <li> other words, it was well worth the money spent.  </li>
            <li> I checked it carefully and it looks brand new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First shave took less than 3 minutes and it felt like I used a straight razor ..</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned because people could shave certain body parts and stuff</li>
            <li> First of all, it takes a long time to shave and it leaves a big mess.</li>
            <li> was disappointed that my Norelco triple-header (heavily advertised holiday gift) generally did NOT give me a great shave and moreover, the NickelCadmium battery that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge wasn&#x27;t replaceable.  </li>
            <li> This is the first razor (after trying at least 5) that has worked on my steel-wool beard.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to buy a \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; product, but this one looked completely new.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s loud, I have to shave 3 times longer to do the job than previous models of Braun I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> No mess, no fuss, and takes less time.</li>
            <li> technology has come a long way</li>
            <li> It will shave close, but it takes a long time to get to that point.</li>
            <li> I assume that the plastic parts that raise the trimmer will break soon, as usual, but I can live with that.  </li>
            <li> When I saw the reconditioned Braun for less than half the price of a new one in the store, I had to try it.</li>
            <li> It has been reconditioned by the factory, but I could not tell that it was not new.   </li>
            <li> It gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had without one single nick.</li>
            <li> gives a close shave and lasts forever on a single battery charge.</li>
            <li> It lasted over 3 weeks per charge for well over 7 years then started to dwindle down for then next three years.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Finally, on the subject of electric vs. blade shaving...if you are a daily blade shaver (as I am), don&#x27;t expect any electric shaver to replace your blade habit.</li>
            <li> It works very well, and the charge lasts approximately 7-8 days.  </li>
            <li> WHICH IS FEW FROM WHAT I SEE,  JUST CALL BRAUN FOR A REPLACEMENT, OR GO TO A LOCAL SERVICE PLACE</li>
            <li> After the shaver has dried, apply two drops of sewing machine oil(light machine oil) and run shaver for ten seconds.</li>
            <li> but they just make you run in circles from one service center to another.</li>
            <li> I simply pop the screen and run it for a few seconds, and brush/air-blow it once a week (all per the instructions).  </li>
            <li> Not much to complain about, it works well.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint is with the self cleaning accessory, and thats minor.  </li>
            <li> far as Braun shavers go, I have owned two previous models over the past 15 years, and this one beats both, hands down.</li>
            <li> I started looking at new shavers when I stumbled across a reconditioned Braun 7505 and figured I would give it a try, I could always put it the motorhome for occasional use if I was not impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure, but I think this is the only difference between this shaver and the 7526. &lt;br</li>
            <li> The other day the shaver ran out of power and would not recharge.</li>
            <li> First of all let me say that one of the other reviews that suggests that it has been used is wrong.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased several differant brands of rechargable and disposable shavers in the past.  </li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after reading other recommendations on this site, and I have not regretted it.</li>
            <li> Got tired of buying new blades all the time.  </li>
            <li> It cuts reasonably close (except on the neck, where it suffers the same problem as all foil shavers).</li>
            <li> HAS LASTED AT LEAST TEN DAYS OF SHAVING.IT</li>
            <li> The Braun produces a loud whining noise that I find irritating, though I think this is typical of foil razors.</li>
            <li> previous shaver was a triple head Norelco.  </li>
            <li> brush away the previous user&#x27;s hair particals but his after</li>
            <li> which is less susceptible to \\&quot;memory\\&quot; loss.  </li>
            <li> I shaved one half of my beard with the Norelco for 90 seconds and one half with the Braun.  </li>
            <li> I had cheap electrics given to me in my late teens that chewed my face up pretty bad, so I was wary.</li>
            <li> The closeness rivals a Gilette Mach 3 shave, but without the mess or \\&quot;burn\\&quot; on the neck and chin.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a gift - asked my friend for this since I felt that the new one was too expensive.</li>
            <li> Just want to establish that this company knows, and cares deeply, about the science of cutting facial hair.</li>
            <li> The shave itself is terrific; I have not scratched myself once in approximately 4 weeks of use, and the shave is closer that the Norelco.</li>
            <li> The battery was soldered in, so I decided that it was too much trouble to try and find the battery at Radio Shack and solder one in, so I bought the 7505 Syncro.</li>
            <li> and it would not hold a charge)I wasted no time in ordering another one.</li>
            <li> The foil shavers I have used in the past have a problem with missing hairs.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the idea of a reconditioned product, but I wanted to save the [$] off the new price and risked it.</li>
            <li> My last Braun - the 5520 Flex Integral - lasted 8 years, and I was sad to see it go -</li>
            <li> Although reconditioned, you would hardly know it.  </li>
            <li> Although it is reconditioned it is hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> The shave is close, and the power has lasted at least two weeks between charge.  </li>
            <li> It holds a charge for at least a week.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard but tender skin; this shaver shaves me close without irritating my skin.  </li>
            <li> A few faint scratches.</li>
            <li> Not nearly as good as the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I stopped using electric shavers because I was disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> I feel like I discovered a secret find with this product.  </li>
            <li> I assumed that they&#x27;d make the same base for both razors</li>
            <li> problem is the power supply cord is poorly designed.</li>
            <li> But not great.</li>
            <li> I tried to work with Braun expecting maybe a mal function as it is hard to believe this device can be so bad</li>
            <li> Between the 7000 and 8000 series you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase</li>
            <li> It also gave a lousy shave, and I&#x27;d have to shave with a blade after shaving with the Microscreen.&lt;BR&gt;</li>
            <li> And repair shops are having a difficult time getting replacement motors.  </li>
            <li> But, sorry, Panasonic has it beat.&lt;br /&gt;dap</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is the \\&quot;synchro\\&quot; motion of the cutting head or the combination of cutters on the head, but I&#x27;m not having this issue with this razor.</li>
            <li> The battery died and it was very difficult to take apart, but I did.</li>
            <li> Bad move on my part</li>
            <li> They just had a bad connection etc.  </li>
            <li> 7505 isn&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed ever since I got this in Jan 2005.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.</li>
            <li> So besides a crap product also terribe customer service.</li>
            <li> but i guess the synchro&#x27;s base is taller.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it and use it every other day. Replaced blade once a year and this product (although refurbished) is still ticking and working properly.</li>
            <li> After using Norelco and Remington electric shavers for several years, and not being satisfied with the shave, I broke down and bought the Braun last year along with the Self Cleaning accessory.  I can finally say that I get a good, close, comfortable shave for the first time in years.  It works very well, and the charge lasts approximately 7-8 days.  The only complaint is with the self cleaning accessory, and thats minor.  Its supposed to start blinking when the cleaning fluid gets low, and turn off completely after 4-5 days to make you change the cartridge.  Mine worked well the first couple of months, but now it blinks forever and never turns off.  So, when it starts blinking I simply replace the cartridge immediately.</li>
            <li> I had at home pansonic shaver, which some how the feature wise looks not that good compared this, I am going to buy this and throw away  Pansonic one.&lt;BR&gt;Raju</li>
            <li> I have been a Norelco user for the last 15 years. I decided to try the reconditioned 7505 mainly because of the price. The shave is much closer than the Norelco and without irritation.&lt;BR&gt;The unit I received looked brand new. I could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> fOR THOSE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE PRODUCT PLEASE STOP!!  tHIS IS A FAR SUPERIOR PRODUCT TO WHAT I WAS USING WHICH WAS A REMINGTON 2830 INTERCEPTOR,(WHICH BY THE WAY COST OVER 4 TIMES WHAT I PAID FOR THE BRAUN.)A FULL CHARGE HAS LASTED AT LEAST TEN DAYS OF SHAVING.IT IS A FAR CLOSER AND FASTER SHAVE THAN I AM USED TOO.  I HAVE ALWAY USED ELECTRIC SHAVERS AND THIS IS THE BEST IVE OWED TO DATE. AND DID YOU SEE THE PRICE???? FOR THOSE HAVING PROBLEMS WHICH IS FEW FROM WHAT I SEE,  JUST CALL BRAUN FOR A REPLACEMENT, OR GO TO A LOCAL SERVICE PLACE THEY WILL SEND IT FOR FREE.DID I MENTION THE PRICE FOR THIS??? - B</li>
            <li> The shavor arrived in perfect condition, and I used it right out of the package. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After about three weeks of use, I can say without hesitation that this shaver gives me the best shave that I&#x27;ve ever found with an electric shaver. I haven&#x27;t felt the need to break out the old lather and razor since receiving this product. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It holds a charge well, clean up is easy. It looks good, and feels good in my hand. Very satisfying result for me at a tremendous price.</li>
            <li> Always found Braun shavers to be the best at doing what there design to do, shave your face close and fast with minimum irritation. Between the 7000 and 8000 series you can&#x27;t go wrong. Price was my deciding factor.</li>
            <li> This is the first razor (after trying at least 5) that has worked on my steel-wool beard.  The daily cleaning system makes it feel brand new every time I use it, and the first foil lasted me 18 months.  My wife left my first one of these on our truck before a trip through the mountains, so I am very happy to find such a great deal on a replacement.  For a military man that has to shave every day, this was a real life-saver.</li>
            <li> I recently tried the Grundig shaver - self proclaimed &amp;quot;The Best Shavers in the World.&amp;quot;  While a nice ergonomic shaver and one that did the job adequately, it is not a Braun.  I grew up usinga  Braun shaver but wanted to try out the GRundig to compare.  It&#x27;s just not the same.  So, I am now back to Braun.  The shaver gives a closer shave, in shorter time and with just as nice of a &amp;quot;look.&amp;quot;  WHile not as ergonomically pleasing, the Braun shaver is an attractive appliance, and I won&#x27;t go back!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a couple of electric razors in the last ten years and they always pulled my hair, and I gave them up right away for a regular razor that was closer &amp; more comfortable. When I saw the reconditioned Braun for less than half the price of a new one in the store, I had to try it. I&#x27;m really happy I did, what a close, comfortable shave, and a great deal to boot! I believe in reconditioned products from experience, and this one is no different, highly recommended new or reconditioned, Thanks Amazon &amp; Braun....</li>
            <li> I have tried several electric razors over the years.  They all seemed to eat my face.  This one was recommended by my brother-inlaw.  He paid about 100.00 for his.  Mine was 44.99.  What a deal.  It arrived in like new condition, no blems. I recommend this razor to all.</li>
            <li> After 20 years of scraping a razor across my face I decided to give an electric razor a whirl. I had cheap electrics given to me in my late teens that chewed my face up pretty bad, so I was wary. My dad uses a Braun so I figured I&#x27;d look there first and found Amazon&#x27;s listing. I compared them all and the combination of price and reviews caused me to decide on the reconditioned 7505. I wasn&#x27;t crazy about the idea of a reconditioned product, but I wanted to save the [$] off the new price and risked it. I am one happy customer! I&#x27;ve used the razor for just over two weeks now on the initial charge. I was worried about the two or three weeks of face adjustment time you hear so often about. No problem there. All that neck irritation and redness every morning is gone. I get a great, close shave, though it took me a couple of days to get really good results as I got the hang of shaving with an electric. Clean up is easy. I don&#x27;t save a whole lot of time, but it&#x27;s a neater and more efficient process. The razor arrived in mint shape. I could not tell the difference between what I got and a new razor. This is a fantastic razor at a great price.</li>
            <li> I feel like I discovered a secret find with this product.  It arrived to me looking brand new and working great, and at a great price.  I was a little hesitant to buy a \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; product, but this one looked completely new.  Additionally, this shaver was a big improvement over a basic model Braun I had before.  This one is much more quiet and comfortable, although I&#x27;d like to find an electric shaver even more quiet.</li>
            <li> If you are interested in trying a foil based shaver, this is the one to try.  It has been reconditioned by the factory, but I could not tell that it was not new.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The box included: &lt;br /&gt;* shaver &lt;br /&gt;* charging cord &lt;br /&gt;* cleaning brush &lt;br /&gt;* soft case &lt;br /&gt;* manual &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I like this razor for two reasons.  First, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I have tried several electric razors in the past and most of them irritate my skin, leaving what looks like a rash.  This is even after several weeks of adjusting to the electric shave.  This razor didn&#x27;t do that. &lt;br /&gt;Second, it does a good job of getting all of the hairs.  The foil shavers I have used in the past have a problem with missing hairs.  I don&#x27;t know if it is the \\&quot;synchro\\&quot; motion of the cutting head or the combination of cutters on the head, but I&#x27;m not having this issue with this razor. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only shortcoming I would like to mention is the lack of any sort of \\&quot;low charge\\&quot; type indicator.  It would be nice to know when this was happening.  I&#x27;m not sure, but I think this is the only difference between this shaver and the 7526. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very impressed with this razor and would recommend it to anyone interested in trying an electric foil shaver.  It is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Quit using a Norelco about 3 years ago and switched to a regular razor with blades. Got tired of buying new blades all the time.  I saw the reconditioned Braun and figured at the price I could give it a try.  Turned out to be a great buy.  I also purchased some \\&quot;shaving oil\\&quot; instead of \\&quot;pre-shave\\&quot;.  No shaving burn!!!  Did not have to get my face use to the new Braun at all.  Gives a great shave, but it takes a bit longer than the Norelco did.  The only draw back is that I could shave while driving the car with the Norelco and I don&#x27;t think that would be a easy task the the Braun.  I find with the Braun that I have to shave in front of the mirror, but then I guess normal guys do that anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about the idea of \\&quot;Factory-Reconditioned\\&quot;, don&#x27;t.  Mine arrived in brand new condition.  Arrived like they said it would and worked like they said.  Was a great deal at a great price!</li>
            <li> Works great when plugged into AC but won&#x27;t function after about two days in cordless mode (won&#x27;t stay charged) w/normal use.</li>
            <li> Lucky to have gotten this ... when Amazon had it on sale. Wonderful shave, very close, with no allergic reactions (unlike the rotary shavers, which are like taking sandpaper to my face!) But even for [the non sale price] it&#x27;s not a bad deal, I&#x27;d just keep an eye open for a sale price, so check the Friday Sale to see if it happens!</li>
            <li> Hello All,&lt;br /&gt;after reading some of the glowing and not-so-glowing reviews, I decided to try the Braun 7505.  I was especially pleased by it being included in the Friday specials.   What I ordered and recieved was a mint, reconditioned shaver, perfectly clean, no hairs of some unknown soul present, all accessories, two year warranty, etc. for about a third of the new price.  This alone is a sign of a quality item.  TV&#x27;s have a 90 day warranty, but a shaver with a two year warranty?  Evidently the Germans put more faith in their products than other nations.. :)&lt;br /&gt;The big test was the first shave.  Compared to the old Panasonic shaver that I used years ago, which is why I despised electric shavers for over ten years, this machine is a gem.  The closeness rivals a Gilette Mach 3 shave, but without the mess or \\&quot;burn\\&quot; on the neck and chin.  The cleanup is the same old routine, but I can not see buying a shaver that has a cleaning stand/solution......Brush it clean and run it again and again.&lt;br /&gt;In other words, it was well worth the money spent.  Thank you Amazon.com and Braun.&lt;br /&gt;Dustin</li>
            <li> .&lt;BR&gt;This factory re-conditioned shaver is like brand new and comes with a two year manufacturers warranty.&lt;br /&gt;The price I paid for this shaver is incredible! ... Thank you Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;First shave took less than 3 minutes and it felt like I used a straight razor .. Extremely soft and smooth .. with no nicks&lt;BR&gt;or tiny scratches.  I do not even need to use an electric razor pre-shave lotion or gel on my face. &lt;br /&gt;With a full charge of the internal battery, this shaver will easily give me two weeks of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is easy to use, gives you a very close shave. The pop up hair trimmer easily takes care of long hair.&lt;br /&gt;The Braun 7505 will last a long time if you methodically keep it clean, recharge the internal battery and replace the foil/cutter block after 18 months of daily use.&lt;br /&gt;This one is definitely a &#x27;Keeper&#x27; and I highly recommend the Factory Reconditioned Braun 7505 Syncro Shaver to anyone who is looking for an outstanding men&#x27;s electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I had no second thoughts about buying a refurbished shaver. The shaver comes spotless from Amazon. &lt;br /&gt;  I keep my shaver cleaned and lubricated without the clean-and-charge stand. I put 90% rubbing alcohol in a sealable plastic container-with the shaver unplugged,put the shaver head on the surface of the alcohol, then tilt one side of the shaver head one-quarter of an inch into the alcohol(just like the shaver icon at the bottom of the shaver). The cleaning process only takes a minute! Take the foil off of the shaver to dry-plug in for recharge if needed. After the shaver has dried, apply two drops of sewing machine oil(light machine oil) and run shaver for ten seconds. Do this process once a week along with occasional cleaning with the cleaning brush and your shaver&#x27;s foil and cutterblock should last longer than you would expect!        Ken C.</li>
            <li> Although the name says reconditioned, I found that the product worked as good as new. The only thing I find missing in this product is a elaborate user manual, which I guess will be available in a fully new pack. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Performance good, battery good, shaving best.</li>
            <li> Refurbished model, battery died in one year. My wife bought a new one and it is still going. Very close shave, but not as close as the more pricer Panasonic models in the 8xxx series.</li>
            <li> Clean close shave. Awesome. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Why would anyone buy a factory-reconditioned Shaver? U must be out of your mind to use something that has come into contact with someone else&#x27;s bristles.&lt;br /&gt;Yeech. In this case I rather pay more and have the peace of mind that its only my bristles clogged in the machinery.</li>
            <li> What a bargain.  This shaver works so well, I was hesitant to buy this for my husband as he insists that he has to use a blade for a close shave, but he just loves this and his face is so smooth and no cuts and he just is so very pleased.  Great great razor.</li>
            <li> With my five year old Norelco overdue for replacement I went hunting for a new razor. Based upon the reviews given this razor, and the price, I decided to give it a try. Bad move on my part, it does not shave nearly as well as the old Norelco. I will never make the mistake of buying a Braun again.</li>
            <li> This was one of the best purchases I ever made.  The razor works great and I saved so much money buying it reconditioned.  The razor came quickly and looks and works like new.  The battery lasts long and I loved the fact that you can use the power cord also.  This razor is extremely superior to my last razor (panasonic wet/dry).  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this purchase</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco shavers for the past 33 years and thought they gave a good shave. My last Norelco has lasted about 5 years and was ready for replacement. I started looking at new shavers when I stumbled across a reconditioned Braun 7505 and figured I would give it a try, I could always put it the motorhome for occasional use if I was not impressed. This shaver is great, it will not be leaving my home. Instead I will purshase another for the motorhome. &lt;BR&gt;The reconditioned unit looks and shaves like a new factory direct unit.&lt;BR&gt;Great price. Great shave. Great warranty. Great value. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this deal. I had used a Norelco for about 4 years and I was pretty happy with it, but it would frequently scratch my neck. It was about time to get a new razor, and this Braun for $45 was far and away the best value. I checked it carefully and it looks brand new. The shave itself is terrific; I have not scratched myself once in approximately 4 weeks of use, and the shave is closer that the Norelco. The charge seems to last forever also, as I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet. I definitely recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t quite believe that I could buy a shaver normally retailing for $105 (current Best Buy price) for such a low price. However, it arrived in perfect condition (no way to tell from new) and has worked perfectly for more than two months now. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy a factory reconditioned unit. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;As far as Braun shavers go, I have owned two previous models over the past 15 years, and this one beats both, hands down. Its motor runs MUCH faster, provider a faster shave overall, and the battery charge lasts longer (2 weeks!) and runs the motor at a very consistent pace. It&#x27;s a bit on the large side, but works for me as I have large hands. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Finally, on the subject of electric vs. blade shaving...if you are a daily blade shaver (as I am), don&#x27;t expect any electric shaver to replace your blade habit. I use it when traveling...which is a lot...because it&#x27;s neat, clean and fast. I also use it for \\&quot;quickie\\&quot; shaves on weekends or before going out. But for a close shave with no compromises (ie., those neck whiskers!) there&#x27;s nothing like a blade.</li>
            <li> This is my third Braun. I had a Braun before that I bought on sale at Sears in Canada, when the exchange rate was good. The battery died and it was very difficult to take apart, but I did. The battery was soldered in, so I decided that it was too much trouble to try and find the battery at Radio Shack and solder one in, so I bought the 7505 Syncro. It is a great shaver, but again it is sealed so the battery would not be able to be changed. Apart from that it is a great shaver. It gives a fast close shave and it is easy to handle. I am pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Braun - truly a mark of excellence and quality.</li>
            <li> Absolutely junk, will not buy anything from Braun the rest of my life. It simply does not shave right and it turns shaving in a torture session. I tried to work with Braun expecting maybe a mal function as it is hard to believe this device can be so bad but they just make you run in circles from one service center to another. So besides a crap product also terribe customer service. Save your money and buy a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift - asked my friend for this since I felt that the new one was too expensive. I have not been disappointed ever since I got this in Jan 2005. I use it to shave my head about twice a week, and I have yet to replace the cutter or the foil. A great value overall. Works just like a new one!</li>
            <li> Used it more than 10 years, very satisfied!!!</li>
            <li> An outstanding shaver!  Before I got this, I used a Remington Microscreen 1, and after shaving with the Microscreen I&#x27;d go over my face with a blade.  The Microscreen was a pain to clean, a pain to charge, and the biggest pain came from using it... the Microscreen seemed to grind and pull out stubble, then deposit the stubble back on my face.  It also gave a lousy shave, and I&#x27;d have to shave with a blade after shaving with the Microscreen.&lt;BR&gt;But enough about the Microscreen, I replaced it with the reconditioned 7505 and now I can throw my blades away.  The 7505 was indistinguishable from any new shaver, shaves as close as I got with the Microscreen AND a blade, is easy to clean, gives a &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot; shave (doesn&#x27;t redeposit stubble on face), and after 3 weeks of ownership has yet to need to be charged (w/ daily use).  And the best part of all.... it cost a trivial amount more than the Microscreen.&lt;BR&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This razor works really well but I bought it to replace my old flex integral which was stolen at a party (yeah i know, who steals a friggin razor?).  The problem is that this razor is too large to fit into the clean and charge base for the integral.  I assumed that they&#x27;d make the same base for both razors but i guess the synchro&#x27;s base is taller.  Annoying but still a great razor.</li>
            <li> This shaver works great. I used to get razor burn with the popular rotary 3 head brand, so I stopped using electric. I do not get any razor burn with this razor. Although not as close as a blade, it is close enough for me. The battery lasts for weeks before needing a recharge. It was a great deal at less that half of the cost of a perfect new one. Factory reconditioned? It looked brand new to me.</li>
            <li> Although reconditioned, you would hardly know it.  A few faint scratches. Great for the price. Works terrific.  Charge lasts a week.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy guys! Although it is reconditioned it is hardly noticeable. I checked many other websites but nowhere did I find such a good deal.&lt;BR&gt;If you don&#x27;t mind reconditioned items.</li>
            <li> I have had this Braun 7505 shaver for about nine months.  It gives a nice clean shave and I am satisfied with its performance. This model is much better than the several year old Braun shaver that I replaced it with. &lt;br /&gt;The problem is the power supply cord is poorly designed. The other day the shaver ran out of power and would not recharge. I called the Braun toll free customer service number and we concluded that the cord was probably the problem. Braun will replace the cord under their 2 year warranty, but I don&#x27;t expect the new cord to hold up much longer than the first one.  &lt;br /&gt;The reconditoned shaver...is a great deal...</li>
            <li> I have long known that Braun stands for quality, so I was surprised to a Braun shaver at this price.  I wasn&#x27;t disappointed. I have a heavy beard but tender skin; this shaver shaves me close without irritating my skin.  I&#x27;d buy another from Amazon in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I received this shaver in June, 2004.  It quit working in August, 2004.  I sent it back to the factory and received a replacement in September, 2004.  This second shaver quit working in December, 2004.  I haven&#x27;t sent it back yet for another replacement because I have no confidence in getting another shaver that will have a reasonable life.  I intend to make a claim to get my money back to buy a Norelco. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver was a triple head Norelco.  The Braun shave is maybe as good as the Norelco but the Norelco rotary heads provide a quicker shave with fewer passes.  The Norelco battery is much better.  It lasted over 3 weeks per charge for well over 7 years then started to dwindle down for then next three years. &lt;br /&gt;The Braun battery lasts 2 weeks per charge when new. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I have been using Braun shavers for &gt; 25 years, &amp; this is just another step forward in improving a good product.  The \\&quot;factory reconditioned\\&quot; shaver had the slightest handling scuffs, but inspection of the blades showed it had never touched a face.  Slight changes in the foil, &amp; the offset head, made it more comfortable &amp; easier to get into curves than previous models.  And, the cord/cordless feature means that I won&#x27;t have to throw it away when the battery pack dies after 2 years like my last one.  (There&#x27;s no point in paying $50 to replace a battery pack.)  I assume that the plastic parts that raise the trimmer will break soon, as usual, but I can live with that.  I don&#x27;t need the fancy self-cleaning tray or shave lube dispenser of the more expensive models, I just want the basics.  For the money, the 7505 is a great value.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are true !! This razor shaves as smooth as a blade in less time, cheaper, and without the nicks and cuts. And the fact that this is a factory reconditioned unit is not an issue at all-if I didn&#x27;t know this before I would have never been able to guess as the unit is in mint condition. Who needs the fancy cleaning accesories, you can do just as good a job on your own.  At this price this is the best deal going for a high quality electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric about 1 year ago, still going strong and still using the same blades.  The thing came just like new.  I was a little concerned because people could shave certain body parts and stuff but it was totally clean.  I really believe it was new.  No hair, scratches, anything out of place. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I think the price has actually dropped since I purchased, this is a fantastic deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, it shaves great.  I can&#x27;t believe I struggled with traditional razors for all of these years.</li>
            <li> My first Braun shaver (5000 series) lasted for 20 years so when it wore out (still shaved but trimer broke and it would not hold a charge)I wasted no time in ordering another one. The refurbished 7505 not only saved me considerable money but its condition and operation could not be determined to be any different than a brand new one. If you want to use an electric shaver Braun is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> When I first got the shaver it seemed to have a STRONG motor and still does. However it rattles, it&#x27;s loud, I have to shave 3 times longer to do the job than previous models of Braun I&#x27;ve owned. I have an old worn out Braun that barely runs and still it shaves me with less passes than the new one. I even have the CLEANER set up for it. The cleaner cartridges are costly and need to be changed more frequently than I expected. Anyway, I AM a Braun fan and always will be but I think this one needs some work!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd reconditioned appliance and have to say it is the only way to go.  First of all let me say that one of the other reviews that suggests that it has been used is wrong.  It is my understanding that the items that are reconditioned are the ones that never worked in the first place so they could not have been used by the consumer.  They just had a bad connection etc.  When I took this razor out of the box I could not tell it from a brand new machine.  A terrific bargain!</li>
            <li> Hold on to your warranty.  The manufacturer has has a lot of problems with the motor.  You will know you have a problem when it starts sounding like it is about to fall apart.  And repair shops are having a difficult time getting replacement motors.  I&#x27;ve waited for three months for a replacement motor.  Fortunately, the motor noise doesn&#x27;t effect shaving ability, which is adequate.</li>
            <li> I received my reconditioned Braun syncho 7505 two days ago. Someone in my office brought me the package and it was something vibrating inside, I found out that a rubber band was wrapped around the lock button and the unit was on! I was wondering if it vibrated all the way from it&#x27;s shipping point. The unit definitely was not in near brand new condition as some of the reviewers said. The printing on the back has faded and some blemishes on the rubber bottom near the charging connector. However Braun did provide a new blade and foil. I like the Syncho 7505 because of it&#x27;s NiMh rechargable battery, which has no recharge memory like the NiCd battery that most other shavers have. I cleaned the whole unit out with alcohol and tried it out. Shaving with it the first time, I accidently scrapped the skin of my adams apple because of this unit is much bulkier than my old Braun Intergral 5414. It did give a closer shave than the 5414 which the battery is dying and can only hold a charge for about 4 shaves. Anyway, I&#x27;m keeping this shaver because of it&#x27;s bargain price.</li>
            <li> My favoriate shaver broke a year ago, So I went out and bought a remington. Big mistake. Based on the reccomendations I grab this one. Like other reviewers it was in great condition and works perfect! Other than books, this is my best amazon purchase to date!</li>
            <li> I have been pleased with this razor except for one thing that  &lt;br /&gt;probably might not bother most men.  It is reconditioned and I &lt;br /&gt;wish that the process included a good cleaning.  I have been able &lt;br /&gt;to brush away the previous user&#x27;s hair particals but his after &lt;br /&gt;shave lotion or shaver cleaning fluid remains no matter what I &lt;br /&gt;do.  So, I will just put up with what I consider an objectional smell and continue to use the shaver.  But I will never buy a reconditioned Braun shaver again.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Braun is the electric razor division of Gillette -- an amazing company that has dominated its sector for 100 years (No, I&#x27;m not an employee or stockholder).  Just want to establish that this company knows, and cares deeply, about the science of cutting facial hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed that my Norelco triple-header (heavily advertised holiday gift) generally did NOT give me a great shave and moreover, the NickelCadmium battery that couldn&#x27;t hold a charge wasn&#x27;t replaceable.  That&#x27;s all I needed to know. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This Braun product was an inexpensive alternative to a brand new model -- I don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;cleaning solution\\&quot; kit.  It works more than fine. I used to get \\&quot;razor bumps\\&quot; and ingrown hairs with the Norelco.  The battery is NickelMetalHydrid which is less susceptible to \\&quot;memory\\&quot; loss.  After a couple of years, I replaced the foil and cutter block for ~$20 (which should probably be done more often). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am more than satisfied; I would buy a Braun again.</li>
            <li> The shaver was faulty.  I charged it when I got it.  Then it required recharging after two two minute uses.  The same thing happened again, and I called you.  I received a new one from you today, so we shall see.</li>
            <li> I hesitate to write the 45th (or so) review of this product BUT I&#x27;m so impressed I feel I must!  I&#x27;d been using the Braun Flex 5775 and, although good value for the money, was getting tired of how long it took to shave and that it really didn&#x27;t shave all that close.  I bought this \\&quot;reconditioned\\&quot; product after reading the reviews and need to say it is the best shaver I&#x27;ve used, as well as the least expensive.  Closeness rivals a blade.  As quiet and more effective than the Norelco Quatro without spending money on lotion.  Faster, closer shave (and a lot quieter)than the Panasonic Linear model.  I have sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all.  Cuts the time it took me to shave with the Braun Flex nearly in 1/2.  And I like that it is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shaver...I simply pop the screen and run it for a few seconds, and brush/air-blow it once a week (all per the instructions).  Although re-conditioned, it came as good as new (If, like one of the reviewers below, you discover dirt, etc - send it back for a replacement!) I almost want to get two to keep one in reserve!</li>
            <li> This is my first electric shaver and there is no comparison with a razor. First of all, it takes a long time to shave and it leaves a big mess. If you have a thick shave like I do, you will need your handy gillette shaver eventually, to do the fine cleaning under the chin.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am going back to my gillette shaver.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this refurb shaver for almost two months.  The shave is close, and the power has lasted at least two weeks between charge.  My facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow fast, so I don&#x27;t have much of a problem with shaving per se.  The motor is silent.  Not much to complain about, it works well.  The only thing I would have preferred for it to be was washable under water.  That&#x27;s okay though, not a big deal.  Recommended for the low price.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver for my boyfriend about 2 years ago, and let me tell you... You get what you pay for! I was scared by the price, but heard it was great. They were right. He has never felt so good against my face! It shaves very smooth and leaves him with no stubble! There are also great perks to having a self cleaning razor. He just pops it in and there it goes! The cleaning cartridges last a good amount of time and are cheap to replace. Guys and girls will enjoy the results!!</li>
            <li> I bought one of these on a lark, given the low price promotion Amazon had on the reconditioned version...Currently I use a Panasonic 8003W shaver, which is a great shaver. By comparison, the 7505 is...well..good. But not great. Not nearly as good as the Panasonic. It doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close and it takes somewhat longer to get a comparable shave. It&#x27;s also not nearly as convenient to clean as the Panasonic (which is a wet/dry shaver, so you can just run soapy water over it to clean it).&lt;br /&gt;The 7505 isn&#x27;t bad. It cuts reasonably close (except on the neck, where it suffers the same problem as all foil shavers). It feels good in your hand. Battery life is good (although the lack of even a single measly low battery light is very cheap on Braun&#x27;s part). It&#x27;s definitely better than some of the second string brands (I&#x27;m thinking Remington and the like). But, sorry, Panasonic has it beat.&lt;br /&gt;dap</li>
            <li> This shaver is terrific for the price.</li>
            <li> Just received yesterday, so I cannot attest to the longevity of this factory refurbished Braun shaver, but what I can say is that its the closest, best shave I have gotten from an electric. My last Braun - the 5520 Flex Integral - lasted 8 years, and I was sad to see it go - but this morning I was literally amazed at how good their technology has gotten in the interim. It required fewer passes, and far less burn (and I had a good sharp blade on my 5520) Have no doubts about the quality of this syncro shaver. Also - the shaver was very clean, no signs of prior use, just had the factory refurb sticker on it which I promptly pulled off.</li>
            <li> Works great!  My hubby enjoys the clean cut shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these shavers before.  My first was used till it wore out.  This is, by far, the best electric razor I&#x27;ve used and I would and have recommended it to others.</li>
            <li> The Factory-Reconditioned 7505 was such a good deal I thought I would go for it. I&#x27;m glad I did. First of all, I looked it over with a magnifying glass. It looked absolutly brand new. It gives me such a good close shave my wife rubs my face and tells me \\&quot;Smooth as a babys ...\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> This product does not measure up to a Norelco shaver -- not even close. The overall battery life is shorter and you get fewer shaves per charge. The 3-head system of the Norelco makes it easier to shave curved areas under you chin, etc. Also, the Braun does not collect whiskers, instead when you are finished shaving, you find a layer of whiskers on your shirt. The Norelco does a fine job of capturing whiskers in the shaving head and keeping you clean. I had a Norelco for years, then bought a Braun. I have used it for over a year and have recently returned to Norelco, a much better product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting an electric shaver for awhile, but the good ones are always so expensive. Well, this one came up as one of my Gold Box items and the price was right. When I opened the box, I could not believe this was reconditioned. It looked bran spanking new. It already was charged and ready to go, so I took it to the bathroom and gave it a test run. It gave me the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had without one single nick. I love this thing.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Braun with some trepidation regarding purchasing a factory reconditioned personal care product.  In fact, it looks to be in like-new good condition, with what seems to be a new foil head.  I am fully confident in using it.&lt;br /&gt;I had been using a Norelco rotary and was curious which was better.  I shaved one half of my beard with the Norelco for 90 seconds and one half with the Braun.  Both seemed to do a very credible job, perhaps with a minor edge to the Braun.  However, the Norelco, not being rechargeable and not having a battery, is light weight, and better for travel.  Another advantage is that the sound is lower pitched.  The Braun produces a loud whining noise that I find irritating, though I think this is typical of foil razors. &lt;br /&gt;On a Friday sale, expect to find the Braun about twenty-five percent lower than its current price.  It is clearly a good value in that you will pay considerably more for a new one.</li>
            <li> For the past few years, I stopped using electric shavers because I was disappointed with the results. While I still believe the closest shave is with a razor, (Mach 3 is awesome), for an electric shaver, the Braun 7505 is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;1. price: no arguments here. I was debating between purchasing a brand-new, lower model shaver, or this reconditioned model. I have absolutely no regrets about purchasing the reconditioned Braun. &lt;BR&gt;2. shave: shaves great. again, a razor will be a better shave, but, you cant beat the convenience of an electric shaver. No mess, no fuss, and takes less time. technology has come a long way and I have to say I am very pleased with the performance of this shaver. (&lt;BR&gt;3. battery power: still relatively new, but this thing seems to last forever in between charges. I have charged it once and have been able to use it everyday for several weeks without recharging it. (i have moderate facial hair).&lt;BR&gt;4. clean up: a cinch. i just followed the recommendation of another reviewer and i just blast  compressed air to clean the shaver. great way to clean the shaver.&lt;BR&gt;5. although this model can be used in conjunction with the cleaner/base, this reconditioned model does not come with it. I honestly dont see the need for it. compressed air works fine enough for me.&lt;BR&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Conclusion: Excellent price, great shave, easy clean up and great battery power makes this reconditioned shaver a standout.</li>
            <li> It will shave close, but it takes a long time to get to that point. I had to keep going over and over the same area to get it to shave close.  I am switching back to a Norelco.</li>
            <li> I more or less second the overall opinion expressed in the other reviews.  I tend to shave every 3 days or so, and this shaver does a creditable job of making me presentable again.  Not so great with longer, sparser whiskers on the neck, and nowhere near a match for a sharp blade, but way easier to get the job done vs. a blade while watching small kids or camping.  Just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I have purchased several differant brands of rechargable and disposable shavers in the past.  I now use the Braun Syncro every day because it gives me a shave that is comperable to a regular shaver with gel or foam.  I highly recommend this shaver. It saves me time and money and that says it all.</li>
            <li> TODAY, I LOOKED AT WAL-MART TO SEE IF THEY HAD THIS PARTICULAR MODEL OF THE BRAUN 7505 SHAVER.  IT WAS ON THEIR SHELF!!I WAS SURPISED TO SEE THE AMOUNT THAT YOU STARTED OUT WAS ABOUT THE SAME AS, NOT OVER INFALATED. WHEN I RETURNED HOME, I PLACED MY FIRST ORDER WITH YOU.&lt;BR&gt;  IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY SON WHO IS THIRTEEN, HIS FIRST SHAVER, THE TIME FOR HIS FIRST SHAVE.HE DOES NOT KNOW IT IS COMING AND WILL BE IN THE MAIL.  THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS PROMOTION.</li>
            <li> I have had this for a couple of months now, and I have no complaints. It replaced a Braun Flex Integral that refused to stay charged. The Syncro gives the best shave I have ever got! It shaves very smoothly and quickly. The head moves from side to side as well as up and down, so somehow that makes it more efficiant. &lt;br /&gt;This is the best electric razor I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I bought it on price, brand name, and promotional considerations.  I use an electric razor when I&#x27;m in a rush.  I have a Norelco razor that I paid more for, but wanted another that I could keep in my desk at work.  This razor works well, and you can&#x27;t beat the price.  The Norelco is now relegated to the desk, and I use this one to shave with on a more regular basis.  I&#x27;ve found no electric razors work as good as a blade, but they&#x27;re convenient, and this one does a pretty good job.  Definately worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver after reading other recommendations on this site, and I have not regretted it. Don&#x27;t let the &amp;quot;factory reconditioned&amp;quot; label scare you - I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference between this unit a new one (and I tried).&lt;br /&gt;The 7505 gives a close shave and lasts forever on a single battery charge. I initially thought the pivoting head was a gimmick, but I found that it is actually a useful feature. The extendable cutter is really good at keeping sideburns clean, and the whole unit has a nice heft and feel to it, making it a pleasure to use.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: a great shaver at a great price.</li>
            <li> After using this for about a month your face will become used to this shaver. You need never use a blade again, this will shave you as close as a blade!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.  Very nice product, and it has held up well after several years of use now.</li>
            <li> I think I bought this 10 years ago and it is still working great! Easy to clean, great construction, great feel, still looks cool, easy to plug in and charge. It holds a charge for at least a week.</li>
            <li> Had Braun before and liked the quality.  Still using product and works as good as new. Would buy another one.</li>
