            <li>Great product; smells fresh, not too strong, yet creates the desirable effect you quest for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how many cologne afficionados there are out there</li>
            <li>Love Kenzo arrived on time as promised</li>
            <li>kenzo is classified as a refreshing, aquatic fragrance.</li>
            <li>and i love this smell</li>
            <li>Love Kenzo For men</li>
            <li>I love this colone</li>
            <li>i amso glad to have found this cologne after so many years of not seeing it around...</li>
            <li>Everything was ok.</li>
            <li>I paid more for the 1.7 bottle at that shop</li>
            <li>top of that, during the time I wore the bottle I didn&#x27;t get from Amazon</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it lasts for days..</li>
            <li>I have used this spray for more than 6 years now</li>
            <li>and I just love it.</li>
            <li>And I was instantly in love with it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>| 20 more words required</li>
            <li>I love sports Kenzo perfume and maybe this is the fragrance of Kenzo also will appeal to me</li>
            <li>It has good longevity at around 5 hours and the projection is just right at about 1 foot.  </li>
            <li>thanks, good service..</li>
            <li>On the other hand   this smells like they put perfect ingridients for my nose, and every time I spray it anew</li>
            <li>love the original smell of this one</li>
            <li>this the original fragance from since 10 or more years ago...</li>
            <li>Definitely a strong perfume.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery very satisfied with the product .</li>
            <li>Amazon can be a great place to save for a lot of items, but apparently fragrances are not one of them.</li>
            <li>We both loved it and now I love it more since I am back with this one.  </li>
            <li>, i did use this this Kenzo perfume about 12 years ago , i love it , it is cool,</li>
            <li>It is a great scent at work, on a date, or for a social outing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tested this in a local store before and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommendable because it&#x27;s such a deal for price and quality</li>
            <li>I (like a lot of people) was attracted to the pricing &amp; free shipping</li>
            <li>This is a clean, fresh scent that is in my top 3.  </li>
            <li>I have used the product over 20 years and am very satisfied with this difficult to find product and at a great price!!</li>
            <li>first purchased this item from Amazon in January of 2011, as it had stopped being readily available at most retailers I visited.</li>
            <li>Its worth every drop!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Kenzo for Men is a unique fragrance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Completely unique.</li>
            <li>i love my jungle by kenzo and this had a nice , clean fragrence that my son liked and has worn a few times.</li>
            <li>And also, why not, for those special moments.</li>
            <li>and it lasts all day, but than it might   be a killer intenzity and not moderate, I am a happy buyer, thanks.</li>
            <li>I order this product for my hubby and enjoy this smell very much when he &#x27;s wearing it.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>At first, it was overwhelming, but it really grew on me.  </li>
            <li>id worth it.</li>
            <li>A fresh scent, is set well into the skin and stays all day.</li>
            <li>I use different brands for my perfumes but always, always get back to Kenzo, this smell is incredible.</li>
            <li>anyway everything about this kind of items are personal preferences.</li>
            <li>Hopefully they fix it as is order a fresh , up to date one again.</li>
            <li>Far and away my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I use all of my Kenzo to &#x27;tame&#x27; the more musky scents that I love or to introduce variety to a scent I already enjoy wearing.</li>
            <li>Since I still had the older bottle I was able to do side by side comparisons and the differences were very noticeable.</li>
            <li>It is just right.</li>
            <li>The reason why I have given the fair rating of 3/5 is because it is not a counterfeit scent that I have received with both orders just watered down ones in my opinion.</li>
            <li>They sent me it very fast and it even came with a shower gel i wasnt expecting.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>so i dont know where the office part would kick in for any of you ;)</li>
            <li>so I know hot it smells.</li>
            <li>I always love the smell of this mid 90&#x27;s</li>
            <li>so I know hot it smells.</li>
            <li>I received a bottle more in line with the first one I&#x27;d purchased from Amazon two years prior.</li>
            <li>that I found about it for the first time.</li>
            <li>Good firm smell.</li>
            <li>Its leaves a positive impression for ladies, does not make an over powering cologne-wearing guy.</li>
            <li>so I give him a positive evaluation</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s very fresh (i live in a very hot place) and not terribly woody, it&#x27;s unobtrusive but the ones who come closer to you invariably notice the scent, and it lasts long enough on the skin.</li>
            <li>and i really like it.</li>
            <li>It is recommended for office wear, but i really dont have an office</li>
            <li>Son loves it and used whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Leaf</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Fast service.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t spend as much time reviewing a fragrance on Amazon as I just did.</li>
            <li>Go to a real store and purchase it.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I keep all my empty bottles.</li>
            <li>It is a little bit sweet but smooth.</li>
            <li>using this for past two years...recommended many friens and got some compliments too!</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure the fragrance I got is not original.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure the fragrance I got is not original.</li>
            <li>The scent possesses a blend of strong green notes, rare iris, cedar, sandalwood and vetiver.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I&#x27;ll try other by Kenzo as well, but this one is just perfect not more  not less.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t like it as much as I smelled too much like a wild jungle.</li>
            <li>A classic and a masterpiece.</li>
            <li>smell as original and smell stay long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>As far as Amazon goes I am willing to give them another shot with colognes that ship directly from them.</li>
            <li>design is a classic, Ive smelled the other kenzo&#x27;s that morphed from this, but this one is the original i believe,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>and i could never find it where i  live.  </li>
            <li>I received my first 3.4 oz of this verdant mellifluence as a gift from Imelda Marcos back in 1995.</li>
            <li>In this case it&#x27;s pretty likely it won&#x27;t be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>My husband first found this scent on a cruise back in 1995.</li>
            <li>I am attracted to it every time and find it to be subtle, light, distinctive and fresh</li>
            <li>/&gt;Saving $24 on a bottle of cologne only makes sense if it&#x27;s the same quality you&#x27;d get if you paid full retail price at a store that the manufacturer vouches for (Bloomingdales or Sephora if you&#x27;re in NYC.)</li>
            <li>Even if you did spray a little extra, it would not seem overpowering to you or others, as it is a refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to give online EDT spray buying a try &amp; ordered Kenzo (shipped directly by Amazon)</li>
            <li>I may have thought nothing of it if I had not read so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li>I frequently receive compliments with this cologne on and have yet to come across someone who dislikes it.  </li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than few hours,  than I spray it again.</li>
            <li>This is my second buy, my boyfriend finished the first bottle so that i bought him the second, he likes it.</li>
            <li>Unless of course the other 1 star review is right</li>
            <li>very pleasing smell but not lasts very long.</li>
            <li>I did trash the 3 bottles that I wasn&#x27;t able to return - that&#x27;s how weak they smelled.)</li>
            <li>With these I&#x27;ve almost doubled up, can barely smell them on myself &amp; even though the faint smell lasts the whole day (which leads me to believe they are the \\&quot;genuine article\\&quot;)</li>
            <li>FRESH DARK DEEP BLUE SCENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>With my other EDT sprays (which are not overpowering scents) 3 sprays will last the whole day.</li>
            <li>There is little variation in the notes of the smell, which is a positive for me</li>
    </ol>

            <li> so I know hot it smells.</li>
            <li> I received a bottle more in line with the first one I&#x27;d purchased from Amazon two years prior.</li>
            <li> that I found about it for the first time.</li>
            <li> Good firm smell.</li>
            <li> Its leaves a positive impression for ladies, does not make an over powering cologne-wearing guy.</li>
            <li> so I give him a positive evaluation</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very fresh (i live in a very hot place) and not terribly woody, it&#x27;s unobtrusive but the ones who come closer to you invariably notice the scent, and it lasts long enough on the skin.</li>
            <li> and i really like it.</li>
            <li> It is recommended for office wear, but i really dont have an office</li>
            <li> Son loves it and used whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Leaf</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Fast service.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t spend as much time reviewing a fragrance on Amazon as I just did.</li>
            <li> Go to a real store and purchase it.</li>
            <li> I love it so much, I keep all my empty bottles.</li>
            <li> It is a little bit sweet but smooth.</li>
            <li> using this for past two years...recommended many friens and got some compliments too!</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure the fragrance I got is not original.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure the fragrance I got is not original.</li>
            <li> The scent possesses a blend of strong green notes, rare iris, cedar, sandalwood and vetiver.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I&#x27;ll try other by Kenzo as well, but this one is just perfect not more  not less.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as much as I smelled too much like a wild jungle.</li>
            <li> A classic and a masterpiece.</li>
            <li> smell as original and smell stay long time.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As far as Amazon goes I am willing to give them another shot with colognes that ship directly from them.</li>
            <li> design is a classic, Ive smelled the other kenzo&#x27;s that morphed from this, but this one is the original i believe,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> and i could never find it where i  live.  </li>
            <li> I received my first 3.4 oz of this verdant mellifluence as a gift from Imelda Marcos back in 1995.</li>
            <li> In this case it&#x27;s pretty likely it won&#x27;t be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> My husband first found this scent on a cruise back in 1995.</li>
            <li> I am attracted to it every time and find it to be subtle, light, distinctive and fresh</li>
            <li> /&gt;Saving $24 on a bottle of cologne only makes sense if it&#x27;s the same quality you&#x27;d get if you paid full retail price at a store that the manufacturer vouches for (Bloomingdales or Sephora if you&#x27;re in NYC.)</li>
            <li> Even if you did spray a little extra, it would not seem overpowering to you or others, as it is a refreshing scent.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to give online EDT spray buying a try &amp; ordered Kenzo (shipped directly by Amazon)</li>
            <li> I may have thought nothing of it if I had not read so many negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I frequently receive compliments with this cologne on and have yet to come across someone who dislikes it.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than few hours,  than I spray it again.</li>
            <li> This is my second buy, my boyfriend finished the first bottle so that i bought him the second, he likes it.</li>
            <li> Unless of course the other 1 star review is right</li>
            <li> very pleasing smell but not lasts very long.</li>
            <li> I did trash the 3 bottles that I wasn&#x27;t able to return - that&#x27;s how weak they smelled.)</li>
            <li> With these I&#x27;ve almost doubled up, can barely smell them on myself &amp; even though the faint smell lasts the whole day (which leads me to believe they are the \\&quot;genuine article\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> FRESH DARK DEEP BLUE SCENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> With my other EDT sprays (which are not overpowering scents) 3 sprays will last the whole day.</li>
            <li> There is little variation in the notes of the smell, which is a positive for me</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not much into heavy scented colognes and this one has just the right strength.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s another 1 star review from December of last year from someone that has used this fragrance for a long time and noticed that what they received from Amazon wasn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Last very long</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Either way, the bottles I&#x27;ve received from Amazon over the last two years smell at best like a watered down version and at worst like nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know why, it&#x27;s like a scent between original Kenzo and a regular colon, but just weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately you really aren&#x27;t saving money by ordering this product from Amazon, as you&#x27;re likely to end up with a product that has seriously lost its luster.</li>
            <li> I was never disciplined with wearing spray because it&#x27;s not natural product but chemie.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a long time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very hard to find it within 200 miles of our hill-jack southern VA town, so I&#x27;m very grateful to find it online.</li>
            <li> this is a fake product is not original, the original fragrance lasts many hours, this miss alcohol-based and oil. , Fake alcohol and water.</li>
            <li> A few drops is enough, it stays on your body all day.</li>
            <li> NOT WHAT I EXPECTED SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING THIS BRAND SINCE I DISCOVERED IT</li>
            <li> With all my other sprays I get compliments from strangers (at the very least from my wife) but with these the only person who could smell them was myself and that is barely.</li>
            <li> I spoke to customer service at amazon and they explained that I could not return the bottle due to shipping regulations, but they did send out a replacement.</li>
            <li> Dark days by the beach.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just one spray, it made me feel gross at least 3 hours</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s watered down it&#x27;s not a safety issue, but if it&#x27;s been tampered with that is another</li>
            <li> they have no potency, which I believe is because the product has been watered down.</li>
            <li> Now I know how patrons feel when they get watered down alcohol at a bar,</li>
            <li> &amp; Gucci Guilty (shipped from New York Perfumes via Amazon).</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m a little weary of this bottle, maybe I&#x27;ll just spray it on with clothes instead of just my skin.</li>
            <li> It has all the qualities I look for in an everyday fragrance</li>
            <li> It smells weird, I don&#x27;t know if it is its actual scent</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of reviews for various fragrances purchased on Amazon &amp; one complaint that kept coming up a lot is fake or diluted products.</li>
            <li> and no one has complained yet this is the meaning of a fragrance that represents beaches, sand, and linen clothing for me</li>
            <li> It lasts for maybe an hour, the box says kenzo 2007, and the secondary UPC code has been cut and taped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put at least 10 sprays on my shirt to see if it&#x27;s my chemistry</li>
            <li> like this parfume , but it it quaty difficult to find it in a shop</li>
            <li> Totally Fake juice in my opinion.</li>
            <li> so i wear it casually</li>
            <li> , I mean, it&#x27;s not that it smells bad, it&#x27;s that the smell of it makes me uncomfortable</li>
            <li> SMELLS STRANGE AND AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> they are very weak!</li>
            <li> or I got a bad one.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Anything Kenzo is great.</li>
            <li> I have used the product over 20 years and am very satisfied with this difficult to find product and at a great price!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this one when I was dating my wife.  We both loved it and now I love it more since I am back with this one.  It is very unique!!!</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite colognes... great for spring, summer, and/or dates and festivities. Truly one of the greatest fragrances.</li>
            <li> I was never disciplined with wearing spray because it&#x27;s not natural product but chemie.  This one I like and feel there must be something to it as I spray it almost every day.  It&#x27;s like when you are hungry and like to smell a good cookin. On the other hand   this smells like they put perfect ingridients for my nose, and every time I spray it anew I like  it, that smell of cleanlines, moderate intensity. The smell doesn&#x27;t last for more than few hours,  than I spray it again. Sometimes I&#x27;ll try other by Kenzo as well, but this one is just perfect not more  not less. Probably, I wish i spray it once and it lasts all day, but than it might   be a killer intenzity and not moderate, I am a happy buyer, thanks.</li>
            <li> Excellent experience! All according to the agreement. Impeccable compliance deadlines. Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Good firm smell. It is a little bit sweet but smooth. A few drops is enough, it stays on your body all day.</li>
            <li> I use all of my Kenzo to &#x27;tame&#x27; the more musky scents that I love or to introduce variety to a scent I already enjoy wearing. I don&#x27;t know how many cologne afficionados there are out there but I like to create my own scent and Kenzo is a great &#x27;mixer&#x27; to achieve this!</li>
            <li> I received my first 3.4 oz of this verdant mellifluence as a gift from Imelda Marcos back in 1995. At first, it was overwhelming, but it really grew on me.  I used up the bottle in no time.  I love it so much, I keep all my empty bottles. ;-)</li>
            <li> Last very long and i really like it.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like it as much as I smelled too much like a wild jungle. However it smelled nice on my cousin whom i gifted it to.</li>
            <li> Love Kenzo arrived on time as promised</li>
            <li> kenzo is classified as a refreshing, aquatic fragrance. The scent possesses a blend of strong green notes, rare iris, cedar, sandalwood and vetiver. It is recommended for office wear, but i really dont have an office and i love this smell so i wear it casually and no one has complained yet this is the meaning of a fragrance that represents beaches, sand, and linen clothing for me so i dont know where the office part would kick in for any of you ;)</li>
            <li> Great product; smells fresh, not too strong, yet creates the desirable effect you quest for. Its leaves a positive impression for ladies, does not make an over powering cologne-wearing guy. Its worth every drop! Love Kenzo For men</li>
            <li> I recommend this perfume, quite enduring. Very nice, not as strong or as mild. Excellent for day to day. And also, why not, for those special moments.</li>
            <li> Loved it...using this for past two years...recommended many friens and got some compliments too!</li>
            <li> I love this colone and i could never find it where i  live.  I am so happy i found it here.  They sent me it very fast and it even came with a shower gel i wasnt expecting.  Very pleased!!!</li>
            <li> i amso glad to have found this cologne after so many years of not seeing it around...one of my favs!</li>
            <li> it smells awesome, and unique. girls loving it. It cost some money but i think it id worth it. cheers</li>
            <li> A fresh scent, is set well into the skin and stays all day. Packed perfectly. Very Satisfied with the item and service.</li>
            <li> I use different brands for my perfumes but always, always get back to Kenzo, this smell is incredible. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I got this for my brother and he loves it!  It smells great!  It was a graduation gift for him!</li>
            <li> I can still smell it by the end of the day. Definitely a strong perfume. Nothing else to add to this.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure the fragrance I got is not original. I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a long time so I know hot it smells. This one does not smell correct.</li>
            <li> good item as listed, fast shipping, great packing, i did use this this Kenzo perfume about 12 years ago , i love it , it is cool,</li>
            <li> SMELLS STRANGE AND AWFUL.  NOT WHAT I EXPECTED SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING THIS BRAND SINCE I DISCOVERED IT AT NORDSTROM IN THE MID 90&#x27;S.  DO NOT BUY.</li>
            <li> love the original smell of this one</li>
            <li> this the original fragance from since 10 or more years ago...anyway everything about this kind of items are personal preferences.</li>
            <li> oldie but goodie....I always love the smell of this mid 90&#x27;s cologne.&lt;br /&gt;Prices range from 35 to 40. Son loves it and used whole bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Leaf design is a classic, Ive smelled the other kenzo&#x27;s that morphed from this, but this one is the original i believe,&lt;br /&gt;and no question best scent.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok. Thanks</li>
            <li> I have never heard of this cologne before my friend mentioned her husband used to use this back in the day. We couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but here...(reasonably priced) Smells nice!!!</li>
            <li> SMELLS GOOD! I DON&#x27;T have words to describe.. very good. The prize is low for the product quality. I&#x27;m really glad!</li>
            <li> Great scent but it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery very satisfied with the product .</li>
            <li> scent of seduction, I gave my husband this perfume and worships it, use it every day, I recommend it as a gift to your partner</li>
            <li> It printed under the outside of box, made in 2007?  It is 2015 now...</li>
            <li> This is my second buy, my boyfriend finished the first bottle so that i bought him the second, he likes it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tested this in a local store before and it smells great. But the One fulfilled by Amazon seems off. It lasts for maybe an hour, the box says kenzo 2007, and the secondary UPC code has been cut and taped over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little weary of this bottle, maybe I&#x27;ll just spray it on with clothes instead of just my skin. If it&#x27;s watered down it&#x27;s not a safety issue, but if it&#x27;s been tampered with that is another story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon took care of me a refunded the order. They should also be looking into the year of stock they are selling and the UPC issue. Hopefully they fix it as is order a fresh , up to date one again.</li>
            <li> Very good product. Fast service.</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommendable because it&#x27;s such a deal for price and quality</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of reviews for various fragrances purchased on Amazon &amp; one complaint that kept coming up a lot is fake or diluted products. I (like a lot of people) was attracted to the pricing &amp; free shipping so I decided to give online EDT spray buying a try &amp; ordered Kenzo (shipped directly by Amazon) &amp; Gucci Guilty (shipped from New York Perfumes via Amazon). Orders arrived on time, packaging &amp; bottles seemed legit, the fragrances smelled like they were supposed to with one problem...they are very weak! I may have thought nothing of it if I had not read so many negative reviews. With my other EDT sprays (which are not overpowering scents) 3 sprays will last the whole day. With these I&#x27;ve almost doubled up, can barely smell them on myself &amp; even though the faint smell lasts the whole day (which leads me to believe they are the \\&quot;genuine article\\&quot;) they have no potency, which I believe is because the product has been watered down. With all my other sprays I get compliments from strangers (at the very least from my wife) but with these the only person who could smell them was myself and that is barely. It&#x27;s a shame companies still do business like this but they have lost mine. Went to a local store today (Perfumania) &amp; what a difference! The reason why I have given the fair rating of 3/5 is because it is not a counterfeit scent that I have received with both orders just watered down ones in my opinion. Now I know how patrons feel when they get watered down alcohol at a bar, disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a follow up to my initial review. Amazon customer service has been excellent so far and have given me a refund. As far as Amazon goes I am willing to give them another shot with colognes that ship directly from them.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure the fragrance I got is not original. I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for a long time so I know hot it smells. This one does not smell correct.</li>
            <li> Amazon can be a great place to save for a lot of items, but apparently fragrances are not one of them. There&#x27;s another 1 star review from December of last year from someone that has used this fragrance for a long time and noticed that what they received from Amazon wasn&#x27;t it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first purchased this item from Amazon in January of 2011, as it had stopped being readily available at most retailers I visited. I had no issue with that bottle. I reordered in November of 2011 when I was running low and the bottle I received smelled nothing like the fragrance I&#x27;d been using for years. I spoke to customer service at amazon and they explained that I could not return the bottle due to shipping regulations, but they did send out a replacement. That replacement had the same issue. They even sent a third replacement but it still smelled off. Since I still had the older bottle I was able to do side by side comparisons and the differences were very noticeable. I reached out to Kenzo to see if they had changed their formula recently but they assured me that they had not. They did mention that there was no way to guarantee quality buying from Amazon as Kenzo has no control over how the product is handled and stored. I accepted a refund from Amazon and left it at that. After about a year I decided to give it another try. I received a bottle more in line with the first one I&#x27;d purchased from Amazon two years prior. When that bottle was running low I happened upon a retailer close by that stocked it so I picked one up there. I paid more for the 1.7 bottle at that shop then I can get the 3.4 for on Amazon, so I figured I&#x27;d go back to Amazon after I ran through that one. This time I received my fourth dud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, during the time I wore the bottle I didn&#x27;t get from Amazon I had plenty of people ask me what scent I was wearing. This used to happen to me all the time, but it never happened with the two bottles from Amazon that I ended up wearing (even though itseemed wasteful I did trash the 3 bottles that I wasn&#x27;t able to return - that&#x27;s how weak they smelled.) I realize now it&#x27;s because the bottles I thought were alright that I got from Amazon were only alright compared to the ones that were way off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kenzo for Men is a unique fragrance. It never comes across as &#x27;your cologne&#x27;. Instead it blends in with your scent and just sort of becomes the way you smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately you really aren&#x27;t saving money by ordering this product from Amazon, as you&#x27;re likely to end up with a product that has seriously lost its luster. Unless of course the other 1 star review is right and it&#x27;s a knockoff that you&#x27;re paying for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either way, the bottles I&#x27;ve received from Amazon over the last two years smell at best like a watered down version and at worst like nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saving $24 on a bottle of cologne only makes sense if it&#x27;s the same quality you&#x27;d get if you paid full retail price at a store that the manufacturer vouches for (Bloomingdales or Sephora if you&#x27;re in NYC.) In this case it&#x27;s pretty likely it won&#x27;t be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money. Save your time. Don&#x27;t spend as much time reviewing a fragrance on Amazon as I just did. Please.</li>
            <li> Warm sexy scent. I bought it as a gift and my friend really liked it too. Great product at a good price.</li>
            <li> undoubtedly this fragrance is the best I&#x27;ve had, Super enduring odor, a very pleasant fragrance, q whenever I put all the fragrance ask me am using,</li>
            <li> It Smells very good. I love the smell and it lasts for days..i am happy with my purchase. I recommend it</li>
            <li> This is a clean, fresh scent that is in my top 3.  It has good longevity at around 5 hours and the projection is just right at about 1 foot.  Even if you did spray a little extra, it would not seem overpowering to you or others, as it is a refreshing scent.  There is little variation in the notes of the smell, which is a positive for me but it depends on your preferences.  I frequently receive compliments with this cologne on and have yet to come across someone who dislikes it.  It is a great scent at work, on a date, or for a social outing.</li>
            <li> i love my jungle by kenzo and this had a nice , clean fragrence that my son liked and has worn a few times.</li>
            <li> FRESH DARK DEEP BLUE SCENT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Completely unique. A classic and a masterpiece. There´s nothing out there like it. Dark days by the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome fragrance.</li>
            <li> very pleasing smell but not lasts very long. I order this product for my hubby and enjoy this smell very much when he &#x27;s wearing it.</li>
            <li> I have used this spray for more than 6 years now and I just love it. It is just right.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Kenzo in Paris about 7 years ago.  I&#x27;m not much into heavy scented colognes and this one has just the right strength.  I have never smelled any cologne like this. Wonderful.</li>
            <li> It is just perfect!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My husband first found this scent on a cruise back in 1995. It&#x27;s very hard to find it within 200 miles of our hill-jack southern VA town, so I&#x27;m very grateful to find it online. It&#x27;s an impressive scent. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> smell as original and smell stay long time.&lt;br /&gt;I like this parfume , but it it quaty difficult to find it in a shop</li>
            <li> Far and away my favorite men&#x27;s fragrance.  I am attracted to it every time and find it to be subtle, light, distinctive and fresh</li>
            <li> I understand this fragrance has been out for quite some time, but it wasn&#x27;t until a year or so that I found about it for the first time. And I was instantly in love with it. It has all the qualities I look for in an everyday fragrance - it&#x27;s very fresh (i live in a very hot place) and not terribly woody, it&#x27;s unobtrusive but the ones who come closer to you invariably notice the scent, and it lasts long enough on the skin. I&#x27;m glad I can find this on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It smells weird, I don&#x27;t know if it is its actual scent or I got a bad one. Just one spray, it made me feel gross at least 3 hours, I mean, it&#x27;s not that it smells bad, it&#x27;s that the smell of it makes me uncomfortable, I don&#x27;t know why, it&#x27;s like a scent between original Kenzo and a regular colon, but just weird.</li>
            <li> Totally Fake juice in my opinion. I can put 20-30 sprays on and in 5 minutes it&#x27;s gone. I put at least 10 sprays on my shirt to see if it&#x27;s my chemistry and I CANNOT smell anything on my shirt an hour later. I was totally ripped off - Do not buy from this! Go to a real store and purchase it.</li>
