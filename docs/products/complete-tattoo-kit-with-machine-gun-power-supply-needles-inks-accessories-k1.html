            <li>easy to set up, comes with everything needed and works great for beginners :)</li>
            <li>the package came in a box inside of a box inside of a soft case, and inside of the case were perfectly packed parts.</li>
            <li>and I was looking to purchase a good, cheap tattoo gun with supplies.</li>
            <li>it sure as hell comes with everything in the picture.</li>
            <li>how many touch up&#x27;s one does wit it.</li>
            <li>doesnt work, LOVE IT THO</li>
            <li>Everything you need and more to start tattooing :)</li>
            <li>I am a tattoo novice and i do love this piece</li>
            <li>, I will defiantly buy more from this company</li>
            <li>I have practiced many forms of art and always intrigued in how the tattoo worked.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>i used the tattoo gun out of the package and it was my first tattoo!!!</li>
            <li>This kit is good for a starter kit or a back up kit,it comes with everything you need,the machine works great strong built</li>
            <li>It comes with a pretty good stock of needles.</li>
            <li>have done 4 or 5 tattoos with this gun so far and its performed great for the price</li>
            <li>and he liked it, but I prefer to use a higher quality if I was tattooing on myself.</li>
            <li>good for a aspiring artist,recommend to new comer..</li>
            <li>and she got it all put together and started working with it, and everything was going fine, kit heading for a 5 star rating.  </li>
            <li>As of now no complaints works fine</li>
            <li>else seems to be fine.</li>
            <li>But besides that the kit is great!!!!I recommend this to all starter artist but remember buy different ink like mom&#x27;s or kuro sumi which are great inks to work with.</li>
            <li>everything works great except the power cord 3 prong connector in the back of the unit is lose</li>
            <li>The quality of everything is fantastic.</li>
            <li>then that it&#x27;s perfect for small beginner projects.</li>
            <li>everything came undamaged and so far it works amazing</li>
            <li>But hey, for the $15 I actually had to pay out of pocket, it was a good deal still.</li>
            <li>This is a very good machine especially for a new person just entering the tattoo world.</li>
            <li>the return was quick</li>
            <li>but ink is pretty cheap</li>
            <li>Not one of the stainless steel tips fit any of the needles.</li>
            <li>This item is amazing, the only problem i have is with the CD that was sent with the item with instructions</li>
            <li>it is worth it.</li>
            <li>worth</li>
            <li>the price ink is crappy but the rest of it is worth it</li>
            <li>But you can start practiceing right out of the box.</li>
            <li>I put it together right out of the box in about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Works great, few months in... Still doing tattoos!</li>
            <li>Everything was great except gun didn&#x27;t work, other than that it all works had to buy new gun to get going</li>
            <li>But within the first 20 hours of use one of the gun would just cut off</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy a higher quality of it.</li>
            <li>Had a bit of a time getting the machine to cooperate at first, but got it where it needs to be.</li>
            <li>I actually got more supplies than I was expecting.</li>
            <li>First I want to say that Amazon Prime paid off again with its two day shipping.</li>
            <li>the tattoo gun stalls at time but works did a tattoo on my leg and it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I have been interested in tattooing for quite sometime</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend this product to any first time tattoo buyers.</li>
            <li>, overall I was very very pleased with this product especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat that</li>
            <li>I bought this kit as a gift for a friend of mine who wants to learn tattooing.  </li>
            <li>It will do the trick for her to know if she wants to go on and pursue the art, and then invest in quality equipment.</li>
            <li>got a gift card from a friend and decided to get a real tattoo gun.&lt;br</li>
            <li>the person that got it was very please with it ..</li>
            <li>I did not expect to work on real flesh but hoped to just understand the art.</li>
            <li>but it works well enough to get the job done, and the needles seem cheap but work</li>
            <li>Thank you guys do much</li>
            <li>Bought this kit for the price mainly.</li>
            <li>It came within  three days of order and nothing was damaged,  the cd is junk but that could be a bad cd rip and the ink is not the best ink</li>
            <li>and you can possibly leave a scar if tattooing with it it doesnt sit right at all no matter</li>
            <li>It seemed like a nice little kit to start with to test the waters without to much of a financial commitment.  </li>
            <li>, I bought new tips, and two new guns.</li>
            <li>only thing is the ink quality is pretty crappy.</li>
            <li>As far as the ink goes, I would not use it.</li>
            <li>The product arrived early and it was well packaged.</li>
            <li>it was completely set up.</li>
            <li>The foot pedal was broken when it arrived in the mail and to be honest I could keep on going on with the imperfections of this product.</li>
            <li>It did work and was a great kit everything included, tough dvd to watch due to format.</li>
            <li>Pretty Shweet but the machine came loose and i tightened everything down,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>The needles weren&#x27;t exactly the greatest and the ink is HORRIBLE.</li>
            <li>but then again I&#x27;ve only used it for about four hours all together so far...</li>
            <li>so I took it apart completely and put it back together</li>
            <li>Its a analog home film made in china you can barely make out.</li>
            <li>Well, overall it&#x27;s not too bad of a deal and is pretty right on to most of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li>The gun itself is a bit finnicky, and takes a bit of adjustment every now and then, but for the price, it&#x27;s well worth the small hassle.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Makes me wonder how long it will last overall.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing about it is the iron sakura ink it brings its very cheap</li>
            <li> I would suggest getting different ink and needles but other</li>
            <li> ,I was ganna return it and get a replacement but that takes time so ,I just open the unit and soldier the wire permanently,problem solve other than that I like this kit,note shipping is slow ships directly from the seller not Amazon...</li>
            <li> I like the kit it came on time and even had an extra black ink bottle</li>
            <li> /&gt;i plan on adding uv black ligt colors and invisable black ligt colors to my ink set to make some super bad cholo style tattoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> The instructional DVD is clearly pirated from some other source, and is very poor quality.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like this little kit.</li>
            <li> Power supply seems a little eh.</li>
            <li> I went at it for a bit and after just a few hours the peddle stopped working.</li>
            <li> I did do a few small ones on myself just to test the ink</li>
            <li> the only thing wrong with it is the ink and the needles, the ink is pretty much crap</li>
            <li> I have paid double for what I paid for this kit for another kit and the tattoos came out bad.</li>
            <li> Overall not too bad.</li>
            <li> I do admit I hate to return items, especially when they are inexpensive.  </li>
            <li> and he likes the the kit; however, he stated that the video is outdated and grainy.</li>
            <li> Tattooing some random girl.</li>
            <li> My DVD didn&#x27;t read the CD :(</li>
            <li> ,the DVD is worthless it does not work,if you need refferences just go to the web,I been using this kit for about two weeks</li>
            <li> Dvd is worthless shows nothing about how to tattoo or setup at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not the worst either</li>
            <li> However the quality is so horribly.</li>

            <li> Just to get to know how to use and practice it is worth it. It has almost everything. But you can start practiceing right out of the box.</li>
            <li> I bought this kit as a gift for a friend of mine who wants to learn tattooing.  It seemed like a nice little kit to start with to test the waters without to much of a financial commitment.  Well, overall it&#x27;s not too bad of a deal and is pretty right on to most of the other reviews.  The inks are fine to practice with on fake skin or fruit, but if I was putting something on someone I&#x27;d really go with a high quality ink (duh).  I gave her the kit and she got it all put together and started working with it, and everything was going fine, kit heading for a 5 star rating.  But within the first 20 hours of use one of the gun would just cut off and she&#x27;d have to jiggle the connections and the on/off switch to get it going again.  Makes me wonder how long it will last overall.  I do admit I hate to return items, especially when they are inexpensive.  I just prefer to eat the cost.  It will do the trick for her to know if she wants to go on and pursue the art, and then invest in quality equipment.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loved her tattoo gun. The CD is s*** though</li>
            <li> For starters this is a good starter kit it sure as hell comes with everything in the picture.The only bad thing about it is the iron sakura ink it brings its very cheap and you can possibly leave a scar if tattooing with it it doesnt sit right at all no matter how many touch up&#x27;s one does wit it. But besides that the kit is great!!!!I recommend this to all starter artist but remember buy different ink like mom&#x27;s or kuro sumi which are great inks to work with.</li>
            <li> My DVD didn&#x27;t read the CD :(</li>
            <li> I like this little kit. Although I have had to still buy some of my own stuff. Not one of the stainless steel tips fit any of the needles. And the gun seems to stop working once in a while. You have to give it a whack on the side to get it to start up again. No worries though, I bought new tips, and two new guns. But hey, for the $15 I actually had to pay out of pocket, it was a good deal still.</li>
            <li> As of now no complaints works fine but ink is pretty cheap</li>
            <li> easy to set up, comes with everything needed and works great for beginners :) i started using it within 5min of getting it</li>
            <li> Works great, few months in... Still doing tattoos!</li>
            <li> I have been doing cholo style tattoos for years now.&lt;br /&gt;I got a gift card from a friend and decided to get a real tattoo gun.&lt;br /&gt;i know i will be happy with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i plan on adding uv black ligt colors and invisable black ligt colors to my ink set to make some super bad cholo style tattoo&#x27;s</li>
            <li> This arrived with all parts included and well packaged as described. The quality is on par with the price. The cd doesn&#x27;t work at all, however.</li>
            <li> This item is amazing, the only problem i have is with the CD that was sent with the item with instructions doesnt work, LOVE IT THO</li>
            <li> This kit is good for a starter kit or a back up kit,it comes with everything you need,the machine works great strong built,the DVD is worthless it does not work,if you need refferences just go to the web,I been using this kit for about two weeks everything works great except the power cord 3 prong connector in the back of the unit is lose so it keep turning off and on,I was ganna return it and get a replacement but that takes time so ,I just open the unit and soldier the wire permanently,problem solve other than that I like this kit,note shipping is slow ships directly from the seller not Amazon...</li>
            <li> The instructional DVD is clearly pirated from some other source, and is very poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;Everything else seems to be fine. The gun itself is a bit finnicky, and takes a bit of adjustment every now and then, but for the price, it&#x27;s well worth the small hassle.</li>
            <li> Everything you need and more to start tattooing :)</li>
            <li> Fairly allright kit , would&#x27;ve been nice if it came with a clip cord! And if the DVD actually worked .</li>
            <li> This is a great product it wasn&#x27;t for myself it was a gift but the person that got it was very please with it ..</li>
            <li> Thus is a great kit for someone who is jus getting started. I&#x27;m an apprentice at a shop in Austin. I like the kit it came on time and even had an extra black ink bottle</li>
            <li> I am a tattoo novice and i do love this piece o tattoo kit..good for a aspiring artist,recommend to new comer..</li>
            <li> This kit is awesome!! I have paid double for what I paid for this kit for another kit and the tattoos came out bad. The tattoos I do with this kit are amazing!! I love it!!</li>
            <li> worth the price ink is crappy but the rest of it is worth it</li>
            <li> This is a very good machine especially for a new person just entering the tattoo world. It came within  three days of order and nothing was damaged,  the cd is junk but that could be a bad cd rip and the ink is not the best ink but it&#x27;s not the worst either, overall I was very very pleased with this product especially for the price, you can&#x27;t beat that , I will defiantly buy more from this company</li>
            <li> I have practiced many forms of art and always intrigued in how the tattoo worked. I did not expect to work on real flesh but hoped to just understand the art. It did work and was a great kit everything included, tough dvd to watch due to format. I went at it for a bit and after just a few hours the peddle stopped working. the return was quick so I guess i got what I wanted</li>
            <li> excellent !!!! 5 star for the price...</li>
            <li> Pretty Shweet but the machine came loose and i tightened everything down,&lt;br /&gt;and what is a vcd? what the hell am i supposed to put that into?</li>
            <li> Well, I certainly wouldn&#x27;t say that this gun is the best I&#x27;ve ever used but it gets the job done. I&#x27;ve had this one for about a week now and we&#x27;ve done several tattoos with it. I put it together right out of the box in about 5 minutes. I did not use the \\&quot;VCD\\&quot; thing that came with it, so I can&#x27;t comment on that. The gun itself works great. I had no issues with the power supply box or cords. It comes with a pretty good stock of needles. As far as the ink goes, I would not use it. I&#x27;d buy a higher quality of it. I did use it on someone else and he liked it, but I prefer to use a higher quality if I was tattooing on myself. I did do a few small ones on myself just to test the ink and it was just \\&quot;okay.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would say buy the gun if you&#x27;re in a pinch for a gun or you&#x27;re a beginner. This is not a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; gun at all, but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> This kit is great for a starter! it includes everything you need to begin :D I really loved it. Awesome!</li>
            <li> Had a bit of a time getting the machine to cooperate at first, but got it where it needs to be. Power supply seems a little eh. But it&#x27;s definitely a good kit for the price. I actually got more supplies than I was expecting. Overall not too bad.</li>
            <li> I got my son this kit for Christmas and he likes the the kit; however, he stated that the video is outdated and grainy. He also mentioned it would have been nice to have the cleaning solution for the skins.</li>
            <li> The idea of having this amount of product in ONE for this price, is very lovely. However the quality is so horribly. The needles weren&#x27;t exactly the greatest and the ink is HORRIBLE. The foot pedal was broken when it arrived in the mail and to be honest I could keep on going on with the imperfections of this product. Never again.</li>
            <li> First I want to say that Amazon Prime paid off again with its two day shipping. the package came in a box inside of a box inside of a soft case, and inside of the case were perfectly packed parts. everything came undamaged and so far it works amazing but then again I&#x27;ve only used it for about four hours all together so far... the only thing wrong with it is the ink and the needles, the ink is pretty much crap but it works well enough to get the job done, and the needles seem cheap but work okay. I would suggest getting different ink and needles but other then that it&#x27;s perfect for small beginner projects. I think it was worth the money and at least now I don&#x27;t have to do stick n pokes...</li>
            <li> Bought this kit for the price mainly. works like a charm the tattoo gun stalls at time but works did a tattoo on my leg and it works pretty well. only thing is the ink quality is pretty crappy.</li>
            <li> this kit is a very very good kit for beginners!!! the item arrived in 2 days as requested, and it was well packaged!! everything that was on the picture was included and everything worked!! i have never owned a tattoo machine nor have i&#x27;ve ever done one. i used the tattoo gun out of the package and it was my first tattoo!!! as i say again very good kit for beginners and i am very happy! and may i add...the ink is amazing for beginners it comes out great!!</li>
            <li> Everything was great except gun didn&#x27;t work, other than that it all works had to buy new gun to get going</li>
            <li> works great. havent had any probs with it. have done 4 or 5 tattoos with this gun so far and its performed great for the price</li>
            <li> This is an amazing kit.  It has everything I wanted and ordered. It even has a lot of extra tips I didn&#x27;t even know I was getting. Plus gloves a s*** Tone of grommets and bands.  Thank you guys do much I&#x27;m super pleased with my purchase! !!</li>
            <li> I have been interested in tattooing for quite sometime and I was looking to purchase a good, cheap tattoo gun with supplies. The product arrived early and it was well packaged. The quality of everything is fantastic. I looked up a tutorial online - how to set up a tattoo gun - within 10 min it was completely set up. The only issue I ran into was the gun didn&#x27;t work initially so I took it apart completely and put it back together and it worked like a gem! I love this purchase! I&#x27;d recommend this product to any first time tattoo buyers.</li>
            <li> everything  came with it</li>
            <li> Dvd is worthless shows nothing about how to tattoo or setup at all. Its a analog home film made in china you can barely make out. Tattooing some random girl. Its a bit embarrassing I would think to even send this with kit. Don&#x27;t count on any instructions video or otherwise.</li>
