            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>great price.</li>
            <li>and it is also great for age spots.</li>
            <li>The product itself is good.  </li>
            <li>This is a totally amazing skin refinish cream.</li>
            <li>What use is a product, no matter how effective, when you can&#x27;t access the goods?  </li>
            <li>I was excited to order this product after reading all the great reviews.  </li>
            <li>More effective</li>
            <li>so far i have used it for a couple of weeks, no breakouts or adverse reactions which is an excellent start for me.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best product on earth to make skin as smooth as glass.  </li>
            <li>I love the results I get every time I use it.  </li>
            <li>and it feels ok.</li>
            <li>I love this product and will never use another.</li>
            <li>So for me, use M2 every night, wash my face with anti-bacterial soap in the morning and before the M2 application at night, don&#x27;t touch my hands to my face throughout the day, stay away from any products from South America :) and I am acne free.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought it for my huge pore issue, so I am satisfied with the results!!  </li>
            <li>and then my makeup and its fine.</li>
            <li>The hyperpigmentation areas look fantastic.</li>
            <li>The ingredients listed are good quality, natural products from what I&#x27;ve researched.</li>
            <li>Not the best packaging design as far as how the pump &amp;#34;pops up.&amp;#34; Product is very sticky, it is very important to apply as thinly as possible as the directions state.</li>
            <li>Let me start out by saying that I have had acne since I was 12 years old, and it has not been kind to me.</li>
            <li>There really is nothing more to say about it than that</li>
            <li>When I inquired, she told me about M2, which apparently is quite popular amongst college girls.</li>
            <li>so it is worth the money because it works with my skin and eliminates all the anxiety a breakout causes.</li>
            <li>Helped really clear my face, minimized my pores &amp; made my skin super smooth.</li>
            <li>I first wash my hands then face with unscented anti-bacterial soap.  </li>
            <li>As other raters have suggested, the product is quite sticky and does not have the best smell; however, the result is definitely worth a little bit of discomfort.</li>
            <li>It really works great to lighten dark spots and red acne scars/marks on the face.</li>
            <li>Feels a little sticky on the skin but feels nice once it is washed off in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Almost immediately, skin was much smoother and healthier looking.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t use too much or it will leave your face feeling sticky and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even tho I only applied a light layer &amp; rubbed it in, I noticed the pillow stuck to my face.</li>
            <li>and I knew I could not have used the whole bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many different OTC acne treatments and this is the only one that consistently works for my skin type.  </li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and my dark spots got lighter.</li>
            <li>I was first intrigued when a student with skin troubles showed up with clear skin (in matter of days).</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I used the old formula of this brand years ago and really like it</li>
            <li>In the description of this it clearly states that this is for the M2 skin refinish 20%.</li>
            <li>Within the first two days of using, I noticed my very acne prone skin because very soft and the dead skin started to slough off.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product only as a twice a year treatment because its a little strong.</li>
            <li>Many girls suffer from dark spots on their skin due to birth control and I am no exception.</li>
            <li>That being said, I know it is an old wives tale, but if I eat any significant amount of chocolate I will have a small break out (also with eating quinoa...</li>
            <li>I have seen a small different on my face and I am expecting that later on the improvement will be better.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed any other results as far as differences in acne breakouts or wrinkles, but maybe over time there will be some improvements in those areas.  </li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s enough to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Just last time received wrong low strength paid for stronger formula ..like the stronger formula better...!</li>
            <li>And the pump dispenses enough to get as much as needed in small amounts without  wasting product (I have other pump dispenser products that  cause waste when I want to pump more than once).</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this product based on other reviews.  </li>

            <li> The bottle should last a long time.</li>

            <li> You might go to bed with terrible red marks on your face but wake up with beautiful skin in the morning.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about a week, and my scars and indents seem noticeably less red, and the acne that was there is already starting to disappear.</li>

            <li> I have used it for about a month or so now every night and sometimes in the morning under my makeup unless my skin gets too dry and starts peeling, then I take a break from it for a day or two.  </li>
            <li> It comes with the warning that it may dry skin out to cause peeling</li>
            <li> I let my face dry for about five minutes and apply evenly with ≈1.5 squirts of M2.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it help with my acne, but it helps the dark spots fade over time as well.</li>
            <li> I have tried various other products and while they work for a little while, eventually the acne pops back</li>
            <li> It feels a little bit sticky when applied to the face, I do recommend applying it with enough time before bed.</li>
            <li> The melasma has faded somewhat, but of course, will never really go away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s now been several weeks and some very dark hyper-pigmented spots due to my acne are lightening up.</li>
            <li> really bad, just strong) due to the acids and ingredients of the product.</li>
            <li> I was shocked and elated when after a few hours of using it for the first time, the pores on my nose, cheeks, and forehead were noticeably smaller!!</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t typically have acne, few shows up from time to time.</li>
            <li> tightens pores helped tame my acne down.</li>
            <li> It is little sticky but i dont mind because i use this at night time.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky like other customers have mentioned and it can be annoying at times, but like everyone else said moisturizer helps.  </li>
            <li> Not only was I having a difficult time with blemishes on my face but also with even skin tone.</li>
            <li> but it could be some psychological reason that as an engineer I fail to understand)  </li>
            <li> Started using this in my late 40&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> Just random breakouts here and there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel a bad smell as others have mention.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Almost immediately, skin was much smoother and healthier looking. I have moderate melasma and some hyperpigmentation and this product has really helped -- it does take a few weeks though.  The hyperpigmentation areas look fantastic. The melasma has faded somewhat, but of course, will never really go away. The melasma is guaranteed to flare again if I don&#x27;t use my sunscreen. (Use your sunscreen people!!)  The bottle should last a long time. It only takes a dab. Don&#x27;t use too much or it will leave your face feeling sticky and gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using this product along with the M2 Exfoliating Cleanser and plan on purchasing both again once I run out.</li>
            <li> The wife loves this.  great price.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin and was having a hard time trying to find something that would help to control my break-outs as I have gotten older.  Started using this in my late 40&#x27;s.  Still using it in my mid-50&#x27;s and it is also great for age spots.</li>
            <li> In the description of this it clearly states that this is for the M2 skin refinish 20%. I received the lower strength 12%! Thankfully Amazon is awesome and is refunding my money.&lt;br /&gt;I feel the seller was purposely misrepresenting themselves!</li>
            <li> I like that it supposedly helps not only prevent future acne outbreaks but also helps shrink pores &amp; improves the look or scarred skin. However, it feels tacky once applied. Even tho I only applied a light layer &amp; rubbed it in, I noticed the pillow stuck to my face. I dislike that.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best product on earth to make skin as smooth as glass.  I keep 2 on hand at all times because I would never run the risk of running out.  Love, love, love it!</li>
            <li> The product itself is good.  Feels a little sticky on the skin but feels nice once it is washed off in the morning.  My issue is the pump stopped working and I knew I could not have used the whole bottle.  Since the bottle is opaque, I took the bottle apart and emptied the contents into a jar, like another reviewer did.  This is a 50 ml bottle, I emptied 20 ml into my jar.  What use is a product, no matter how effective, when you can&#x27;t access the goods?  Message to the manufacturer: forget the fancy packing, just give us a bottle that works.  Customers are paying for 50 ml, give us what we paid for.  I will not buy this again if the bottle is in the current design.</li>
            <li> LOVE this serum!!! I have been using this serum for a couple of years and I think it is incredible. Not only does it help with my acne, but it helps the dark spots fade over time as well. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I used the old formula of this brand years ago and really like it so I was a bit hesitant to try the brand after the name changed. Within the first two days of using, I noticed my very acne prone skin because very soft and the dead skin started to slough off. It&#x27;s now been several weeks and some very dark hyper-pigmented spots due to my acne are lightening up. I&#x27;m very happy with the product and will order again!</li>
            <li> I was first intrigued when a student with skin troubles showed up with clear skin (in matter of days). When I inquired, she told me about M2, which apparently is quite popular amongst college girls. Although I don&#x27;t typically have acne, few shows up from time to time. just a dab of M2 clears up my skin by next morning. As other raters have suggested, the product is quite sticky and does not have the best smell; however, the result is definitely worth a little bit of discomfort.</li>
            <li> This is a totally amazing skin refinish cream. I love the results I get every time I use it.  It&#x27;s like putting on a mask over night. The ingredients listed are good quality, natural products from what I&#x27;ve researched. And the pump dispenses enough to get as much as needed in small amounts without  wasting product (I have other pump dispenser products that  cause waste when I want to pump more than once).</li>
            <li> Let me start out by saying that I have had acne since I was 12 years old, and it has not been kind to me. At this point, my cheeks are patches of scars and indents with pimples still popping up whenever they feel like it. I have tried various other products and while they work for a little while, eventually the acne pops back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff seems to work. I have been using this product for about a week, and my scars and indents seem noticeably less red, and the acne that was there is already starting to disappear. I am going to continue using this product for a month, and update this review at that time, but I have a feeling that it will have a place in my bathroom for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that this product is sticky when you place it on your skin, and my wife hates that. Just a heads up.</li>
            <li> This stuff just flat out does not work for me.  There really is nothing more to say about it than that however, it may work for you.</li>
            <li> I was excited to order this product after reading all the great reviews.  I was shocked and elated when after a few hours of using it for the first time, the pores on my nose, cheeks, and forehead were noticeably smaller!! I have used it for about a month or so now every night and sometimes in the morning under my makeup unless my skin gets too dry and starts peeling, then I take a break from it for a day or two.  I haven&#x27;t really noticed any other results as far as differences in acne breakouts or wrinkles, but maybe over time there will be some improvements in those areas.  I mainly bought it for my huge pore issue, so I am satisfied with the results!!  It is very sticky like other customers have mentioned and it can be annoying at times, but like everyone else said moisturizer helps.  I also use it sometimes under my makeup during the day and then the stickiness isn&#x27;t a problem because I put moisturizer on over it and then my makeup and its fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for 2 weeks and it feels ok. I have seen a small different on my face and I am expecting that later on the improvement will be better. It feels a little bit sticky when applied to the face, I do recommend applying it with enough time before bed. I didn&#x27;t feel a bad smell as others have mention.</li>
            <li> Helped really clear my face, minimized my pores &amp; made my skin super smooth. It also helped with my blotchy complexion of post acne scars. I would recommend this product only as a twice a year treatment because its a little strong.</li>
            <li> Many girls suffer from dark spots on their skin due to birth control and I am no exception. Not only was I having a difficult time with blemishes on my face but also with even skin tone. I bought this product and read rave reviews about it. It comes with the warning that it may dry skin out to cause peeling but if you use the smallest amount of aveeno lotion (not even M2&#x27;s line of lotion) you will not have an issue. You might go to bed with terrible red marks on your face but wake up with beautiful skin in the morning. I love this product and will never use another. I don&#x27;t even have terrible skin. Just random breakouts here and there. I only use this product 2 times a week and that&#x27;s enough to keep my skin clear. And ALWAYS wear 15 spf on my face.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this product based on other reviews.  I just can&#x27;t say that I noticed a difference in my skin after using it.</li>
            <li> Loved it! tightens pores helped tame my acne down. ..Just last time received wrong low strength paid for stronger formula ..like the stronger formula better...! More effective</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth and my dark spots got lighter. It is little sticky but i dont mind because i use this at night time.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different OTC acne treatments and this is the only one that consistently works for my skin type.  I use it every night before bed.  I first wash my hands then face with unscented anti-bacterial soap.  I let my face dry for about five minutes and apply evenly with ≈1.5 squirts of M2.  That being said, I know it is an old wives tale, but if I eat any significant amount of chocolate I will have a small break out (also with eating quinoa... I have done extensive tests and have the data to correlate intake to break outs... but it could be some psychological reason that as an engineer I fail to understand)  Each bottle of M2 last me about 6 months so it is worth the money because it works with my skin and eliminates all the anxiety a breakout causes. So for me, use M2 every night, wash my face with anti-bacterial soap in the morning and before the M2 application at night, don&#x27;t touch my hands to my face throughout the day, stay away from any products from South America :) and I am acne free.</li>
            <li> Not the best packaging design as far as how the pump &amp;#34;pops up.&amp;#34; Product is very sticky, it is very important to apply as thinly as possible as the directions state. This is not to be worn during daytime or under make-up. Should be worn at night/bedtime. It does have a stronger smell(not really bad, just strong) due to the acids and ingredients of the product. It really works great to lighten dark spots and red acne scars/marks on the face. Results show within a day or two. I do recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I am still in the process of trying this. so far i have used it for a couple of weeks, no breakouts or adverse reactions which is an excellent start for me.</li>
