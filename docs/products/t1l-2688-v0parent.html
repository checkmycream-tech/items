            <li>I had thought that these salts were coarser when I ordered, but they are very fine grain.</li>
            <li>These, however, almost magically disappear as soon as I put them in the water.  </li>
            <li>My skin always feels nice and smooth after I get out of my bath, and I feel relaxed.  </li>
            <li>I decided to do a detox bath with this instead, and I swear it works better than anything I ever used before.</li>
            <li>that I was able to transfer it into.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better bath products I have purchased.</li>
            <li>I can not say enough good about these!!</li>
            <li>hotter the better in terms of water temperature</li>
            <li>is it dissolves quicker and more fully.</li>
            <li>I suffer from peripheral neuropathy and soaking my feet in these salts and hot water did not make them feel good.</li>
            <li>I mix 2 cups with a full tub of warm bath water.</li>
            <li>but I was hoping that the salt wouldn&#x27;t be so finely ground.</li>
            <li>I have been using these bath salts for years to help my psoriasis and my wife who has no skin condition uses them too to keep her skin hydrated and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for Dead Sea bath salts.</li>
            <li>It always makes me wonder if it&#x27;s genuine or not...</li>
            <li>Granules a small to medium size and perfect for the homemade bath salt gifts I was making.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pretty sure I will buy again</li>
            <li>They dissolve quickly and just make the bath water feel... silky?</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the dead sea salts.</li>
            <li>I mix 2 parts of these salts with 3 parts epsom salts, then add essential oils, and make my own bath salts.</li>
            <li>This is by far my favourite bath addition as it&#x27;s natural and has properties that make your skin look better and your muscles more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Dead Sea&#x27;s minerals have been used for centuries to rejuvinate and achieve younger, more beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>But I do love another brand a little more, (</li>
            <li>I have dry skin on my face and scalp, so I fill the sink with warm water and add some of this salt.</li>
            <li>This is a good product, it was just a little to course for the application I wished to used it for.</li>
            <li>These pads are mild and I found them useful on a long trip (good way to get around TSA regs on carrying liquids) because they are useful for refreshing the face, cleansing the face, hands, a quick sponge off  in the midst of travel (under arms and other areas needing attention when a bath is not possible).  </li>
            <li>It keeps my skin in good condition and I find that it&#x27;s most effective to use after a bad day in work (these happen far too often)</li>
            <li>In todays economy more is better for example two weeks at least.</li>
            <li>My skin is soft, smells sweet, and isn&#x27;t irritated.</li>
            <li>I added some lavender, clary sage, and eucalyptus essential oils to mine to make my bath smell fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Very soothing for my irritated skin.</li>
            <li>but it really did not.</li>
            <li>It worked really well for that</li>
            <li>It actually works better when you scrub it all over your body with some natural oil.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li>and it seems to help my skin it makes my bath water feel nice its hard to explain</li>
            <li>They really do make my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t find them that much better than other similar wipes, which is why I gave them a three.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>You can go purchase generic Epsom Salt for considerably less and get better results than with this bag</li>
            <li>It makes the bags last a lot longer than filling a whole bath with it.</li>
            <li>I found their website, they are based in the UK (wow, go figure) and even then still found no ingredient list.  </li>
            <li>I have been doing any number of natural things to help so</li>
            <li>The product us good, it&#x27;s just too expensive for the amount they put in the bags.</li>
            <li>I instinctively closed my eyes when I first saw it.  </li>
            <li>I have a hard job teaching high school English, and a good soak in these salts helps me decompress after a hard day.</li>
            <li>Not really sure how it works, but dead sea salt is amazing.</li>
            <li>After each bath I always use the silky smooth body lotion which I apply at least twice a day to help keep my condition at bay</li>

            <li> In the summer I even make powdered milk or tea baths and mix in a cup of dead sea salt.</li>
            <li> use this 3 times a week and find that throwing in a handful usually does the trick.</li>
            <li> I recommend doing it the night before a day off, because you will be very tired the next day.</li>

            <li> Crap!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I add it up to what I already have with an oil base and I just use it as a scrub instead of a bath. It actually works better when you scrub it all over your body with some natural oil.</li>
            <li> Not really sure how it works, but dead sea salt is amazing. I have dry skin on my face and scalp, so I fill the sink with warm water and add some of this salt. It makes the bags last a lot longer than filling a whole bath with it. I definitely recomend it if you havent tried it before.</li>
            <li> I have Psoriasis and my derm advised to take warm baths so I purchased this in hopes that it would reduce the inflammation or at least have an effect on my Psoriasis, which it didn&#x27;t seem to do much. It doesnt have any fragrance which is good, but i just didn&#x27;t see results. However, I do work out occasionally and would use this to alleviate the muscle soreness. Not what I hoped for but worked for something.</li>
            <li> These salts dissolve like a dream.  Most commercial bath salts that I buy at, say, a department store, take quite a while to dissolve and end up sitting on the bottom of the tub making it uncomfortable for awhile.  These, however, almost magically disappear as soon as I put them in the water.  The salts themselves don&#x27;t have any aroma.  I added some lavender, clary sage, and eucalyptus essential oils to mine to make my bath smell fantastic.  My skin always feels nice and smooth after I get out of my bath, and I feel relaxed.  I highly recommend these.</li>
            <li> My reiki instructor suggested this for me as a replacement for epsom salt for my baths. I decided to do a detox bath with this instead, and I swear it works better than anything I ever used before. I recommend doing it the night before a day off, because you will be very tired the next day. I recommend drinking lots of fluids and allowing your body to relax afterwards. You will feel great!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife, and she swears by it.  The only thing I wish is that the bag was resealable.  Good thing I had a few empty jars lying around that I was able to transfer it into.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better bath products I have purchased. Very soothing for my irritated skin. And the aroma is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> These are terrific bath salts. They really do make my skin soft. I have a hard job teaching high school English, and a good soak in these salts helps me decompress after a hard day.</li>
            <li> I needed a fluffer bag of Dead Sea salt to maintain my skin in between shipments from Saltworks, a.k.a. They Who Supply Utopia in Salt Form, so I got this 2 lb bag of crap made by \\&quot;Spa Magik\\&quot;.  I normally do not trust any business that intentionally misspells its name out of scorn and disgust for their poor vocabulary skills, but I was desperate to keep my psoriasis (and RA--I&#x27;ve hit the Autoimmune Powerball, yay for me).  How horrible is their product?  Let me count the ways...  Quality Dead Sea salt is a quite dingy shade of off-white.  The whiter the salt, the poorer the mineral content and quality.  Their salt is so blindingly white I instinctively closed my eyes when I first saw it.  Quality manufacturers include a list of their quality ingredients.  Spa Magik includes a breakdown of the mineral content of unprocessed Dead Sea salt, it is not indicative of the bag&#x27;s makeup.  I found their website, they are based in the UK (wow, go figure) and even then still found no ingredient list.  Spa Magik does admit however that it is not a luxury brand, and then promotes its sister product which they claim is luxury.  I contacted the MagiKians at Spa Magik and politely asked for a list of ingredients.  The phone call was dropped, how convenient.  The email I sent has yet to receive a response.  To summarize, THIS PRODUCT BLOWS!!  You can go purchase generic Epsom Salt for considerably less and get better results than with this bag o&#x27; crapple. Salt lovers, stay away...you and I both know that Dead Sea salt does not make bathwater cloudy or skin itchy &amp; greasy at the same time.  Idk what this is, but I DO know it&#x27;s not solely salt from the Dead Sea as the advertisement claimed.</li>
            <li> I have had a sudden onset of eczema on my hands. NEVER had to deal with anything like this before in my life and I&#x27;m in my 70&#x27;s now.  I read that people who had psoriasis or eczema who went to Israel and soaked in the Dead Sea actually had marked improvement in their condition. Well I can&#x27;t afford to go to Israel, so I brought some of the Dead Sea Salts to me, and soaked my hands in them.  Hopefully, it&#x27;s helping!  I have been doing any number of natural things to help so, honestly, I cannot say that this is the cure, but,,,,the skin rash I have been experiencing IS getting better. Slowly.</li>
            <li> I mix 2 parts of these salts with 3 parts epsom salts, then add essential oils, and make my own bath salts. I had thought that these salts were coarser when I ordered, but they are very fine grain. They dissolve quickly and just make the bath water feel... silky? Vastly different than just using epsom salts, even though I&#x27;m mixing the two salts together.</li>
            <li> These pads are mild and I found them useful on a long trip (good way to get around TSA regs on carrying liquids) because they are useful for refreshing the face, cleansing the face, hands, a quick sponge off  in the midst of travel (under arms and other areas needing attention when a bath is not possible).  I didn&#x27;t find them that much better than other similar wipes, which is why I gave them a three.&lt;br /&gt;But I did appreciate their mildness.</li>

            <li> I bought this to make a variety of bath salts for the ladies in my family. It worked really well for that but I was hoping that the salt wouldn&#x27;t be so finely ground. It looks prettier in the jars if its a but chunkier and less uniform.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even feel like salt idk what this was . Crap!!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money . Shipping also took too long</li>
            <li> This is by far my favourite bath addition as it&#x27;s natural and has properties that make your skin look better and your muscles more relaxed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this 3 times a week and find that throwing in a handful usually does the trick. Its best to add the water first, add the salt and then mix it with your hand to separate and disperse the salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The hotter the better in terms of water temperature and I soak in it until the water goes coldish (30-45 mins). It keeps my skin in good condition and I find that it&#x27;s most effective to use after a bad day in work (these happen far too often) or after a hard session in the gym.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I wouldn&#x27;t recommend though is to thrown the salt water over your hair because it makes it terribly dry and unmanageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be buying a bigger bag next time in order to save a few £££££.</li>
            <li> When my daughter was an infant she had horrible eczema, so every night we would give her a sea salt bath in the kitchen sink and it help a lot.  Through trial and error we have thankfully found a moisturizing regimen that works for her and she doesn&#x27;t need this anymore so my wife sometimes putrs it in her own bath.  It does leave your skin feeling very nice.</li>
            <li> This is great cheap salt and it works great for baths. The only problem is that is contains grains of sand or dirt as well as salt (not a bunch but noticeable).</li>
            <li> The product us good, it&#x27;s just too expensive for the amount they put in the bags. For those who bathe daily &amp; have jetted tubes, the product does not but a week. In todays economy more is better for example two weeks at least.</li>
            <li> I suffer from peripheral neuropathy and soaking my feet in these salts and hot water did not make them feel good. Sorry. That is the reason I purchased this product. Never did soak in the tub with this, so I can&#x27;t say how it would affect the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my husband. He has psoriasis and it did make a difference on his skin. It worked great on his hands.</li>
            <li> This is a good product, it was just a little to course for the application I wished to used it for. Great it you were usisng in for bath salts.</li>
            <li> I like it, use it for my baby girl who suffers from ezcema.  But I do love another brand a little more, (One with Nature Bath Salts, Dead Sea Mineral, Eucalyptus - 32 oz  also comes in lavendar and another scent) simply for the scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dead sea salts are the only way i have found to keep my baby from having flare ups. it soothes her skin and i believe it calms her.  I mean, come on, who doesn&#x27;t love a nice salt soak??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus this brand has over the other is it dissolves quicker and more fully.</li>
            <li> This is the best price I&#x27;ve found for Dead Sea bath salts. It always makes me wonder if it&#x27;s genuine or not... Anyway, I gave this as a gift to someone for Christmas. Got a good review from him. That&#x27;s all I can ask for, I guess.</li>
            <li> I been using it when I take a bath and it seems to help my skin it makes my bath water feel nice its hard to explain but I&#x27;m pretty sure I will buy again</li>
            <li> Cannot tell you about the quality , it looked  god just barely enough for a couple of baths. , I realize the weight is on the order guide .</li>
            <li> Around the time of the changing of the seasons I either have tons of rashes in secret places or just dry skin due to eczema. This salt soothes my skin. It doesn&#x27;t take the place of fexofenadine or expensive creams, but the redness and stinging pain does get better after a long soak in this stuff every 5-6 days. I mix 2 cups with a full tub of warm bath water. In the summer I even make powdered milk or tea baths and mix in a cup of dead sea salt. My skin is soft, smells sweet, and isn&#x27;t irritated.</li>
