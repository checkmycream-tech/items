    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>In conclusion...one of my best investments!</li>
            <li>thus Braun SE7281WD Epilator and Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li>but this one is really wonderful!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years and this one is the best without a doubt!  </li>
            <li>The fact that you can use it in the shower is priceless!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li>Yes, anything that takes your hair out by the root will hurt, I don&#x27;t think the best epilator in the world could stop that, so don&#x27;t ever expect it to feel like a massage.</li>
            <li>the finer hairs do break - these are best to attack with the slower mode, which is easier on the hair 3)</li>
            <li>Wanted to get a rechargeable one and after reviewing, this one seemed the best.  </li>
            <li>So if you are looking, this is the best one!</li>
            <li>By the way - Laser Hair Removal actually is awesome.  </li>
            <li>This one is the best.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good buy!</li>
            <li>Not for the meek, but this is the best epilator money can buy.  </li>
            <li>I have not and probably will not use it on my bikini line, though the razor and trimmer on this thing is awesome.  </li>
            <li>The best part about this product is it can be used in the bath or shower.</li>
            <li>Anyhow I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t stop!!!!    </li>
            <li>still very happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have always used epilators but this is the best quality i have ever used.</li>
            <li>This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in months...</li>

            <li>Good luck!</li>
            <li>Just used my beautiful Braun Xpressive Body System on my arms and legs tonight in the shower.</li>
            <li>I bought this three years ago, and it still works beautifully.</li>
            <li>, this is an excellent product and I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends many times!</li>
            <li>I recommended to my friend and she is happy with that as well.</li>
            <li>Happy hair removal.  </li>
            <li>A GREAT feature is</li>
            <li>Design is great.</li>
            <li>The trimmer also works great too.   </li>
            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>I use this everywhere which is great, too  </li>
            <li>Used to have the corded version and although it worked great</li>
            <li>It does not eliminate the pain but it does greatly reduce it.</li>
            <li>That would be a great product feature.</li>
            <li>this is a great deal for all the money and time you will save  *</li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s my advice- while it is a great idea</li>
            <li>This is a great product.</li>
            <li>Great</li>
            <li>The shaver/trimmer option works great too.    </li>
            <li>This one does a great job, removes all the hair and no need to worry about re growth for a couple of weeks.   </li>
            <li>This product is amazing!</li>
            <li>I have used many &amp; this is THE BEST.</li>
            <li>:)Everything else is just great about this product...!!!</li>
            <li>Battery wise...</li>
            <li>The product is good.</li>
            <li>Since it is meant to be an epilator, the shaver is not as good as i would like it to be..</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you if it works good or not because I cant even use the thing.</li>
            <li>Orange one seems to be good to me</li>
            <li>Pain: Yes you get used to the pain, I don&#x27;t use soothing creams or anything, sometimes I trick my mind by thinking \\&quot;ahh, this feels good..</li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>To be totally fair to newbies, no, I didn&#x27;t get here overnight.  </li>
            <li>the wet/dry feature is really good for cleaning it.</li>
            <li>But I decided I would give myself about 6 weeks and see how it did pain wise.</li>
            <li>and it still did just as good as a wax would.</li>
            <li>*almost* feels good in a way, but not quite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>and I am delighted.</li>
            <li>good machine to have in the bath for her.</li>
            <li>Good job Braum.</li>
            <li>I think the massage cap is really good</li>
            <li>This product seams to work good on me.</li>
            <li>This product is good because it can be used in the water/shower.</li>
            <li>It may be a good device, but not for me.</li>
            <li>I definately recommend buying this product if you are looking for a good epilator.   </li>
            <li>The trimmer works fairly well, and it&#x27;s nice to have a device that is so multifunctional (great for traveling).  </li>
            <li>I was all excited with the cordless feature, what a great innovation!  </li>
            <li>Considering the pain I went through with my asymmetrical brazillian, the legs were EASY!!</li>
            <li>This epilator has held up exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfying to watch them disappear as the epilator goes over them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not tried it in the shower yet, as I&#x27;m happy about being able to set out a towel and watch tv and have a snack while I do this thing.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li>I love it great product A</li>
            <li>the more it hurts!)</li>
            <li>and I love it!  </li>
            <li>This product was wonderful at first.</li>
            <li>Ooo I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li>and OMG I love it even now!</li>
            <li>I was very excited about this purchase!  </li>
            <li>I am very happy with this purchase, I had used an epilator about 25 years ago and it was pure torture.  </li>
            <li>The light is a great add on.</li>
            <li>the result is amazing.......</li>
            <li>it was amazing</li>
            <li>The light on it is absolutely great and illuminates hairs</li>
            <li>The wipes looked good but are mostly un-necessary.    </li>
            <li>For the face i honestly prefer the tweezers but it can be used on there too.</li>
            <li>The unit is nicely designed and rests effortlessly in the palm of the hand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li>... makes a nice paper weight...</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done my armpits but thats when the shaving head comes in handy.</li>
            <li>You kind of have to keep up with it as your hair grows and figure out which hairs grow in what direction.  </li>
            <li>I liked the idea of being cordless</li>
            <li>also it&#x27;s equally effective for bikini line.   </li>
            <li>- It is extremely effective; almost as effective as waxing&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I honestly wish I had saved money and gotten the corded one.  </li>
            <li>This is surprisingly gentle when you use it as an epilator and the shaver/trimmer is excellent as well.  </li>
            <li>but it was time consuming and lacked some features that I thought would be nice.</li>
            <li>I bought this after checking my own friends skin after epilation.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a Panasonic ES2045 Wet/Dry Epilator which works great from a friend that I know well and throughly cleaned and sanitized the unit before use.</li>
            <li>It also reall gentle on my skin, and love the light!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I also like that is a good size and easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I also used the shaver head and it&#x27;s pretty good too!    </li>
            <li>The charging light indicator is a good addition since I always used to forget when I kept it for charging</li>
            <li>There is even a considerably bright light in this epilator, which helps to detect hiding hair.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, but I love the fact that it rinses out with water nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is by far the best epilator I have ever tried.</li>
            <li>I am in love with my new best friend.</li>
            <li>The price is well invested, as one will see great results right away.</li>
            <li>I have very fine and VERY light colored hair...</li>
            <li>The first use worked great</li>
            <li>This is a great hair removal device and my first epilator.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s great for beginners or even for the more experienced epilator-user who doesn&#x27;t wish to be stuck next to an outlet.</li>
            <li>It is also a very easy to clean device!  </li>
            <li>(by the way you HAVE to tighten your skin to get a better epilating).     </li>
            <li>i simply love it and use it on my legs, armpits and bikini line.</li>
            <li>i also love that i can wash it under the water.</li>
            <li>The shaver is ok.</li>
            <li>In hindsight, I think the margaritas had more of an effect than the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4)  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s better to buy the epliator that is connected to the charger.</li>
            <li>Hair removal in the shower is way more convenient.</li>
            <li>Trust me, it is easier the more you use it.</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the design.  </li>
            <li>I am flabbergasted at how many hairs it finds.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable</li>
            <li>I have to admit that I m impressed on how well this product works..especially on the short hairs.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
            <li>This epilator is much more thorough, and that is why it is much better.  </li>
            <li>The build quality could have been better.</li>
            <li>Waited for a week or so and got more.  </li>
            <li>love this epilator.</li>
            <li>Much better option than me trying to dig it out with tweezers and making myself bleed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and the best part is: I don&#x27;t have to wait until most of the hair has regrown before I use it...in a similar fashion as shaving</li>
            <li>I hope it will help someone else out there.  :-)</li>
            <li>and I have enjoyed using this as an alternative to shaving.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>The shaver is okay; I tried it on my underarms (even with the 7281 I am timid to try epilating there)&lt;br</li>
            <li>(I no longer need to use the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mode unless I wait 2 weeks between uses, more hair&#x3D;more pain).</li>
            <li>Wish I had paid more attention while ordering</li>
            <li>the pain gets better.  </li>
            <li>If I go more than 2 weeks or so, it&#x27;s noticeable.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not awful-</li>
            <li>She has already used it, and is extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li>and after satisfying myself i orderd it.  </li>
            <li>So much better than shaving.</li>
            <li>(and convenient!)to have a cordless epilator to be able to use in the shower...</li>
            <li>I have shaved, waxed, lasered, and more.</li>
            <li>I love that this can travel with me</li>
            <li>I LOVE this epilator</li>
            <li>And I love that it is cordless and can be used in the shower, which I haven&#x27;t done yet but will.</li>
            <li>It would have been better to include this in the kit and to have the option to use it corded.    </li>
            <li>and she is pleased too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been more than a year or so now - and it has started making a lot of noise as if the blades are touching the covering on top.</li>
            <li>You will have to send the unit in and spend another 50 bucks or more to have it &amp;#34;fixed.&amp;#34; Do yourself a favor, and avoid this product.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would have purchased it from Amazon because I love Amazon.com</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>Anyways, I love this epilator.</li>
            <li>I love that it charges is an hour and lasts for 40 minutes as well.  </li>
            <li>Regarding the pain, it does get better over time.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use it in my bath without any worries at all.</li>
            <li>I shave the rest the more</li>
            <li>Does it get any better?</li>
            <li>with a pleasant surprise the product reached me within three days of placing order (my first ever purchase with amazon</li>
            <li>If you do a search about this product, you will see that a very significant number of people have problems with it not keeping a charge even after charging it all day.</li>
            <li>About this particular model: I think it&#x27;s really great</li>
            <li>The epilator, my first, which I have had for two months does a good job of removing hair, but breaks off more hair than I would like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy and comfortable to use in legs/arms and etc...</li>
            <li>First of all, this is a good epilator.  </li>
            <li>rechargeble battery work pretty good and</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to effectively :)</li>
            <li>you have fine hairs (like mine) that need more convincing and slip through the epilators</li>
            <li>It took the hair off so well, and was nearly painless (honestly, at this point, it feels like the skin is getting \\&quot;a good</li>
            <li>was very surprised and happy of the benefit of how well this product works.</li>
            <li>the best feature is that it goes under water and can be used on wet areas.</li>
            <li>I dont know how many people can actually enjoy afflicting pain on themselves, but I cannot.</li>
            <li>However, I did purchase the &#x27;after epilation&#x27; lotion, which I used afterwards, and it smells great and makes your legs feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Nice epilator, worth the money.</li>
            <li>I have a fair complexion with fine hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow particularly fast.</li>
            <li>every other at best</li>
            <li>I found that this model is very comfortable and using it on my legs and underarms was not painful in any way whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like to use this one in the shower because it doesn&#x27;t slide as easy.</li>
            <li>but after awhile it was easy to keep going.</li>
            <li>Removes hair easily.</li>
            <li>if you can brave that you definitely going to fall in love with epilating ur under arms.</li>
            <li>its so easy to use and work efficiently.</li>
            <li>It was really easy peasy compared to anything else.    </li>
            <li>It is painless, fast and best part is that you can use it anywhere, in the shower for bikini waxing, anywhere else in your privacy it does not require you to be near an outlet.</li>
            <li>and I end up feeling stubbles very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, no problems at all.</li>
            <li>i strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It is fully washable - a major win since oil buildup is the bane of epilators</li>
            <li>She liked it very much.</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;ve got a healthy amount of hair growth - I come from a germanic background, so shaving legs/bikini line for me isn&#x27;t really the best choice - also waxing only lasts a couple weeks for me</li>
            <li>I took a hot warm bath and tried afterward....</li>
            <li>I have been thrilled with this product, which performs exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time using an epilator of any kind.</li>
            <li>It had some of the best and most thorough reviews; (2) I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d prefer to use it in the shower or dry, so I wanted the wet/dry feature to test all the possibilities; and (3) I liked that this came with several \\&quot;heads\\</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s super fast, smooth and doesn&#x27;t hurt as older models, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s waterproof and when I dropped it in the sink, it came out just fine.  </li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;ll give it four stars because it does as good a job as any epilator could, most my complaints have to do with epilating in general.</li>
            <li>All in all, it is the best solution I have come across for leg hair, and if it lasts a long time it will be well worth the money.</li>
            <li>you won&#x27;t care because the remaining hairs are so fine)    </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>I went ahead and filled the tub with warm to hot water and soaked for about 15 miutes, then worked the epilator over both legs and my bikini area.  </li>
            <li>May be my hairs are too fine and break.</li>
            <li>This is the very first epilator I have ever been able to manage to use on my legs and do it all in one session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using the epilator DRY and in a lot of good light I am able to get most if not all of those fine hairs.    </li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is huge too.</li>
            <li>The light, this makes all the difference, and I never thought it would.</li>
            <li>This came with the free pack of pre-epilation wipes that I have not used so can&#x27;t give you any detail on them.  </li>
            <li>I also have a Braun 5270 model - which is corded and seems to be much more powerful.  </li>
            <li>The head on my 7281 epilator needs to be replaced and at this point replacement heads won&#x27;t be available until the end of Jan. 2010.  </li>
            <li>Once the head is available it will cost over $44 to replace...</li>
            <li>I have had smooth, smooth legs for DAYS.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read solutions to this like going ahead and shaving with a razor after epilating if you want the really smooth feel.    </li>
            <li>how smooth you want to be.</li>
            <li>but I do it based on wanting a smooth feeling versus hairless appearance.    </li>
            <li>I had brought it back with me from Europe 10 years ago, but I was quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>I used the efficiency cap on my legs and in 15 minutes, I had smooth, touchable skin.</li>
            <li>the product is really compact, handy and one can use it just anywhere anytime.</li>
            <li>Rather than that making me happy, it actually makes me nervous that it isn&#x27;t getting all of the hairs.</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I would say that the \\&quot;hair free for 4-6</li>
            <li>My legs are silky smooth</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic epilator.</li>
            <li>so I think this has a lot to do with the amount of pain I can endure for the thought of being smooth for up to 4 weeks at a time.  </li>
            <li>So my hands never feel as smooth even after epilation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Sorry for the rambling review, but if you have any questions feel free to ask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifier</li>
            <li>I will first say that before you use this- do your research!!</li>
            <li>I have not yet started using it on my bikini area since that seems much more sensitive to me, but that works out ok since it comes with a pretty nice shaver.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to be very powerful.</li>
            <li>B000KKUW6M Loofah Back Massager Brush with Ergonomic Grip Handle]]- works perfect not only to prevent ingrown hair but also leaves your skin very smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li>This one is wireless, quick, easy to clean and its charge lasts for three to four sessions.</li>
            <li>I wanted to be able to epilate my legs and underarms, and this product performs pretty well.</li>
            <li>Also, is the first epilator I&#x27;ve been able to use on my face without reaction.</li>
            <li>Also if you aren&#x27;t familiar with how to use and epilator read the instructions it doesn&#x27;t work like a razor</li>
            <li>First time just got the top layer.  </li>
            <li>plus, I&#x27;ve undergone waxing so many times, so it couldn&#x27;t possibly hurt more than that!</li>
            <li>I was so excited about two things on this one: the rechargeable battery, and the wet/dry ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I LOVE the smart light</li>
            <li>At first I was very excited for it seemed to work.</li>
            <li>You can disassemble the parts and clean them at home.  </li>
            <li>This is the 3rd I&#x27;ve owned and by far the best.</li>
            <li>, I can epilate anytime I need to and have soft, smooth skin!!</li>
            <li>&quot; so I could work my way into it with the massaging head, and use the precision head for special areas, etc.  </li>
            <li>but she was SO RIGHT!  </li>
            <li>I have tried and owned it all: razors, electric razor, the original Epilady back more than 25 years ago, the Smooth Away system, Nair, and a really nice hot wax kit.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only ever owned this epilator, but in the 4+ months I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li>Its really good and seems like an improvement on earlier versions of Braun epilators.</li>
            <li>A true keeper.</li>
            <li>I really love having underarms with no stubble shadow, and they feel much smoother.</li>
            <li>&amp; I absolutely fell in love with...</li>
            <li>I found that it took about a month before I really was able to \\&quot;get them all\\&quot;.      </li>
            <li>Soaking in a warm tub, drinking a bottle of wine, and yelling loudly helped.  </li>
            <li>Things I loved about waxing: regrowth was slower; no razor rash or tiny purple dots at each hair follicle(!!!).</li>
            <li>I tried to do it at home with ready to use wax strips, which are okay to use on legs, but one can not use them efficiently for arms</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very helpful in letting me see which spots needs more attention.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this is true</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see the advantage to being able to use the epilator in the shower.</li>
            <li>Love it, fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and works extremely well, with continued use</li>
            <li>Many epilators get great reviews, so I had a hard time deciding on one.</li>
            <li>Yes, there is what I would call discomfort with the first and most ambitious hair removal, but I suggest that you do use the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; head with it.</li>
            <li>This model works much better than the older Braun epilator.  </li>
            <li>A newbie may also experience some skin tenderness/bruising afterwards but it&#x27;ll quickly fade in 24 to 48 hours.    </li>
            <li>I am sure it is more efficient, but that is why you have to go back ansd forth like they tell you not to.  </li>
            <li>I went back to researching, I read so many reviews and many of you probably have and will.</li>
            <li>the light is more clear then the one i saw in store.  </li>
            <li>but your body quickly gets used to the sensation</li>
            <li>Yes, you can get a pretty great shave from this, but you have to be willing to do one, or a combination of several things:</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to try how good it is.</li>
            <li>This is my first Epilator ever!</li>
            <li>But does it hurt first time use?!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li>I finally made the leap and purchased this Braun epilator and are so glad that I did!</li>
            <li>While the dry only version predecessor was prone to pinch the skin, this improved design is perfect.</li>
            <li>i found the spot light really helpful as it makes even the smallest of hair noticeable, if you want a quick epilation better to use it without the pivotal head and use it dry.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and it isn&#x27;t as loud as some review have mentioned!</li>
            <li>My legs have very sparse, fine hair.</li>
            <li>Since I had grown use to my last epilator I was extremely surprised that this one felt so much better and barely noticed any pain; as well as I don&#x27;t have to wax anymore saving so much more money now by spending more on the better epilator.</li>
            <li>That was the positive turning point for me as it significantly helped to desensitize the skin.</li>
            <li>If you can find a place that&#x27;s cheap enough and someone who is experienced enough, DO IT!!!!</li>
            <li>I really like the light.</li>
            <li>Overall its good and does its job very well.</li>
            <li>This is NOT as much of a problem with the 7281 model and it removes hair much more gently.    </li>
            <li>I now prefer the regular attachment for efficiency, but the massager is great on the remaining sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>This model has more tweezers, so I finish my epilation 3 times faster than with the old one.</li>
            <li>One is pulling out fewer hairs and they truly, honestly, I swear, cross my heart . . .</li>
            <li>a deep salt scrub always helps the problem (I make my own:</li>
            <li>You can save a good amount of money and get a corded Braun that will last much longer than this unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Given all of that and just how well this unit works I would say that it is definitely worth the selling</li>
            <li>I would say that it is definitely worth the selling</li>
            <li>It did take a while to do my legs, but it was so worth it.</li>
            <li>As far as epilating, it&#x27;s great as long as there is full power in the battery.</li>
            <li>I have used it in the shower so far and love the results.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty fast and easy.</li>
            <li>I only epilate once a week to start and the Braun significantly gets more hairs the Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The battery lasted long enough to do both legs one after the other, I LOVE the wet/dry capability, cordless is great, and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>I tried other epilators with 70 tweezers that did not do as good of a job as this one with about 40 tweezers.</li>
            <li>Right?</li>
            <li>I have bought this Braun to ma wife and no any issue w/ it up to right now.</li>
            <li>Ok my sweet hubby got me this for Christmas last year.  </li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t need any special soothing creams or gentle &#x27;caps&#x27; or anything.  </li>
            <li>Rechargeable Wet &amp; Dry Epilator]]This is the best epilator that I have ever used.</li>
            <li>I primarily use it on my underarms with good results, but I have found it more difficult to use on my legs.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has a light, although I normally use it on well lit areas, so</li>
            <li>The battery holds a nice long charge and this has held up well over time</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not hard, so they should make the battery available for purchase via their web site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will agree with another review on here that no matter what you can&#x27;t be silky smooth because of the cycle of the hair growth, you just can&#x27;t catch the teeny short fine hairs that are just popping up to the surface.  </li>
            <li>But outside of this little detail, everything about this product is excellent.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s very sturdy, I&#x27;ve never had problems with the tweezing mechanisms, and it has a nice, solid feel.</li>
            <li>Pointers for the first time user: shave first and allow a noticeable stubble regrowth (2 to 3 days worth).  </li>
            <li>its so much change then one i saw in stores and to be honest i did not even saw the same model in stores.  </li>
            <li>The smart light is also really really good although that may be one of the reasons that I am not completely satisfied with the product... because I can see the hairs that aren&#x27;t pulled out.    </li>
            <li>This epilator is perfect to use wet or dry!!</li>
            <li>you can&#x27;t see it under normal circumstances, but in the summer when the light outside hits my legs they light up like a christmas tree!  </li>
            <li>I think the fact that you can get it wet is meant more so you can clean it-</li>
            <li>and I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to charge it, now the light becomes steady and I take it off.    </li>
            <li>- first I&#x27;ll epilate my forearms and legs earlier in the day, then when I go out for something special, I&#x27;ll use those sand paper pads from walgreens called \\&quot;smooth away\\</li>
            <li>So, although it took most of the hair off it came back ingrown.</li>
            <li>Lesson learned from the first night!&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>I would suggest doing it under the hot running water in the shower.</li>
            <li>I charged mine as soon as I got it and have done my legs (twice), underarms (first time doing this</li>
            <li>it took only 10 minutes to do my legs &amp; d pain was NOT HORRIBLE at all......</li>
            <li>That DOES work for a first timer.</li>
            <li>and then I only have to \\&quot;swipe\\&quot; over them once or twice more through the month.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been ripping out hair versus shaving since they first invented the Epilady and am now on my 4th hair removal appliance.  </li>
            <li>Some roots, the first time around, are well anchored.  </li>
            <li>This is my first purchase of an epilator.</li>
            <li>But it took me some time to have the courage to do the first swipe.</li>
            <li>At first, I used it with the massager head since the manual said that that stimulates the skin before and soothes the skin after hair removal.</li>
            <li>So I tried using the efficieny cap, which I found out was much better in doing the job especially in those problem areas.    </li>
            <li>The way to get started with epilation is to shave first.  </li>
            <li>This was the first time I used this product after years of waxing.</li>
            <li>Added bonus is that it comes with many different tops as well as an electric razor.   </li>
            <li>the more you continue to epilate regularly.</li>
            <li>I am a first time user of the epilator.</li>
            <li>In closing, I love this thing and will never, ever go back to shaving.</li>
            <li>and it does not catch many hair in the same time so epilation time gets longer</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>It seemed much better than waxing to me because it took only the hair and not any of the skin.</li>
            <li>and i instantly fall in love with amazon).    </li>
            <li>This is my first epilator</li>
            <li>My first one was an Epilady coil epilator.</li>
            <li>If anyone at Braun is reading this: please switch to a power supply similar to laptops, which does not cover more than one outlet and the transformer can sit on the floor.</li>
            <li>: I listed this as people would most likely complain about the \\&quot;high\\&quot; price of the Braun.</li>
            <li>The battery cell is a nonstandard voltage, and I cannot find the exact battery nor a compatible size/voltage match</li>
            <li>The battery cell is a nonstandard voltage, and I cannot find the exact battery nor a compatible size/voltage match ANYWHERE.)</li>
            <li>I like this product so far, although I haven&#x27;t had perfectly smooth legs to date.</li>
            <li>Still works pretty well</li>
            <li>Regrowth is not scary- your hair will be finer and tapered at the end, not angry and spikey like shaved hair    </li>
            <li>Overall, I am definitely pleased.</li>
            <li>I am back to the old-fashioned razor :)</li>
            <li>I first purchased this in august.</li>
            <li>I jumped in the shower, cleaned myself throughly with anti-bacterial soap and then a moisturizing soap, and waited about 5 minutes- letting my skin and the air steam up with the hot water.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t even have the famous red dots.</li>
            <li>My first one was a lower-end model that I picked up just to see if I could tolerate epilation.</li>
            <li>If you have never epilated before then let me just say it does hurt the first time or two</li>
            <li>Firstly I think the \\&quot;smoothe for 4 weeks\\&quot; claim is a load of rubbish.</li>
            <li>I first tried it around my ankles to ensure that the machine held a charge</li>
            <li>it is working, I know that I have a higher tolerance for pain...</li>
            <li>This was my first experience with an epilator</li>
            <li>(most likely because I have never waxed this area</li>
            <li>, so this was the first time the hair was coming out at the root).  </li>
            <li>After thorough research, I picked this epilator as my first.</li>
            <li>What I noticed it&#x27;s much better to use larger speed even in case of beginners-</li>
            <li>I was surprised that it could be so smooth.</li>
            <li>It is much more comfortable than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li>The moving part is easy to clean (with the brush, included) and it can be washed with soap and water (I air dry it after that).  </li>
            <li>The hair grows back so much slower and epilations are quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>This epilator was able to grab short hairs and the light on the thing really helps, I didn&#x27;t miss any hairs and got the job done with way fewer passes than with my old one.</li>
            <li>so if the first pass in a sensitive area has you seeing stars -- the subsequent passes will honestly get easier.  </li>
            <li>So far I am really excited.       </li>
            <li>Overall great product, well made and epilation gives me the results I want (minus the pain)</li>
            <li>I think it works better dry and the pain isn&#x27;t sufficiently reduced under hot water.     </li>
            <li>And make sure you get it all the long hairs ... take your time.  </li>
            <li>My daughter used it for her first leg shaving/epilation and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend epilating in/after a shower for the first time if it hurts too much.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t pain much, she is using epilators for the first time.</li>
            <li>I had another wet/dry that was nowhere near as effective, so I am just buying another one of these to make up for the short battery life because I like it that much.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, very low on the pain scale.  </li>
            <li>However, even the 2nd time will be light years easier than the first.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s better than waxing as u don&#x27;t need to wait for all the hair to grow up to a certain length and even a single visible hair can be removed just whenevr you want.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;Smart Light\\</li>
            <li>so they went largely unused.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also I am kind of addicted to self-tanning and shaving and waxing totally ruins a great faux tan.     </li>
            <li>i will definitely recoment it to anyone who is interested in such kind of product.</li>
            <li>The battery life is good, it last for about 45 minutes and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to charge.    </li>
            <li>I used it in both dry and wet conditons, and I think it does a more thorough job on dry skin mostly because your hair has more of a distance from your skin.</li>
            <li>fine sea salt mixed with almond or grapeseed oil and 2 drops of lavendar aromatherapy oil).</li>
            <li>this hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me, and if you exfoliate regularly you should be fine.    </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t use older models of any epilators and this is the first one that really works with me.</li>
            <li>If a hair is stubbornly being missed, be sure to stretch the skin tight right at that area, and try again.</li>
            <li>I lost my power cord in October and didn&#x27;t realize how great it had been until I had to go back to shaving for a few months.  </li>
            <li>I also enjoy the razor/trimmer attachment for those more delicate areas.</li>
            <li>Under my arms I always ask my husband to tighten my skin so the hair gets pull out and not broken.</li>
            <li>Not so much...   </li>
            <li>But, the real reason is &#x27;maintenance&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed that after just one use, my hair became much softer and did grow in slower.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the Braun people for this marvel of hair removal technology.</li>
            <li>The epilator itself is very well built</li>
            <li>I LOVE how I can wash it or use the wet shaver.</li>
            <li>you might not FEEL smooth for several reasons.  </li>
            <li>After I lost my charging cord it took well into November before I really needed to shave.  </li>
            <li>I truly believe it depends how fast your hair grows and</li>
            <li>And, no, it will never be totally discomfort free</li>
            <li>my legs are literally as smooth as glass for up to several days afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The easiest way to do one&#x27;s knees is to bend the leg -- the entire knee area becomes smooth.  </li>
            <li>For those who become nervous at the site of blood, a newbie may also experience a hair root removal (1 or 2 spots here or there especially in sensitive areas) drawing some blood.  </li>
            <li>I was really really really hesitant to get an epilator...</li>
            <li>in fact, I had been scared to get one my whole life.</li>
            <li>I made the purchase, even though I was still really nervous.&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li>The massaging head really does help reduce pain.</li>
            <li>It really does work very well in the bath/shower/steam</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update on 6/6/12: Really doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore...</li>
            <li>Using this in the shower really does help alot.</li>
            <li>Also having a shaving attachment helps when you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to really epilate (or in my case do the area&#x27;s your too scared to try just yet like your armpits).</li>
            <li>but if you are expecting to be totally silky smooth for a month- no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if I use it too much, I think maybe it overheats-</li>
            <li>really think this has to do with the battery and charging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>An absolute five-star item/purchase.</li>
            <li>My legs, however, didn&#x27;t hurt that much.</li>
            <li>, I can definately tell the difference between it and the efficiency cap, the pain is much reduced.</li>
            <li>And the hair was MUCH thinner than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Using it regularly will eventually get all the hairs and you&#x27;ll have smooth legs.</li>
            <li>But I noticed fast hair grow, in 1 week for me, after using this device, if compare to Phillips device, my previous(old) one.</li>
            <li>It would have been nice if someone had given me one of these when I was like 15...thinking about all the money&amp;time I have wasted on shaving</li>
            <li>I was happy at the beginning, but right now it&#x27;s useless    </li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t use it in the shower because its less effective but</li>
            <li>Hurts a little, but easy and quick way to get rid of the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>the more you use it as other reviews have said.  </li>
            <li>&quot; that is like a shaving alternative that basically sands your hairs off - it gets the hairs gone better than shaving and doesn&#x27;t leave sharp hairs popping up during the grow-out.    </li>
            <li>But other than that I LOVE how it&#x27;s cordless - that means I can go out and use it on the patio.  </li>
            <li>I find this epilator works much better than the other ones I have used.  </li>
            <li>I think it is probably better than other epilators that I have used</li>
            <li>I do like the option to use this in the shower, and the light on this particular model is extremely helpful and useful.</li>
            <li>know this review is long, but sometimes I think it&#x27;s really important to share the whole story.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great purchase that I did not regret a single second.</li>
            <li>so i need to be hair-free all the time and being fairly hairy (and a brunette) before getting this silk-epil wet and dry</li>
            <li>I will not say it is painless, but it is every bit as effective as the old \\&quot;coil\\&quot; type epilators, with much less pain.</li>
            <li>I always had a problem with those having cheap cords that stopped working long before the epilator died.  </li>
            <li>I searched for one similar everywhere and did some research that said the 40 dollar epilators do just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li>When I used it for the first time it was more painful than any other times after, so it does gets better, but you have to understand that your body has very sensitive places no matter how many times you epilate!</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it does not come with the facial attachment, which many people would like to have.</li>
            <li>But overall I do like it better than shaving with a razor but about the same as an electric.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s harder to get a good grip on the device when it&#x27;s wet.    </li>
            <li>The razor burns last 24/hr a day, and this is over quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d rather \\&quot;suffer\\&quot; a bit and be good for a few weeks, plus, when the hair grows back, it&#x27;s finer and softer than after shaving.    </li>
            <li>but I got used to it quickly and the pain was very short lived.</li>
            <li>When I use it on my legs, the hair seems to come back relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>That was one of the reasons I picked this particular</li>
            <li>this model in particular seems to have some bugs that need to be worked out.</li>
            <li>The epilator can only be used wireless, so if the battery is low and you haven&#x27;t finished the job, you have to wait until it is fully charged again before being able to turn it on.  </li>
            <li>This little product is super cool</li>
            <li>I am in super duper mad love with this product &amp; would strongly recommend to every girl to have one......</li>
            <li>highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li>In researching what was currently available, I&#x27;m upgrading from the Braun Silk Epil Eversoft Model #5316 (yellow and gray case) to the Braun Se 3170 Silk Epil 3 (pink &amp; white case) specifically because it is Braun&#x27;s latest model with a cord.  </li>
            <li>All the reviews I read spoke highly of it, either in the US or in Europe</li>
            <li>The price tag is quite high</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.    </li>
            <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I just roll it on my head, on high power whenever i have a headache.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>It has a little light that does wonders!</li>
            <li>It stung a little, but nothing more than tweezing out hairs.</li>
            <li>The pain was lesser, sort of felt like shaving over razor burn, but after the first pass I felt nothing!     </li>
            <li>Sure it hurts a little</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give this purchase a little more time before I give up on it.  </li>
            <li>Maybe this is the best one, it&#x27;s painful though.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because of the sound, which was louder than I expected it to produce.     </li>
            <li>forget about any body scrubs, they don&#x27;t work well in this situation, are far too gentle.</li>
            <li>The second night was much easier as I didn&#x27;t hit the margaritas the first night (don&#x27;t worry,</li>
            <li>I tried the bikini line, but couldn&#x27;t get more than a few hairs out until it was unbearable.</li>
            <li>I have fine black hair which grows really fast.</li>
            <li>I normally epliate without the massage head and its bearable.</li>
            <li>It is from my experience it depends on the person and the day that makes the review (I am having normal day.)    </li>
            <li>I followed the advice of many reviewers and took a long bath before starting.</li>
            <li>the battery back up is more than enough to complete your job in one go.</li>
            <li>and I never could manage to use it on my legs for more than a few seconds at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;But the reason I&#x27;m writing this review-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several epilators, and have tried pretty much every model of the silk-epil.  </li>
            <li>It does have a tendency to not be able to pull out all the hairs and a few do seem to end up being cut</li>
            <li>I have used it more than a few times now  with longer growth , shorter growth</li>
            <li>The panasonic works well, but upon through studying and watching many YouTube videos I noticed that the Braun epilators seemed to spin quite faster than the Panasonic, which I was having trouble with the speed in which it spun</li>
            <li>Other than that it works fine</li>
            <li>the lip takes awhile cause it makes my eyes water due to those fine hairs at the bottom of my nostrils</li>
            <li>but they just mean you can use some kind of body gel wtih them.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m 90% happy with it, I wish the noise was a little quieter, and I wish the battery lasted just a little longer.  </li>
            <li>The battery charge lasts long enough to tackle large areas, even with the light permanently operating.</li>
            <li>The little light really does help you find missed spots.</li>
            <li>The light makes seeing missed hairs extremely easy&lt;br</li>
            <li>I find that the knees area is the most sensitive, so no matter what it will hurt a little.</li>
            <li>Let me tell it, there are little words to describe this devil&#x27;s instrument when every hair is ripped out of your most sensitive area.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is if you are new to this, do areas over a couple of days to get use to it.  </li>
            <li>I had to exchange for a new unit becuase the battery would not charge.</li>
            <li>I was weary to spend alot of money on a New Braun epilator without knowing how well the product would work for me.</li>
            <li>The battery life is far longer in this epilator than the older models so I can use it longer and need not re-charge it.</li>
            <li>Does seem to prolong the smooth legs relative to shaving (i.e. last longer).</li>
            <li>You will find that the fact that it works when wet does NOT make much of a difference at all -- in fact, I know that it works better when used dry.</li>
            <li>However, a couple of weeks ago I noticed that even when it was fully charged, the red light (signaling low battery) started flashing after about 15 mins of use.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t get any rashes even though i have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If you are new to epilation, it&#x27;s going to hurt (but only the first couple of times)  </li>
            <li>I have been able to start using this on my underarms which I have heard is one of the most sensitive areas (definitely hurt pretty bad the first time)</li>
            <li>The hair is then both upright and long enough to successfully, easily remove.  </li>
            <li>this is the second one i bought, the first one got stolen.</li>
            <li>Review from a male cyclist after first use ...</li>
            <li>I did shower the first night before I started, but not the second.  </li>
            <li>: make sure you don&#x27;t have any deoderant on your underarms when you epilate, it makes the hairs slick and the tweezers don&#x27;t grip well.    </li>
            <li>This product can be used in the shower which definitely makes it pretty convenient since that is</li>
            <li>Been shaving all my life, and not only would I get razor rash EVERY time, but the regrowth would be evident within a matter of hours.</li>
            <li>Wow, what an improvement in 10 years!</li>
            <li>And sell the same item at higher price.</li>
            <li>it gets really hot and seems to strain the battery, and it will just totally die.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>The pain is tolerable, but it definitely hurts the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all, red dots</li>
            <li>I have had many epilators in the past.</li>
            <li>It is a good idea when you&#x27;re starting to epilate to epilate every few days for a week so that all the &#x27;cycles&#x27; of hair can be initially epilated.</li>
            <li>For those of you who are lucky enough to have thin and light hair, this thing will pull it right out, no prob.  </li>
            <li>What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the hair that would grow inbetween epilation sessions had an absolutely more smooth and soft texture... since going back to shaving my re-growth is bristly and irritating.    </li>
            <li>It works well in both wet and dry conditions, though personally I found that I was having problems getting it to grip my hairs in the shower and that it did a better job with FINE HAIR when I used it DRY.  </li>
            <li>It is MUCH less effective when used wet.</li>
            <li>finally i decided to buy epilator and instantly liked the Braun&#x27;s wet &amp; dry one as it&#x27;s cordless and can be used in shower.</li>
            <li>He jumped and yelled and sure enough there was a little bald spot where I had applied the epilator to his stomach.  </li>
            <li>This thing wouldn&#x27;t be allowed at Gitmo as a persuasion device because it is down right in-humane!  </li>
            <li>, I just did it over two day until clear of hair.</li>
            <li>and I end up getting weird in-grown hairs, so epilating actually does a great job.    </li>
            <li>&gt; - Once you clear an area keeping up with it is painless&lt;br</li>
            <li>It actually took me a while thinking if I really wanted to use it or not.</li>
            <li>I used the old fashioned one with the rotating plastic bar and found it excrutiating.   </li>
            <li>I use the shaver head for my underarms and bikini area and that works very well, especially in the shower.  </li>
            <li>this really helps opening the pores and reducing the pain especially for the armpits.</li>
            <li>i still have that old model</li>
            <li>Pop a couple of advil and start some margaritas (3-4, start earlier if you can&#x27;t drink them that fast)</li>
            <li>this thing does work, and works very well if you keep with it fairly regularly.  </li>
            <li>Finally, when it says to keep the head of the Epilator at 90 degree angle to leg, really pay attention to this,</li>
            <li>I can see EVERY hair growing out of my legs, even if I&#x27;m in a dimly lit room.   </li>
            <li>(upsetting because I was planning on completely doing away with razors).</li>
            <li>Even when the hairs grow back, they are tapered, so they are much softer than shaving stubble which would irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>You are not trapped in the bathroom.)    </li>
            <li>As for lasting 3 to 4 weeks, not so much.</li>
            <li>The market for epilators is not as developed here as it is in Europe</li>
            <li>but when you think at how much you use it over the years, or when you compare it to waxing at a salon/spa, it is actually quite a  deal.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month</li>
            <li>but after coming to US hair removal became an issue as professional waxing is hell costly.</li>
            <li>It pulls very thoroughly, even on very short hair that wax won&#x27;t ever get.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;very quiet\\&quot; in this context is a relative term!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I will continue to use it (although if I&#x27;m in a rush I whip out the old razor).</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t work NEARLY as well.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this epilator yesterday and got it today, so naturally I had to use it.</li>
            <li>I do have a sensitive skin and am sensitive to pain, so it was bearable to use on the legs, but not the bikini area.  </li>
            <li>After I expiated, I cleaned the areas again with an anti-bacterial soap and then used a soft scrub.</li>
            <li>The old one did the job</li>
            <li>Say goodnight to tylenol and advil, this Braun wet/dry will do just all of that naturally.  </li>
            <li>It takes hours to charge the battery and it works for about 10 minutes before it stop working completely.</li>
            <li>I like that the hairs have greatly diminished and haven&#x27;t grown back as dark and plentiful as they had in the past....</li>
            <li>Worth every cent of the 119 dollars I spent.  </li>
            <li>However, different and much better than shaving, the hair won&#x27;t regrow within a few hours...or days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And honestly I was tired of the prickly feeling on my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I did so dry.</li>
            <li>My legs come out smooth - but they get itchy once they start growing back - as if the skin is irritated by the sharp edges of the hairs.</li>
            <li>Hair regrowth seems to be slowing down and thinning out...since my hair is so thick, I do get a few ingrowns, especially near the thicker skin at the knees, but that&#x27;s WAY better than the MANY ingrowns I got during waxing; and</li>
            <li>Knees down first, then up to mid (or a bit higher thigh)</li>
            <li>It is definitely less painful and much easier than waxing, but I feel like I have to do do it about once a week for the best results.</li>
            <li>Similarly with the legs, tapered hairs are much less visible than blunt ones, and I do think it is growing back slightly more sparsely</li>
            <li>First of all, if you can get past the first use, I applaud you.</li>
            <li>This machine does remove the hairs with repeated passes, the discomfort of initial removal takes some getting use to, asprin and hot water bath prior.  </li>
            <li>Epilation definitely hurts when you first get started but from my experience it gets lesser</li>
            <li>but right after that I wasn&#x27;t feeling any pain unbearable as other people have commented like.....</li>
            <li>I had been doing my research and was ready to purchase another system that is more similar to a portable electrolysis machine that is available on the market and on HSN, but read some really bad reviews</li>
            <li>Move into a more sensitive area gradually on the slower speed (pulling fewer hairs per second) until you feel comfortable or rather numb enough to make a sweeping pass on high speed.  </li>
            <li>The head seems to run fine for a couple of minutes and then bogs down for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li>Waxing is more painful than this thing, it is easy to use and has about 20 percent of the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li>on that note- I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m EVER 100% silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>The small light is def.</li>
            <li>I did my underarms for the first time and expected pain and bumps</li>
            <li>I have barely any hair left on my legs, and the few that still grow are light and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After a year and a half of occasional use, the battery has significantly worn out.</li>
            <li>I have been using an epilator for years, the last Braun was working for 10 years, but it was time for something new.</li>
            <li>Since I have a very sensitive skin and low pain threshold</li>
            <li>If the hair is too long, it&#x27;ll be more prone to breakage versus removal, and it&#x27;s also more painful.    </li>
            <li>and I have no other problems with it.    </li>
            <li>I had read on some other websites and product reviews that soaking in a tub of hot water before epilating helps with the pain since it opens the pores and allows the hair follicle to slip out easier.  </li>
            <li>so pulling hair out at the root was interesting, to say the least!  </li>
            <li>Doing the other one in the shower helped SO much!  </li>
            <li>I would recommend starting with a professional leg wax so that the first time you use the Braun you won&#x27;t have thick growth to deal with the first time.  </li>
            <li>It gets better is what I&#x27;m saying and my fingers are crossed that over time I will feel the need to shave less and less.  </li>
            <li>My underarms were a little sensitive at first</li>
            <li>I really wanted the wet/dry capability, but the wetness makes the tweezers slide off the hair, so the hair ends up getting pulled pretty hard but doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li>After googling it, I quickly realized that numerous other ladies encountered the same problem.  </li>
            <li>Epilating is not going to give you that smooth feeling like after shaving that only lasts a few minutes anyway!</li>
            <li>the 40min charge is long enough to do my whole body plus 2 touch ups.</li>
            <li>Barely feel it.</li>
            <li>As it grows, it is so soft/fine, it is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li>The hair then starts to grow back thinner and finer over time making it far easier to remove.</li>
            <li>you could barely feel a thing.</li>
            <li>+, I recommend waxing if you have sensitive skin before you jump back into epilating.)</li>
            <li>I use it at night and by the morning, the red marks are completely gone.</li>
            <li>shaving gives a smooth effect to skin but for only a few hours and it also started causing irritation to my underarms may be because of the coarse stubs of hair.  </li>
            <li>- As far as epilators go, the Braun SE7281WD is very quiet.</li>
            <li>The couple days of doing my calves was intense (cursing, screaming, alarming my husband with my obsessive mission to rip the hair out of my legs), and there&#x27;s no way I could get everything in one sitting since I have zero tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li>if you don&#x27;t handle pain well, this is the ONLY thing that will get you through the early days  </li>
            <li>I barely even feel it.  </li>
            <li>I do not want to know how much I have spent on razors.</li>
            <li>and I really got what I expected.  </li>
            <li>I gave this 4 stars because I really wanted the 7781 wet/dry model that has several more attachments but have been unable to find a way to purchase it here in the US.</li>
            <li>I will say that a few moments of pain is certainly worth the time in between shavings as well....</li>
            <li>Product is reliable, wet or dry, although if using wet you might have to go over the same area more than once.</li>
            <li>Or, if starting new, cut it short with a barber razor with no guard.  </li>
            <li>Vast improvement from my previous epilator, and worth the expense.</li>
            <li>but i use aloe vera gel right after epilating and i shower with a scrubbing glove everyday.</li>
            <li>I use the higher speed as I find this hurts less than the slower speed.</li>
            <li>This epilator did both my legs in under 10 minutes, which is a huge difference from my old one which would take at least twice as long</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not like the battery is not easily replaced; two TORX screws, pull the unit out of the casing, and the battery is right there.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going back to my old Braun, and buying a different brand when I can afford it.</li>
            <li>In my case, this whole process needs to be done roughly every 10 days -- from a visible perspective, I could actually go longer</li>
            <li>it was a little pain at the first 2 minutes</li>
            <li>Initially I was really scared of using it because of the sound it was making and because everybody kept saying that it would hurt pretty bad</li>
            <li>for the results, my hair normally grows back within the same day or definitely the next day</li>
            <li>(or $3, unbelievable right?)</li>
            <li>It caused these very unsightly sometimes black, bluish bumps.</li>
            <li>it takes less time to be ready shaved.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>I have noticed that when the battery power is less, it really just cuts the hairs, and does not pull them out.  </li>
            <li>Buy the 40 dollar one first and in a few months when it dies, come back and buy this one.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not bad at all after a few tries.</li>
            <li>With this epilator, I have pain for just a second, and yes at first there are red marks, but they disappear after a few hours.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; use a plastic and stainless steel tweezer to get a really tight grip on each hair and pulls it out.</li>
            <li>This worked really great until one of the heads died, still lasted two years, unfortunately replacement heads are hard to find now</li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> In conclusion...one of my best investments!</li>
            <li> thus Braun SE7281WD Epilator and Amazon has the best price.</li>
            <li> but this one is really wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years and this one is the best without a doubt!  </li>
            <li> The fact that you can use it in the shower is priceless!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> Yes, anything that takes your hair out by the root will hurt, I don&#x27;t think the best epilator in the world could stop that, so don&#x27;t ever expect it to feel like a massage.</li>
            <li> the finer hairs do break - these are best to attack with the slower mode, which is easier on the hair 3)</li>
            <li> Wanted to get a rechargeable one and after reviewing, this one seemed the best.  </li>
            <li> So if you are looking, this is the best one!</li>
            <li> By the way - Laser Hair Removal actually is awesome.  </li>
            <li> This one is the best.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good buy!</li>
            <li> Not for the meek, but this is the best epilator money can buy.  </li>
            <li> I have not and probably will not use it on my bikini line, though the razor and trimmer on this thing is awesome.  </li>
            <li> The best part about this product is it can be used in the bath or shower.</li>
            <li> Anyhow I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t stop!!!!    </li>
            <li> still very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have always used epilators but this is the best quality i have ever used.</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in months...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this purchase!  </li>
            <li> Plus the massager is awesome!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to have invested in this product!</li>
            <li> I love it!!!</li>
            <li> I LOVE IT!!!  </li>
            <li> This one is great and the best epilator that I have used.      </li>
            <li> Good luck, ladies (and gents)!    </li>
            <li> Good luck!</li>
            <li> Just used my beautiful Braun Xpressive Body System on my arms and legs tonight in the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this three years ago, and it still works beautifully.</li>
            <li> , this is an excellent product and I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends many times!</li>
            <li> I recommended to my friend and she is happy with that as well.</li>
            <li> Happy hair removal.  </li>
            <li> A GREAT feature is</li>
            <li> Design is great.</li>
            <li> The trimmer also works great too.   </li>
            <li> Great product.</li>
            <li> I use this everywhere which is great, too  </li>
            <li> Used to have the corded version and although it worked great</li>
            <li> It does not eliminate the pain but it does greatly reduce it.</li>
            <li> That would be a great product feature.</li>
            <li> this is a great deal for all the money and time you will save  *</li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s my advice- while it is a great idea</li>
            <li> This is a great product.</li>
            <li> Great</li>
            <li> The shaver/trimmer option works great too.    </li>
            <li> This one does a great job, removes all the hair and no need to worry about re growth for a couple of weeks.   </li>
            <li> This product is amazing!</li>
            <li> I have used many &amp; this is THE BEST.</li>
            <li> :)Everything else is just great about this product...!!!</li>
            <li> Battery wise...</li>
            <li> The product is good.</li>
            <li> Since it is meant to be an epilator, the shaver is not as good as i would like it to be..</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you if it works good or not because I cant even use the thing.</li>
            <li> Orange one seems to be good to me</li>
            <li> Pain: Yes you get used to the pain, I don&#x27;t use soothing creams or anything, sometimes I trick my mind by thinking \\&quot;ahh, this feels good..</li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> To be totally fair to newbies, no, I didn&#x27;t get here overnight.  </li>
            <li> the wet/dry feature is really good for cleaning it.</li>
            <li> But I decided I would give myself about 6 weeks and see how it did pain wise.</li>
            <li> and it still did just as good as a wax would.</li>
            <li> *almost* feels good in a way, but not quite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I am delighted.</li>
            <li> good machine to have in the bath for her.</li>
            <li> Good job Braum.</li>
            <li> I think the massage cap is really good</li>
            <li> This product seams to work good on me.</li>
            <li> This product is good because it can be used in the water/shower.</li>
            <li> It may be a good device, but not for me.</li>
            <li> I definately recommend buying this product if you are looking for a good epilator.   </li>
            <li> The trimmer works fairly well, and it&#x27;s nice to have a device that is so multifunctional (great for traveling).  </li>
            <li> I was all excited with the cordless feature, what a great innovation!  </li>
            <li> Considering the pain I went through with my asymmetrical brazillian, the legs were EASY!!</li>
            <li> This epilator has held up exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfying to watch them disappear as the epilator goes over them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve not tried it in the shower yet, as I&#x27;m happy about being able to set out a towel and watch tv and have a snack while I do this thing.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I am very pleased.</li>
            <li> I love it great product A</li>
            <li> the more it hurts!)</li>
            <li> and I love it!  </li>
            <li> This product was wonderful at first.</li>
            <li> Ooo I am in love with this product!</li>
            <li> and OMG I love it even now!</li>
            <li> I was very excited about this purchase!  </li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, I had used an epilator about 25 years ago and it was pure torture.  </li>
            <li> The light is a great add on.</li>
            <li> the result is amazing.......</li>
            <li> it was amazing</li>
            <li> The light on it is absolutely great and illuminates hairs</li>
            <li> The wipes looked good but are mostly un-necessary.    </li>
            <li> For the face i honestly prefer the tweezers but it can be used on there too.</li>
            <li> The unit is nicely designed and rests effortlessly in the palm of the hand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it</li>
            <li> ... makes a nice paper weight...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done my armpits but thats when the shaving head comes in handy.</li>
            <li> You kind of have to keep up with it as your hair grows and figure out which hairs grow in what direction.  </li>
            <li> I liked the idea of being cordless</li>
            <li> also it&#x27;s equally effective for bikini line.   </li>
            <li> - It is extremely effective; almost as effective as waxing&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I honestly wish I had saved money and gotten the corded one.  </li>
            <li> This is surprisingly gentle when you use it as an epilator and the shaver/trimmer is excellent as well.  </li>
            <li> but it was time consuming and lacked some features that I thought would be nice.</li>
            <li> I bought this after checking my own friends skin after epilation.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a Panasonic ES2045 Wet/Dry Epilator which works great from a friend that I know well and throughly cleaned and sanitized the unit before use.</li>
            <li> It also reall gentle on my skin, and love the light!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I also like that is a good size and easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I also used the shaver head and it&#x27;s pretty good too!    </li>
            <li> The charging light indicator is a good addition since I always used to forget when I kept it for charging</li>
            <li> There is even a considerably bright light in this epilator, which helps to detect hiding hair.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, but I love the fact that it rinses out with water nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is by far the best epilator I have ever tried.</li>
            <li> I am in love with my new best friend.</li>
            <li> The price is well invested, as one will see great results right away.</li>
            <li> I have very fine and VERY light colored hair...</li>
            <li> The first use worked great</li>
            <li> This is a great hair removal device and my first epilator.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s great for beginners or even for the more experienced epilator-user who doesn&#x27;t wish to be stuck next to an outlet.</li>
            <li> It is also a very easy to clean device!  </li>
            <li> (by the way you HAVE to tighten your skin to get a better epilating).     </li>
            <li> i simply love it and use it on my legs, armpits and bikini line.</li>
            <li> i also love that i can wash it under the water.</li>
            <li> The shaver is ok.</li>
            <li> In hindsight, I think the margaritas had more of an effect than the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4)  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s better to buy the epliator that is connected to the charger.</li>
            <li> Hair removal in the shower is way more convenient.</li>
            <li> Trust me, it is easier the more you use it.</li>
            <li> and I LOVE the design.  </li>
            <li> I am flabbergasted at how many hairs it finds.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable</li>
            <li> I have to admit that I m impressed on how well this product works..especially on the short hairs.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
            <li> This epilator is much more thorough, and that is why it is much better.  </li>
            <li> The build quality could have been better.</li>
            <li> Waited for a week or so and got more.  </li>
            <li> love this epilator.</li>
            <li> Much better option than me trying to dig it out with tweezers and making myself bleed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and the best part is: I don&#x27;t have to wait until most of the hair has regrown before I use it...in a similar fashion as shaving</li>
            <li> I hope it will help someone else out there.  :-)</li>
            <li> and I have enjoyed using this as an alternative to shaving.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> The shaver is okay; I tried it on my underarms (even with the 7281 I am timid to try epilating there)&lt;br</li>
            <li> (I no longer need to use the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mode unless I wait 2 weeks between uses, more hair&#x3D;more pain).</li>
            <li> Wish I had paid more attention while ordering</li>
            <li> the pain gets better.  </li>
            <li> If I go more than 2 weeks or so, it&#x27;s noticeable.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not awful-</li>
            <li> She has already used it, and is extremely pleased with the results.  </li>
            <li> and after satisfying myself i orderd it.  </li>
            <li> So much better than shaving.</li>
            <li> (and convenient!)to have a cordless epilator to be able to use in the shower...</li>
            <li> I have shaved, waxed, lasered, and more.</li>
            <li> I love that this can travel with me</li>
            <li> I LOVE this epilator</li>
            <li> And I love that it is cordless and can be used in the shower, which I haven&#x27;t done yet but will.</li>
            <li> It would have been better to include this in the kit and to have the option to use it corded.    </li>
            <li> and she is pleased too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been more than a year or so now - and it has started making a lot of noise as if the blades are touching the covering on top.</li>
            <li> You will have to send the unit in and spend another 50 bucks or more to have it &amp;#34;fixed.&amp;#34; Do yourself a favor, and avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would have purchased it from Amazon because I love Amazon.com</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> Anyways, I love this epilator.</li>
            <li> I love that it charges is an hour and lasts for 40 minutes as well.  </li>
            <li> Regarding the pain, it does get better over time.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can use it in my bath without any worries at all.</li>
            <li> I shave the rest the more</li>
            <li> Does it get any better?</li>
            <li> with a pleasant surprise the product reached me within three days of placing order (my first ever purchase with amazon</li>
            <li> If you do a search about this product, you will see that a very significant number of people have problems with it not keeping a charge even after charging it all day.</li>
            <li> About this particular model: I think it&#x27;s really great</li>
            <li> The epilator, my first, which I have had for two months does a good job of removing hair, but breaks off more hair than I would like.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and comfortable to use in legs/arms and etc...</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a good epilator.  </li>
            <li> rechargeble battery work pretty good and</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to effectively :)</li>
            <li> you have fine hairs (like mine) that need more convincing and slip through the epilators</li>
            <li> It took the hair off so well, and was nearly painless (honestly, at this point, it feels like the skin is getting \\&quot;a good</li>
            <li> was very surprised and happy of the benefit of how well this product works.</li>
            <li> the best feature is that it goes under water and can be used on wet areas.</li>
            <li> I dont know how many people can actually enjoy afflicting pain on themselves, but I cannot.</li>
            <li> However, I did purchase the &#x27;after epilation&#x27; lotion, which I used afterwards, and it smells great and makes your legs feel so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Nice epilator, worth the money.</li>
            <li> I have a fair complexion with fine hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow particularly fast.</li>
            <li> every other at best</li>
            <li> I found that this model is very comfortable and using it on my legs and underarms was not painful in any way whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to use this one in the shower because it doesn&#x27;t slide as easy.</li>
            <li> but after awhile it was easy to keep going.</li>
            <li> Removes hair easily.</li>
            <li> if you can brave that you definitely going to fall in love with epilating ur under arms.</li>
            <li> its so easy to use and work efficiently.</li>
            <li> It was really easy peasy compared to anything else.    </li>
            <li> It is painless, fast and best part is that you can use it anywhere, in the shower for bikini waxing, anywhere else in your privacy it does not require you to be near an outlet.</li>
            <li> and I end up feeling stubbles very quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> i strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It is fully washable - a major win since oil buildup is the bane of epilators</li>
            <li> She liked it very much.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve got a healthy amount of hair growth - I come from a germanic background, so shaving legs/bikini line for me isn&#x27;t really the best choice - also waxing only lasts a couple weeks for me</li>
            <li> I took a hot warm bath and tried afterward....</li>
            <li> I have been thrilled with this product, which performs exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time using an epilator of any kind.</li>
            <li> It had some of the best and most thorough reviews; (2) I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d prefer to use it in the shower or dry, so I wanted the wet/dry feature to test all the possibilities; and (3) I liked that this came with several \\&quot;heads\\</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s super fast, smooth and doesn&#x27;t hurt as older models, I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s waterproof and when I dropped it in the sink, it came out just fine.  </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll give it four stars because it does as good a job as any epilator could, most my complaints have to do with epilating in general.</li>
            <li> All in all, it is the best solution I have come across for leg hair, and if it lasts a long time it will be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t care because the remaining hairs are so fine)    </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I went ahead and filled the tub with warm to hot water and soaked for about 15 miutes, then worked the epilator over both legs and my bikini area.  </li>
            <li> May be my hairs are too fine and break.</li>
            <li> This is the very first epilator I have ever been able to manage to use on my legs and do it all in one session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using the epilator DRY and in a lot of good light I am able to get most if not all of those fine hairs.    </li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is huge too.</li>
            <li> The light, this makes all the difference, and I never thought it would.</li>
            <li> This came with the free pack of pre-epilation wipes that I have not used so can&#x27;t give you any detail on them.  </li>
            <li> I also have a Braun 5270 model - which is corded and seems to be much more powerful.  </li>
            <li> The head on my 7281 epilator needs to be replaced and at this point replacement heads won&#x27;t be available until the end of Jan. 2010.  </li>
            <li> Once the head is available it will cost over $44 to replace...</li>
            <li> I have had smooth, smooth legs for DAYS.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read solutions to this like going ahead and shaving with a razor after epilating if you want the really smooth feel.    </li>
            <li> how smooth you want to be.</li>
            <li> but I do it based on wanting a smooth feeling versus hairless appearance.    </li>
            <li> I had brought it back with me from Europe 10 years ago, but I was quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I used the efficiency cap on my legs and in 15 minutes, I had smooth, touchable skin.</li>
            <li> the product is really compact, handy and one can use it just anywhere anytime.</li>
            <li> Rather than that making me happy, it actually makes me nervous that it isn&#x27;t getting all of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I would say that the \\&quot;hair free for 4-6</li>
            <li> My legs are silky smooth</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic epilator.</li>
            <li> so I think this has a lot to do with the amount of pain I can endure for the thought of being smooth for up to 4 weeks at a time.  </li>
            <li> So my hands never feel as smooth even after epilation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sorry for the rambling review, but if you have any questions feel free to ask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifier</li>
            <li> I will first say that before you use this- do your research!!</li>
            <li> I have not yet started using it on my bikini area since that seems much more sensitive to me, but that works out ok since it comes with a pretty nice shaver.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to be very powerful.</li>
            <li> B000KKUW6M Loofah Back Massager Brush with Ergonomic Grip Handle]]- works perfect not only to prevent ingrown hair but also leaves your skin very smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li> This one is wireless, quick, easy to clean and its charge lasts for three to four sessions.</li>
            <li> I wanted to be able to epilate my legs and underarms, and this product performs pretty well.</li>
            <li> Also, is the first epilator I&#x27;ve been able to use on my face without reaction.</li>
            <li> Also if you aren&#x27;t familiar with how to use and epilator read the instructions it doesn&#x27;t work like a razor</li>
            <li> First time just got the top layer.  </li>
            <li> plus, I&#x27;ve undergone waxing so many times, so it couldn&#x27;t possibly hurt more than that!</li>
            <li> I was so excited about two things on this one: the rechargeable battery, and the wet/dry ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I LOVE the smart light</li>
            <li> At first I was very excited for it seemed to work.</li>
            <li> You can disassemble the parts and clean them at home.  </li>
            <li> This is the 3rd I&#x27;ve owned and by far the best.</li>
            <li> , I can epilate anytime I need to and have soft, smooth skin!!</li>
            <li> &quot; so I could work my way into it with the massaging head, and use the precision head for special areas, etc.  </li>
            <li> but she was SO RIGHT!  </li>
            <li> I have tried and owned it all: razors, electric razor, the original Epilady back more than 25 years ago, the Smooth Away system, Nair, and a really nice hot wax kit.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever owned this epilator, but in the 4+ months I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Its really good and seems like an improvement on earlier versions of Braun epilators.</li>
            <li> A true keeper.</li>
            <li> I really love having underarms with no stubble shadow, and they feel much smoother.</li>
            <li> &amp; I absolutely fell in love with...</li>
            <li> I found that it took about a month before I really was able to \\&quot;get them all\\&quot;.      </li>
            <li> Soaking in a warm tub, drinking a bottle of wine, and yelling loudly helped.  </li>
            <li> Things I loved about waxing: regrowth was slower; no razor rash or tiny purple dots at each hair follicle(!!!).</li>
            <li> I tried to do it at home with ready to use wax strips, which are okay to use on legs, but one can not use them efficiently for arms</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very helpful in letting me see which spots needs more attention.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this is true</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see the advantage to being able to use the epilator in the shower.</li>
            <li> Love it, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works extremely well, with continued use</li>
            <li> Many epilators get great reviews, so I had a hard time deciding on one.</li>
            <li> Yes, there is what I would call discomfort with the first and most ambitious hair removal, but I suggest that you do use the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; head with it.</li>
            <li> This model works much better than the older Braun epilator.  </li>
            <li> A newbie may also experience some skin tenderness/bruising afterwards but it&#x27;ll quickly fade in 24 to 48 hours.    </li>
            <li> I am sure it is more efficient, but that is why you have to go back ansd forth like they tell you not to.  </li>
            <li> I went back to researching, I read so many reviews and many of you probably have and will.</li>
            <li> the light is more clear then the one i saw in store.  </li>
            <li> but your body quickly gets used to the sensation</li>
            <li> Yes, you can get a pretty great shave from this, but you have to be willing to do one, or a combination of several things:</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to try how good it is.</li>
            <li> This is my first Epilator ever!</li>
            <li> But does it hurt first time use?!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I finally made the leap and purchased this Braun epilator and are so glad that I did!</li>
            <li> While the dry only version predecessor was prone to pinch the skin, this improved design is perfect.</li>
            <li> i found the spot light really helpful as it makes even the smallest of hair noticeable, if you want a quick epilation better to use it without the pivotal head and use it dry.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and it isn&#x27;t as loud as some review have mentioned!</li>
            <li> My legs have very sparse, fine hair.</li>
            <li> Since I had grown use to my last epilator I was extremely surprised that this one felt so much better and barely noticed any pain; as well as I don&#x27;t have to wax anymore saving so much more money now by spending more on the better epilator.</li>
            <li> That was the positive turning point for me as it significantly helped to desensitize the skin.</li>
            <li> If you can find a place that&#x27;s cheap enough and someone who is experienced enough, DO IT!!!!</li>
            <li> I really like the light.</li>
            <li> Overall its good and does its job very well.</li>
            <li> This is NOT as much of a problem with the 7281 model and it removes hair much more gently.    </li>
            <li> I now prefer the regular attachment for efficiency, but the massager is great on the remaining sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> This model has more tweezers, so I finish my epilation 3 times faster than with the old one.</li>
            <li> One is pulling out fewer hairs and they truly, honestly, I swear, cross my heart . . .</li>
            <li> a deep salt scrub always helps the problem (I make my own:</li>
            <li> You can save a good amount of money and get a corded Braun that will last much longer than this unit.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Given all of that and just how well this unit works I would say that it is definitely worth the selling</li>
            <li> I would say that it is definitely worth the selling</li>
            <li> It did take a while to do my legs, but it was so worth it.</li>
            <li> As far as epilating, it&#x27;s great as long as there is full power in the battery.</li>
            <li> I have used it in the shower so far and love the results.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty fast and easy.</li>
            <li> I only epilate once a week to start and the Braun significantly gets more hairs the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The battery lasted long enough to do both legs one after the other, I LOVE the wet/dry capability, cordless is great, and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I tried other epilators with 70 tweezers that did not do as good of a job as this one with about 40 tweezers.</li>
            <li> Right?</li>
            <li> I have bought this Braun to ma wife and no any issue w/ it up to right now.</li>
            <li> Ok my sweet hubby got me this for Christmas last year.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t need any special soothing creams or gentle &#x27;caps&#x27; or anything.  </li>
            <li> Rechargeable Wet &amp; Dry Epilator]]This is the best epilator that I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I primarily use it on my underarms with good results, but I have found it more difficult to use on my legs.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has a light, although I normally use it on well lit areas, so</li>
            <li> The battery holds a nice long charge and this has held up well over time</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not hard, so they should make the battery available for purchase via their web site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will agree with another review on here that no matter what you can&#x27;t be silky smooth because of the cycle of the hair growth, you just can&#x27;t catch the teeny short fine hairs that are just popping up to the surface.  </li>
            <li> But outside of this little detail, everything about this product is excellent.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s very sturdy, I&#x27;ve never had problems with the tweezing mechanisms, and it has a nice, solid feel.</li>
            <li> Pointers for the first time user: shave first and allow a noticeable stubble regrowth (2 to 3 days worth).  </li>
            <li> its so much change then one i saw in stores and to be honest i did not even saw the same model in stores.  </li>
            <li> The smart light is also really really good although that may be one of the reasons that I am not completely satisfied with the product... because I can see the hairs that aren&#x27;t pulled out.    </li>
            <li> This epilator is perfect to use wet or dry!!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t see it under normal circumstances, but in the summer when the light outside hits my legs they light up like a christmas tree!  </li>
            <li> I think the fact that you can get it wet is meant more so you can clean it-</li>
            <li> and I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to charge it, now the light becomes steady and I take it off.    </li>
            <li> - first I&#x27;ll epilate my forearms and legs earlier in the day, then when I go out for something special, I&#x27;ll use those sand paper pads from walgreens called \\&quot;smooth away\\</li>
            <li> So, although it took most of the hair off it came back ingrown.</li>
            <li> Lesson learned from the first night!&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li> I would suggest doing it under the hot running water in the shower.</li>
            <li> I charged mine as soon as I got it and have done my legs (twice), underarms (first time doing this</li>
            <li> it took only 10 minutes to do my legs &amp; d pain was NOT HORRIBLE at all......</li>
            <li> That DOES work for a first timer.</li>
            <li> and then I only have to \\&quot;swipe\\&quot; over them once or twice more through the month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ripping out hair versus shaving since they first invented the Epilady and am now on my 4th hair removal appliance.  </li>
            <li> Some roots, the first time around, are well anchored.  </li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of an epilator.</li>
            <li> But it took me some time to have the courage to do the first swipe.</li>
            <li> At first, I used it with the massager head since the manual said that that stimulates the skin before and soothes the skin after hair removal.</li>
            <li> So I tried using the efficieny cap, which I found out was much better in doing the job especially in those problem areas.    </li>
            <li> The way to get started with epilation is to shave first.  </li>
            <li> This was the first time I used this product after years of waxing.</li>
            <li> Added bonus is that it comes with many different tops as well as an electric razor.   </li>
            <li> the more you continue to epilate regularly.</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of the epilator.</li>
            <li> In closing, I love this thing and will never, ever go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> and it does not catch many hair in the same time so epilation time gets longer</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> It seemed much better than waxing to me because it took only the hair and not any of the skin.</li>
            <li> and i instantly fall in love with amazon).    </li>
            <li> This is my first epilator</li>
            <li> My first one was an Epilady coil epilator.</li>
            <li> If anyone at Braun is reading this: please switch to a power supply similar to laptops, which does not cover more than one outlet and the transformer can sit on the floor.</li>
            <li> : I listed this as people would most likely complain about the \\&quot;high\\&quot; price of the Braun.</li>
            <li> The battery cell is a nonstandard voltage, and I cannot find the exact battery nor a compatible size/voltage match</li>
            <li> The battery cell is a nonstandard voltage, and I cannot find the exact battery nor a compatible size/voltage match ANYWHERE.)</li>
            <li> I like this product so far, although I haven&#x27;t had perfectly smooth legs to date.</li>
            <li> Still works pretty well</li>
            <li> Regrowth is not scary- your hair will be finer and tapered at the end, not angry and spikey like shaved hair    </li>
            <li> Overall, I am definitely pleased.</li>
            <li> I am back to the old-fashioned razor :)</li>
            <li> I first purchased this in august.</li>
            <li> I jumped in the shower, cleaned myself throughly with anti-bacterial soap and then a moisturizing soap, and waited about 5 minutes- letting my skin and the air steam up with the hot water.</li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t even have the famous red dots.</li>
            <li> My first one was a lower-end model that I picked up just to see if I could tolerate epilation.</li>
            <li> If you have never epilated before then let me just say it does hurt the first time or two</li>
            <li> Firstly I think the \\&quot;smoothe for 4 weeks\\&quot; claim is a load of rubbish.</li>
            <li> I first tried it around my ankles to ensure that the machine held a charge</li>
            <li> it is working, I know that I have a higher tolerance for pain...</li>
            <li> This was my first experience with an epilator</li>
            <li> (most likely because I have never waxed this area</li>
            <li> , so this was the first time the hair was coming out at the root).  </li>
            <li> After thorough research, I picked this epilator as my first.</li>
            <li> What I noticed it&#x27;s much better to use larger speed even in case of beginners-</li>
            <li> I was surprised that it could be so smooth.</li>
            <li> It is much more comfortable than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li> The moving part is easy to clean (with the brush, included) and it can be washed with soap and water (I air dry it after that).  </li>
            <li> The hair grows back so much slower and epilations are quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> This epilator was able to grab short hairs and the light on the thing really helps, I didn&#x27;t miss any hairs and got the job done with way fewer passes than with my old one.</li>
            <li> so if the first pass in a sensitive area has you seeing stars -- the subsequent passes will honestly get easier.  </li>
            <li> So far I am really excited.       </li>
            <li> Overall great product, well made and epilation gives me the results I want (minus the pain)</li>
            <li> I think it works better dry and the pain isn&#x27;t sufficiently reduced under hot water.     </li>
            <li> And make sure you get it all the long hairs ... take your time.  </li>
            <li> My daughter used it for her first leg shaving/epilation and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend epilating in/after a shower for the first time if it hurts too much.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t pain much, she is using epilators for the first time.</li>
            <li> I had another wet/dry that was nowhere near as effective, so I am just buying another one of these to make up for the short battery life because I like it that much.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, very low on the pain scale.  </li>
            <li> However, even the 2nd time will be light years easier than the first.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s better than waxing as u don&#x27;t need to wait for all the hair to grow up to a certain length and even a single visible hair can be removed just whenevr you want.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;Smart Light\\</li>
            <li> so they went largely unused.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also I am kind of addicted to self-tanning and shaving and waxing totally ruins a great faux tan.     </li>
            <li> i will definitely recoment it to anyone who is interested in such kind of product.</li>
            <li> The battery life is good, it last for about 45 minutes and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to charge.    </li>
            <li> I used it in both dry and wet conditons, and I think it does a more thorough job on dry skin mostly because your hair has more of a distance from your skin.</li>
            <li> fine sea salt mixed with almond or grapeseed oil and 2 drops of lavendar aromatherapy oil).</li>
            <li> this hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me, and if you exfoliate regularly you should be fine.    </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t use older models of any epilators and this is the first one that really works with me.</li>
            <li> If a hair is stubbornly being missed, be sure to stretch the skin tight right at that area, and try again.</li>
            <li> I lost my power cord in October and didn&#x27;t realize how great it had been until I had to go back to shaving for a few months.  </li>
            <li> I also enjoy the razor/trimmer attachment for those more delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Under my arms I always ask my husband to tighten my skin so the hair gets pull out and not broken.</li>
            <li> Not so much...   </li>
            <li> But, the real reason is &#x27;maintenance&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed that after just one use, my hair became much softer and did grow in slower.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the Braun people for this marvel of hair removal technology.</li>
            <li> The epilator itself is very well built</li>
            <li> I LOVE how I can wash it or use the wet shaver.</li>
            <li> you might not FEEL smooth for several reasons.  </li>
            <li> After I lost my charging cord it took well into November before I really needed to shave.  </li>
            <li> I truly believe it depends how fast your hair grows and</li>
            <li> And, no, it will never be totally discomfort free</li>
            <li> my legs are literally as smooth as glass for up to several days afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The easiest way to do one&#x27;s knees is to bend the leg -- the entire knee area becomes smooth.  </li>
            <li> For those who become nervous at the site of blood, a newbie may also experience a hair root removal (1 or 2 spots here or there especially in sensitive areas) drawing some blood.  </li>
            <li> I was really really really hesitant to get an epilator...</li>
            <li> in fact, I had been scared to get one my whole life.</li>
            <li> I made the purchase, even though I was still really nervous.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ready to go.</li>
            <li> The massaging head really does help reduce pain.</li>
            <li> It really does work very well in the bath/shower/steam</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update on 6/6/12: Really doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore...</li>
            <li> Using this in the shower really does help alot.</li>
            <li> Also having a shaving attachment helps when you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to really epilate (or in my case do the area&#x27;s your too scared to try just yet like your armpits).</li>
            <li> but if you are expecting to be totally silky smooth for a month- no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if I use it too much, I think maybe it overheats-</li>
            <li> really think this has to do with the battery and charging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> An absolute five-star item/purchase.</li>
            <li> My legs, however, didn&#x27;t hurt that much.</li>
            <li> , I can definately tell the difference between it and the efficiency cap, the pain is much reduced.</li>
            <li> And the hair was MUCH thinner than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Using it regularly will eventually get all the hairs and you&#x27;ll have smooth legs.</li>
            <li> But I noticed fast hair grow, in 1 week for me, after using this device, if compare to Phillips device, my previous(old) one.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if someone had given me one of these when I was like 15...thinking about all the money&amp;time I have wasted on shaving</li>
            <li> I was happy at the beginning, but right now it&#x27;s useless    </li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t use it in the shower because its less effective but</li>
            <li> Hurts a little, but easy and quick way to get rid of the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> the more you use it as other reviews have said.  </li>
            <li> &quot; that is like a shaving alternative that basically sands your hairs off - it gets the hairs gone better than shaving and doesn&#x27;t leave sharp hairs popping up during the grow-out.    </li>
            <li> But other than that I LOVE how it&#x27;s cordless - that means I can go out and use it on the patio.  </li>
            <li> I find this epilator works much better than the other ones I have used.  </li>
            <li> I think it is probably better than other epilators that I have used</li>
            <li> I do like the option to use this in the shower, and the light on this particular model is extremely helpful and useful.</li>
            <li> know this review is long, but sometimes I think it&#x27;s really important to share the whole story.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great purchase that I did not regret a single second.</li>
            <li> so i need to be hair-free all the time and being fairly hairy (and a brunette) before getting this silk-epil wet and dry</li>
            <li> I will not say it is painless, but it is every bit as effective as the old \\&quot;coil\\&quot; type epilators, with much less pain.</li>
            <li> I always had a problem with those having cheap cords that stopped working long before the epilator died.  </li>
            <li> I searched for one similar everywhere and did some research that said the 40 dollar epilators do just as good as the more expensive ones.</li>
            <li> When I used it for the first time it was more painful than any other times after, so it does gets better, but you have to understand that your body has very sensitive places no matter how many times you epilate!</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it does not come with the facial attachment, which many people would like to have.</li>
            <li> But overall I do like it better than shaving with a razor but about the same as an electric.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s harder to get a good grip on the device when it&#x27;s wet.    </li>
            <li> The razor burns last 24/hr a day, and this is over quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d rather \\&quot;suffer\\&quot; a bit and be good for a few weeks, plus, when the hair grows back, it&#x27;s finer and softer than after shaving.    </li>
            <li> but I got used to it quickly and the pain was very short lived.</li>
            <li> When I use it on my legs, the hair seems to come back relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> That was one of the reasons I picked this particular</li>
            <li> this model in particular seems to have some bugs that need to be worked out.</li>
            <li> The epilator can only be used wireless, so if the battery is low and you haven&#x27;t finished the job, you have to wait until it is fully charged again before being able to turn it on.  </li>
            <li> This little product is super cool</li>
            <li> I am in super duper mad love with this product &amp; would strongly recommend to every girl to have one......</li>
            <li> highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> In researching what was currently available, I&#x27;m upgrading from the Braun Silk Epil Eversoft Model #5316 (yellow and gray case) to the Braun Se 3170 Silk Epil 3 (pink &amp; white case) specifically because it is Braun&#x27;s latest model with a cord.  </li>
            <li> All the reviews I read spoke highly of it, either in the US or in Europe</li>
            <li> The price tag is quite high</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.    </li>
            <li> highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just roll it on my head, on high power whenever i have a headache.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> It has a little light that does wonders!</li>
            <li> It stung a little, but nothing more than tweezing out hairs.</li>
            <li> The pain was lesser, sort of felt like shaving over razor burn, but after the first pass I felt nothing!     </li>
            <li> Sure it hurts a little</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this purchase a little more time before I give up on it.  </li>
            <li> Maybe this is the best one, it&#x27;s painful though.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because of the sound, which was louder than I expected it to produce.     </li>
            <li> forget about any body scrubs, they don&#x27;t work well in this situation, are far too gentle.</li>
            <li> The second night was much easier as I didn&#x27;t hit the margaritas the first night (don&#x27;t worry,</li>
            <li> I tried the bikini line, but couldn&#x27;t get more than a few hairs out until it was unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have fine black hair which grows really fast.</li>
            <li> I normally epliate without the massage head and its bearable.</li>
            <li> It is from my experience it depends on the person and the day that makes the review (I am having normal day.)    </li>
            <li> I followed the advice of many reviewers and took a long bath before starting.</li>
            <li> the battery back up is more than enough to complete your job in one go.</li>
            <li> and I never could manage to use it on my legs for more than a few seconds at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the reason I&#x27;m writing this review-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several epilators, and have tried pretty much every model of the silk-epil.  </li>
            <li> It does have a tendency to not be able to pull out all the hairs and a few do seem to end up being cut</li>
            <li> I have used it more than a few times now  with longer growth , shorter growth</li>
            <li> The panasonic works well, but upon through studying and watching many YouTube videos I noticed that the Braun epilators seemed to spin quite faster than the Panasonic, which I was having trouble with the speed in which it spun</li>
            <li> Other than that it works fine</li>
            <li> the lip takes awhile cause it makes my eyes water due to those fine hairs at the bottom of my nostrils</li>
            <li> but they just mean you can use some kind of body gel wtih them.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m 90% happy with it, I wish the noise was a little quieter, and I wish the battery lasted just a little longer.  </li>
            <li> The battery charge lasts long enough to tackle large areas, even with the light permanently operating.</li>
            <li> The little light really does help you find missed spots.</li>
            <li> The light makes seeing missed hairs extremely easy&lt;br</li>
            <li> I find that the knees area is the most sensitive, so no matter what it will hurt a little.</li>
            <li> Let me tell it, there are little words to describe this devil&#x27;s instrument when every hair is ripped out of your most sensitive area.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is if you are new to this, do areas over a couple of days to get use to it.  </li>
            <li> I had to exchange for a new unit becuase the battery would not charge.</li>
            <li> I was weary to spend alot of money on a New Braun epilator without knowing how well the product would work for me.</li>
            <li> The battery life is far longer in this epilator than the older models so I can use it longer and need not re-charge it.</li>
            <li> Does seem to prolong the smooth legs relative to shaving (i.e. last longer).</li>
            <li> You will find that the fact that it works when wet does NOT make much of a difference at all -- in fact, I know that it works better when used dry.</li>
            <li> However, a couple of weeks ago I noticed that even when it was fully charged, the red light (signaling low battery) started flashing after about 15 mins of use.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t get any rashes even though i have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If you are new to epilation, it&#x27;s going to hurt (but only the first couple of times)  </li>
            <li> I have been able to start using this on my underarms which I have heard is one of the most sensitive areas (definitely hurt pretty bad the first time)</li>
            <li> The hair is then both upright and long enough to successfully, easily remove.  </li>
            <li> this is the second one i bought, the first one got stolen.</li>
            <li> Review from a male cyclist after first use ...</li>
            <li> I did shower the first night before I started, but not the second.  </li>
            <li> : make sure you don&#x27;t have any deoderant on your underarms when you epilate, it makes the hairs slick and the tweezers don&#x27;t grip well.    </li>
            <li> This product can be used in the shower which definitely makes it pretty convenient since that is</li>
            <li> Been shaving all my life, and not only would I get razor rash EVERY time, but the regrowth would be evident within a matter of hours.</li>
            <li> Wow, what an improvement in 10 years!</li>
            <li> And sell the same item at higher price.</li>
            <li> it gets really hot and seems to strain the battery, and it will just totally die.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> The pain is tolerable, but it definitely hurts the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all, red dots</li>
            <li> I have had many epilators in the past.</li>
            <li> It is a good idea when you&#x27;re starting to epilate to epilate every few days for a week so that all the &#x27;cycles&#x27; of hair can be initially epilated.</li>
            <li> For those of you who are lucky enough to have thin and light hair, this thing will pull it right out, no prob.  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the hair that would grow inbetween epilation sessions had an absolutely more smooth and soft texture... since going back to shaving my re-growth is bristly and irritating.    </li>
            <li> It works well in both wet and dry conditions, though personally I found that I was having problems getting it to grip my hairs in the shower and that it did a better job with FINE HAIR when I used it DRY.  </li>
            <li> It is MUCH less effective when used wet.</li>
            <li> finally i decided to buy epilator and instantly liked the Braun&#x27;s wet &amp; dry one as it&#x27;s cordless and can be used in shower.</li>
            <li> He jumped and yelled and sure enough there was a little bald spot where I had applied the epilator to his stomach.  </li>
            <li> This thing wouldn&#x27;t be allowed at Gitmo as a persuasion device because it is down right in-humane!  </li>
            <li> , I just did it over two day until clear of hair.</li>
            <li> and I end up getting weird in-grown hairs, so epilating actually does a great job.    </li>
            <li> &gt; - Once you clear an area keeping up with it is painless&lt;br</li>
            <li> It actually took me a while thinking if I really wanted to use it or not.</li>
            <li> I used the old fashioned one with the rotating plastic bar and found it excrutiating.   </li>
            <li> I use the shaver head for my underarms and bikini area and that works very well, especially in the shower.  </li>
            <li> this really helps opening the pores and reducing the pain especially for the armpits.</li>
            <li> i still have that old model</li>
            <li> Pop a couple of advil and start some margaritas (3-4, start earlier if you can&#x27;t drink them that fast)</li>
            <li> this thing does work, and works very well if you keep with it fairly regularly.  </li>
            <li> Finally, when it says to keep the head of the Epilator at 90 degree angle to leg, really pay attention to this,</li>
            <li> I can see EVERY hair growing out of my legs, even if I&#x27;m in a dimly lit room.   </li>
            <li> (upsetting because I was planning on completely doing away with razors).</li>
            <li> Even when the hairs grow back, they are tapered, so they are much softer than shaving stubble which would irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> You are not trapped in the bathroom.)    </li>
            <li> As for lasting 3 to 4 weeks, not so much.</li>
            <li> The market for epilators is not as developed here as it is in Europe</li>
            <li> but when you think at how much you use it over the years, or when you compare it to waxing at a salon/spa, it is actually quite a  deal.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month</li>
            <li> but after coming to US hair removal became an issue as professional waxing is hell costly.</li>
            <li> It pulls very thoroughly, even on very short hair that wax won&#x27;t ever get.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;very quiet\\&quot; in this context is a relative term!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I will continue to use it (although if I&#x27;m in a rush I whip out the old razor).</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work NEARLY as well.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this epilator yesterday and got it today, so naturally I had to use it.</li>
            <li> I do have a sensitive skin and am sensitive to pain, so it was bearable to use on the legs, but not the bikini area.  </li>
            <li> After I expiated, I cleaned the areas again with an anti-bacterial soap and then used a soft scrub.</li>
            <li> The old one did the job</li>
            <li> Say goodnight to tylenol and advil, this Braun wet/dry will do just all of that naturally.  </li>
            <li> It takes hours to charge the battery and it works for about 10 minutes before it stop working completely.</li>
            <li> I like that the hairs have greatly diminished and haven&#x27;t grown back as dark and plentiful as they had in the past....</li>
            <li> Worth every cent of the 119 dollars I spent.  </li>
            <li> However, different and much better than shaving, the hair won&#x27;t regrow within a few hours...or days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And honestly I was tired of the prickly feeling on my legs and underarms.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I did so dry.</li>
            <li> My legs come out smooth - but they get itchy once they start growing back - as if the skin is irritated by the sharp edges of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Hair regrowth seems to be slowing down and thinning out...since my hair is so thick, I do get a few ingrowns, especially near the thicker skin at the knees, but that&#x27;s WAY better than the MANY ingrowns I got during waxing; and</li>
            <li> Knees down first, then up to mid (or a bit higher thigh)</li>
            <li> It is definitely less painful and much easier than waxing, but I feel like I have to do do it about once a week for the best results.</li>
            <li> Similarly with the legs, tapered hairs are much less visible than blunt ones, and I do think it is growing back slightly more sparsely</li>
            <li> First of all, if you can get past the first use, I applaud you.</li>
            <li> This machine does remove the hairs with repeated passes, the discomfort of initial removal takes some getting use to, asprin and hot water bath prior.  </li>
            <li> Epilation definitely hurts when you first get started but from my experience it gets lesser</li>
            <li> but right after that I wasn&#x27;t feeling any pain unbearable as other people have commented like.....</li>
            <li> I had been doing my research and was ready to purchase another system that is more similar to a portable electrolysis machine that is available on the market and on HSN, but read some really bad reviews</li>
            <li> Move into a more sensitive area gradually on the slower speed (pulling fewer hairs per second) until you feel comfortable or rather numb enough to make a sweeping pass on high speed.  </li>
            <li> The head seems to run fine for a couple of minutes and then bogs down for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> Waxing is more painful than this thing, it is easy to use and has about 20 percent of the pain of waxing.</li>
            <li> on that note- I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m EVER 100% silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> The small light is def.</li>
            <li> I did my underarms for the first time and expected pain and bumps</li>
            <li> I have barely any hair left on my legs, and the few that still grow are light and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a year and a half of occasional use, the battery has significantly worn out.</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for years, the last Braun was working for 10 years, but it was time for something new.</li>
            <li> Since I have a very sensitive skin and low pain threshold</li>
            <li> If the hair is too long, it&#x27;ll be more prone to breakage versus removal, and it&#x27;s also more painful.    </li>
            <li> and I have no other problems with it.    </li>
            <li> I had read on some other websites and product reviews that soaking in a tub of hot water before epilating helps with the pain since it opens the pores and allows the hair follicle to slip out easier.  </li>
            <li> so pulling hair out at the root was interesting, to say the least!  </li>
            <li> Doing the other one in the shower helped SO much!  </li>
            <li> I would recommend starting with a professional leg wax so that the first time you use the Braun you won&#x27;t have thick growth to deal with the first time.  </li>
            <li> It gets better is what I&#x27;m saying and my fingers are crossed that over time I will feel the need to shave less and less.  </li>
            <li> My underarms were a little sensitive at first</li>
            <li> I really wanted the wet/dry capability, but the wetness makes the tweezers slide off the hair, so the hair ends up getting pulled pretty hard but doesn&#x27;t come out.</li>
            <li> After googling it, I quickly realized that numerous other ladies encountered the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Epilating is not going to give you that smooth feeling like after shaving that only lasts a few minutes anyway!</li>
            <li> the 40min charge is long enough to do my whole body plus 2 touch ups.</li>
            <li> Barely feel it.</li>
            <li> As it grows, it is so soft/fine, it is barely noticeable.  </li>
            <li> The hair then starts to grow back thinner and finer over time making it far easier to remove.</li>
            <li> you could barely feel a thing.</li>
            <li> +, I recommend waxing if you have sensitive skin before you jump back into epilating.)</li>
            <li> I use it at night and by the morning, the red marks are completely gone.</li>
            <li> shaving gives a smooth effect to skin but for only a few hours and it also started causing irritation to my underarms may be because of the coarse stubs of hair.  </li>
            <li> - As far as epilators go, the Braun SE7281WD is very quiet.</li>
            <li> The couple days of doing my calves was intense (cursing, screaming, alarming my husband with my obsessive mission to rip the hair out of my legs), and there&#x27;s no way I could get everything in one sitting since I have zero tolerance for pain.</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t handle pain well, this is the ONLY thing that will get you through the early days  </li>
            <li> I barely even feel it.  </li>
            <li> I do not want to know how much I have spent on razors.</li>
            <li> and I really got what I expected.  </li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because I really wanted the 7781 wet/dry model that has several more attachments but have been unable to find a way to purchase it here in the US.</li>
            <li> I will say that a few moments of pain is certainly worth the time in between shavings as well....</li>
            <li> Product is reliable, wet or dry, although if using wet you might have to go over the same area more than once.</li>
            <li> Or, if starting new, cut it short with a barber razor with no guard.  </li>
            <li> Vast improvement from my previous epilator, and worth the expense.</li>
            <li> but i use aloe vera gel right after epilating and i shower with a scrubbing glove everyday.</li>
            <li> I use the higher speed as I find this hurts less than the slower speed.</li>
            <li> This epilator did both my legs in under 10 minutes, which is a huge difference from my old one which would take at least twice as long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not like the battery is not easily replaced; two TORX screws, pull the unit out of the casing, and the battery is right there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going back to my old Braun, and buying a different brand when I can afford it.</li>
            <li> In my case, this whole process needs to be done roughly every 10 days -- from a visible perspective, I could actually go longer</li>
            <li> it was a little pain at the first 2 minutes</li>
            <li> Initially I was really scared of using it because of the sound it was making and because everybody kept saying that it would hurt pretty bad</li>
            <li> for the results, my hair normally grows back within the same day or definitely the next day</li>
            <li> (or $3, unbelievable right?)</li>
            <li> It caused these very unsightly sometimes black, bluish bumps.</li>
            <li> it takes less time to be ready shaved.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> I have noticed that when the battery power is less, it really just cuts the hairs, and does not pull them out.  </li>
            <li> Buy the 40 dollar one first and in a few months when it dies, come back and buy this one.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not bad at all after a few tries.</li>
            <li> With this epilator, I have pain for just a second, and yes at first there are red marks, but they disappear after a few hours.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; use a plastic and stainless steel tweezer to get a really tight grip on each hair and pulls it out.</li>
            <li> This worked really great until one of the heads died, still lasted two years, unfortunately replacement heads are hard to find now</li>
            <li> but I am just a little disappointed because all the hype surrounding the product made it sound better than it is.</li>
            <li> I find epillating in the shower is convenient, more effective, and less painful than outside of it, but it IS hard to to see what you are doing.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a year) with regular wet and dry use.  </li>
            <li> It has a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery, so its definitely made to be long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough, and it gets wimpy at the end.  </li>
            <li> I have no idea how long the repair will take or even if I will be dealing with the same problem later.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t feel much pain (I find it a little poky at times!)</li>
            <li> Last week, I had a little more hair growth than the previous weeks, and I made a leap and decided to not use any of the heads at all, but just the bare epilator (dry as usual).  </li>
            <li> Very effective, but very painful the first few uses,</li>
            <li> I have had the epilator for five months, and for the past few uses it has only lasted ten minutes before losing its (full) charge.</li>
            <li> (the irony of life, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale white skin and very thick black body hair, thanks to some not-so-good luck with the gene pool. :-)</li>
            <li> The 5270 is great for flat, open skin areas like legs and arms but NOT a good one for the bikini area -- it is VERY unforgiving and will grab skin if it is used at a slightly wrong angle or around loose skin that is not pulled tight -- and that HURTS!  </li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to pain, but my desire to be done with hassling with hair and mess overrode that.</li>
            <li> you have hairs that are JUST beginning to poke up through the skin and aren&#x27;t long enough to pull out (hence, touch-up&#x27;s required)  3)</li>
            <li> shave with your normal razor a few days ahead of time and let it grow out to the minimum length (the longer the hair,</li>
            <li> I bought \\&quot;Braun SE7281WD\\&quot; because my old \\&quot;Braun Silk-epil\\&quot; broke down (after 5 years of use!!!!pretty</li>
            <li> &gt; - The Braun 7281 is far less painful than other epilators; I successfully cleared my legs in one session!&lt;br /&gt; -</li>
            <li> befor buying braun xpressive body system for my friend on i look around on internet and then in other major stores like bed bath and beyond etc.</li>
            <li> Use baby powder/talcum powder to keep the area you&#x27;re working on dry and the Silk Epil will glide across the skin and target only your hair.  </li>
            <li> Braun 7281 WD lasted a year and a half before the \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; battery died completely; it had held the charge for shorter and shorter times for a while.</li>
            <li> I will just continue to go to my local European Wax Center and get that area tended and maintained.  </li>
            <li> The 2nd time I used it (dry only) was about 1 week later - only a little hair was present and it felt like almost nothing.</li>
            <li> Oh, last week I also discovered that for some ingrowns (those causing a little bump on the surface of the skin and therefore not deep), I can move the epilator several times overthe bump in different directions and it&#x27;ll remove the excess skin and pull out the hair!</li>
            <li> there are always a few little fine hairs it can&#x27;t get, or a few that break.  </li>
            <li> Well, this thing certainly is a process if you struggle with thick leg hair and lots of it.  </li>
            <li> now i just do minor touch ups twice a week.</li>
            <li> the hair grows back faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> It has a fairly long charge</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve long since quit using the massage guard and opt for the fastest/closest pull there is.  </li>
            <li> I think I actually prefer using it wet.</li>
            <li> European Wax Center and get that area tended and maintained.  </li>
            <li> I have yet to see how long before I have to order the replacement parts which are a bit pricey.    </li>
            <li> Do not buy this product -- the battery does not last and is not replaceable except by the service center.</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick dark brown hair that grows in coarse after shaving.  </li>
            <li> So it comes with two different heads one for shaving/trimming and the other one for epilating, this option lets you change caps.</li>
            <li> and I can get through both legs and still have enough for other areas and for touch-ups.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me when I mentioned that I loved the effect of an epilator but was too chicken to use my old Emjoi very often because WOW that thing was painful!  </li>
            <li> and I see a very long partnership ahead of us.</li>
            <li> , I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything since it didn&#x27;t hurt even using it dry.  </li>
            <li> I did one dry with no shower</li>
            <li> Recommend using it as dry epilator.</li>
            <li> I have used it dry sitting on the couch in shorts and inside the shower as well with shaving cream or just lather from bar soap as well.</li>
            <li> Braun impress me as i am not new to braun products,  </li>
            <li> and I told every single girls</li>
            <li> and they sent me a coupon for 20% off a single item.</li>
            <li> I got it at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with 20% coupon off for any single item purchase.</li>
            <li> I am not gonna lie to you and say that epilating is perfectly enjoyable cause it can be uncomfortable in certain areas like the backs of the thighs and knees where those fine horrible hairs are located.</li>
            <li> All of you giving it 4 and 5 stars are either more of a tough gal than I will ever be or on some serious drugs</li>
            <li> At least not for me!You will start to see hair after a week or two, but this are the hairs that break and are not pull so it will only be a few, very unnoticeable in my opinion.</li>
            <li> When I used my old Phillips device, hair do not grow for about 2 weeks and when it start grow there are not many.</li>
            <li> And it still has charge left in it and not running down.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t use it on now -- legs, underarms, upper lip, and even extreme bikini (we&#x27;re talking \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; girls!).  </li>
            <li> As the hair will grow back finer, the subsequent removal procedures decrease in pain and timely effort, as less and less hair will have to be removed.</li>
            <li> and it can be used both wet and dry.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully with time the hairs will be easier to pull in the future.[[ASIN:B001VEK1AI Braun SE7281WD Xpressive Body System Rechargeable Wet &amp; Dry Epilator]]</li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first because I had flashbacks of the \\&quot;EpiLady\\&quot; from back in the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Oh - and finding a link or form to email them was not very easy or obvious on their site.</li>
            <li> so obviously it goes into a black hole where it will be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I do like that this product can be used wet or dry; I have tried both.  </li>
            <li> At least the first few times.</li>
            <li> Some epilator&#x27;s say wet &amp; dry on them</li>
            <li> A little over a year after purchase battery life significantly decreased, and now a few months later I&#x27;m lucky to get a couple of minutes on a charge.</li>
            <li> A little over a year after purchase battery life significantly decreased, and now a few months later I&#x27;m lucky to get a couple of minutes on a charge.</li>
            <li> No pain and very easy to use, except this product is not for me since I have in grown hairs :(</li>
            <li> If you do plan to use it in the shower, just be prepared to do a little extra maintenance (the directions recommend that you apply oil after exposure to water.  </li>
            <li> that it&#x27;s so hard to be near an outlet?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the Epilator, pain is not so bad, and I can handle it.</li>
            <li> It was the most painful experience.</li>
            <li> I also like the Smartlight function, quite practical with artificial light.    </li>
            <li> - Even as well as this unit reduces pain, if you don&#x27;t keep up with an area and let it regrow, it will be more painful than if you keep up with it.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it was more painful than I anticipated, but it does lessen with each use.  </li>
            <li> And (ok an epilator is always a bit painful)</li>
            <li> The only issue is that the battery must last at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li> I know sometimes there are defective products but for such an expensive epilator i am really bummed out.</li>
            <li> but when your hairs regrow they are so small you&#x27;ll feel them at the touch but will barely see them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First, not being a female, I don&#x27;t care if I miss a few hairs here and there.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t have the time to start with stubble, trim the hair to a roughly 1/4 inch length -- just as they&#x27;ll do for a bikini line waxing.  </li>
            <li> I really do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and chose carefully.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very noisy either.</li>
            <li> Despite my initial 5/5 review, I have to knock a few stars off.</li>
            <li> What a fraking waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them and included my update above.  </li>
            <li> What a fraking waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them and included my update above.  </li>
            <li> After using it on my arms and thighs for about a week with minimal discomfort, I downed a couple shots of vodka and began to epilate my calves.</li>
            <li> The hair that did grow was hair that was broken (instead of plucked) but it wasn&#x27;t much at all.  </li>
            <li> (but only a few).</li>
            <li> but now I have to mail it to a repair center at my expense and wait.</li>
            <li> I expected a lot from this brand.</li>
            <li> It also gets easier as the hairs grow back finer and are easier to yank out (plus just plain getting use to what to expect).  </li>
            <li> is that its parts are not strong enough and I do not know how I can get the alternative to the parts which don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> if you are shaving your legs you are serious enough to burn off the extra calories!)&lt;br /&gt;3)  </li>
            <li> I only did half before wimping out, I will do the other half towmorrow.</li>
            <li> Pain: for the first two times it was pretty painful, however, not as bad as I remember from my very first experience with epilators.</li>
            <li> The pain was pretty bad my first use, but since using it several times since, the pain has dramatically decreased.  </li>
            <li> The epilation is less painful than before, making hair removal in the beginning stages more bearable.</li>
            <li> , the other cap is for a closer epilating now</li>
            <li> I usually move my epilator in different directions and angles and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> I let it charge for a total of 7 hours unsuccessfully, I was never able to turn it on.   </li>
            <li> , so 4-6 weeks is a pretty blatant lie.     </li>
            <li> By the way, I don&#x27;t know any other epilator made by the other brands.</li>
            <li> while in or out of the shower unlike other epilators.</li>
            <li> The epilator works like a razor as it is not able to pull the smaller and finer hair.</li>
            <li> In the end I would even say this one is equal if not better then one my friend had and would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> However I would have preferred to just purchase the other model.  </li>
            <li> Not enough gain for the pain, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> , I have to let the hair on my legs get a few mm long in order to epilate.</li>
            <li> The first go-round was a little painful and awkward, I must admit (I tried it in the shower first which was way too awkward, so resumed after shower with dry but warm skin</li>
            <li> I expected less from this epilator than it has delivered.</li>
            <li> Looked into the No!No!, but it has horrible reviews by just about everyone who doesn&#x27;t get paid by the infomercial company (certainly a few exceptions, but not enough to make me comfortable dropping nearly $300 on it!).</li>
            <li> However if you consider that before you buy one like this you have already bought at least one or two other epilators, or have been waxing up to now, please consider the total cost.</li>
            <li> , it is not usable for &amp;#34;plug-in power.&amp;#34; Your battery will last almost until your warranty is up, (mine began to fail after about 2 months and it really hurts when it&#x27;s not full power!!).</li>
            <li> It got much less painful very quickly each time I&#x27;d epilate, though I still can&#x27;t do the bikini</li>
            <li> I will either take another reviewer&#x27;s advice prior to attempting my bikini area again and that is a couple of shots of hard liquor (I am thinking tequila)or</li>
            <li> (need to be careful around the creases - I did knick myself once when the skin was too tight and had a slightly elevated/pinched-up area...</li>
            <li> it was not worth it spoiling my skin and leaving scars.</li>
            <li> I chose this epilator because it was relatively well-reviewed, though I was worried by some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> And when I&#x27;ve been lazy for a long time and haven&#x27;t done my arms n legs, I use the trim option to trim the hair before epilating.</li>
            <li> I certainly expected such an expensive epilator to last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money</li>
            <li> The intense pulling power just overides the uncomfortable headaches.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve used it in average once a week on my legs, bikini area and armpits.  </li>
            <li> I guess the battery wears out eventually, and as it cannot be used while it is plugged in, it will rend the whole epilator useless.</li>
            <li> The first time was painful, next time i tried using it under water in a bath tub.</li>
            <li> The laser didn&#x27;t work for me and hurt far worse than Brauney.</li>
            <li> You need to drill down through support FAQs then say no it didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> You need to drill down through support FAQs then say no it didn&#x27;t help</li>
            <li> Less pain, hardly any, and faster hair removal wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried these rotary \\&quot;tweezer\\&quot; type epilators from other companies - Emjoi for example - and wasted money on them.</li>
            <li> I feel there is a slight tingling still.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product intending for it to be an upgrade from my previous Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle.</li>
            <li> With my previous epilator, I was going 2-3 weeks between epilations, but the hair removal for this one turned out to be inferior</li>
            <li> This unit is cheaper than all the wax I have bought added up, and is cheaper than the previous epilators I have tried.</li>
            <li> I am NOT going to pay Braun&#x27;s inflated price for spending less than five minutes to replace what should be a $12.00-$15.00 battery pack.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(Hint: replacing the battery pack takes less than five minutes; remove two torx screws, pull unit apart.</li>
            <li> I am NOT going to pay Braun&#x27;s inflated price for spending less than five minutes to replace what should be a $12.00-$15.00 battery pack.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;(Hint: replacing the battery pack takes less than five minutes; remove two torx screws, pull unit apart.</li>
            <li> the pain is less.</li>
            <li> it hurts less.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator about a year and a half ago</li>
            <li> I epilate the less hairs</li>
            <li> The others are not worth the little bit(or lot) of money you save.  </li>
            <li> (no more stuck to an outlet) and the wet option.    </li>
            <li> plus you end up in a sticky mess.</li>
            <li> OUCH.Even after hanging out in a steamy shower for a half hour AND using it IN the shower, this was SUPER painful.</li>
            <li> The things I hated about waxing: very messy; very time consuming; have to wait until a good portion of hair has grown back AND until hair growth is at least 1/2 inch or so before waxing EVERY time, which is ugly and makes me feel self-conscious.  </li>
            <li> Everyone who is saying the first time is the worst is absolutely right - when I did my underarms the first time, I was seeing spots it hurt so bad.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I would have to get waxed very frequently</li>
            <li> Kudos to the engineers and designers who came up with this little helper.</li>
            <li> The pain is minimum on legs and a little bit on arms and underarms..</li>
            <li> I have it for a little over a year</li>
            <li> There was a little bit of pain on my knee from where I injured it a few months ago walking a dog.</li>
            <li> Gets dull and does not work as expected after couple months of usage.</li>
            <li> It helps you to see those few hairs that are stubborn and you missed.</li>
            <li> Now... some of the hair it only gets broken, but I think it depends on what direction the hair is and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll try to update a few weeks from now after a few uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Granted, after 15 years of shaving my legs, I can&#x27;t stand when I go a few weeks</li>
            <li> There are a few notes:  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any trouble with ingrown hairs, but some people do, so be mindful of that.  </li>
            <li> and then do touch-ups every few days  or  2)</li>
            <li> This epilator doesn&#x27;t leave any hair behind, even short ones.</li>
            <li> but it did sting for a few minutes</li>
            <li> My legs are not exactly smooth, but I haven&#x27;t bothered to shave and don&#x27;t have man hair all over my legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been a waxer in the past but waiting for my hair to grow long enough to wax as well as the cost has become tiresome.</li>
            <li> Unlike the crap brands, this unit is not made from cheap loose-fitting pot metal.</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for years, so for &#x27;newbies&#x27; just a few comments-&lt;br /&gt;YES-</li>
            <li> Plus I bought the &#x27;exfoliatiom sponge&#x27; for use to help get rid of the dead cells so you don&#x27;t get ingrown</li>
            <li> I feel if I didn&#x27;t go through all the trouble with exfoliating and cleaning, I would get ingrowns.</li>
            <li> I have tried quite a few of them and this works</li>
            <li> It seems to me that a lot of the hair gets broken off at the skin instead of the roots being pulled out which means I have to epilate again a few days later after these hairs have grown</li>
            <li> And with this one I feel a  lot less pain!  </li>
            <li> it was so painful that i had to run cold water (and it really helps to subsidize the pain)after every few seconds of epilation, but this is just the first time.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s not true!</li>
            <li> and I decided I may as well try one because it&#x27;s no more expensive than one round of waxing (less, actually);</li>
            <li> this wasn&#x27;t as bad as some others, I was pretty amazed.</li>
            <li> Epilation IS really painful at first, but</li>
            <li> Working through the under arms area is pretty painful.</li>
            <li> It was painful at first</li>
            <li> Yes, it is painful at first.  </li>
            <li> I have had a few epilators in the past.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, dark leg hair, and shaving used to leave me with stubble, razor burn and you could still see the hairs below the surface.</li>
            <li> For those that are wondering how or why they die, it&#x27;s not that they stop functioning altogether but rather one will notice/hear a visible motor/rotating slow down during periods of regular/extended use.  </li>
            <li> for the initial 1-2 min it actually felt a bit painful</li>
            <li> The description of the epilator states that it is the least painful of any epilator out there, that the wipes will help sooth in case of any pain, and if there is any pain it will usually go away after the first few uses.</li>
            <li> Hard to remember after you&#x27;ve got a few margaritas in you, but</li>
            <li> But the hair will grow thinner, so I usually epilate  every two weeks, plus my hair grows faster because I take skin supplements</li>
            <li> so I usually don&#x27;t do everything in one session.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a small nook under the rotatory head where hair gets stuck every time and can be quite a pain to clean.&lt;br /&gt;3.</li>
            <li> (I usually waxed though since the epilator never removed every thing)</li>
            <li> when I usually do my shaving, its also supposed to relax your skin.</li>
            <li> And after a few minutes, I didn&#x27;t feel anything at all!</li>
            <li> I usually charge it up on a Sunday morning when I wake up, and by the time I&#x27;m done with my coffee</li>
            <li> I had some redness as usual but it went away overnight.</li>
            <li> Of course it is past the warranty date.</li>
            <li> I finally bought it figuring that I could use it as an electric razor if she was wrong</li>
            <li> Waxing was such a hassle and got expensive.</li>
            <li> Braun also claim that the epilator can pull out hairs as small as a grain of sand.</li>
            <li> He agreed to let me try it on his stomach and needless to say it definitely worked!  </li>
            <li> far as the pain is concerned- waxing is less painful.</li>
            <li> But if it gets cold (winter) and you lay off it a few weeks, you&#x27;re back to square one.  </li>
            <li> cuz this thing plain hurts!  </li>
            <li> No more buying shavers, no more shaving cream and no more cuts!</li>
            <li> As weird as this sounds, the skin nerves actually start to grow numb from the constant hair-pulling</li>
            <li> it becomes less and less uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> I have very thick black hair and plenty of it.</li>
            <li> after one month of use i have notice that my under arm hair looks thinner and softer, so it hardly hurts during removal.</li>
            <li> I ran out of hairs to epilate (got a little addicted to the perfection of the process), so am now waiting it out.  </li>
            <li> It has now been at least a year now</li>
            <li> Some have complained about the battery, but I&#x27;ve had no problems.</li>
            <li> This feature didn&#x27;t help me in the least.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t follow the directions and go really slowly up the leg(or wherever).  </li>
            <li> It feels like you are slowly pulling the hairs one by one, whereas with waxing - it&#x27;s done in one swipe.</li>
            <li> I felt like it was too slow to be thoroughly efficient.</li>
            <li> but I just go as slow as I need to.......</li>
            <li> No more shaving for me every 2 or 3 days!</li>
            <li> What do I mean?  </li>
            <li> The first time was painful!  </li>
            <li> So, a few years ago, I started getting waxed, which wasn&#x27;t horrible, but was very expensive and not something I could afford in the long-run; this lead me to purchase my own at-home wax warmer</li>
            <li> it is the on-off button, its a little difficult to handle and manueuver.</li>
            <li> My legs were a little difficult</li>
            <li> I read about every tip I could possibly find before using this bad boy.</li>
            <li> well worth it if you get the horrible razor burns</li>
            <li> , it simply doesn&#x27;t work,   I was shocked when I discover that.</li>
            <li> I decided to do the worst first-</li>
            <li> The worst part was along my bikini line, I now have little bumps every time my hair grows back, shaving irritates and waxing makes it worse.</li>
            <li> If it hurts, don&#x27;t jump from area to area, it&#x27;ll just make it worse.  </li>
            <li> Finish one &#x27;area&#x27;, which will go &#x27;numb&#x27; after a few seconds, then move onto the next.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Roommates may get annoyed though.  </li>
            <li> Over time, your hair will thin.</li>
            <li> Conversely, straighten the leg to do the area behind the knee.    </li>
            <li> I am tired of spending money on waxing and wanted to see how this would work.  </li>
            <li> So, I HATED shaving my legs and did not have the  bank account/ patience that professional waxing requires.</li>
            <li> No more cutting yourself with a razor.</li>
            <li> &gt; - The power supply is an odd size \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot; - Wall Warts are evil as they cover 2-3 other outlets when in use.</li>
            <li> less painful</li>
            <li> It makes it less painful.</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it is less painful than waxing.</li>
            <li> The noise is fairly loud and menacing, but it&#x27;s one of those things you get used to.</li>
            <li> and it was still a little painful, but not as awkward).  </li>
            <li> Also, the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; option on this product - it&#x27;s waterproof and can be used in the shower - turned out to be useless.</li>
            <li> The final straw for this product has been the terrible battery life.</li>
            <li> One star penalty for misleading description and useless wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> The massager head had a prickling effect that made it uncomfortable to epilate in those bony parts.</li>
            <li> That is unrealistic.  </li>
            <li> it was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s difficult to be 100% smooth(but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a bit difficult to navigate on and around the underarm, knee caps and bikini lines</li>
            <li> I no longer have to worry about cutting myself, buying expensive blades, razor burn, or shaving cream.</li>
            <li> First of all it is very VERY painful and it does a terrible job removing the hair!</li>
            <li> 1) let your hair grow out for a month and then epilate like crazy, re-charge and epilate again....</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t wait for hair to grow out, go ahead and epilate like crazy, and then do \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot; every day for a month...  </li>
            <li> is depressing.    </li>
            <li> Unhappy with the order.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my knees or ankles.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re REALLY afraid of pain have a glass of whisky or brandy</li>
            <li> It also tended to pinch my skin, which is really unpleasant on the underarms and the backs of the knees...</li>
            <li> But, I was afraid of how painful it would be to use.    </li>
            <li> I must say that it still didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as the 40 dollar one did</li>
            <li> Since then, it hasn&#x27;t been as bad.  </li>
            <li> that problem will not be as bad.  </li>
            <li> For me it didn&#x27;t hurt too bad.</li>
            <li> The prices aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> Using  this epilator was so painful.</li>
            <li> I could not manage to do my legs with them because they were so painful</li>
            <li> I will say that the bikini area was painful but my legs and underarms didn&#x27;t feel a thing.  </li>
            <li> I am afraid of it because it hurts me!  </li>
            <li> I am totally disappointed since it makes ingrownhair even I shave and then try again</li>
            <li> What a disappointing product!</li>
            <li> and i hate it</li>
            <li> I would still recommend it and use on places where I hate to wax.</li>
            <li> I decided to buy 7281 Wet&amp;Dry Body System - cordless for convenience, but it was very bad decision.   </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed with this product and with Braun customer service.</li>
            <li> Shaving gives me terrible itchy rashes on my legs</li>
            <li> I get HORRIBLE razor burn, so epilation is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t feel the worst</li>
            <li> And worst of all-</li>
            <li> and the worst thing is that you cannot use it when it&#x27;s plagued in</li>
            <li> It was especially painful on the underarms (although, that might just be me)!  </li>
            <li> I bought this product a while ago and it is very dangerous!!</li>
            <li> NoNo is actually USELESS -- while this is GRRREAT!!!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is my first Epilator ever! And let me tell you.. I love it!!! But does it hurt first time use?! Heck Yeah! It actually took me a while thinking if I really wanted to use it or not. When I used it for the first time it was more painful than any other times after, so it does gets better, but you have to understand that your body has very sensitive places no matter how many times you epilate! So it comes with two different heads one for shaving/trimming and the other one for epilating, this option lets you change caps. A roller cap is to \\&quot;massage\\&quot; your skin while epilating so you don&#x27;t feel much pain (I find it a little poky at times!), the other cap is for a closer epilating now I don&#x27;t like to use this one in the shower because it doesn&#x27;t slide as easy. It has a little light that does wonders! It helps you to see those few hairs that are stubborn and you missed. Now... some of the hair it only gets broken, but I think it depends on what direction the hair is and in what direction you are trying to epilate. I usually move my epilator in different directions and angles and it does the trick. I find that the knees area is the most sensitive, so no matter what it will hurt a little. Under my arms I always ask my husband to tighten my skin so the hair gets pull out and not broken. (by the way you HAVE to tighten your skin to get a better epilating).     Epilating is not going to give you that smooth feeling like after shaving that only lasts a few minutes anyway! Another fact is you WILL NOT go 4 weeks without epilating! That&#x27;s not true! At least not for me!You will start to see hair after a week or two, but this are the hairs that break and are not pull so it will only be a few, very unnoticeable in my opinion. But the hair will grow thinner, so I usually epilate  every two weeks, plus my hair grows faster because I take skin supplements and this makes it grow faster.   Battery wise... it lasts about 40 minutes enough time to shave for me anyway!    In conclusion...one of my best investments! No more shaving for me every 2 or 3 days! No more buying shavers, no more shaving cream and no more cuts! It&#x27;s easy to clean and it isn&#x27;t as loud as some review have mentioned! Not like a construction going on in your house!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy and comfortable to use in legs/arms and etc...The only issue is that the battery must last at least 2 hours.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B001VEK1AI Braun SE7281WD Xpressive Body System Rechargeable Wet &amp; Dry Epilator]]This is the best epilator that I have ever used. I used the old fashioned one with the rotating plastic bar and found it excrutiating.   Shaving gives me terrible itchy rashes on my legs so I began getting my legs waxed.  Unfortunately, I would have to get waxed very frequently so I bought the Braun epilator to extend the time I could go between waxings but I have not had to get waxed since I bought the epilator.  I would recommend starting with a professional leg wax so that the first time you use the Braun you won&#x27;t have thick growth to deal with the first time.  I have to use the Braun about every two weeks and I use it on my legs and forearms.  I use the shaver head for my underarms and bikini area and that works very well, especially in the shower.  Exfoliation 48 hours after exfoliation and twice weekly thereafter are necessary to prevent ingrown hairs.  This is a great product and works extremely well, with continued use it becomes less and less uncomfortable.  The only drawback is that it does not come with the facial attachment, which many people would like to have.</li>
            <li> I was using Braun Silk-epil before I purchased the xpressive. Its really good and seems like an improvement on earlier versions of Braun epilators. I feel there is a slight tingling still.  The battery life is far longer in this epilator than the older models so I can use it longer and need not re-charge it. The charging light indicator is a good addition since I always used to forget when I kept it for charging and I wasn&#x27;t sure how long to charge it, now the light becomes steady and I take it off.    One thing I didn&#x27;t like about it is the on-off button, its a little difficult to handle and manueuver. The wipes looked good but are mostly un-necessary.    Overall its good and does its job very well.</li>
            <li> The product is good.It comes with soothing strips which I have never used. The product cannot be used on face(upper lips), the instruction manual does not mention face.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Bed Bath and Beyond because mine just died and I needed one immediately. I was all excited with the cordless feature, what a great innovation!  Not so much...   I couldn&#x27;t turn it on... I let it charge for a total of 7 hours unsuccessfully, I was never able to turn it on.   I re-read the manual several time and nowhere is indicated the number of hours needed to charge it. After googling it, I quickly realized that numerous other ladies encountered the same problem.  I decided to bring it back to Bed Bath and Beyond and traded it for the corded model. The lady at the customer service told me that they have quite some returns on this model concerning the  battery... You have been warned!</li>
            <li> I was shopping around for thus Braun SE7281WD Epilator and Amazon has the best price. I didn&#x27;t have to wait too long to try how good it is. I&#x27;m satisfied with the Epilator, pain is not so bad, and I can handle it. I recommended to my friend and she is happy with that as well.</li>
            <li> this is the second one i bought, the first one got stolen. i can&#x27;t tell you how upset i was! i simply love it and use it on my legs, armpits and bikini line. For the face i honestly prefer the tweezers but it can be used on there too. i am a swimmer so i need to be hair-free all the time and being fairly hairy (and a brunette) before getting this silk-epil wet and dry i would shave every day or almost. now i just do minor touch ups twice a week. the best feature is that it goes under water and can be used on wet areas. this really helps opening the pores and reducing the pain especially for the armpits. i don&#x27;t get any rashes even though i have a very sensitive skin but i use aloe vera gel right after epilating and i shower with a scrubbing glove everyday. i strongly recommend this product. the 40min charge is long enough to do my whole body plus 2 touch ups. i also love that i can wash it under the water. in 1994 i had bought a silk-epil... i still have that old model and i hate it and it hurts and doesn&#x27;t do anything (that&#x27;s why i used to shave...) but this one is really wonderful!! I never waxed but i know the just shaved feeling. you won&#x27;t have it with this epilator but when your hairs regrow they are so small you&#x27;ll feel them at the touch but will barely see them. i didn&#x27;t try the shaving attach.</li>
            <li> The description of the epilator states that it is the least painful of any epilator out there, that the wipes will help sooth in case of any pain, and if there is any pain it will usually go away after the first few uses. First of all, if you can get past the first use, I applaud you. It was the most painful experience. I dont know how many people can actually enjoy afflicting pain on themselves, but I cannot. The wipes do not help. The shaver is ok. Since it is meant to be an epilator, the shaver is not as good as i would like it to be.. If you dont mind the pain, go for it. I cannot tell you if it works good or not because I cant even use the thing.</li>
            <li> I bought mine at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond. At first I was very excited for it seemed to work. But after a couple of weeks of use I saw how it spoiled my skin. I have very thick black hair and plenty of it. So, although it took most of the hair off it came back ingrown. It caused these very unsightly sometimes black, bluish bumps. Or if they were not bumps then just hair growing under my skin.  I tried to fix it with tweezers but that just left scars, I tried Emjoi After Epilation cream but that didn&#x27;t work, I also tried exfoliating often and that still did not work. All in all even if the hair came back finer or took longer to grow it was not worth it spoiling my skin and leaving scars. It has now been at least a year now and I still have problems with some ingrown hair that I did not have before trying the Epilator. The worst part was along my bikini line, I now have little bumps every time my hair grows back, shaving irritates and waxing makes it worse. Either way I lose and wish I had never tried the epilator.</li>
            <li> Review from a male cyclist after first use ... I&#x27;ll try to update a few weeks from now after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;First, not being a female, I don&#x27;t care if I miss a few hairs here and there.  Granted, after 15 years of shaving my legs, I can&#x27;t stand when I go a few weeks and they get hairy.  I do like the feel. But, the real reason is &#x27;maintenance&#x27;.  If you&#x27;ve ever crashed on your road biek (i.e. pavement/asphalt) at 25+ mph and gotten road rash from head to toe, you know why we shave our legs ... a lot easier to bandage and take care off.  Anyway ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLAN AHEAD! What do I mean?  Let&#x27;s see,&lt;br /&gt;1)  shave with your normal razor a few days ahead of time and let it grow out to the minimum length (the longer the hair, the more it hurts!) recommended.  Or, if starting new, cut it short with a barber razor with no guard.  And make sure you get it all the long hairs ... take your time.  Lesson learned from the first night!&lt;br /&gt;2)  Pop a couple of advil and start some margaritas (3-4, start earlier if you can&#x27;t drink them that fast) an hour before your planned start.  I did my legs over two nights.  Knees down first, then up to mid (or a bit higher thigh) the second night.  The second night was much easier as I didn&#x27;t hit the margaritas the first night (don&#x27;t worry, if you are shaving your legs you are serious enough to burn off the extra calories!)&lt;br /&gt;3)  I did shower the first night before I started, but not the second.  In hindsight, I think the margaritas had more of an effect than the shower.&lt;br /&gt;4)  Pull the skin as tight/taunt as you can when shaving.  Hard to remember after you&#x27;ve got a few margaritas in you, but it does help a lot to ease the stinging.&lt;br /&gt;5)  If it hurts, don&#x27;t jump from area to area, it&#x27;ll just make it worse.  Finish one &#x27;area&#x27;, which will go &#x27;numb&#x27; after a few seconds, then move onto the next.&lt;br /&gt;6)  If included, use the olay wipes per instructions ... seem to be a very low topical anthesia (sp?), but every bit helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that is it for now ... Does seem to prolong the smooth legs relative to shaving (i.e. last longer). Hopefully it does get easier/less painful the more you use it as other reviews have said.  I&#x27;ll try to repost on that aspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (over a year later) ... this thing does work, and works very well if you keep with it fairly regularly.  It also gets easier as the hairs grow back finer and are easier to yank out (plus just plain getting use to what to expect).  But if it gets cold (winter) and you lay off it a few weeks, you&#x27;re back to square one.  But overall I do like it better than shaving with a razor but about the same as an electric.</li>
            <li> Orange one seems to be good to me and I found this model after I bought Braun SE 7181 WD orange one.&lt;br /&gt;what&#x27;s different b/w these two? thanks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using epilators for years and this one is the best without a doubt!  The light is a great add on. The fact that you can use it in the shower is priceless!  And with this one I feel a  lot less pain!  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
            <li> The first use worked great but after that it never worked correctly. After it just never worked. I think it&#x27;s better to buy the epliator that is connected to the charger.</li>
            <li> I bought this product intending for it to be an upgrade from my previous Braun 5270 Silk-épil X&#x27;elle. It turned out to be double the price and NO improvement. With my previous epilator, I was going 2-3 weeks between epilations, but the hair removal for this one turned out to be inferior - I had to epilate once a week for the same results. Also, the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; option on this product - it&#x27;s waterproof and can be used in the shower - turned out to be useless. It is MUCH less effective when used wet. The final straw for this product has been the terrible battery life. I have had the epilator for five months, and for the past few uses it has only lasted ten minutes before losing its (full) charge. I&#x27;m going back to my old Braun, and buying a different brand when I can afford it.</li>
            <li> Product is reliable, wet or dry, although if using wet you might have to go over the same area more than once. My daughter used it for her first leg shaving/epilation and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> The little light really does help you find missed spots. It&#x27;s waterproof and when I dropped it in the sink, it came out just fine.  You can disassemble the parts and clean them at home.  It is much more comfortable than my previous epilator.</li>
            <li> If I had only tried this once, I would have stopped! However, after you do it a couple of times, you start to get use to it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt so much. I have also noticed that after just one use, my hair became much softer and did grow in slower. I would suggest doing it under the hot running water in the shower. That was the positive turning point for me as it significantly helped to desensitize the skin. Then, once out of the shower, you can go over area again to get anything you missed.  Finally, when it says to keep the head of the Epilator at 90 degree angle to leg, really pay attention to this, as if you angle it differently, it has a tendency to cut the hair instead of pull it out at the root, especially if you have thicker hair.</li>
            <li> Kudos to the engineers and designers who came up with this little helper. While the dry only version predecessor was prone to pinch the skin, this improved design is perfect. The people thought it well through. Hair removal in the shower is way more convenient. There is even a considerably bright light in this epilator, which helps to detect hiding hair. The epilation is less painful than before, making hair removal in the beginning stages more bearable. As the hair will grow back finer, the subsequent removal procedures decrease in pain and timely effort, as less and less hair will have to be removed. The unit is nicely designed and rests effortlessly in the palm of the hand. The battery charge lasts long enough to tackle large areas, even with the light permanently operating. Thanks to the Braun people for this marvel of hair removal technology. The price is well invested, as one will see great results right away. A true keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only ever owned this epilator, but in the 4+ months I&#x27;ve had it, I&#x27;ve been pretty happy with it. The epilator itself is very well built, it&#x27;s very sturdy, I&#x27;ve never had problems with the tweezing mechanisms, and it has a nice, solid feel. I chose this epilator because it was relatively well-reviewed, though I was worried by some of the negative reviews. I wanted to be able to epilate my legs and underarms, and this product performs pretty well. There are a few notes:  The light, this makes all the difference, and I never thought it would. I can see EVERY hair growing out of my legs, even if I&#x27;m in a dimly lit room.   The trimmer works fairly well, and it&#x27;s nice to have a device that is so multifunctional (great for traveling).  Some have complained about the battery, but I&#x27;ve had no problems. Even when I was just starting and took forever trying to get every hair, it lasted till I was done.  The noise is fairly loud and menacing, but it&#x27;s one of those things you get used to. Roommates may get annoyed though.  I don&#x27;t have any trouble with ingrown hairs, but some people do, so be mindful of that.  I really wanted the wet/dry capability, but the wetness makes the tweezers slide off the hair, so the hair ends up getting pulled pretty hard but doesn&#x27;t come out. This feature didn&#x27;t help me in the least. Also, it&#x27;s harder to get a good grip on the device when it&#x27;s wet.    Yes, anything that takes your hair out by the root will hurt, I don&#x27;t think the best epilator in the world could stop that, so don&#x27;t ever expect it to feel like a massage. Everyone who is saying the first time is the worst is absolutely right - when I did my underarms the first time, I was seeing spots it hurt so bad. My legs were a little difficult but after awhile it was easy to keep going. I tried the bikini line, but couldn&#x27;t get more than a few hairs out until it was unbearable. It is a good idea when you&#x27;re starting to epilate to epilate every few days for a week so that all the &#x27;cycles&#x27; of hair can be initially epilated. It got much less painful very quickly each time I&#x27;d epilate, though I still can&#x27;t do the bikini (upsetting because I was planning on completely doing away with razors). Now, legs are no problem, though my underarms still hurt some. Tip: make sure you don&#x27;t have any deoderant on your underarms when you epilate, it makes the hairs slick and the tweezers don&#x27;t grip well.    I really love having underarms with no stubble shadow, and they feel much smoother. Even when the hairs grow back, they are tapered, so they are much softer than shaving stubble which would irritate my skin. Similarly with the legs, tapered hairs are much less visible than blunt ones, and I do think it is growing back slightly more sparsely (I&#x27;ve heard with routine use, you can stop a lot of growth permanently).    I also had the same issues with 1) never getting a just-shaven smoothness 2) the finer hairs do break - these are best to attack with the slower mode, which is easier on the hair 3) the hair grows back faster than I expected. I have a fair complexion with fine hair, and my hair doesn&#x27;t grow particularly fast. I have to epilate my arms once a week, and my legs every other at best, so 4-6 weeks is a pretty blatant lie.     So, I&#x27;ll give it four stars because it does as good a job as any epilator could, most my complaints have to do with epilating in general. One star penalty for misleading description and useless wet/dry feature.</li>
            <li> Have used the Braun Silk-Epil Comfort that is corded.  Wanted to get a rechargeable one and after reviewing, this one seemed the best.  Well, it is!  I LOVE IT!!!  I charged mine as soon as I got it and have done my legs (twice), underarms (first time doing this and if you keep your arm held up, it was not that bad)and bikini area.  And it still has charge left in it and not running down.  Don&#x27;t know why people complain about it as it has not been a problem for me.  Have not tried in the shower, but I have cleaned it under water after each use.  Have not tried the shaver or trimmer attachment yet.  The massage rollers that are on it do seem to keep me from getting the bumps that I get when I use my corded one so they must be working.  This is one product I would recommend to anyone that is looking for an epilator.  My recommendation is if you are new to this, do areas over a couple of days to get use to it.  Trust me, it is easier the more you use it. I did my underarms for the first time and expected pain and bumps but there were none, I just did it over two day until clear of hair. This came with the free pack of pre-epilation wipes that I have not used so can&#x27;t give you any detail on them.  So if you are looking, this is the best one!</li>
            <li> First of all, this is a good epilator.  You will find that the fact that it works when wet does NOT make much of a difference at all -- in fact, I know that it works better when used dry. I also have a Braun 5270 model - which is corded and seems to be much more powerful.  The 5270 is great for flat, open skin areas like legs and arms but NOT a good one for the bikini area -- it is VERY unforgiving and will grab skin if it is used at a slightly wrong angle or around loose skin that is not pulled tight -- and that HURTS!  This is NOT as much of a problem with the 7281 model and it removes hair much more gently.    The head on my 7281 epilator needs to be replaced and at this point replacement heads won&#x27;t be available until the end of Jan. 2010.  The head seems to run fine for a couple of minutes and then bogs down for no apparent reason. I have taken the entire thing apart and it is not a cleaning issue, but seems to be a problem inside the head itself. This is the reason I bought the 5270 model...  Once the head is available it will cost over $44 to replace...</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve got a healthy amount of hair growth - I come from a germanic background, so shaving legs/bikini line for me isn&#x27;t really the best choice - also waxing only lasts a couple weeks for me and I end up getting weird in-grown hairs, so epilating actually does a great job.    I will agree with another review on here that no matter what you can&#x27;t be silky smooth because of the cycle of the hair growth, you just can&#x27;t catch the teeny short fine hairs that are just popping up to the surface.  I&#x27;ve devised a method however if I do want to be silky - first I&#x27;ll epilate my forearms and legs earlier in the day, then when I go out for something special, I&#x27;ll use those sand paper pads from walgreens called \\&quot;smooth away\\&quot; that is like a shaving alternative that basically sands your hairs off - it gets the hairs gone better than shaving and doesn&#x27;t leave sharp hairs popping up during the grow-out.    Pain: Yes you get used to the pain, I don&#x27;t use soothing creams or anything, sometimes I trick my mind by thinking \\&quot;ahh, this feels good.. it&#x27;s warm\\&quot; and that works alot of the time..     About this particular model: I think it&#x27;s really great, I&#x27;m 90% happy with it, I wish the noise was a little quieter, and I wish the battery lasted just a little longer.  But other than that I LOVE how it&#x27;s cordless - that means I can go out and use it on the patio.  I LOVE how I can wash it or use the wet shaver. I LOVE the smart light and I LOVE the design.  So there you go    Happy hair removal.  By the way - Laser Hair Removal actually is awesome.  If you can find a place that&#x27;s cheap enough and someone who is experienced enough, DO IT!!!! I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get it done sooner, my bikini line is hair-free and I don&#x27;t have to worry about in-grown hairs or shaving anymore.  highly highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this product couple of days ago and tried my legs today &amp; I absolutely fell in love with...I took a hot warm bath and tried afterward....it took only 10 minutes to do my legs &amp; d pain was NOT HORRIBLE at all......I&#x27;ve always done threading and shaving &amp; after reading the reveiw I was expecting a crucial pain but miraculously it didn&#x27;t happen 4 me.........it was a little pain at the first 2 minutes but right after that I wasn&#x27;t feeling any pain unbearable as other people have commented like.....I guess it depends on your skin type ans so....but even it did pain, I would still suggest every girl out there to have one ....the result is amazing.......I can&#x27;t w8 2 show off my skin in summer now.....I am in super duper mad love with this product &amp; would strongly recommend to every girl to have one......XOXOXOXO</li>
            <li> I have tried and owned it all: razors, electric razor, the original Epilady back more than 25 years ago, the Smooth Away system, Nair, and a really nice hot wax kit.  I am very sensitive to pain, but my desire to be done with hassling with hair and mess overrode that. I expected less from this epilator than it has delivered. Yes, there is what I would call discomfort with the first and most ambitious hair removal, but I suggest that you do use the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; head with it. That DOES work for a first timer. I now prefer the regular attachment for efficiency, but the massager is great on the remaining sensitive areas. I am flabbergasted at how many hairs it finds.  A GREAT feature is the \\&quot;Smart Light\\&quot; that shows me the tiniest hairs. Very satisfying to watch them disappear as the epilator goes over them. It is also a very easy to clean device!  I ran out of hairs to epilate (got a little addicted to the perfection of the process), so am now waiting it out.  I have had smooth, smooth legs for DAYS.  Worth every cent of the 119 dollars I spent.  (Note: I&#x27;ve not tried it in the shower yet, as I&#x27;m happy about being able to set out a towel and watch tv and have a snack while I do this thing. You are not trapped in the bathroom.)    Tips: If some hairs are shorter than 2 mm and just can&#x27;t get picked up, they are not visible in any case. Wait a day, and the epilator will get them. DO exfoliate. I recommend the \\&quot;bath gloves\\&quot; that you can get at the grocery store, but the Body Shop has terrific exfoliating bath gloves. If a hair is stubbornly being missed, be sure to stretch the skin tight right at that area, and try again.</li>
            <li> Works so well. I have used many &amp; this is THE BEST. Wished it worked while plugged in though.</li>
            <li> I have had this epilator for almost a year now and I love it!  I lost my power cord in October and didn&#x27;t realize how great it had been until I had to go back to shaving for a few months.  I just ordered my replacement cord and figured I should put up a review since the reviewes on Amazon helped me decide which way to go on this product.    Durability &amp; Quality - This epilator has held up exceptionally well.  It has a fairly long charge and I can get through both legs and still have enough for other areas and for touch-ups.  It works well in both wet and dry conditions, though personally I found that I was having problems getting it to grip my hairs in the shower and that it did a better job with FINE HAIR when I used it DRY.  I have very fine and VERY light colored hair... you can&#x27;t see it under normal circumstances, but in the summer when the light outside hits my legs they light up like a christmas tree!  Using the epilator DRY and in a lot of good light I am able to get most if not all of those fine hairs.    Hair Removal - No product is going to banish your hair permanently, not even laser hair removal!  Yes, you can get a pretty great shave from this, but you have to be willing to do one, or a combination of several things: 1) let your hair grow out for a month and then epilate like crazy, re-charge and epilate again.... and then do touch-ups every few days  or  2) don&#x27;t wait for hair to grow out, go ahead and epilate like crazy, and then do \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot; every day for a month...  (I&#x27;ve tried it both ways) either way I found that it took about a month before I really was able to \\&quot;get them all\\&quot;.      Here&#x27;s the but... you might not FEEL smooth for several reasons.  1) your pores have just been disrupted and you&#x27;ll feel \\&quot;bumpy\\&quot;  2) you have hairs that are JUST beginning to poke up through the skin and aren&#x27;t long enough to pull out (hence, touch-up&#x27;s required)  3) you have fine hairs (like mine) that need more convincing and slip through the epilators grasp a fewtimes.    I&#x27;ve read solutions to this like going ahead and shaving with a razor after epilating if you want the really smooth feel.    My goal was to reduce the length I needed between shaving and to get smoother, finer re-growth, and that&#x27;s what it did!  I epilate once a month for the duration of a TV show and then I only have to \\&quot;swipe\\&quot; over them once or twice more through the month.  After I lost my charging cord it took well into November before I really needed to shave.  What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the hair that would grow inbetween epilation sessions had an absolutely more smooth and soft texture... since going back to shaving my re-growth is bristly and irritating.    Can&#x27;t wait to go back to epilating once my charger gets here!</li>
            <li> This model works much better than the older Braun epilator.  Less pain, hardly any, and faster hair removal wet or dry.  The trimmer and shaving attachments eliminate the need for a separate razor.</li>
            <li> I have had a few epilators in the past.  This one is the best.  I love that it&#x27;s rechargeable and it can be used both wet and dry.  It&#x27;s a very good buy!</li>
            <li> Using  this epilator was so painful. I decided to return it. By the way, I don&#x27;t know any other epilator made by the other brands. In this regard,  I can&#x27;t compare the item. Maybe this is the best one, it&#x27;s painful though.</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for +20 years. This is the 3rd I&#x27;ve owned and by far the best. Design is great. Removes hair easily. Barely feel it. Also, is the first epilator I&#x27;ve been able to use on my face without reaction. The trimmer also works great too.   I highly recommend this unit. Over time, your hair will thin. My legs have very sparse, fine hair. As it grows, it is so soft/fine, it is barely noticeable.  As for lasting 3 to 4 weeks, not so much. I truly believe it depends how fast your hair grows and how smooth you want to be. Definitely a week or 10 days of smoothness.</li>
            <li> I have been thrilled with this product, which performs exactly as advertised.  Easy to use, very low on the pain scale.  Vast improvement from my previous epilator, and worth the expense.</li>
            <li> I have to anticipate that Im a beautician with 14 years of waxing on my shoulders.  Waxing was my religion till now.  I have to admit that I m impressed on how well this product works..especially on the short hairs.  I&#x27;m loving it and I told every single girls I know to go for it and buy it.  The pain is minimum on legs and a little bit on arms and underarms..I will stick with waxing just for the bikini area..    A MUST HAVE!!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it. I bought \\&quot;Braun SE7281WD\\&quot; because my old \\&quot;Braun Silk-epil\\&quot; broke down (after 5 years of use!!!!pretty good I think). This model has more tweezers, so I finish my epilation 3 times faster than with the old one. It also reall gentle on my skin, and love the light!!!!!!!!!!! This epilator doesn&#x27;t leave any hair behind, even short ones. Great product.</li>
            <li> This machine does remove the hairs with repeated passes, the discomfort of initial removal takes some getting use to, asprin and hot water bath prior.  Hopefully with time the hairs will be easier to pull in the future.[[ASIN:B001VEK1AI Braun SE7281WD Xpressive Body System Rechargeable Wet &amp; Dry Epilator]]</li>
            <li> Ok my sweet hubby got me this for Christmas last year.  I gave it 3 stars only because it can do what it was designed to do... rip the hair from your flesh!  I have been TRYING to learn to like this thing.  It isn&#x27;t going well.  I am afraid of it because it hurts me!  The word torture comes to mind.  This thing wouldn&#x27;t be allowed at Gitmo as a persuasion device because it is down right in-humane!  All of you giving it 4 and 5 stars are either more of a tough gal than I will ever be or on some serious drugs cuz this thing plain hurts!  I can&#x27;t recommend it but I do appreciate my husband efforts... makes a nice paper weight...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ripping out hair versus shaving since they first invented the Epilady and am now on my 4th hair removal appliance.  For those that are wondering how or why they die, it&#x27;s not that they stop functioning altogether but rather one will notice/hear a visible motor/rotating slow down during periods of regular/extended use.  In researching what was currently available, I&#x27;m upgrading from the Braun Silk Epil Eversoft Model #5316 (yellow and gray case) to the Braun Se 3170 Silk Epil 3 (pink &amp; white case) specifically because it is Braun&#x27;s latest model with a cord.  Unless one removes her (or his) hair over a multiple day period, a 40 minute rechargeable battery isn&#x27;t going to cut it for the \\&quot;all hair at once\\&quot; period and/or for perfectionists.      There is no body area I can&#x27;t use it on now -- legs, underarms, upper lip, and even extreme bikini (we&#x27;re talking \\&quot;Brazilian\\&quot; girls!).  I&#x27;ve long since quit using the massage guard and opt for the fastest/closest pull there is.  To be totally fair to newbies, no, I didn&#x27;t get here overnight.  And, no, it will never be totally discomfort free (one IS still pulling out a hair by its root). However, even the 2nd time will be light years easier than the first.  One is pulling out fewer hairs and they truly, honestly, I swear, cross my heart . . . grow back finer.      Pointers for the first time user: shave first and allow a noticeable stubble regrowth (2 to 3 days worth).  The hair is then both upright and long enough to successfully, easily remove.  Use baby powder/talcum powder to keep the area you&#x27;re working on dry and the Silk Epil will glide across the skin and target only your hair.  As weird as this sounds, the skin nerves actually start to grow numb from the constant hair-pulling so if the first pass in a sensitive area has you seeing stars -- the subsequent passes will honestly get easier.  Move into a more sensitive area gradually on the slower speed (pulling fewer hairs per second) until you feel comfortable or rather numb enough to make a sweeping pass on high speed.  Personally, I then shave the same area afterwards (in the shower or bath) to smooth/level the hairs that were too short to pull and my legs are literally as smooth as glass for up to several days afterwards.  In my case, this whole process needs to be done roughly every 10 days -- from a visible perspective, I could actually go longer but I do it based on wanting a smooth feeling versus hairless appearance.    If you don&#x27;t have the time to start with stubble, trim the hair to a roughly 1/4 inch length -- just as they&#x27;ll do for a bikini line waxing.  If the hair is too long, it&#x27;ll be more prone to breakage versus removal, and it&#x27;s also more painful.    As for the upper lip, I&#x27;d like to tell you that area gets easier over time, but it&#x27;s just not the case.  I just suck it up and take it like a woman!    A newbie may also experience some skin tenderness/bruising afterwards but it&#x27;ll quickly fade in 24 to 48 hours.    Good luck, ladies (and gents)!    PS: Another tip for newbies: Pull the skin taunt/smooth where it&#x27;s loser (as in the underarm area, around the bikini line, and on the upper lip) to decrease discomfort and prevent accidental skin pinching.  The easiest way to do one&#x27;s knees is to bend the leg -- the entire knee area becomes smooth.  Conversely, straighten the leg to do the area behind the knee.    For those who become nervous at the site of blood, a newbie may also experience a hair root removal (1 or 2 spots here or there especially in sensitive areas) drawing some blood.  Some roots, the first time around, are well anchored.  The hair then starts to grow back thinner and finer over time making it far easier to remove.</li>
            <li> This is my first purchase of an epilator. I like the fact that I have the option of using this while in or out of the shower unlike other epilators. The pain is tolerable. I have not used the wipes provided to help with the pain. But it took me some time to have the courage to do the first swipe. Maybe it&#x27;s because of the sound, which was louder than I expected it to produce.     At first, I used it with the massager head since the manual said that that stimulates the skin before and soothes the skin after hair removal. But I had difficulty getting all the hair out in some areas (knee, bony part of the leg, armpit - I get cuts). The massager head had a prickling effect that made it uncomfortable to epilate in those bony parts. So I tried using the efficieny cap, which I found out was much better in doing the job especially in those problem areas.    The process of epilating takes some time so I usually don&#x27;t do everything in one session. But it does get the hair out so I&#x27;m still satisfied.</li>
            <li> I find this epilator works much better than the other ones I have used.  I had another wet/dry that was nowhere near as effective, so I am just buying another one of these to make up for the short battery life because I like it that much.  This is my second wet/dry, and my third or forth epilator.  I get HORRIBLE razor burn, so epilation is the way to go.  Epilation IS really painful at first, but well worth it if you get the horrible razor burns like I used to!!!  The razor burns last 24/hr a day, and this is over quickly.  I find epillating in the shower is convenient, more effective, and less painful than outside of it, but it IS hard to to see what you are doing.  The way to get started with epilation is to shave first.  Since each hair grows at a different rate you can epilate for one or two days, and then shave again, and epilate again, etc., etc.  Don&#x27;t follow the directions and go really slowly up the leg(or wherever).  That is unrealistic.  I am sure it is more efficient, but that is why you have to go back ansd forth like they tell you not to.  I use this everywhere which is great, too  This epilator is much more thorough, and that is why it is much better.  The others are not worth the little bit(or lot) of money you save.  Good luck!</li>
            <li> This little product is super cool - it goes with me whenever I go out of town. I have fine black hair which grows really fast. I normally epliate without the massage head and its bearable. I haven&#x27;t done my armpits but thats when the shaving head comes in handy. And when I&#x27;ve been lazy for a long time and haven&#x27;t done my arms n legs, I use the trim option to trim the hair before epilating. It makes it less painful. Initially I was really scared of using it because of the sound it was making and because everybody kept saying that it would hurt pretty bad but it doesn&#x27;t. In fact over time you&#x27;ll get used to it and redness will also reduce. I normally don&#x27;t use it in the shower because its less effective but the wet/dry feature is really good for cleaning it. It does everything it promises.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. I wish the power lasted longer and I could use it plugged to power source (this is cordless only)&lt;br /&gt;2. The build quality could have been better. There&#x27;s a small nook under the rotatory head where hair gets stuck every time and can be quite a pain to clean.&lt;br /&gt;3. Pricing</li>
            <li> This was the first time I used this product after years of waxing.The epilator works like a razor as it is not able to pull the smaller and finer hair.Working through the under arms area is pretty painful. Also the skin gets stuck sometime if not pulled taut.  Also it consumes a lot of time.Overall I did not like the product.I would like to use the traditional waxing method.</li>
            <li> No pain and very easy to use, except this product is not for me since I have in grown hairs :( Sad....my friends who use this have no issues at all. I would still recommend it and use on places where I hate to wax.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to epilating about 5 years ago. She had a double headed one from Spain it was amazing you could barely feel a thing. I searched for one similar everywhere and did some research that said the 40 dollar epilators do just as good as the more expensive ones. So I settled and bought a 40 dollar one, it did the job yes and I got use to how it worked (I usually waxed though since the epilator never removed every thing) Well it died about 4 months ago after, I decided that I wanted an epilator that would last and actually get the job done.  I went back to researching, I read so many reviews and many of you probably have and will. It is from my experience it depends on the person and the day that makes the review (I am having normal day.)    I decided in the to buy the Braun 7281 and crossed my fingers. Since I had grown use to my last epilator I was extremely surprised that this one felt so much better and barely noticed any pain; as well as I don&#x27;t have to wax anymore saving so much more money now by spending more on the better epilator. But I decided I would give myself about 6 weeks and see how it did pain wise. It didn&#x27;t feel the worst but it did sting for a few minutes and then I got use to it again. I must say that it still didn&#x27;t hurt as bad as the 40 dollar one did and it still did just as good as a wax would. (Any epilator is going to sting if you haven&#x27;t waxed or epilated in a 6 weeks +, I recommend waxing if you have sensitive skin before you jump back into epilating.) In the end I would even say this one is equal if not better then one my friend had and would recommend it to anybody. Added bonus is that it comes with many different tops as well as an electric razor.   If you are still on the fence about buying this one verses the 40 dollar one you have also been looking at. Buy the 40 dollar one first and in a few months when it dies, come back and buy this one. But if you want to save yourself time and money then make the jump and buy the Braun 7281 you won&#x27;t regret it.  Also if you aren&#x27;t familiar with how to use and epilator read the instructions it doesn&#x27;t work like a razor and if you use it like a razor it will hurt. I feel it is the only reason people would complain about this epilator.</li>
            <li> Not for the meek, but this is the best epilator money can buy.  The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is huge too. Used to have the corded version and although it worked great it was difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Well, this thing certainly is a process if you struggle with thick leg hair and lots of it.  For those of you who are lucky enough to have thin and light hair, this thing will pull it right out, no prob.  For the rest of us, it&#x27;s a process.  The first time was painful!  Soaking in a warm tub, drinking a bottle of wine, and yelling loudly helped.  Since then, it hasn&#x27;t been as bad.  First time just got the top layer.  Waited for a week or so and got more.  You kind of have to keep up with it as your hair grows and figure out which hairs grow in what direction.  My legs are not exactly smooth, but I haven&#x27;t bothered to shave and don&#x27;t have man hair all over my legs so I guess it&#x27;s working.  I have red legs and what looks like razor burn for about 2 days afterward.  I feel like the next time I use it (which will be soon) that problem will not be as bad.  It gets better is what I&#x27;m saying and my fingers are crossed that over time I will feel the need to shave less and less.  But again, it is a process.      I have not and probably will not use it on my bikini line, though the razor and trimmer on this thing is awesome.  Want to try the pits, but haven&#x27;t had the guts.</li>
            <li> I wanted to list what came in the box since I don&#x27;t think the description gives enough info:  The epilator with Lithium Ion rechargeable battery  Massaging, pivoting cap  Shaver with trimmer head  Efficiency, pivoting cap  Pre-epilation wipes  Nifty carrying pouch    On to a short review.   Epilation definitely hurts when you first get started but from my experience it gets lesser the more you continue to epilate regularly. The hairs seem to grow in alot thinner as well. I have been able to start using this on my underarms which I have heard is one of the most sensitive areas (definitely hurt pretty bad the first time) I have not yet started using it on my bikini area since that seems much more sensitive to me, but that works out ok since it comes with a pretty nice shaver. So even if you decide against using this for epilation, its not going to be something that you can never use. This product can be used in the shower which definitely makes it pretty convenient since that is when I usually do my shaving, its also supposed to relax your skin. It has a rechargeable Lithium Ion battery, so its definitely made to be long lasting.  I gave this 4 stars because I really wanted the 7781 wet/dry model that has several more attachments but have been unable to find a way to purchase it here in the US. I have found a way to purchase some of the attachments through Braun from their product replacement page, there is a link on their website. However I would have preferred to just purchase the other model.  Overall great product, well made and epilation gives me the results I want (minus the pain)</li>
            <li> I am a first time user of the epilator. Before I made my purchase, I did lots and lots of research. This was the model I finally decided on.     The first time I used it, I did so dry. It stung a little, but nothing more than tweezing out hairs. And after a few minutes, I didn&#x27;t feel anything at all! The second time I used it, I did so in the shower. I think I actually prefer using it wet. The pain was lesser, sort of felt like shaving over razor burn, but after the first pass I felt nothing!     I have thick, dark leg hair, and shaving used to leave me with stubble, razor burn and you could still see the hairs below the surface. With this epilator, I have pain for just a second, and yes at first there are red marks, but they disappear after a few hours. I use it at night and by the morning, the red marks are completely gone. The light on it is absolutely great and illuminates hairs I couldn&#x27;t see. I use the higher speed as I find this hurts less than the slower speed. I also used the shaver head and it&#x27;s pretty good too!    I must confess, I didn&#x27;t actually buy it on Amazon. I signed up for Bed Bath and Beyond&#x27;s email and they sent me a coupon for 20% off a single item. I went to their store, bought the epilator which they have priced at $119, with my coupon it saved me $24!!    In closing, I love this thing and will never, ever go back to shaving.</li>
            <li> I bought this product approx. 6 months ago. I am totally disappointed since it makes ingrownhair even I shave and then try again and it does not catch many hair in the same time so epilation time gets longer I really do not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I was really really really hesitant to get an epilator...in fact, I had been scared to get one my whole life. IF I had only known then, what I know now!! (the irony of life, right?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very pale white skin and very thick black body hair, thanks to some not-so-good luck with the gene pool. :-) Been shaving all my life, and not only would I get razor rash EVERY time, but the regrowth would be evident within a matter of hours. Yuck!  So, a few years ago, I started getting waxed, which wasn&#x27;t horrible, but was very expensive and not something I could afford in the long-run; this lead me to purchase my own at-home wax warmer and I started waxing myself. Things I loved about waxing: regrowth was slower; no razor rash or tiny purple dots at each hair follicle(!!!). The things I hated about waxing: very messy; very time consuming; have to wait until a good portion of hair has grown back AND until hair growth is at least 1/2 inch or so before waxing EVERY time, which is ugly and makes me feel self-conscious.  So:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided I needed to find a longer-term solution. Looked into the No!No!, but it has horrible reviews by just about everyone who doesn&#x27;t get paid by the infomercial company (certainly a few exceptions, but not enough to make me comfortable dropping nearly $300 on it!). Then I saw epilators... and I decided I may as well try one because it&#x27;s no more expensive than one round of waxing (less, actually); plus, I&#x27;ve undergone waxing so many times, so it couldn&#x27;t possibly hurt more than that! Right? I hoped....  Many epilators get great reviews, so I had a hard time deciding on one. I ended up going with this one (Braun SE7281WD) because (1) It had some of the best and most thorough reviews; (2) I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;d prefer to use it in the shower or dry, so I wanted the wet/dry feature to test all the possibilities; and (3) I liked that this came with several \\&quot;heads\\&quot; so I could work my way into it with the massaging head, and use the precision head for special areas, etc.  I made the purchase, even though I was still really nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been about 5 weeks and I don&#x27;t regret the decision one bit! The first go-round was a little painful and awkward, I must admit (I tried it in the shower first which was way too awkward, so resumed after shower with dry but warm skin and it was still a little painful, but not as awkward).  The 2nd time I used it (dry only) was about 1 week later - only a little hair was present and it felt like almost nothing. Same with 3rd week.  Last week, I had a little more hair growth than the previous weeks, and I made a leap and decided to not use any of the heads at all, but just the bare epilator (dry as usual).  It took the hair off so well, and was nearly painless (honestly, at this point, it feels like the skin is getting \\&quot;a good scratching\\&quot;...I can&#x27;t explain this, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt...*almost* feels good in a way, but not quite).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this epilator. I usually charge it up on a Sunday morning when I wake up, and by the time I&#x27;m done with my coffee it&#x27;s ready to go. I use it on my armpits, arms, legs, bikini (need to be careful around the creases - I did knick myself once when the skin was too tight and had a slightly elevated/pinched-up area...ever since, I have used the precision head for the bikini area!), and stomach below the navel. There&#x27;s always a charge left when I am done. It is pretty fast and easy. Hair regrowth seems to be slowing down and thinning out...since my hair is so thick, I do get a few ingrowns, especially near the thicker skin at the knees, but that&#x27;s WAY better than the MANY ingrowns I got during waxing; and a deep salt scrub always helps the problem (I make my own: fine sea salt mixed with almond or grapeseed oil and 2 drops of lavendar aromatherapy oil). Oh, last week I also discovered that for some ingrowns (those causing a little bump on the surface of the skin and therefore not deep), I can move the epilator several times overthe bump in different directions and it&#x27;ll remove the excess skin and pull out the hair! Much better option than me trying to dig it out with tweezers and making myself bleed!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and the best part is: I don&#x27;t have to wait until most of the hair has regrown before I use it...in a similar fashion as shaving, I can epilate anytime I need to and have soft, smooth skin!! However, different and much better than shaving, the hair won&#x27;t regrow within a few hours...or days!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know this review is long, but sometimes I think it&#x27;s really important to share the whole story. I hope it will help someone else out there.  :-)</li>
            <li> I have used serval epilators, Epilady, and two different Emjoi ones.  I always had a problem with those having cheap cords that stopped working long before the epilator died.  This one is great and the best epilator that I have used.      Four stars only because the problem I have with it is that the cover pops off often when I am using it.  Other than that it works fine and I have no other problems with it.    I don&#x27;t use it in the shower, but I love the fact that it rinses out with water nicely.</li>
            <li> The epilator, my first, which I have had for two months does a good job of removing hair, but breaks off more hair than I would like. It is definitely less painful and much easier than waxing, but I feel like I have to do do it about once a week for the best results. The biggest problem I have is hair growing in just below the outermost layer of skin; this hair is not removed. All in all, it is the best solution I have come across for leg hair, and if it lasts a long time it will be well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaver based on a recommendation from a friend. I was skeptical at first because I had flashbacks of the \\&quot;EpiLady\\&quot; from back in the 80&#x27;s. The Epilady was nothing short of a torture device but the Braun shaver is NOTHING like that. Sure it hurts a little but it is definitely tolerable especially after taking a couple of ibuprofin (or a glass of wine!) In my opinion, it is less painful than waxing. I have used it on my legs and forearms and will attempt bikini line when I build up some courage.</li>
            <li> I was bummed when my Philips Satinelle died on me last month. I had brought it back with me from Europe 10 years ago, but I was quite happy with it. The market for epilators is not as developed here as it is in Europe and I&#x27;m not for shaving at all. I&#x27;d rather \\&quot;suffer\\&quot; a bit and be good for a few weeks, plus, when the hair grows back, it&#x27;s finer and softer than after shaving.    I did some research and found the Braun SilkEpil Xpressive. All the reviews I read spoke highly of it, either in the US or in Europe (I couldn&#x27;t help but check there too). The price tag is quite high but when you think at how much you use it over the years, or when you compare it to waxing at a salon/spa, it is actually quite a  deal. I liked the idea of being cordless (no more stuck to an outlet) and the wet option.    I received it last week and I am delighted. Wow, what an improvement in 10 years! I started epilating 15 years ago with my mom&#x27;s Babyliss Epilady (ouch!!!), then upgraded to my Philips one and saw the difference in pain level. But no comparison to the Xpressive! I used the efficiency cap on my legs and in 15 minutes, I had smooth, touchable skin. Didn&#x27;t cringe, even on the back of my legs. I had some redness as usual but it went away overnight. Epilating my underarms was not as \\&quot;enjoyable\\&quot; but again, I used the efficiency cap and the highest speed. I am a hardcore epilating person ;-) I also like the Smartlight function, quite practical with artificial light.    Overall, a great purchase that I did not regret a single second. Throw away the razor and get the Braun SilkEpil Xpressive!!</li>
            <li> This was my first time using an epilator of any kind. I read all of the reviews and chose carefully. I&#x27;ve been a waxer in the past but waiting for my hair to grow long enough to wax as well as the cost has become tiresome. I followed the advice of many reviewers and took a long bath before starting. It was painful at first but I got used to it quickly and the pain was very short lived. It seemed much better than waxing to me because it took only the hair and not any of the skin.</li>
            <li> Braun 7281 WD lasted a year and a half before the \\&quot;rechargeable\\&quot; battery died completely; it had held the charge for shorter and shorter times for a while. Of course it is past the warranty date. I certainly expected such an expensive epilator to last a lot longer. I&#x27;m switching brands.</li>
            <li> This is a great hair removal device and my first epilator.  The pain was pretty bad my first use, but since using it several times since, the pain has dramatically decreased.  So far, I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and I have enjoyed using this as an alternative to shaving.  The hair grows back so much slower and epilations are quick and easy.  I highly recommend this product.    As others have commented on the battery life, I must say that this has not been an issue for me.  I have used the epilator for up to 30 minutes at a time and not been effected by a low battery.  I do like the option to use this in the shower, and the light on this particular model is extremely helpful and useful.</li>
            <li> till i was in india, body hair removal was not a concern. all i needed was to visit a beauty salon and shell out around Rs. 150 (or $3, unbelievable right?) for waxing of legs, arms and underarms. but after coming to US hair removal became an issue as professional waxing is hell costly. I tried to do it at home with ready to use wax strips, which are okay to use on legs, but one can not use them efficiently for arms plus you end up in a sticky mess. then i tried shaving. shaving gives a smooth effect to skin but for only a few hours and it also started causing irritation to my underarms may be because of the coarse stubs of hair.  finally i decided to buy epilator and instantly liked the Braun&#x27;s wet &amp; dry one as it&#x27;s cordless and can be used in shower. with a pleasant surprise the product reached me within three days of placing order (my first ever purchase with amazon and i instantly fall in love with amazon).    i never used an epilator before and was a bit scared as according to some reviews the process hurts. i decided to use it in shower with the pivoting cap, though i did not use the pre epilation wipes it came with(the pack is still unopened). for the initial 1-2 min it actually felt a bit painful but eventually my skin adapted to the pinching sensation.  the most difficult part was to use it for underarms. it was so painful that i had to run cold water (and it really helps to subsidize the pain)after every few seconds of epilation, but this is just the first time. if you can brave that you definitely going to fall in love with epilating ur under arms. it&#x27;s better than waxing as u don&#x27;t need to wait for all the hair to grow up to a certain length and even a single visible hair can be removed just whenevr you want. after one month of use i have notice that my under arm hair looks thinner and softer, so it hardly hurts during removal. also it&#x27;s equally effective for bikini line.   the product is really compact, handy and one can use it just anywhere anytime. the battery back up is more than enough to complete your job in one go. i found the spot light really helpful as it makes even the smallest of hair noticeable, if you want a quick epilation better to use it without the pivotal head and use it dry.     my suggestion would be go for it and simply forget all the hassles and cost associated with waxing or irritation of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is my first epilator and I love it. It pulls very thoroughly, even on very short hair that wax won&#x27;t ever get. I used it in both dry and wet conditons, and I think it does a more thorough job on dry skin mostly because your hair has more of a distance from your skin. It&#x27;s not very noisy either. I really like the light. It&#x27;s very helpful in letting me see which spots needs more attention.</li>
            <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a year and a half of occasional use, the battery has significantly worn out. I have queried Google, yahoo, and Amazon looking for the battery and cannot find it for sale anywhere, including on Braun&#x27;s web site. I have also tried emailing Braun several times but have never received a response. Six months later, I am going to try emailing them again, but I don&#x27;t expect to get a response this time either since they seem to not give a (explitive). It&#x27;s not like the battery is not easily replaced; two TORX screws, pull the unit out of the casing, and the battery is right there. Apply dielectric grease or vaseline on the seals, put it back together. It&#x27;s not hard, so they should make the battery available for purchase via their web site!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation? Despite my initial 5/5 review, I have to knock a few stars off. You can save a good amount of money and get a corded Braun that will last much longer than this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is by far the best epilator I have ever tried. My first one was an Epilady coil epilator. Remember those? Very effective, but very painful the first few uses, and I never could manage to use it on my legs for more than a few seconds at a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried these rotary \\&quot;tweezer\\&quot; type epilators from other companies - Emjoi for example - and wasted money on them. I could not manage to do my legs with them because they were so painful so they went largely unused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the 7281 - I can&#x27;t get over how well this epilator works. Unlike the crap brands, this unit is not made from cheap loose-fitting pot metal. The \\&quot;tweezers\\&quot; use a plastic and stainless steel tweezer to get a really tight grip on each hair and pulls it out. I will not say it is painless, but it is every bit as effective as the old \\&quot;coil\\&quot; type epilators, with much less pain. This is the very first epilator I have ever been able to manage to use on my legs and do it all in one session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - It is extremely effective; almost as effective as waxing&lt;br /&gt; - The Braun 7281 is far less painful than other epilators; I successfully cleared my legs in one session!&lt;br /&gt; - The massaging head really does help reduce pain. I have tried it without any head, with the basic pivoting head, and the massaging head. It does not eliminate the pain but it does greatly reduce it. The pain reduction is definitely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt; - Once you clear an area keeping up with it is painless&lt;br /&gt; - The light makes seeing missed hairs extremely easy&lt;br /&gt; - It is fully washable - a major win since oil buildup is the bane of epilators&lt;br /&gt; - The shaver is okay; I tried it on my underarms (even with the 7281 I am timid to try epilating there)&lt;br /&gt; - It really does work very well in the bath/shower/steam room!&lt;br /&gt; - As far as epilators go, the Braun SE7281WD is very quiet. Note: \\&quot;very quiet\\&quot; in this context is a relative term!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; - The power supply is an odd size \\&quot;wall wart\\&quot; - Wall Warts are evil as they cover 2-3 other outlets when in use. If anyone at Braun is reading this: please switch to a power supply similar to laptops, which does not cover more than one outlet and the transformer can sit on the floor. That would be a great product feature. Just remember: wall warts are the devil!&lt;br /&gt; - Even as well as this unit reduces pain, if you don&#x27;t keep up with an area and let it regrow, it will be more painful than if you keep up with it. This con is not specific to the Braun 7281 but to epilation in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price: I listed this as people would most likely complain about the \\&quot;high\\&quot; price of the Braun. However if you consider that before you buy one like this you have already bought at least one or two other epilators, or have been waxing up to now, please consider the total cost. This unit is cheaper than all the wax I have bought added up, and is cheaper than the previous epilators I have tried. Given all of that and just how well this unit works I would say that it is definitely worth the selling price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I now regret going with the 7281. A little over a year after purchase battery life significantly decreased, and now a few months later I&#x27;m lucky to get a couple of minutes on a charge. I opened it and found it uses a Li-Ion cell, so I searched for it online  (Sanyo UR18500L) and I cannot find ANY reliable sources for the battery - and I am NOT going to pay Braun&#x27;s inflated price for spending less than five minutes to replace what should be a $12.00-$15.00 battery pack.  What a fraking waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I emailed them and included my update above.  Oh - and finding a link or form to email them was not very easy or obvious on their site. You need to drill down through support FAQs then say no it didn&#x27;t help then you finally get a form which gives you neither feedback nor emails you a copy of your inquiry so obviously it goes into a black hole where it will be ignored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Hint: replacing the battery pack takes less than five minutes; remove two torx screws, pull unit apart. Replace battery pack. Grease seals with either dielectric grease or vaseline. Reassemble in reverse order.  The only problem? The battery cell is a nonstandard voltage, and I cannot find the exact battery nor a compatible size/voltage match ANYWHERE.)ed.

            <li> I was very excited about this purchase!  I am tired of spending money on waxing and wanted to see how this would work.  I have to admit that it was more painful than I anticipated, but it does lessen with each use.  I primarily use it on my underarms with good results, but I have found it more difficult to use on my legs.  When I use it on my legs, the hair seems to come back relatively quickly.  I&#x27;m going to give this purchase a little more time before I give up on it.  I do like that this product can be used wet or dry; I have tried both.  If you do plan to use it in the shower, just be prepared to do a little extra maintenance (the directions recommend that you apply oil after exposure to water.  I also enjoy the razor/trimmer attachment for those more delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fool yourself into thinking that it won&#x27;t sting. It will. At least the first few times. I like this product so far, although I haven&#x27;t had perfectly smooth legs to date. The trimmer/shaver cap helps a lot. That was one of the reasons I picked this particular epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on 6/6/12: Really doesn&#x27;t hurt much anymore... Rather than that making me happy, it actually makes me nervous that it isn&#x27;t getting all of the hairs. I often have to go over an area several times to get any hairs that the epilator misses. Still works pretty well and I will continue to use it (although if I&#x27;m in a rush I whip out the old razor). I don&#x27;t think the trimmer part of the shave cap is working anymore for some reason.</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great product. If you have never used an epilator before it does take some getting use to. I have had the product for about a month now and each time I use it the pain is less. The best part about this product is it can be used in the bath or shower. Some epilator&#x27;s say wet &amp; dry on them but they just mean you can use some kind of body gel wtih them. Using this in the shower really does help alot. Also having a shaving attachment helps when you are in a hurry and don&#x27;t have time to really epilate (or in my case do the area&#x27;s your too scared to try just yet like your armpits). I would have given the product a 5 star if the Olay wipes that came with it had some type of numbing effect.</li>
            <li> So, I HATED shaving my legs and did not have the  bank account/ patience that professional waxing requires. It was this burning hatred of hair and relative certainty that laser hair removal is nowhere in my immediate future that motivated me to look into epilation. Also I am kind of addicted to self-tanning and shaving and waxing totally ruins a great faux tan.     I bought this epilator.     After using it on my arms and thighs for about a week with minimal discomfort, I downed a couple shots of vodka and began to epilate my calves.OUCH.Even after hanging out in a steamy shower for a half hour AND using it IN the shower, this was SUPER painful. But I kept going...    The couple days of doing my calves was intense (cursing, screaming, alarming my husband with my obsessive mission to rip the hair out of my legs), and there&#x27;s no way I could get everything in one sitting since I have zero tolerance for pain. Anyhow I am so glad that I didn&#x27;t stop!!!!    10 months later, I epilate once per week for about 15 minutes while watching tv (I no longer need to use the \\&quot;wet\\&quot; mode unless I wait 2 weeks between uses, more hair&#x3D;more pain). It would have been nice if someone had given me one of these when I was like 15...thinking about all the money&amp;time I have wasted on shaving is depressing.    Pros:    *Price- this is a great deal for all the money and time you will save  *Wet/Dry function- if you don&#x27;t handle pain well, this is the ONLY thing that will get you through the early days  *Rechargable- No cords, no batteries.   *Multifunction- you can use it as a shaver or trimmer if you&#x27;re so inclined  *Regrowth is not scary- your hair will be finer and tapered at the end, not angry and spikey like shaved hair    Cons:    *If you are new to epilation, it&#x27;s going to hurt (but only the first couple of times)  *Grip-In the shower I&#x27;ve dropped it before because the grip isn&#x27;t rubberized  *It&#x27;s difficult to be 100% smooth(but you won&#x27;t care because the remaining hairs are so fine)    I&#x27;ve read people complain about the battery...I plug mine in for an hour every couple of uses and it&#x27;s fine. Also ingrown hairs seems to be a recurring theme...this hasn&#x27;t been an issue for me, and if you exfoliate regularly you should be fine.    Of course I totally recommend this epilator to all my friends and family. I think it&#x27;s great for beginners or even for the more experienced epilator-user who doesn&#x27;t wish to be stuck next to an outlet.</li>
            <li> This vendor increase the price after you ordered it and cancels your current order.And sell the same item at higher price. Unhappy with the order.</li>
            <li> good machine to have in the bath for her. it takes less time to be ready shaved.&lt;br /&gt;and it can be used for cut hair also</li>
            <li> This worked really great until one of the heads died, still lasted two years, unfortunately replacement heads are hard to find now</li>
            <li> First of all it is very VERY painful and it does a terrible job removing the hair! Not enough gain for the pain, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This is a UK epilator and had to get a UK-USA Adaptor ... did NOT like it at all. Wish I had paid more attention while ordering</li>
            <li> have been using it since last 3 years...still very happy with it. I have always used epilators but this is the best quality i have ever used.</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for years, so for &#x27;newbies&#x27; just a few comments-&lt;br /&gt;YES- the pain gets better.  Stick with it.  I use it for everything- upper lip, underarms, legs, bikini- and I don&#x27;t need any special soothing creams or gentle &#x27;caps&#x27; or anything.  I barely even feel it.  You can get there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It definitely beats shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I would say that the \\&quot;hair free for 4-6 weeks\\&quot; claim is bunk.  If I go more than 2 weeks or so, it&#x27;s noticeable.  Now, the hair is softer and lighter so even if it&#x27;s there it&#x27;s not awful- but if you are expecting to be totally silky smooth for a month- no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on that note- I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;m EVER 100% silky smooth.  there are always a few little fine hairs it can&#x27;t get, or a few that break.  It&#x27;s not like that JUST shaven feeling.  (but, that just shaven feeling only lasts what, an hour?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the reason I&#x27;m writing this review-&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had several epilators, and have tried pretty much every model of the silk-epil.  I was so excited about two things on this one: the rechargeable battery, and the wet/dry ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First re: the wet/dry- I tried it in the shower- It didn&#x27;t work NEARLY as well.  missed tons of hairs.  I think the fact that you can get it wet is meant more so you can clean it- not use it in the tub.  But, maybe that&#x27;s just me, maybe I should try it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the battery- I honestly wish I had saved money and gotten the corded one.  The charge doesn&#x27;t last long enough, and it gets wimpy at the end.  Even if I plug it in, it&#x27;s wimpy until the battery gets some charge back.  And worst of all- if I use it too much, I think maybe it overheats- it gets really hot and seems to strain the battery, and it will just totally die.  I have to leave it alone for 5-10 min, and then I can go again just for maybe 3 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really think this has to do with the battery and charging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my recommendation would be to save money and get the corded version.  After all- where are you going to be using it that it&#x27;s so hard to be near an outlet?</li>
            <li> I have had this product for about 2 1/2 months and it just stopped working. Its never been dropped or anything. I know sometimes there are defective products but for such an expensive epilator i am really bummed out.</li>
            <li> Estoy muy contenta con mi epilator braun, es excelente, puedes rebajar el vello ante   de eliminarlo de raiz para que duela menos.    Es de facil uso, rapido y sin dolor. Se las recomiendo 100%</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator for my wife.  She has already used it, and is extremely pleased with the results.  An absolute five-star item/purchase.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to me when I mentioned that I loved the effect of an epilator but was too chicken to use my old Emjoi very often because WOW that thing was painful!  It also tended to pinch my skin, which is really unpleasant on the underarms and the backs of the knees...I finally bought it figuring that I could use it as an electric razor if she was wrong but she was SO RIGHT!  This is surprisingly gentle when you use it as an epilator and the shaver/trimmer is excellent as well.  I even use the trimmer setting to do the backs of my boys&#x27; necks and their \\&quot;sideburns\\&quot; when I give them haircuts!  The battery holds a nice long charge and this has held up well over time (I&#x27;ve had it for nearly a year) with regular wet and dry use.  No complaints here, this is an excellent product and I&#x27;ve recommended it to friends many times!</li>
            <li> befor buying braun xpressive body system for my friend on i look around on internet and then in other major stores like bed bath and beyond etc. Braun impress me as i am not new to braun products,  finally i check the product [...] and after satisfying myself i orderd it.  its so much change then one i saw in stores and to be honest i did not even saw the same model in stores.  its so easy to use and work efficiently. rechargeble battery work pretty good and the light is more clear then the one i saw in store.  i will definitely recoment it to anyone who is interested in such kind of product.</li>
            <li> I have bought this Braun to ma wife and no any issue w/ it up to right now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and I have been shaving since I was about 14. I do not want to know how much I have spent on razors. I ordered this epilator yesterday and got it today, so naturally I had to use it. WOW! So much better than shaving. It did take a while to do my legs, but it was so worth it. I didn&#x27;t have to worry about cutting my knees or ankles. For me it didn&#x27;t hurt too bad. My underarms were a little sensitive at first but I got use to it. My legs, however, didn&#x27;t hurt that much. There was a little bit of pain on my knee from where I injured it a few months ago walking a dog. Don&#x27;t ask. Overall, I am definitely pleased. I no longer have to worry about cutting myself, buying expensive blades, razor burn, or shaving cream. What a relief!</li>
            <li> I do have a sensitive skin and am sensitive to pain, so it was bearable to use on the legs, but not the bikini area.  I can see how it would work for some people, but it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I am back to the old-fashioned razor :)</li>
            <li> I first purchased this in august. I had to exchange for a new unit becuase the battery would not charge. The second unit charged up- BUT i have owned it for almost 4 months, and the battery is NOT charging- AGAIN.  As far as epilating, it&#x27;s great as long as there is full power in the battery. I have noticed that when the battery power is less, it really just cuts the hairs, and does not pull them out.  Here&#x27;s my advice- while it is a great idea (and convenient!)to have a cordless epilator to be able to use in the shower...this model in particular seems to have some bugs that need to be worked out. I would not recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> Just used my beautiful Braun Xpressive Body System on my arms and legs tonight in the shower. It did hurt only a tiny bit on both areas. No irritation at all so far,knock on wood. The only thing I noticed after the shower was that I didn&#x27;t remove all the hairs from my legs. So I went over again after shower. Worked great!!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. However, I did purchase the &#x27;after epilation&#x27; lotion, which I used afterwards, and it smells great and makes your legs feel so soft and silky.Plus I bought the &#x27;exfoliatiom sponge&#x27; for use to help get rid of the dead cells so you don&#x27;t get ingrown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I am a female, age 57.</li>
            <li> I will first say that before you use this- do your research!! I read about every tip I could possibly find before using this bad boy. I exfoliated the areas of hair removal with anti-bacterial soap for one week every day before using this. When my package arrived, I took a pain killer 30 minutes ahead of time and downed a glass of wine. I jumped in the shower, cleaned myself throughly with anti-bacterial soap and then a moisturizing soap, and waited about 5 minutes- letting my skin and the air steam up with the hot water. I decided to do the worst first- my va-ga. My mind set was that if I could get through that, I could do anything. Let me tell it, there are little words to describe this devil&#x27;s instrument when every hair is ripped out of your most sensitive area. I only did half before wimping out, I will do the other half towmorrow. Next up was the legs. Considering the pain I went through with my asymmetrical brazillian, the legs were EASY!! In fact, it barley hurts. Not painless, but nothing even a pain-intolerant person couldn&#x27;t get through. After I expiated, I cleaned the areas again with an anti-bacterial soap and then used a soft scrub. My legs are silky smooth and I didn&#x27;t even have the famous red dots. I feel if I didn&#x27;t go through all the trouble with exfoliating and cleaning, I would get ingrowns. Just don&#x27;t get slack about it and I think this product will work wonders for you!! This beats shaving any day!!!</li>
            <li> I am in love with my new best friend. His name is Brauney and I see a very long partnership ahead of us. I have shaved, waxed, lasered, and more. Waxing is more painful than this thing, it is easy to use and has about 20 percent of the pain of waxing. I just got it and did both legs and bikini area in about 20 minutes. Waxing was such a hassle and got expensive. The laser didn&#x27;t work for me and hurt far worse than Brauney. It was really easy peasy compared to anything else.    I love that this can travel with me and I don&#x27;t have to have hairy legs for a week or two before I can remove it again. So far I am really excited.       My only concern is ingrown hairs, but I intend to exfoliate. I will update if a problem arises.</li>
            <li> This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in months...I LOVE this epilator, it&#x27;s super fast, smooth and doesn&#x27;t hurt as older models, I&#x27;m impressed! Good job Braum.</li>
            <li> I have been using an epilator for years, the last Braun was working for 10 years, but it was time for something new. I decided to buy 7281 Wet&amp;Dry Body System - cordless for convenience, but it was very bad decision.   I have it for a little over a year I was happy at the beginning, but right now it&#x27;s useless    The battery when charged suppose to last 40 min,(it did work well for a year),   now after charging for an hour it doesn&#x27;t work even 5 min and the worst thing is that you cannot use it when it&#x27;s plagued in, it simply doesn&#x27;t work,   I was shocked when I discover that. Not worth the money</li>
            <li> This is my second epilator and I am very pleased with this purchase. My first one was a lower-end model that I picked up just to see if I could tolerate epilation. The old one did the job but it was time consuming and lacked some features that I thought would be nice. So, I took the plunge and bought this Braun after doing quite a bit of research. If you have never epilated before then let me just say it does hurt the first time or two but your body quickly gets used to the sensation and it&#x27;s not bad at all after a few tries. Now, about the product. This epilator did both my legs in under 10 minutes, which is a huge difference from my old one which would take at least twice as long and I would still find missed hairs afterward. This epilator was able to grab short hairs and the light on the thing really helps, I didn&#x27;t miss any hairs and got the job done with way fewer passes than with my old one. I like that it comes with a shaver/trimmer head. The battery seems to be very powerful. And I love that it is cordless and can be used in the shower, which I haven&#x27;t done yet but will. Nice epilator, worth the money.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I use it specifically for my headaches.  I just roll it on my head, on high power whenever i have a headache. The intense pulling power just overides the uncomfortable headaches. With this product, I no longer need to wake my husband in the middle of the night so he can yank the hair for me. Say goodnight to tylenol and advil, this Braun wet/dry will do just all of that naturally.  Sometimes i use it to epilate the hair on my legs as well. I got it at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond with 20% coupon off for any single item purchase.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic epilator. I am hooked ever since buying it. It is painless, fast and best part is that you can use it anywhere, in the shower for bikini waxing, anywhere else in your privacy it does not require you to be near an outlet. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that when it is plugged in and charging you need to wait until it finishes before continuing use. So anywhere over 1.5 hours of operation it has to be recharged and if you haven&#x27;t finished your job, you just have to wait until it recharges to continue. But outside of this little detail, everything about this product is excellent. I tried other epilators with 70 tweezers that did not do as good of a job as this one with about 40 tweezers. I highly recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> Firstly I think the \\&quot;smoothe for 4 weeks\\&quot; claim is a load of rubbish. Braun also claim that the epilator can pull out hairs as small as a grain of sand. I don&#x27;t think this is true, I have to let the hair on my legs get a few mm long in order to epilate. There are always hairs that it just doesn&#x27;t seem to get and I never feel silky smoothe after using it. It seems to me that a lot of the hair gets broken off at the skin instead of the roots being pulled out which means I have to epilate again a few days later after these hairs have grown so I can pull them out too. A week or so later I start to notice the hairs growing back. In reality I think that I have to epilate every two weeks rather than every month like it claims.    I think the massage cap is really good, I can definately tell the difference between it and the efficiency cap, the pain is much reduced. The smart light is also really really good although that may be one of the reasons that I am not completely satisfied with the product... because I can see the hairs that aren&#x27;t pulled out.    I don&#x27;t really see the advantage to being able to use the epilator in the shower. I think it works better dry and the pain isn&#x27;t sufficiently reduced under hot water.     The battery life is good, it last for about 45 minutes and it doesn&#x27;t take very long to charge.    I think it is probably better than other epilators that I have used but I am just a little disappointed because all the hype surrounding the product made it sound better than it is. It definately beats shaving.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at BB&amp;B last weekend utilizing a 20% coupon.  I had been doing my research and was ready to purchase another system that is more similar to a portable electrolysis machine that is available on the market and on HSN, but read some really bad reviews so I decided to purchase an epilator instead.  I am very happy with this purchase, I had used an epilator about 25 years ago and it was pure torture.  I found that this model is very comfortable and using it on my legs and underarms was not painful in any way whatsoever.  I had read on some other websites and product reviews that soaking in a tub of hot water before epilating helps with the pain since it opens the pores and allows the hair follicle to slip out easier.  I first tried it around my ankles to ensure that the machine held a charge, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything since it didn&#x27;t hurt even using it dry.  I called my husband into the bathroom and told him to let me try it on his leg or arm, he refused saying that he didn&#x27;t want any bald spots.  He agreed to let me try it on his stomach and needless to say it definitely worked!  He jumped and yelled and sure enough there was a little bald spot where I had applied the epilator to his stomach.  Great it is working, I know that I have a higher tolerance for pain...afterall I have been through child birth and he whimpers and whines at stumping his toe.  I have also waxed for years so I think this has a lot to do with the amount of pain I can endure for the thought of being smooth for up to 4 weeks at a time.  I went ahead and filled the tub with warm to hot water and soaked for about 15 miutes, then worked the epilator over both legs and my bikini area.  I will say that the bikini area was painful but my legs and underarms didn&#x27;t feel a thing.  I will either take another reviewer&#x27;s advice prior to attempting my bikini area again and that is a couple of shots of hard liquor (I am thinking tequila)or I will just continue to go to my local European Wax Center and get that area tended and maintained.  Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend.European Wax Center and get that area tended and maintained.  Overall I am very pleased with my purchase and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Well, I must say, WHAT an experience!  This was my first experience with an epilator and I really got what I expected.  I have pretty thick dark brown hair that grows in coarse after shaving.  And honestly I was tired of the prickly feeling on my legs and underarms.  I have never waxed either (yikes!) so pulling hair out at the root was interesting, to say the least!  Yes, it is painful at first.  It was especially painful on the underarms (although, that might just be me)!  I did one dry with no shower but I couldn&#x27;t take it (most likely because I have never waxed this area, so this was the first time the hair was coming out at the root).  Doing the other one in the shower helped SO much!  I would recommend epilating in/after a shower for the first time if it hurts too much.  The pain is tolerable, but it definitely hurts the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the results, my hair normally grows back within the same day or definitely the next day and I end up feeling stubbles very quickly.  After epilating, I went days without feeling hair.  The hair that did grow was hair that was broken (instead of plucked) but it wasn&#x27;t much at all.  And the hair was MUCH thinner than normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this purchase!  The battery lasted long enough to do both legs one after the other, I LOVE the wet/dry capability, cordless is great, and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> After thorough research, I picked this epilator as my first. After years of waxing and being waxed at salons, I figured this would save me time and money. But, I was afraid of how painful it would be to use.    Surprisingly, it wasn&#x27;t as painful as I thought it would be. I got used to the \\&quot;feeling\\&quot;. The results last a lot longer than shaving. It does have a tendency to not be able to pull out all the hairs and a few do seem to end up being cut (but only a few). Using it regularly will eventually get all the hairs and you&#x27;ll have smooth legs. The shaver/trimmer option works great too.    It&#x27;s just a bit difficult to navigate on and around the underarm, knee caps and bikini lines and I think I may have to get the optional accessories. It would have been better to include this in the kit and to have the option to use it corded.    I have yet to see how long before I have to order the replacement parts which are a bit pricey.    Overall, a great product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to effectively :)</li>
            <li> I have been using epilators exclusively for 15 years now. I have barely any hair left on my legs, and the few that still grow are light and soft. I also use epilators on my armpits and bikini line. This product was wonderful at first. However, after six months the battery stopped working. It takes hours to charge the battery and it works for about 10 minutes before it stop working completely. I am very disappointed with this product and with Braun customer service. I thought I could just return the product and get my money back but now I have to mail it to a repair center at my expense and wait. I have no idea how long the repair will take or even if I will be dealing with the same problem later. And what am I supposed to do in the interim? I haven&#x27;t used razor for 15 years and don&#x27;t plan on starting now. What a disappointing product!</li>
            <li> This product seams to work good on me. A bit noisy for a epilator, reminds me of my lawn mover.....:)Everything else is just great about this product...!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as b&#x27;day gift for my girl friend. She liked it very much. This doesn&#x27;t pain much, she is using epilators for the first time. This one does a great job, removes all the hair and no need to worry about re growth for a couple of weeks.   I would highly recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I have this Braun Epilator now for several month and I am very pleased. Easy to use, no problems at all. I have to say I never use them under the shower, no need for me to do this. Love it, fast shipping. By the way my daughter got one too and she is pleased too.</li>
            <li> Since I have a very sensitive skin and low pain threshold I really couldn&#x27;t use older models of any epilators and this is the first one that really works with me. First of all, red dots: yes, they appear all over the place where I was using it but do not last for longer than ~10 h (so I epilate legs in the evenings, before going to sleep, follow with J&amp;J baby olive and in the morning dots are gone). Pain: for the first two times it was pretty painful, however, not as bad as I remember from my very first experience with epilators. I have already used it for about 5 times and I don&#x27;t have any problems with pain that I can&#x27;t stand (my tip: if you&#x27;re REALLY afraid of pain have a glass of whisky or brandy 15 min prior to epilation- it helps!). What I noticed it&#x27;s much better to use larger speed even in case of beginners- it hurts less. Ingrown hair: this is something no epilator can help, just remember to exfoliate regularly, on daily basis- forget about any body scrubs, they don&#x27;t work well in this situation, are far too gentle. I use [[ASIN:B000KKUW6M Loofah Back Massager Brush with Ergonomic Grip Handle]]- works perfect not only to prevent ingrown hair but also leaves your skin very smooth without irritation.</li>
            <li> I have had many epilators in the past. This one is wireless, quick, easy to clean and its charge lasts for three to four sessions.</li>
            <li> Hurts a little, but easy and quick way to get rid of the unwanted hair. Plus the massager is awesome!</li>
            <li> This product is good because it can be used in the water/shower. But I noticed fast hair grow, in 1 week for me, after using this device, if compare to Phillips device, my previous(old) one. When I used my old Phillips device, hair do not grow for about 2 weeks and when it start grow there are not many.</li>
            <li> I got this epilator about a year and a half ago and I&#x27;ve used it in average once a week on my legs, bikini area and armpits.  I like that it is wireless, so it gives you freedom to use it in different rooms and the cord does not get on the way. I also like that is a good size and easy to hold. I like that it has a light, although I normally use it on well lit areas, so it does not makes a big difference to me. The moving part is easy to clean (with the brush, included) and it can be washed with soap and water (I air dry it after that).  The epilator can only be used wireless, so if the battery is low and you haven&#x27;t finished the job, you have to wait until it is fully charged again before being able to turn it on.  Mine takes about 30 minutes to fully charge and gives me about 45 mins of wireless use. However, a couple of weeks ago I noticed that even when it was fully charged, the red light (signaling low battery) started flashing after about 15 mins of use. I guess the battery wears out eventually, and as it cannot be used while it is plugged in, it will rend the whole epilator useless.</li>
            <li> I bought this after checking my own friends skin after epilation. I was surprised that it could be so smooth. Even today - her hands come out smooth after epilation whereas for me - I can feel the broken hairs. So my hands never feel as smooth even after epilation. I have used it more than a few times now  with longer growth , shorter growth and it hasn&#x27;t worked. May be my hairs are too fine and break. My legs come out smooth - but they get itchy once they start growing back - as if the skin is irritated by the sharp edges of the hairs. So I use it only on my hands now and that too if there is no time for waxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the pain is concerned- waxing is less painful. It feels like you are slowly pulling the hairs one by one, whereas with waxing - it&#x27;s done in one swipe. The first time was painful, next time i tried using it under water in a bath tub. It helped a bit. But i believe that using it under water or on wet skin gave me more broken hairs. Recommend using it as dry epilator. Haven&#x27;t dared using it for underarms / bikini area. Prefer waxing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery would last only enough to do my hands or 1/2 of my legs. It&#x27;s been more than a year or so now - and it has started making a lot of noise as if the blades are touching the covering on top. It may be a good device, but not for me.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this product -- the battery does not last and is not replaceable except by the service center. If you do a search about this product, you will see that a very significant number of people have problems with it not keeping a charge even after charging it all day. Also note that the cord only charges the battery, it is not usable for &amp;#34;plug-in power.&amp;#34; Your battery will last almost until your warranty is up, (mine began to fail after about 2 months and it really hurts when it&#x27;s not full power!!). By the time you figure out the problem, you are out of warranty. You will have to send the unit in and spend another 50 bucks or more to have it &amp;#34;fixed.&amp;#34; Do yourself a favor, and avoid this product. I expected a lot from this brand.</li>
            <li> I bought this product a while ago and it is very dangerous!! It pinched my skin causing red/purple bruises and made me bleed. And, after all that, it didn&#x27;t even work!</li>
            <li> Ooo I am in love with this product! I bought it like 3years back and OMG I love it even now! Serves all the said purposes! It actually does what it claims!! I am very happy to have invested in this product!</li>
            <li> This product is amazing! No more cutting yourself with a razor.</li>
            <li> I purchased this epilator at Bed Bath and Beyond with a gift card.  Otherwise, I would have purchased it from Amazon because I love Amazon.com :)  Anyways, I love this epilator. I have tried quite a few of them and this works so well I can&#x27;t even describe it.  I have used it in the shower so far and love the results.  I love that it charges is an hour and lasts for 40 minutes as well.  I definately recommend buying this product if you are looking for a good epilator.   Regarding the pain, it does get better over time.  Also, if you want to purchase additional attachments go to:  theessentials.com and look under Braun, lady shaving and epilation, epilator parts.  The prices aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
            <li> This epilator is perfect to use wet or dry!! I love the fact that I can use it in my bath without any worries at all. The small light is def. a plus to see if you&#x27;ve missed some hair. And (ok an epilator is always a bit painful) this wasn&#x27;t as bad as some others, I was pretty amazed.</li>
            <li> Use this all the time.  I also got NoNo which says it is painless. NoNo is actually USELESS -- while this is GRRREAT!!!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this three years ago, and it still works beautifully.</li>
            <li> I  have a problem with this product is that its parts are not strong enough and I do not know how I can get the alternative to the parts which don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a Panasonic ES2045 Wet/Dry Epilator which works great from a friend that I know well and throughly cleaned and sanitized the unit before use. I was weary to spend alot of money on a New Braun epilator without knowing how well the product would work for me. The panasonic works well, but upon through studying and watching many YouTube videos I noticed that the Braun epilators seemed to spin quite faster than the Panasonic, which I was having trouble with the speed in which it spun I felt like it was too slow to be thoroughly efficient. I finally made the leap and purchased this Braun epilator and are so glad that I did! I am not gonna lie to you and say that epilating is perfectly enjoyable cause it can be uncomfortable in certain areas like the backs of the thighs and knees where those fine horrible hairs are located. I will say that a few moments of pain is certainly worth the time in between shavings as well....I only epilate once a week to start and the Braun significantly gets more hairs the Panasonic. I shave the rest the more I epilate the less hairs there will be overall........I as scared as I was for the pain was very surprised and happy of the benefit of how well this product works. I have used it dry sitting on the couch in shorts and inside the shower as well with shaving cream or just lather from bar soap as well. I use it on my armpits and my chin and lip as well......the lip takes awhile cause it makes my eyes water due to those fine hairs at the bottom of my nostrils it HURTS.....but I just go as slow as I need to.......I like that the hairs have greatly diminished and haven&#x27;t grown back as dark and plentiful as they had in the past....I will continue to use this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the rambling review, but if you have any questions feel free to ask&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifier</li>
