            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>Lovely color.  </li>
            <li>but if you mix it with gloss, it works better</li>
            <li>and I think would be flattering for most all skin tones (I&#x27;m a medium beige tone).</li>
            <li>I always top it with a lip gloss and it&#x27;s perfections.</li>
            <li>- there are a ton of colors so if this one doesn&#x27;t suit you, you can try another shade!:)</li>
            <li>just okay.</li>
            <li>This color is very light, even on me and my skin is pretty fair.</li>
            <li>Smells good and packaging is pretty.</li>
            <li>I like the Milani products and my favorite is no longer available.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply, lasts about as well as any others.</li>
            <li>Love this lipstick beautiful color it doest smell bad its great quality for the price love the gold tube</li>
            <li>Nothing special, save your money and go with Make Up Forever nude lipsticks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a gorgeous color.</li>
            <li>Super formula and color</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit too light for my lips since they naturally have more color.</li>
            <li>Sent quickly.</li>
            <li>It will look very pretty.</li>
            <li>The color Nude Creme is very pretty</li>
            <li>This is the perfect natural pink nude (doesn&#x27;t wash you out!)  </li>
            <li>It has a nice scent, but may be too much for very sensitive people.</li>
            <li>love this lipstick i bought it to go with nix lip liner, 810 natural</li>
            <li>It goes on fairly smooth with a semi matte finish, which was unexpected.</li>
            <li>(you never know what something really looks like when you buy it online based off of YouTube videos), and</li>
            <li>Pretty soft color, as advertised</li>
            <li>The color looks decent on my skintone.</li>
            <li>Wish it was more long lasting</li>
            <li>It is indeed light if your lips are dark.</li>
            <li>I am very fair-skinned/pale, with naturally very pigmented pink lips.</li>
            <li>WOW.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nude that wouldn&#x27;t wash me out and also complimented my natural lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find Milani products where I am, so was excited to see this on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it comes in my lips are usualy chapped and with this lipstick my lips feel moisturized not dry</li>
            <li>you;&#x27;re looking for, overall Ok but not great.</li>

            <li> On time! Beautiful color</li>
            <li> I like the Milani products and my favorite is no longer available.  This color is very light, even on me and my skin is pretty fair.</li>
            <li> Love the color. Somewhat drying though.</li>
            <li> Liked the color and wear of this the one time that I wore it. Have not worn it since because it has an unpleasant smell and taste.</li>
            <li> Lovely color.  Its the perfect peach nude. Harder to see on pigmented lips though. I just have to apply 3 layers.</li>
            <li> The color looks decent on my skintone. Wish it was more long lasting but if you mix it with gloss, it works better I think.</li>
            <li> Beautiful shade, color pay off is nice! Pair it with a eyeliner or a smoky . It will look very pretty. Smells good and packaging is pretty.</li>
            <li> All Milani lipsticks are amazing! Quality as good as Mac and they smell like Mac as well! This color looks great on everyone!</li>
            <li> Nothing special, save your money and go with Make Up Forever nude lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I took a chance with this (you never know what something really looks like when you buy it online based off of YouTube videos), and WOW. It&#x27;s such a gorgeous color. I am very fair-skinned/pale, with naturally very pigmented pink lips. I wanted a nude that wouldn&#x27;t wash me out and also complimented my natural lips.

            <li> Super formula and color</li>

            <li> Believe the hype!  This is the perfect natural pink nude (doesn&#x27;t wash you out!)  It&#x27;s creamy and opaque and just a perfect shade to pick when you don&#x27;t know what color to wear!  The formula is somewhat moisturizing - and I don&#x27;t have to apply a lip balm underneath.  Out performs the department store brands (trust me, I worked at one of the Big 3) that sell for close to $30 a tube.  Yes, you can save your cash and still look like a million bucks!  Try this line - there are a ton of colors so if this one doesn&#x27;t suit you, you can try another shade!:)</li>
            <li> Meh....just okay. Has an odd smell/taste. I don&#x27;t hate the color, but I don&#x27;t love it either. It&#x27;s a bit too light for my lips since they naturally have more color.</li>
            <li> Lipstick has an unpleasant odor, but the color is nice. Sent quickly.</li>
            <li> Pretty soft color, as advertised</li>
