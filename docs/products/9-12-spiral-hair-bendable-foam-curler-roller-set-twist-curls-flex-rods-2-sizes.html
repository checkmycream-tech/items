            <li>It&#x27;s quality is good.  </li>
            <li>It is great for creating a bouncy head full of curls.</li>
            <li>Worked well and easy to use for the money!</li>
            <li>BUT STRONG SMELL OF RUBBER!</li>
            <li>These were so easy to use and resulted in some amazing curls.</li>
            <li>and I thought I&#x27;d be able to use these to curl that part.</li>
            <li>; accessories? :)</li>
            <li>These rollers work perfectly to curl the hair without the heat as I expected.</li>
            <li>Easy to use to create bouncy curls and waves without heat.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>THESE HAVE A STRONG CHEMCAL SMELL THAT MADE MY STOMACH HURT.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and the extension hair is thicker -</li>
            <li>They look a bit cheap.</li>
            <li>The price is right and you get plenty, so go ahead,  have a slumber party and curl everyone&#x27;s hair at once.</li>
            <li>I have pretty curly hair all over except underneath</li>
            <li>but for now they&#x27;re pretty much being used as cat toys.</li>
            <li>ON BACK OF PACKAGING IN FINE PRINT.</li>
            <li>THIS CHEAP IS LIKELY</li>
            <li>And the longer you leave them in, the tighter the curl, so you could go for a curl, a gentle wave, or a head like Shirly Temple.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>They also feel bulky and hurt, despite being made out of soft foam.</li>
            <li>Eh I guess my hair is too short to really see the effect of these.</li>
            <li>They were not only simple but fun to use with my daughter.</li>
            <li>so you can do bigger or smaller curls depending on what you like or want and they seem very durable as well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend them to anyone who wanted a simple &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; natural curls.</li>
            <li>Strong and irritating plastic odor.</li>
            <li>It was very cheap but works like the expensive ones you can find in stores.</li>

            <li> Worked well and easy to use for the money!</li>
            <li> These are a little awkward to put into your hair. They also feel bulky and hurt, despite being made out of soft foam. I can roll them up to the base of my neck but any more and it hurts.</li>
            <li> Strong and irritating plastic odor. Im still coughing. Be prepared to air them out and possibly wash them before using.</li>
            <li> Great price. They were bigger ths</li>
            <li> They reek and there is a warning on the package that says they contain an ingredient known to cause cancer in California. It made us afraid to use them.</li>
            <li> THESE HAVE A STRONG CHEMCAL SMELL THAT MADE MY STOMACH HURT. HALF WAY THROUGH EXAMING THEM I NOTICED A WARNING ON BACK OF PACKAGING IN FINE PRINT. IT&#x27;S A SHAME THAT THIS ISN&#x27;T LISTED ON WEBSTE. I&#x27;D HATE TO THINK A PREGNANT WOMEN OR SOMEONE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH HEALTH PROBLEMS WAS USING THESE WITHOUT KNOWING. AWFUL. SOMETHING THIS CHEAP IS LIKELY FOUND AT A 99 CENT STORE AS WELL YET ON HERE COST 12 DOLLARS. NOT ONLY ARE THEY PROFTTING, BUT ALSO POISIONING PEOPLE.&lt;br /&gt;ON BACK SAYS:&lt;br /&gt;PROP 65 WARNING&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO CAUSE CANCER, BIRTH DEFECTS OR OTHER REPRODUCTIVE HARM.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> They look a bit cheap. but get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;upside it that theirs a lot in the pack as apose to 12 or 18 for more expensive</li>
            <li> It was very cheap but works like the expensive ones you can find in stores. It is great for creating a bouncy head full of curls. They&#x27;re not torture to sleep on. And the longer you leave them in, the tighter the curl, so you could go for a curl, a gentle wave, or a head like Shirly Temple.</li>
            <li> These rods are perfect for my use. I have used them on my hair, as well as extensions. My hair is fine and the extension hair is thicker - but the curls hold up well on both!</li>
            <li> It does work and it&#x27;s not too hard to put in my hair. But I have a hard time sleeping with them in. It&#x27;s very uncomfortable. But...it does work.</li>
            <li> Eh I guess my hair is too short to really see the effect of these. I have pretty curly hair all over except underneath and I thought I&#x27;d be able to use these to curl that part. I&#x27;ll try again when my hair grows out a bit but for now they&#x27;re pretty much being used as cat toys.</li>
            <li> great idea, but not for thick curly hair :(</li>
            <li> WORK WELL...BUT STRONG SMELL OF RUBBER!</li>
            <li> They flexible and bendable.  It&#x27;s quality is good.  Easy to use to create bouncy curls and waves without heat.  If using on wet hair, It will take long time for hair to dry.  I used it on damp hair for 8 hours.  My hair was still damp when I took them off.</li>
            <li> These may not be the highest quality spiral bendable rollers, but they do work great and I see no difference in their use and their results.  The price is right and you get plenty, so go ahead,  have a slumber party and curl everyone&#x27;s hair at once.</li>
            <li> These rollers work perfectly to curl the hair without the heat as I expected. I totally recommend this product. Thanks</li>
            <li> Very good quality. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was  that the ends scrape your fingers if the foam becomes detached</li>
            <li> These were so easy to use and resulted in some amazing curls. I would recommend them to anyone who wanted a simple &amp;#34;DIY&amp;#34; natural curls. They were not only simple but fun to use with my daughter. Can you say awesome &amp;#34;make over&amp;#34; accessories? :)</li>
            <li> They did not hold their shape well at all.  They just did not work for me at all.  I tried using them several times and I&#x27;ve gone online and looked at how to use these and it just is not a good product.  No instructions at all on how to use them.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to. There are two different different sizes so you can do bigger or smaller curls depending on what you like or want and they seem very durable as well.</li>
            <li> I like this product. Easy to use but I think the rollers are too big though (for my head). They do work  and I could sleep in them.</li>
            <li> Work great in daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
