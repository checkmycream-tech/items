            <li>Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li>These artifical nail trimmers do their job and are pretty cute too.</li>
            <li>Super cheap but not in quality.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut through gel, doesn&#x27;t cut clean.</li>
            <li>They work beautifully and you&#x27;re able to remove the blade if it ever gets dull.</li>
            <li>it is very sturdy and stylish.</li>
            <li>this was very helpful for me and will be looking for more buys as the days go by thank  for all the items.</li>

            <li>This false nail tip clipper is awesome!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut the false nail tips as good as before but can&#x27;t complain too much, because I got it at a good price.</li>

            <li>I am pleased with my purchase especially for the price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li>Such a super cheap price, you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li>Product was a little cheap (acrylic cutters) but for the price it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li>Works just as good as the same clippers sold for $15.99 at the big stores!</li>
            <li>Glad I finally bought a set, they have made my life much easier,  -they seem to get the job done.</li>
            <li>It gives a nice smooth finish and is very smooth when cutting.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a clean and professional cut to their nails.</li>
            <li>It came super early</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong and hopefully will last.</li>
            <li>I would certainly continue to use, and order again if needed.</li>
            <li>It does not leave a clean cut, but far better than traditional nail clippers on natural nails.</li>
            <li>I was looking for something to cut my nails to avoid the fee at my nail salon and this little clipper came in handy.</li>
            <li>I bought these because they were cheap and you buy them for at least $5 more at the store...</li>
            <li>This was so cheap, i was afraid it would break, but its great.</li>
            <li>and they leave such a smooth cut.</li>
            <li>, they work really well.</li>
            <li>Was very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Cut</li>
            <li>In addition, the price was very competitive.  </li>
            <li>But I do really like it.</li>
            <li>IT SHOULD WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>Comes in adorable pink color as well.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>It give straight nail cutter as I want and wished&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>As light as they are, I thought they would break; however, such was not the case.</li>
            <li>I thought It would be cheap since I only paid a dollar for it</li>
            <li>Plus what girl doesnt love pink?</li>
            <li>very light.&lt;br /&gt;you would not be waisting the two dollars they ask for</li>
            <li>Since I did not have much time to use the product this is why I give it 3 stars</li>
            <li>I will try it on my other tips soon to see if it will work with a more sturdy nail tips.</li>
            <li>Nice clipper, however the blade seems to get dull quickly (albeit with a far bit of use) and you can&#x27;t replace it with another blade like some models.</li>
            <li>i thought this would be dull and cheap but to my surprise they are sharp and effective!</li>
            <li>finally found one that works with my RA hands--others have been very hard to work or hold--and a lot more money--i use them on my own nails--love it</li>
            <li>These work decent</li>
            <li>I ordered two by mistake &amp; was so pleased with it gave the extra one to my mom instead of sendn back for a refund</li>
            <li>I just really like my nails pretty short so that I dont jam my fingers so much, and</li>
            <li>bomb id recommend this cuts human and pet nails clean cut also after its easy to file down and shape nails after</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for at home or salon use.</li>
            <li>the color highly recoomend thank you.</li>
            <li>I love this little gadget.</li>
            <li>Worked okay the first couple of months, but now it gives me a hard time when I use it.</li>
            <li>Not very shape &amp; cheaply made.</li>
            <li>They were great clippers cut the nail perfectly no pulling of the nail to cause pain.</li>
            <li>but anyway so far i think theses is really going to do the work</li>
            <li>invest a few more dollars and get quality</li>
            <li>It helps me save money because now I can cut my own nails down instead of paying an extra 4 dollars for it at the nail shop</li>
            <li>Not hard to squeeze or anything.</li>
            <li>Sharp but the handle is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>BUT it still works like its new.</li>
            <li>The blade is very sharp therefore it easily cuts your&lt;br /&gt;nails</li>
            <li>They are not big and bulky and the pink comfort handle makes them cute &amp; girly.</li>
            <li>but this is nice product for false and real nails</li>
            <li>It cuts my nails very professionally, just like in the beauty salon.</li>
            <li>Other than it getting a little stuck now and then, it is still a good product.</li>
            <li>A little cheaply made and light weight compared to others I have had, but really no complaints.  </li>
            <li>It was as ordered, as pictured and no complaints so far!  </li>
            <li>and it came extra fast!</li>
            <li>so the wait is long, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Especially if you&#x27;re a first timer doing acrylics.</li>
            <li>I know I am going to file them anyway, but every other nail cutter I have used created a clean edge when they cut.</li>
            <li>I like how it can cut either round or square quite efficiently, and yet very quickly.</li>
            <li>It felt a little cheap</li>
            <li>It does it&#x27;s job, cutting the nail, but is not sharp enough to leave a clean edge, as a good pair of nail clippers would.</li>
            <li>The rubber is a little sheer on the handels but thats okay.</li>
            <li>To be honest I thought it would be a little more cheesy than what looks in the picture.</li>
            <li>Packed securely as far as shipping.</li>
            <li>In the stores around me, I would have paid almost $15-20 just for the same product function, so I was ready to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; for a sub-par product.</li>
            <li>When I received this one and tried it for the first time , I realized that I had waited too long to make this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Works better than I would have expected for such a low price!</li>
            <li>that is as far as you can press it.</li>
            <li>It also came early.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>its so much easier to clip my acrylic nails now instead of using regular ones.</li>
            <li>So I received my product a week early that is a plus.</li>
            <li>with no trouble.</li>
            <li>It cuts the false tips quick and easy and even comes with instructions on how to get a curved, round and straight edge.</li>
            <li>works excellent when cutting down my plastic nail tips when doing my manicures!</li>
            <li>these false nail tip clippers are light weight but very durable.</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp, cuts in a snap and there are no ridges; it&#x27;s a complete sharp cut and a smooth one.</li>
            <li>this is the best product you can have for false nails makes measuring and cutting soo much easier.</li>
            <li>The blade is sharp so I expect it to cut tips very well.</li>
            <li>i have long natural nails</li>
            <li>This is a really great tool for cutting your acrylic nails down to size.</li>
            <li>and it was very sharp and cut right through the acrillic nails and did not leave a rough edge.</li>

            <li> and I would recommend this product to my friends because of the cheap prices and on time shipping.</li>
            <li> and those are the cheap ones.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal to me because I knew the product wouldn&#x27;t be all that great.</li>
            <li> but i enjoy the ease it creates when doing acrylics</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to enjoy this one.</li>
            <li> that the only use for this tools lol.</li>
            <li> They are sturdy and are a comfortable size.</li>
            <li> The material used is really cheap.</li>
            <li> I wish there were assorted colors, but hey, their use is far superior to its look.</li>
            <li> Any other time i would just use scissors but that requires more filing because it doesnt cut straight, this clipper works great!</li>

            <li> The spring seems to work fine; and the price is right!</li>

            <li> These artifical nail trimmers do their job and are pretty cute too.</li>
            <li> Super cheap but not in quality.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut through gel, doesn&#x27;t cut clean.</li>
            <li> They work beautifully and you&#x27;re able to remove the blade if it ever gets dull.</li>
            <li> it is very sturdy and stylish.</li>

            <li> Cute pink kind of color.</li>
            <li> i was expecting better quality clippers, when they arrived it was cheap packaging, the quality is very cheap looking, it does work for the nail tips, just the struture were not what i expected</li>
            <li> The product I purchased was very pretty</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much specially because this was the last thing I needed to start doing nails.</li>
            <li> But you have to be gentle with it because you could easily break it.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other kind!</li>
            <li> Pretty cool.</li>
            <li> Totally worth</li>
            <li> The product was good, and did what I expected.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the girlfriend since she recently started doing her own nails.</li>
            <li> The pink part, the grip, feels good to hold on to.</li>
            <li> It is an awesome product, nothing came broken or anything</li>
            <li> This false nail tip clipper is awesome!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut the false nail tips as good as before but can&#x27;t complain too much, because I got it at a good price.</li>
            <li> the money and shipping was super fast!  </li>
            <li> Got here fast and in original box.</li>

            <li> they have  really nice pink rubberish grips on handles that grip well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted</li>
            <li> i have not had a chance to use it yet however in the instuctions showed different ways to cute with them.</li>
            <li> Im aware the price would suggest its cheapness</li>
            <li> I really would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> Came in cheap wrap but does it&#x27;s job so far no complaints</li>
            <li> they are exactly what I wanted and needed to get my tools completed for my in home work for my friends and neighbors.</li>
            <li> Very durable and for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase especially for the price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li> Such a super cheap price, you just can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> Product was a little cheap (acrylic cutters) but for the price it&#x27;s fine!</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the same clippers sold for $15.99 at the big stores!</li>
            <li> Glad I finally bought a set, they have made my life much easier,  -they seem to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It gives a nice smooth finish and is very smooth when cutting.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a clean and professional cut to their nails.</li>
            <li> It came super early</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong and hopefully will last.</li>
            <li> I would certainly continue to use, and order again if needed.</li>
            <li> It does not leave a clean cut, but far better than traditional nail clippers on natural nails.</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to cut my nails to avoid the fee at my nail salon and this little clipper came in handy.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were cheap and you buy them for at least $5 more at the store...</li>
            <li> This was so cheap, i was afraid it would break, but its great.</li>
            <li> and they leave such a smooth cut.</li>
            <li> , they work really well.</li>
            <li> Was very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Cut</li>
            <li> In addition, the price was very competitive.  </li>
            <li> But I do really like it.</li>
            <li> IT SHOULD WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this</li>
            <li> Comes in adorable pink color as well.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> It give straight nail cutter as I want and wished&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> As light as they are, I thought they would break; however, such was not the case.</li>
            <li> I thought It would be cheap since I only paid a dollar for it</li>
            <li> Plus what girl doesnt love pink?</li>
            <li> very light.&lt;br /&gt;you would not be waisting the two dollars they ask for</li>
            <li> Since I did not have much time to use the product this is why I give it 3 stars</li>
            <li> I will try it on my other tips soon to see if it will work with a more sturdy nail tips.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper, however the blade seems to get dull quickly (albeit with a far bit of use) and you can&#x27;t replace it with another blade like some models.</li>
            <li> i thought this would be dull and cheap but to my surprise they are sharp and effective!</li>
            <li> finally found one that works with my RA hands--others have been very hard to work or hold--and a lot more money--i use them on my own nails--love it</li>
            <li> These work decent</li>
            <li> I ordered two by mistake &amp; was so pleased with it gave the extra one to my mom instead of sendn back for a refund</li>
            <li> I just really like my nails pretty short so that I dont jam my fingers so much, and</li>
            <li> bomb id recommend this cuts human and pet nails clean cut also after its easy to file down and shape nails after</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for at home or salon use.</li>
            <li> the color highly recoomend thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget.</li>
            <li> Worked okay the first couple of months, but now it gives me a hard time when I use it.</li>
            <li> Not very shape &amp; cheaply made.</li>
            <li> They were great clippers cut the nail perfectly no pulling of the nail to cause pain.</li>
            <li> but anyway so far i think theses is really going to do the work</li>
            <li> invest a few more dollars and get quality</li>
            <li> It helps me save money because now I can cut my own nails down instead of paying an extra 4 dollars for it at the nail shop</li>
            <li> Not hard to squeeze or anything.</li>
            <li> Sharp but the handle is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> BUT it still works like its new.</li>
            <li> The blade is very sharp therefore it easily cuts your&lt;br /&gt;nails</li>
            <li> They are not big and bulky and the pink comfort handle makes them cute &amp; girly.</li>
            <li> but this is nice product for false and real nails</li>
            <li> It cuts my nails very professionally, just like in the beauty salon.</li>
            <li> Other than it getting a little stuck now and then, it is still a good product.</li>
            <li> A little cheaply made and light weight compared to others I have had, but really no complaints.  </li>
            <li> It was as ordered, as pictured and no complaints so far!  </li>
            <li> and it came extra fast!</li>
            <li> so the wait is long, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Especially if you&#x27;re a first timer doing acrylics.</li>
            <li> I know I am going to file them anyway, but every other nail cutter I have used created a clean edge when they cut.</li>
            <li> I like how it can cut either round or square quite efficiently, and yet very quickly.</li>
            <li> It felt a little cheap</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, cutting the nail, but is not sharp enough to leave a clean edge, as a good pair of nail clippers would.</li>
            <li> The rubber is a little sheer on the handels but thats okay.</li>
            <li> To be honest I thought it would be a little more cheesy than what looks in the picture.</li>
            <li> Packed securely as far as shipping.</li>
            <li> In the stores around me, I would have paid almost $15-20 just for the same product function, so I was ready to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; for a sub-par product.</li>
            <li> When I received this one and tried it for the first time , I realized that I had waited too long to make this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Works better than I would have expected for such a low price!</li>
            <li> that is as far as you can press it.</li>
            <li> It also came early.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> its so much easier to clip my acrylic nails now instead of using regular ones.</li>
            <li> So I received my product a week early that is a plus.</li>
            <li> with no trouble.</li>
            <li> It cuts the false tips quick and easy and even comes with instructions on how to get a curved, round and straight edge.</li>
            <li> works excellent when cutting down my plastic nail tips when doing my manicures!</li>
            <li> these false nail tip clippers are light weight but very durable.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp, cuts in a snap and there are no ridges; it&#x27;s a complete sharp cut and a smooth one.</li>
            <li> this is the best product you can have for false nails makes measuring and cutting soo much easier.</li>
            <li> The blade is sharp so I expect it to cut tips very well.</li>
            <li> i have long natural nails</li>
            <li> This is a really great tool for cutting your acrylic nails down to size.</li>
            <li> and it was very sharp and cut right through the acrillic nails and did not leave a rough edge.</li>
            <li> Overall though, this works very well in most situations--too thick or too thin and it can bend the nail coming off.</li>
            <li> Although filing afterwards is normal, I forsee that this could potentially cause splits in the nail that go further down.</li>
            <li> won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I like it, hope it last for a long time</li>
            <li> My daughter does a much better job at cutting the acrylic nails than with regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li> I have only cut a few nails with it and it seems to be working well so far.</li>
            <li> with this i can cut the entire width of the nail at the same time with minimal filing afterwards!.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have a pair of these can actually help on real nails when you break one without cutting more than you mean.</li>
            <li> Well her fake nail cracked and she couldnt get it off her real nail with all her acrylic material, tried using normal nail clippers til i reminded her about this.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail clipper on this website only because of the color pink.</li>
            <li> just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to get one.</li>
            <li> the entire thing was a Pastel pink.</li>
            <li> it takes too long to be here in us.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t take too long to get my items maybe 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I have been searching for this acrylic clipper for a long time.</li>
            <li> And i received 2 red ones instead of just one pink one.</li>
            <li> I was able to cut the fake nails down that i got from the nail shop</li>
            <li> Just wonder how long they will stay sharp enough...</li>
            <li> So much easier and less stressful on your nail than plain siscors.</li>
            <li> My old one is very hard and not sharp at all.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t even cut through the whole nail easily left really really rough edges and was just frustrating to use.</li>
            <li> Not a strong clipper feels like they are going to fall apartalso not sharp</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot easier than using a regular nail clipper to cut down nails.</li>
            <li> Also found some thumb nails are too flat to fit in the curved cutting guide but other models have that problem too.</li>
            <li> It is a fabulous tool that works so well on artificial nails...</li>
            <li> Along with fast shipping I would definitely buy another one if something goes wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> the description said it was the color pink</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I thought that it was only going to cut a round shaped nail.</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected.</li>
            <li> i just would have like to know that i wasn&#x27;t getting pink for some reason or the other.</li>
            <li> other then the color it works well.</li>
            <li> and they&#x27;re pink!</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t get stuck like other ones I&#x27;ve used, either.  </li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and decided to take my chance since I could not beat the price.</li>
            <li> and the woman said that there was a delay due to a train accident...</li>
            <li> A month before expected date!</li>
            <li> But other than that I highley recomend it.</li>
            <li> I got this over the christmas break for my stuff and the other day im just now getting them</li>
            <li> In the picture which is supposed to be part of a the description showed that the clippers were PINK!</li>
            <li> Its flimsy and very rough feeling....</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll definitley need to fille the edges down.</li>
            <li> can save you a 5 or 10 dollars for a cut down at the nail salon.  </li>
            <li> I saved the cut down nail fee they charge of 6$</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping one, and giving the other away as a gift!</li>
            <li> and it is very sharp.  </li>
            <li> and it would leave my nail very sharp, but with these the end are not as ruff but still have to file</li>
            <li> It is very sharp and I have had this item for months.  </li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> It does the job well and is very sharp, so remember to face it way from you</li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical to use this on my real nails</li>
            <li> these clippers work really good for cutting artificial tips down to size.</li>
            <li> I paid way less than paying to get my nails clipped every 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and i hate cutting them with a regular nail clipper because it takes several uneven cute to get across the width of the nail.</li>
            <li> I do not work on fake nails very often so having this clipper rather than using my ordinary clippers</li>
            <li> Its a little flimsy</li>
            <li> it had little bubbles in the handle on one side all over.</li>
            <li> I was  expecting it to be a little sturdier than it appears.</li>
            <li> Worked well haven&#x27;t had any trouble yet..</li>
            <li> If not it is just a junk@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ waste money</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t waste my time again.</li>
            <li> check it out and if you don&#x27;t you are missing out..</li>
            <li> It still feels lighter than ones at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply, but overall, it does what I bought it to do (clip fake nails).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lil small</li>
            <li> I know you usually get what you pay for</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Was expecting it to have two edge cutters,  putting a finger inside the cutter hole thing is a little scary ..</li>
            <li> No more unevenly fake nails.</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t broken my false nails by clipping them.</li>
            <li> but I didnt even try it, it was that poorly made.</li>
            <li> I bought one and when I got it , it was broken.</li>
            <li> ON MY ACRYLIC FALSE NAILS.</li>
            <li> One snip and her fake nail was off.</li>
            <li> Useless stuff.</li>
            <li> not perfectly... still have to trim the edge myself with puffs..</li>
            <li> in all the years that i have done fake nails i wished i had got these yrs ago.</li>
            <li> Expensive.</li>
            <li> This item is very poorly made ,,,do not recommend.  </li>
            <li> I have had not problems cutting through false nails or acrylic nails!</li>
            <li> I wondered if this would do the job of cutting my fake nails, but works like a charm.</li>
            <li> I was quite disappointing.</li>
            <li> they leave ruff edges that are dangerous and cause a lot of buffing out</li>
            <li> I dont know if it is how I am cutting it or holding it?</li>
            <li> cuz they were not staying in while I was cutting my tips</li>
            <li> I dont wear artificial nails</li>
            <li> For the price, you just can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> When I tried these bad girls out I couldn&#x27;t stop cutting cause</li>
            <li> IDK MAYBE I JUST GOT A BAD ONE</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I use it and it works fine the price is unbeatable. I use it to do acrylic nails works fine</li>
            <li> I received this nail clipper and loved it! It&#x27;s pink which is my favorite color and in great condition. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This package came today,10 days earlier than the earliest shipping estimate. My friend tried it on her nails that i did for her a couple days ago and it was a nice clean,even cut. Its a little flimsy but i think that it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I ordered this nail clipper on this website only because of the color pink. the description said it was the color pink and it came red. I was quite disappointing. other then the color it works well.</li>
            <li> Super cheap, and arrived here on time, these cut amazing! and they&#x27;re pink! will order another pair if anything ever happens to the ones I have now.</li>
            <li> I liked that it came in a week and it is very sharp.  I love the color. Though it looks like the pictures, there was a defect...  it had little bubbles in the handle on one side all over. But,.. it does what it needs to do. Good for the price.</li>
            <li> i use to use regular cliper to cut my nail and would have to cut accross twice for the thum and it would leave my nail very sharp, but with these the end are not as ruff but still have to file</li>
            <li> I got the product on time and have been using faithfully on my nails. Works great, have no troubles. To be honest I thought it would be a little more cheesy than what looks in the picture. But, it&#x27;s not. Good quality and I very happy.</li>
            <li> When I bought this, I thought that it was only going to cut a round shaped nail. But it actually came with instructions of all on the different ways to get a different cut. Pretty cool. Who knew one tool could be use many ways.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what you ask for. A tip cutter. Its light and of course easy to use and the price is unbeatable. I would recommend this product and buy again</li>
            <li> Sharp but the handle is cheap plastic. Overall will get the job done but might have to purchase another one later.</li>
            <li> It felt a little cheap but what can you expect from the price (which is an awesome deal). I just hope that it doesn&#x27;t break when using it.</li>
            <li> it is the best color works great cuts perfect the price was great and it got here before the date it said</li>
            <li> Worked well haven&#x27;t had any trouble yet..</li>
            <li> This false nail tip clipper is awesome! it is very sturdy and stylish. It is very sharp and I have had this item for months.  I have had not problems cutting through false nails or acrylic nails! Totally worth the money and shipping was super fast!  I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a sturdy clipping tool.</li>
            <li> Great cutter. Super cheap but not in quality. Packed securely as far as shipping. Cute pink kind of color. Mine is more of a fuchsia kind of color.  Pretty and functional, what more can u ask for ladies &amp; gents.</li>
            <li> Works just as good as the same clippers sold for $15.99 at the big stores! Such a super cheap price, you just can&#x27;t beat it. Arrived sooner than anticipated too!</li>
            <li> works excellent when cutting down my plastic nail tips when doing my manicures! Will buy again thank you for shipping so soon!</li>
            <li> Was expecting it to have two edge cutters,  putting a finger inside the cutter hole thing is a little scary ..but it does an amazing job...should have different colors for different type of personality just some ideas to the seller..great product</li>
            <li> Very cheap. Not very sturdy. Low quality. Poorly made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight and built ok, shipping was kind of quick considering it came from China and shipping could take weeks... but when it cuts my nails, they leave an unclean edge. I know I am going to file them anyway, but every other nail cutter I have used created a clean edge when they cut. The price was ok though!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says. Cuts perfectly, is pretty nicely made, and I believe this one even came with some free sparkles :) It also comes with a guide on how to position the clippers to get the cut you want. Very nice!</li>
            <li> This is a very good product but it did take a month to get here and I would keep this away from children.</li>
            <li> Love this tip cutter  So much easier and less stressful on your nail than plain siscors. Very happy with this product.</li>
            <li> These nail clippers work really good. They are nice and sturdy.</li>
            <li> Good. I like it. It works great. Like do deal with you next time. Thank u. Hope u can do more businesses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these since I bought them and I had no issues with it. They worked great! Received them on time.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice and and easy to use. The product I purchased was very pretty and I would recommend this product to my friends because of the cheap prices and on time shipping.</li>
            <li> It is sharped and very good to use. I refer it to some friends and they like it and are happy.</li>
            <li> I bought these because they were cheap and you buy them for at least $5 more at the store...and those are the cheap ones.  These work awesome! They don&#x27;t get stuck like other ones I&#x27;ve used, either.  Definitely worth the buy!</li>
            <li> No complaints, works great!</li>
            <li> I got this product for under $2 and it was free shipping. In the stores around me, I would have paid almost $15-20 just for the same product function, so I was ready to &amp;#34;settle&amp;#34; for a sub-par product. However, the nail clippers were a lot better than I thought it would be! It still feels lighter than ones at Sally&#x27;s beauty supply, but overall, it does what I bought it to do (clip fake nails). It came within the month I ordered it, so I will say that I&#x27;m glad I saved money and was patient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen better in beauty stores but for me being cheap it works. I just started doing my own nails again after couple years and start up costs can be a lot over $300 just for all tools supplies etc.  so I got these.  They are ok you can tell they are not made real real strong like some solid metal ones I&#x27;ve seen but they work.  I would Not buy again.&lt;br /&gt;And shipping does take 2-3 weeks just FYI.</li>
            <li> Cut well. Can do squared or rounded. Even trimmed through acrylic. Good buy! I would recommend. Fast shipping too! Good for professional or at home use!</li>
            <li> I GOT THESE TO DO MY OWN NAILS AT HOME. I WAS USING NAIL CLIPPERS WHICH I FOUND WAS SPLITTING THE TIPS. THIS GIVES A SMOOTH CUT WITH NO SPLITS, WOULD DEF BUY AGAIN IF NEEDED</li>
            <li> Came weeks early, perfect cut, cheap price and with a great price! Highly recommend for at home or salon use.</li>
            <li> I do my own nails and had put off buying one of these clippers for a very long time.  When I received this one and tried it for the first time , I realized that I had waited too long to make this purchase.  It is a fabulous tool that works so well on artificial nails...gives you a nice straight clip without chipping the nail...good buy...just wish I hadn&#x27;t waited so long to get one.</li>
            <li> Works better than I would have expected for such a low price! I would definitely go with this clipper if you like to do your nails at home.</li>
            <li> It was as ordered, as pictured and no complaints so far!  Hoping my daughter will be able to use it for what she ordered it for!</li>
            <li> Very very nice at first i thought this would be dull and cheap but to my surprise they are sharp and effective! The price is the bonus i would recommend to anyone who needs to build there nail.supplies up or just to have for gel or acrylic nails i am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> this was very helpful for me and will be looking for more buys as the days go by thank  for all the items.</li>
            <li> This.is a great tool to have handy if, like me, you love doing acrylic nails.  The ease of use stands alone, not to mention a great price!</li>
            <li> I love the nail clippers... I bought  a kit to begin my own acrylic nails. The kit did not come with nail clippers so I ordered them separate. The Price was great and so is the quality!</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and decided to take my chance since I could not beat the price. The product was good, and did what I expected. It does not leave a clean cut, but far better than traditional nail clippers on natural nails. I also had polish on, which may have caused some of the issue. I always file afterwards anyway so this was not a big deal for me. I would certainly continue to use, and order again if needed.</li>
            <li> Hi I do my own nails and clippers are not that great...these cut nice and smooth ;) would buy again</li>
            <li> They work beautifully and you&#x27;re able to remove the blade if it ever gets dull. They haven&#x27;t broken my false nails by clipping them. You still need to file afterwards.</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t 100 dollar clippers so don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re getting but this is nice product for false and real nails and I recommend it if you&#x27;re in beauty school, on the go, or just looking to give yourself your own manicures! It came super early and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. Very happy customer</li>
            <li> These cut so good, I love them they are so much better than using nail clippers and they leave such a smooth cut. I would definitely recommend these.</li>
            <li> I like it. Way better than using standard toenail &amp; nail clippers. I love them. Item came exactly as described.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the girlfriend since she recently started doing her own nails. Well her fake nail cracked and she couldnt get it off her real nail with all her acrylic material, tried using normal nail clippers til i reminded her about this. One snip and her fake nail was off. Very pleased!</li>
            <li> Nice acrylic nail cutter. Very sharp. Took a bit to get but overall happy with the product. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> bomb id recommend this cuts human and pet nails clean cut also after its easy to file down and shape nails after</li>
            <li> This works perfect for my fake nails i design or do on others. I Love it works for what it was made for</li>
            <li> CUTS VERY SMOOTHLY AND IS VERY CUTE, SMALL, AND WILL WORK ON REAL NAILS AND ACRYLIC. VERY GOOD PRICE AND QUALITY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the perfect acrylic cutter and i finally found it. It&#x27;s truly a perfect buy as well.</li>
            <li> i have long natural nails and i hate cutting them with a regular nail clipper because it takes several uneven cute to get across the width of the nail. as a result i have to file alot afterwards to get them even. with this i can cut the entire width of the nail at the same time with minimal filing afterwards!.</li>
            <li> Great nail clippers for beginners, they work really well. They are not big and bulky and the pink comfort handle makes them cute &amp; girly.</li>
            <li> I liked the product very much specially because this was the last thing I needed to start doing nails. great product!</li>
            <li> Glad I finally bought a set, they have made my life much easier,  -they seem to get the job done.</li>
            <li> works fine and pretty i been use it over 6 months work fine love the color highly recoomend thank you.</li>
            <li> These artifical nail trimmers do their job and are pretty cute too. The rubber is a little sheer on the handels but thats okay.</li>
            <li> Works great on my acrylic / gel nails. Quick and easy to use. But it did take a while for delivery though.</li>
            <li> these clippers work really good for cutting artificial tips down to size. Low cost and does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Did not look like the picture. the entire thing was a Pastel pink. (which was fine by me) Was very lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;Cut great. Will buy again if i need to.</li>
            <li> These work decent they leave ruff edges that are dangerous and cause a lot of buffing out but they get the job done</li>
            <li> Works great, just be careful very sharp, love the results, great price...would recommend to anyone and I already have lol.</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t even cut through the whole nail easily left really really rough edges and was just frustrating to use. Go to sally&#x27;s and buy one there you&#x27;ll be much happier!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about the quality yet.  I will use it in 45 days.  It&#x27;s strong and hopefully will last.</li>
            <li> Worked okay the first couple of months, but now it gives me a hard time when I use it. Doesn&#x27;t cut the false nail tips as good as before but can&#x27;t complain too much, because I got it at a good price. Other than it getting a little stuck now and then, it is still a good product.</li>
            <li> They looked like good clippers at a reasonable price. I am satisfied with these clippers they work well. they were a good deal and I would recommend them to any one I use them in my spa.</li>
            <li> Nice clipper, however the blade seems to get dull quickly (albeit with a far bit of use) and you can&#x27;t replace it with another blade like some models. Overall though, this works very well in most situations--too thick or too thin and it can bend the nail coming off. Also found some thumb nails are too flat to fit in the curved cutting guide but other models have that problem too.</li>
            <li> Ok so the day I got this I was seeing if it was broke and i am glad i tested it because it had just fell apart in my hands</li>
            <li> Good quality product. They are strong  and easy to use. they have  really nice pink rubberish grips on handles that grip well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lil small but hey it&#x27;s cheap it works well and it&#x27;s really is the perfect size !! I love it and I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I like this product.  It does the job well and is very sharp, so remember to face it way from you or you will cut yourself or your client. LOL.  No I didn&#x27;t cut myself or my client!!</li>
            <li> Useless stuff. If you have crystal mail you can buy it. If not it is just a junk@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ waste money</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to. It&#x27;s a lot easier than using a regular nail clipper to cut down nails. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to buy. Plus the price was nice.</li>
            <li> Product was simple enough that it worked as designed as delivered.  In addition, the price was very competitive.  Works for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m keeping one, and giving the other away as a gift! The blade is sharp, cuts in a snap and there are no ridges; it&#x27;s a complete sharp cut and a smooth one.</li>
            <li> IT JUST DONT CUT THE NAIL RIGHT IDK MAYBE I JUST GOT A BAD ONE EVERY ONE ELSE SEEMS TO LIKE IT.  I DONT THINK ITS GOOD QUALITY IT SEEMED A LITTLE JUNKY TO ME</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal to me because I knew the product wouldn&#x27;t be all that great. People, its $4. Not very shape &amp; cheaply made. Doesn&#x27;t cut through gel, doesn&#x27;t cut clean. But hey, it&#x27;s $4 so what do you expect.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted and I got it for an amazing price! The packaging was good, and the clipper is easy to use. Not hard to squeeze or anything. I practically feel like a pro. It cuts the false tips quick and easy and even comes with instructions on how to get a curved, round and straight edge. Plus it came weeks before the estimated delivery date :D I recommend this if you want to try doing your own acrylic nails like me.</li>
            <li> i have not had a chance to use it yet however in the instuctions showed different ways to cute with them. they look easy to use and comfortable size for hands.</li>
            <li> Just like what they have at the salon. It is really easy to use. I just really like my nails pretty short so that I dont jam my fingers so much, and its hart to make them that short when you can only use this to where it makes the nail just a bit longer than the fingertip, cause that is as far as you can press it. But I do really like it.</li>
            <li> A little cheaply made and light weight compared to others I have had, but really no complaints.  I have used them a couple times and they work just fine.  In the end all I wanted was for them to do their job and they do!</li>
            <li> Works like the salon!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter for Christmas she loves them she does her nails all the time very nice for cheap price I paid</li>
            <li> Im aware the price would suggest its cheapness but I didnt even try it, it was that poorly made. The blade was crooked and had excess metal pieces stuck to it.</li>
            <li> Works Good . I havent used much but no complaints yet :)&lt;br /&gt;The price is pretty good i would probley recommend .</li>
            <li> I wish I could have more colors to pick but it was just one, which is fine, at the end the important thing is that it does work good!</li>
            <li> It got here fast, in great condition and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. I would recommend it and might buy more.</li>
            <li> it works it is very easy to use took a long time in shipping but i enjoy the ease it creates when doing acrylics</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy I received my item thank you!</li>
            <li> it was okay the clipper cutter did what it said it would.&lt;br /&gt;it was a very cheap price and i loved that</li>
            <li> cuts wells, but not perfectly... still have to trim the edge myself with puffs..&lt;br /&gt;and it takes too long to be here in us.</li>
            <li> Cuts perfectly and came early</li>
            <li> in all the years that i have done fake nails i wished i had got these yrs ago. it so beats nail clippers. you have got to get ya some.</li>
            <li> I really love this thing!! Good grip to hold on very good quality it&#x27;s very easy to use!!! I really would recommend this! It does a perfect job!!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, the price was right so I got one. I dont know if it is how I am cutting it or holding it? but I swear it cuts the acrylic tips crooked....almost everytime. hmmmmmm. anyone else experience this?</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. It worked perfectly.  Easier to cut and shape just how want my nails. without keeping to cut and cut.</li>
            <li> this is the best product you can have for false nails makes measuring and cutting soo much easier. It did take awhile to get but company does work with you.</li>
            <li> I LIKE IT, IT DOES THE JOB, IT&#x27;S ALL GOOD AND SNIPS MY TIPS LIKE IT SHOULD WITHOUT MUCH EFFORT</li>
            <li> These clippers don&#x27;t strain my hand at all. They are easy to use and light as a feather. I&#x27;m very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Exactly what I needed. Does the job good. I am very pleased. Packaging wasn&#x27;t done correctly but product was in good shape.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality but it will do.</li>
            <li> Never received the item. Called them after it had been a month and the woman said that there was a delay due to a train accident... Gave up on it and never called them back. Wouldn&#x27;t waste my time again.</li>
            <li> This also came very quickly! A month before expected date! Came in cheap wrap but does it&#x27;s job so far no complaints</li>
            <li> but I had to keep tightening the screws cuz they were not staying in while I was cutting my tips so I just baught 1 from my local store..</li>
            <li> daughter uses these all the time.  seem to work just fine!</li>
            <li> Speedy delivery!! I was very happy to get my order so quickly. Product was a little cheap (acrylic cutters) but for the price it&#x27;s fine! I would gladly do business with them again!!</li>
            <li> It cut just like I thought it would and works wonders. Love it so happy I got it  yay yay</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget. It cuts my nails very professionally, just like in the beauty salon. I like how it can cut either round or square quite efficiently, and yet very quickly. It is a good price too. I went into Sally Beauty Supply and found a similarly made one for $19.99! Ouch! Expensive. It was the same story at WalMart and CVS. Believe me, for the money, you cannot get a better value. I would recommend that you be prepared to wait for it, because it comes from over seas and takes a while to come. Otherwise, I would recommend it to anyone who wants a clean and professional cut to their nails.</li>
            <li> these false nail tip clippers are light weight but very durable. They get the job done and are perfect for the use!</li>
            <li> I was looking for something to cut my nails to avoid the fee at my nail salon and this little clipper came in handy. I paid way less than paying to get my nails clipped every 2 weeks. It works perfectly fine for the price and I would buy again. Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this it cuts the tip perfectly...Good buy</li>
            <li> This was not what I thought I ordered... They are not designed for use on gel nails. No I will not buy again.</li>
            <li> They arrived in a timely manner, they also work great. I would recommend these to friends. Also a lot cheaper to buy online than in the store</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job, cutting the nail, but is not sharp enough to leave a clean edge, as a good pair of nail clippers would. Although filing afterwards is normal, I forsee that this could potentially cause splits in the nail that go further down. You get what you pay for, I suppose.</li>
            <li> I was  expecting it to be a little sturdier than it appears. But you have to be gentle with it because you could easily break it. It does the job...just quite not what it looked like in the picture.</li>
            <li> My old one is very hard and not sharp at all. I&#x27;m going to enjoy this one. The pink part, the grip, feels good to hold on to. The blade is sharp so I expect it to cut tips very well. The spring seems to work fine; and the price is right!</li>
            <li> Good product, good price. Doesn&#x27;t exactley form nails perfectly. You&#x27;ll definitley need to fille the edges down. But other than that I highley recomend it. It also came early.</li>
            <li> Just recieved this item. It is nice quality and works well! I am impressed with the quality for the money :)</li>
            <li> I do not work on fake nails very often so having this clipper rather than using my ordinary clippers get the done done nicely in one snip.</li>
            <li> This nail clipper I bought is awesome. No more unevenly fake nails. They even shipped it out asap from across the world. Will worth my money and nice product.</li>
            <li> These Cutterz so sharp they cut perfect. When I tried these bad girls out I couldn&#x27;t stop cutting cause I ain&#x27;t never clippers cut so good besides these are the ones they cut with at the nail salon that I love to get my nail cut with</li>
            <li> It is an awesome product, nothing came broken or anything and it came extra fast! Love it! Must have and convinient for price.</li>
            <li> Perfect! they are exactly what I wanted and needed to get my tools completed for my in home work for my friends and neighbors. Got here fast and in original box. No complainants.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks SF-P</li>
            <li> I know you usually get what you pay for but this is so horrible in quality...Its flimsy and very rough feeling....almost dangerously bad...I would not recommend buying this...invest a few more dollars and get quality</li>
            <li> Nail trimmer it&#x27;s ok but thought I could use it to trim my nails but didn&#x27;t know this is to trim fake nail tips</li>

            <li> this item works OK i don&#x27;t use it very much but when i do it works an dose what it suppose to</li>
            <li> these things are so flimsy that I am scared to use them on a person. I feel like I am going to break them.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected. It creates a nice clean cut like it should. Comes in adorable pink color as well.</li>
            <li> I love how this nail cutter clips my nails. I dont wear artificial nails so I was a little skeptical to use this on my real nails but they work really good. It doesnt damage your nails at all. Very easy to use!</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and does the job so far! :)</li>
            <li> For the price, you just can&#x27;t go wrong! They work and are easy to use. Just wonder how long they will stay sharp enough...</li>

            <li> Easy to use and the product is much better than the average nail clippers. They are sturdy and are a comfortable size. As light as they are, I thought they would break; however, such was not the case. My daughter does a much better job at cutting the acrylic nails than with regular nail clippers.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly!! Def a good buy and very cheap too!! Any other time i would just use scissors but that requires more filing because it doesnt cut straight, this clipper works great!</li>
            <li> I love love this tip cutter! Very easy to use and it cut the tips very smoothly. I will try it on my other tips soon to see if it will work with a more sturdy nail tips.</li>

            <li> These work great. They cut nice and evenly. Along with fast shipping I would definitely buy another one if something goes wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> Everyone should have a pair of these can actually help on real nails when you break one without cutting more than you mean.</li>
            <li> great detail, works perfectly, very effective and is highly reccomended when cliping the nails during and or after the visit to the nail salon</li>
            <li> I got this over the christmas break for my stuff and the other day im just now getting them but anyway so far i think theses is really going to do the work plus . . it was a good deal :)</li>
            <li> its easy to use and does not feel cheap had it for a couple days and i love it . p.s the way it cut perfect</li>
            <li> These work great. They were a awesome price as well. Its coming from china so the wait is long, but totally worth it.</li>
            <li> awesome very sharp. I was able to cut the fake nails down that i got from the nail shop i go  2.  I saved the cut down nail fee they charge of 6$ so im very happy.  I ordered two by mistake &amp; was so pleased with it gave the extra one to my mom instead of sendn back for a refund</li>
            <li> One of my favorite item. I will re-order if need arises!</li>
            <li> Works great and it&#x27;s easy to use for the price I love it and the color will buy again from buyer</li>
            <li> Perfect for clipping my natural nails. I love the square cut for my nails</li>
            <li> This product feels very light weight which concerns me about the durability but I love this product. Like I stated, it is lightweight, very easy to use and to cut with. It gives a nice smooth finish and is very smooth when cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these since I bought them and I had no issues with it. They worked great! Received them in a timely manner. Any order from overseas if you are a U.S. customer is going to take weeks not days.</li>
            <li> This item is very poorly made ,,,do not recommend.  Not a strong clipper feels like they are going to fall apartalso not sharp won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> I bought one and when I got it , it was broken. The material used is really cheap. Never buying another one again.</li>
            <li> every time i use this tool, its cuts perfect everytime. very light.&lt;br /&gt;you would not be waisting the two dollars they ask for</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a nail tech, I used this product to cut tip, and acrylic nails. Good results no cracking when I cut the acrylic nails.</li>
            <li> this product actually works It looks flimsy but it does work on any type of nails...so if you want it get it!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted works great!!! Very durable and for the price it was worth it. the shipping was more then the item</li>
            <li> Wow! I have been searching for this acrylic clipper for a long time. This clipper can cut acrylic without splitting or chipping! Makes your job easy!</li>
            <li> I wish there were assorted colors, but hey, their use is far superior to its look. Cuts the tips straight and perfect and now I can avoid having to cut with nail clippers. I recommend them!</li>
            <li> I like it, hope it last for a long time it seems to be a strong nail tip clipper cutter</li>
            <li> GREAT NAIL CLIPPER I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT. IT WORKS WELL ON MY ACRYLIC FALSE NAILS. IT COMES WITH INSTRUCTIONS AS WELL.</li>
            <li> I am always doing my nails, but sometimes cannot get into the Salon on time and need to trim them before hand. These work great for that. Thanks!</li>
            <li> So I received my product a week early that is a plus. I have only cut a few nails with it and it seems to be working well so far. Since I did not have much time to use the product this is why I give it 3 stars but I will update as i use the product</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Love it!! It&#x27;s great to trim acrylics. It&#x27;s easy to use/handle. Strongly recommend it. Especially if you&#x27;re a first timer doing acrylics. The product itself feels very strong and looks like it will last me quite some time.</li>
            <li> The nail tip clipper is lightweight and works great. I am pleased with my purchase especially for the price compared to department stores.</li>
            <li> Tried this as soon as I received it and it was very sharp and cut right through the acrillic nails and did not leave a rough edge.</li>
            <li> In the picture which is supposed to be part of a the description showed that the clippers were PINK! And i received 2 red ones instead of just one pink one. I dont mind i just would have like to know that i wasn&#x27;t getting pink for some reason or the other.</li>
            <li> This is a really great tool for cutting your acrylic nails down to size. The blade is very sharp therefore it easily cuts your&lt;br /&gt;nails to the length you want  with no trouble.</li>
