            <li>But over all I&#x27;m satisfied with this product</li>

            <li>Very sturdy and of good quality.</li>
            <li>It attached easily using some wood screwsscrews</li>

            <li>It is strong and my wife enjoys it.</li>
            <li>Love it my bathroom is staying so much nicer best buy in a long time thank you</li>
            <li>and I dont think you could fit a curling iron in it.</li>
            <li>And curling iron over 1.5&amp;#34;  prob wouldn&#x27;t fit either.</li>
            <li>We use the 2 1/2&amp;#34; irons and they wouldn&#x27;t fit.</li>
            <li>Great when you have teenage girls at home.</li>
            <li>Very nice product but not enough space to hang in our bathroom</li>
            <li>Getting my things off the counter and in a easily accessible place without inconvenience</li>
            <li>It was good just smaller than I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li>Very Nice but not the size i expected.</li>
            <li>Works great for my hair dryer and other hair styling products.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>The description of the item was exact..</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted for mounting to the edge of a vanity.</li>
            <li>love the metal and will now purchase a smaller iron ....</li>
            <li>It is very compact!  </li>
            <li>These were not the exact size we were needing.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>This item claims to hold hot tools.</li>
            <li>but it is nice not having the hot iron plates pressed against each other</li>
            <li>but they certainly work.</li>
            <li>Openings designed for older hot tools.</li>
            <li>A larger straight iron doesn&#x27;t fit in the slot.</li>
            <li>My biggest issue is that I have to remove my nozzle off of my hairdryer, but I don&#x27;t really mind doing that.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This is so much more than i had expected.</li>
            <li>Works out really well with the irons looking to order again soon</li>
            <li>Very compact but holds all my tools.  </li>
            <li>The customer service man was very helpful and understanding.</li>
            <li>My 1 inch curling iron doesn&#x27;t fit but my smaller ones do.</li>
            <li>looks great, holds my large straightener in both the larger openings and fits hairdryer, is on the small side</li>
            <li>As for the curling iron holes, there&#x27;s no way a flat iron would fit in any of them</li>
            <li>Some holes are too small for anything it seems, but otherwise I love it!</li>
            <li>However, we have sent the items back and are anticipating a full refund.  </li>
            <li>MORE MESS</li>
            <li>the other was okay which surprised me because both boxes were mangled .</li>
            <li>the iron holes are tiny, however this seems to be the only product available that isn&#x27;t $100</li>
            <li>The 3 holes on the side are only about 3.5&amp;#34; deep, not nearly long enough to safely house a hot curling iron.</li>
            <li>This item arrived in a clear plastic, Ziploc bag.  </li>
            <li>I use it for my blow dryer and my flat iron but a normal size curling iron would fit in the largest round hole.</li>
            <li>But be careful as the holders are plastic and hot curling items may melt it.</li>
            <li>The manufacturer says it withstands high temps for long periods of time.</li>
            <li>Since they don&#x27;t get narrow towards the bottom my irons now fit through, except with the same concern on the opposite end.</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s why I have to assume it was the two slots on the side which is kind of a weird design</li>
            <li>They would need to be at least 2&amp;#34; longer (3&amp;#34; for a curling wand) to make me comfortable using this around people especially children.</li>
            <li>and I guess if you leave a flat iron open it will fit in the 2 slots on the left (not sure if that was what they are actually designed for).</li>

            <li> and I guess if you leave a flat iron open it will fit in the 2 slots on the left (not sure if that was what they are actually designed for).</li>
            <li> The opening for the blow dryer not large enough for a professional dryer with nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> but you have to put flat iron in w/one side out &amp; one in slot as it isn&#x27;t big enough to hold wider ones.</li>
            <li> I bought this thinking the holders on the left would be big enough for my clippers to sit in, but it&#x27;s much smaller than expected.</li>
            <li> my flat irons stick way up......</li>
            <li> The holes were weird sizes that didn&#x27;t fit any of my styling products</li>
            <li> The openings seem a little smaller in person than online</li>
            <li> Read size measurement carefully before you order.</li>
            <li> when I opened them , one had crushed plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> It was not what I expected.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, I still use it and it serves its purpose.</li>
            <li> Probably due to heat.</li>
            <li> The holes for the curling irons should be deeper and the 2 other slots as well.</li>
            <li> round slots could be deeper other than that it works well</li>
            <li> It is not as  heavy</li>
            <li> This item appeared as it is in the picture, except missing one of the plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> It holds all my everyday supplies.</li>
            <li> Our smallest curl iron would not fit.  </li>
            <li> I warn everyone considering this item that it is SMALL in every way.</li>
            <li> The two smallest holes are probably too small to hold any sort of iron unless you have a mini one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite small.</li>
            <li> but it is small.</li>
            <li> Not a nice touch if you are planning on getting this item to give as a gift.  </li>
            <li> Too Small and will be retuning item!</li>
            <li> Not happy</li>
            <li> So overall, it isn&#x27;t a terrible product, just not at all what I was expecting, and needs some adjustments to the curling iron holders.</li>
            <li> you do not mention the width of the holes for curling irons which makes it difficult when my largest one is 1 1/2 in  also</li>
            <li> So I did what any desperate person would do and I cut the bottoms out.</li>
            <li> however I will take into consideration the bad weather everywhere ...</li>
            <li> I was shocked</li>
            <li> Awful!!!!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Shouldn&#x27;t this item come in a box? This item arrived in a clear plastic, Ziploc bag.  Not a nice touch if you are planning on getting this item to give as a gift.  This item appeared as it is in the picture, except missing one of the plastic pieces.</li>
            <li> I love this!! I can keep all my hair stuff organized and in one place!!</li>
            <li> The bomb-works perfectly and looks great</li>
            <li> Although this item seems to be made well, I cannot give it a great review because it isn&#x27;t practical for a styling salon, which was the intended use. I warn everyone considering this item that it is SMALL in every way. Short in length which makes it look like a kids toy and the iron holes are tiny, however this seems to be the only product available that isn&#x27;t $100 so, I had to make it work. It fits a blow dryer well (without the concentrator) and I guess if you leave a flat iron open it will fit in the 2 slots on the left (not sure if that was what they are actually designed for). As for the curling iron holes, there&#x27;s no way a flat iron would fit in any of them so that&#x27;s why I have to assume it was the two slots on the side which is kind of a weird design but it is nice not having the hot iron plates pressed against each other so it&#x27;s not a big deal. The 3 holes on the side are only about 3.5&amp;#34; deep, not nearly long enough to safely house a hot curling iron. You&#x27;d burn your hand trying to grab your blow dryer out or another curling iron. They would need to be at least 2&amp;#34; longer (3&amp;#34; for a curling wand) to make me comfortable using this around people especially children. So I did what any desperate person would do and I cut the bottoms out. Since they don&#x27;t get narrow towards the bottom my irons now fit through, except with the same concern on the opposite end. If a child were to grab it from the underneath they would get burned. But, because of where I&#x27;m putting it on my station, I do not need to worry about anyone having access to the underneath.  So overall, it isn&#x27;t a terrible product, just not at all what I was expecting, and needs some adjustments to the curling iron holders.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery,  nice design</li>
            <li> Very nice product but not enough space to hang in our bathroom so will be returning it</li>
            <li> I love this! My biggest issue is that I have to remove my nozzle off of my hairdryer, but I don&#x27;t really mind doing that.</li>
            <li> Love it my bathroom is staying so much nicer best buy in a long time thank you</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I need and you can have hot irons in it without it melting. The two smallest holes are probably too small to hold any sort of iron unless you have a mini one. I use it for my blow dryer and my flat iron but a normal size curling iron would fit in the largest round hole.</li>
            <li> It was good just smaller than I thought it was going to be</li>
            <li> Item as described. The inserts inside the metal holder are plastic. The manufacturer says it withstands high temps for long periods of time. Time will tell.  I hope so because the plastic won&#x27;t scratch the appliances.</li>
            <li> Good quality and plenty of openings for tools. The openings seem a little smaller in person than online but they certainly work.</li>
            <li> Some holes are too small for anything it seems, but otherwise I love it!</li>

            <li> A nice made unit, just wouldn&#x27;t work for our tools. We use the 2 1/2&amp;#34; irons and they wouldn&#x27;t fit. Had to return...</li>
            <li> The holes were weird sizes that didn&#x27;t fit any of my styling products</li>
            <li> THIS IS PERFECT FOR WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. NEEDED MY CURLING IRON, STRAIGHTNER &amp; BLOW DRYER HANGING WITH CORDS SEPARATED.  LOVE IT</li>
            <li> Love this. It is perfect for keeping your hair tools organized and off the counter tops. Great when you have teenage girls at home.</li>
            <li> This is so much more than i had expected. It holds all my everyday supplies. The description of the item was exact..</li>
            <li> Works out really well with the irons looking to order again soon</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and of good quality. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is probably one of the handiest things I&#x27;ve ever ordered. Love it. Saves space on my vanity.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and received something completely different! I wanted 6 of what is shown and received 6 table top standing blow dryer holders. Not happy and i am getting the run around trying to return these!</li>
            <li> Very Nice but not the size i expected. I thought it would be much bigger in reality, but it wasn&#x27;t as big as the picture shown.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted for mounting to the edge of a vanity.It attached easily using some wood screwsscrews</li>
            <li> I bought this item before and the plastic inserts always break. Probably due to heat. Otherwise I like this item. I&#x27;m buying them again.</li>
            <li> Looks perfect in the picture, but it is the worst quality ever!!!!! The screws given wouldn&#x27;t even hold it up in the wall so now it is just sitting in its box. Awful!!!!</li>
            <li> Very compact but holds all my tools.  Love it</li>
            <li> Like the product-won&#x27;t fall apart like last holder I had.</li>
            <li> it does the job but it is small.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my teenage daughters room!</li>
            <li> Sturdy,  far sturdier than I expected</li>
            <li> you do not mention the width of the holes for curling irons which makes it difficult when my largest one is 1 1/2 in  also my flat irons stick way up...... love the metal and will now purchase a smaller iron ....keep the larger one in a drawer. And the delivery was a week later than quoted... however I will take into consideration the bad weather everywhere ... it would have been nice if you had contacted me about the delay instead of waiting for me to inquire.... thank you for your time .

            <li> I was shocked when i saw this, it looks much larger in picture than it actually is.  It is very compact!  Read size measurement carefully before you order. Hangs easily. Holds tools but you have to put flat iron in w/one side out &amp; one in slot as it isn&#x27;t big enough to hold wider ones.</li>
            <li> There are no mounting screws, nothing at all but this metal piece arrived</li>
            <li> The opening for the blow dryer not large enough for a professional dryer with nozzle.&lt;br /&gt;Also the holes for curling irons ,not deep enough again for professionsl irons</li>
            <li> Perfect product to help any woman organize her stuff in the bathroom. Wife loves it.</li>
            <li> I JUST GOT THIS AND I HAVE ALREADY HUNG IT UP AND USING IT,,,NO MORE MESS EVERYTHING I NEED IS IN ONCE PLACE...LOVE LOVE  THIS SALON RACK...</li>
            <li> Quality is good.  Openings designed for older hot tools.</li>
            <li> These were not the exact size we were needing.  Our smallest curl iron would not fit.  However, we have sent the items back and are anticipating a full refund.  The customer service man was very helpful and understanding.</li>
            <li> The holes for the curling irons should be deeper and the 2 other slots as well. But over all I&#x27;m satisfied with this product</li>
            <li> Caution when getting blowdryer, curling irons are too cl</li>
            <li> daughter loves it!! her friends are checking Amazon out to purchase one also :) great buy well constructed</li>
            <li> I ordered two and when they came they were taped to the bottom of two mats I ordered for my stations at the shop. the boxes were smashed and tore up. when I opened them , one had crushed plastic pieces. the other was okay which surprised me because both boxes were mangled .</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I ordered. Getting my things off the counter and in a easily accessible place without inconvenience and this does the trick. is a great job.</li>
            <li> Works great for my hair dryer and other hair styling products.</li>
            <li> My 1 inch curling iron doesn&#x27;t fit but my smaller ones do. I like it.</li>
            <li> It is strong and my wife enjoys it. It holds all of her stuff and does not feel cheap, it is made of good materials.</li>
            <li> Too Small and will be retuning item!</li>
            <li> This item claims to hold hot tools. However the holder cups are made of plastic. Do not use this item!!!!!!. Heat and plastic do not mix. I am returning item and filing a claim with Amazon</li>
            <li> Too deep to be hung inside vanity door</li>
            <li> Mounts easily and my wife likes it. But be careful as the holders are plastic and hot curling items may melt it. the tray it self is metal.</li>
            <li> holds everything I use in the morning</li>
            <li> Returned to Amazon.  It was not what I expected.  Too big for my vanity.</li>
