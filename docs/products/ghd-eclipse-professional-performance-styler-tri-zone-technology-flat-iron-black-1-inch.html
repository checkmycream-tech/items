            <li>I heard good ylyhings about the straightener</li>
            <li>great feel on your hand, and very light compared to others.</li>
            <li>I really love my GHD Eclipse Straightener!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>so any kind of humidity will ruin any attempt at straightening.</li>
            <li>My hair is one of my best asset, so I really take care of it.  </li>
            <li>Does the perfect job each and every use that i have used mine so far</li>
            <li>great purchase and worth the money...</li>
            <li>But this is by far the best straightener I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, the most bazaar product I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li>The GHD eclipse is so awesome, right from the very first beep.</li>
            <li>Originally I was extremely impressed with this straightener, its sleek, it doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair, it heats up extremely fast and holds the heat; however, after about three weeks of use, I tried turning on the styler and after about 7 seconds it started to beep, a beep that would occur about every 10-15 seconds</li>
            <li>Not bad but not as good as they are saying.</li>
            <li>It is humid and very hot during the summer and my hair looks good after straightening with the GHD.</li>
            <li>I must say that this is the best iron that has held up my hair the best under this extreme weather I live in.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I am soooo glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Love love love it.  </li>
            <li>Excelent I love ghd eclipse</li>
            <li>Make sure the styler is switched off and unplugged.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love how the iron looks,</li>
            <li>My daughter and I love it but</li>
            <li>I purchased this straigtener after my Keratin Perfect one finally died on me.</li>
            <li>I cannot return it but would love to if I could.</li>
            <li>Finally, I love how sleek this straightener is,</li>
            <li>but I thought it could have a more miraculous outcome on my hair</li>
            <li>no frizz, one pass through most of the time.  </li>
            <li>Love, love, love this tool.  </li>
            <li>Also the dual voltage benefit allows me to travel with my favorite tool anywhere in the world.</li>
            <li>This is the best flat iron I have ever used!</li>
            <li>so I can quickly put it away without fear of catching something on fire.</li>
            <li>It is even better than my original Chi (which was much better than the ones they make today).  </li>
            <li>My thoughts were if I was going to spend the money, I wanted to make sure I get a really good one because I am quite particular if I am going to splurge on something.</li>
            <li>But the Neuro Styler doesn&#x27;t have this fancy wake up sound when you push the start button :)</li>
            <li>Easy ship took 2 -3 days and wife likes it.</li>
            <li>My wife, who has naturally curly red hair, says that this is the best, most efficient straightener she has ever used!</li>
            <li>Comes with a handy sleeve to cover the hot blades when you&#x27;re done, allowing me to stow it away easily in a drawer.</li>
            <li>It straightened my fine curly hair fine, but the waves did not hold.</li>
            <li>and it is making a beeping sound and flashing.</li>
            <li>Light weight.</li>
            <li>Hair straightener made a rattling sound.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve never been able to successfully straighten my hair before as it takes so long</li>
            <li>All of the GHD flat irons have the smart chip sensor in it to heat up evenly to 365 degrees, which is the perfect temperature for your hair not to be burned and the shine come through.</li>
            <li>My hair dresser recommended it as it uses a lower temperature than most flat irons but does a superior job in straightening hair.</li>
            <li>The iron heats up super fast which is great when you are retouching in the morning and do not have much time.</li>
            <li>I have the original ghd iron, but I must say that I find the eclipse to be a step up.</li>
            <li>This is my first ghd and it  was able to straighten my hair in one or two passes, but I didn&#x27;t notice a change in the amount of time.</li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>It is an amazing tool, a bit pricey, but worth every penny that any woman who wants to straighten her hair will attest to.</li>
            <li>This is by far my most favorite straighter</li>
            <li>This is by far the best flat iron you will rver purchase.  </li>
            <li>Heats up fast and was able to register it with the ghd website.</li>
            <li>I received the real deal and was able to register it on ghds website.</li>
            <li>WAY too hot for fine hair.</li>
            <li>quick on and off</li>
            <li>Plus it gives my hair that burnt smell that I can&#x27;t get rid of even if I use it lightly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair very straight.  </li>
            <li>It is VERY hot</li>
            <li>I saved so much money buying it here!!</li>
            <li>One pass and your hair is smooth, straight and silky.  </li>
            <li>An airing cupboard is ideal if you have one, alternatively, you can place the wrapped styler close by a radiator (at least 6 inches away).</li>
            <li>While they are OK, nothing compares to the GHD Eclipse Professional.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so worth the price.  </li>
            <li>well worth the money.</li>
            <li>I had read many reviews of all the different straighteners that is available, and I chose the GHD Eclipse.</li>
            <li>Leave the styler to warm back up to room temperature gradually -</li>
            <li>Though I would recommend to buy it from your hair stylist as they get it from their local beauty supply store for a better prize, plus some of the stores offer free return and exchange for the warranty period of 2 years in store, taking away the hassle of calling customer service or waiting for the replacement to arrive.</li>
            <li>It heats up SUPER FAST!</li>
            <li>My hair glides right through the straightener without any snags.</li>
            <li>It comes with a rubber heat guard you can use right after you finish using iron.</li>
            <li>I purchased this from QVC and it broke after 4 and a half months - the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light just kept blinking and wouldn&#x27;t warm up.  </li>
            <li>I plugged it in and when I turned it on it made a cute little electronic sound!</li>
            <li>Wrap your styler in a dry towel and place in a warm room.</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly and straightens smoothly to a very glossy shine.</li>
            <li>closest other flat iron I can think of is the Paul Mitchel Neuro Styler, which has also the smart chip sensor and excellent quality plates.</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li>I have fine, medium length hair that has a natural wave to it</li>
            <li>this is my first GHD product</li>
            <li>Humidity is usually above 60% most days and during the summer closer to 90%.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a pretty big chunk of change for something that either wasn&#x27;t going to work, or wasn&#x27;t going to work any better than what I had--which was a Bioionic One Pass.  </li>
            <li>This baby was ready in 5-10 seconds--no exaggeration!  </li>
            <li>I passed the iron through the first section of hair</li>
            <li>First let me describe my hair: I am in between type 3b and 3c, shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I watched all videos I could find on how to use it and most say it only requires one pass to straighten her</li>
            <li>Heats up FAST!</li>
            <li>Also handles got really hot.</li>
            <li>I love the beveled edges of the GHD eclipse as I like to make curls with it, and the titanium plates are definitely an extra benefit.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of all the buzz and reviews but if to be honest with you, it is not that different from any other more affordable straightener.</li>
            <li>and it makes me a little more comfortable that I will not accidentally burn myself when it is cooling on counter.</li>
            <li>I think in the long run it is better for my hair not to expose it to too hot temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, I have very curly mixed hair, and I am able to straighten it usually but it requires a really good tool.</li>
            <li>A co-worker had purchased one (although not the same model) and really liked it, so that made me feel a little better.  </li>
            <li>She was absolutely thrilled when I told her I had bought it for her because she had picked it out previously</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but my hair stays straight for days.</li>
            <li>It literally takes about 10 seconds to heat up, from the time I push the button to the time the alarm sounds to let me know that it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this straightener for absolutely anyone.</li>
            <li>Before this I had two Sedus, the pro and then the revolution which worked very well.</li>
            <li>The only thing is you have to let the curls set because they do fall pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>It makes a cute on and off sound which is different from other brands.</li>
            <li>( it would not do this if hair was relaxed), and I also live in humid hot Texas.</li>
            <li>Slightly better thank the chi but not sure it is worth the price difference...</li>
            <li>my hair is back to frizzie and a huge afro after as little as 10 minutes exposed to heat and humidity, but  Not with this Eclipse iron, it was able to withstand very well considering the weather.</li>
            <li>works great on my thick coarse hair!!!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about a temp setting because it&#x27;s smart enough to know the right temp.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a thousand times better than any CHI or other professional brand styler that I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li>the price is way too high.</li>
            <li>It IS easier on my hair, but it is not as hot as other GHD models so it takes more concentration to get the same look.</li>
            <li>Remove towel and use styler as normal.</li>
            <li>Was told it was normal.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s not too heavy :)</li>
            <li>I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li>I wanna see if I can change it for a new one or??</li>
            <li>My GHD Eclipse heats up very quickly and I especially like the heat-resistant glove that I can slip over the end of the flat iron.</li>
            <li>The Eclipse not only leaves my hair feeling healthy (a hard task after a lot of color-treatments) and also keeps it straight and smooth even after being outside in the humidity.</li>
            <li>I had read a lot of reviews about this flat iron, and was willing to pay the high ticket price to try it out.</li>
            <li>I do recommend this iron,and I hope it lasts a long time to make it worth the investment.</li>
            <li>This thing easily cut my styling time in half!  </li>
            <li>Because I was not prepared to make such a large purchase,  I drove home feeling</li>
            <li>I received this as a gift from a friend who purchased it directly from ghd.</li>
            <li>I allowed a rep to try them out on my hair at the beauty supply store that I frequent.</li>
            <li>my hair is natural</li>
            <li>I had the old GHD 1 inch</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t over heat my colored hair with this flat iron, and love the little silicone cover</li>
            <li>I do wish it would work in one pass to eliminate the need to run it various times and expose my hair to a lot of heat, but the final result and ability to withstand a lot of humidity and hot TX temperatures offsets that issue.</li>
            <li>, I dislike it when other brands place the button right where your fingers go when you are using iron</li>
            <li>Specifically, if the internal temperature of the styler is below 8 degrees, it will not switch on and heat up normally.</li>
            <li>You can tell it is a quality product, the materials look very nice and not cheap like other plastics used on other flat irons.</li>
            <li>If you experience this you should complete the following steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Atfer telling my husband about them, he surprised me the following week.  </li>
            <li>Some parts will go back to wavy after some time, I believe this happens because I have natural hair</li>
            <li>I did however notice how soft and silky it left my hair!</li>
            <li>But it also takes a really long time to cool down</li>
            <li>I noticed my hair was much softer after using this iron than my old one (I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li>Friends have been coming up to me asking if I&#x27;ve had a professional blow dry!</li>
            <li>I am keeping this flat iron because it is fast heating up and does tend to make my hair shiner, but not much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>I love GHD flat irons, and I bought this one because it is supposed to be less hard on the hair.</li>

            <li> It is VERY hot</li>
            <li> I saved so much money buying it here!!</li>
            <li> One pass and your hair is smooth, straight and silky.  </li>
            <li> An airing cupboard is ideal if you have one, alternatively, you can place the wrapped styler close by a radiator (at least 6 inches away).</li>
            <li> While they are OK, nothing compares to the GHD Eclipse Professional.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so worth the price.  </li>
            <li> well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had read many reviews of all the different straighteners that is available, and I chose the GHD Eclipse.</li>
            <li> Leave the styler to warm back up to room temperature gradually -</li>
            <li> Though I would recommend to buy it from your hair stylist as they get it from their local beauty supply store for a better prize, plus some of the stores offer free return and exchange for the warranty period of 2 years in store, taking away the hassle of calling customer service or waiting for the replacement to arrive.</li>
            <li> It heats up SUPER FAST!</li>
            <li> My hair glides right through the straightener without any snags.</li>
            <li> It comes with a rubber heat guard you can use right after you finish using iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from QVC and it broke after 4 and a half months - the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light just kept blinking and wouldn&#x27;t warm up.  </li>
            <li> I plugged it in and when I turned it on it made a cute little electronic sound!</li>
            <li> Wrap your styler in a dry towel and place in a warm room.</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly and straightens smoothly to a very glossy shine.</li>
            <li> closest other flat iron I can think of is the Paul Mitchel Neuro Styler, which has also the smart chip sensor and excellent quality plates.</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I have fine, medium length hair that has a natural wave to it</li>
            <li> this is my first GHD product</li>
            <li> Humidity is usually above 60% most days and during the summer closer to 90%.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a pretty big chunk of change for something that either wasn&#x27;t going to work, or wasn&#x27;t going to work any better than what I had--which was a Bioionic One Pass.  </li>
            <li> This baby was ready in 5-10 seconds--no exaggeration!  </li>
            <li> I passed the iron through the first section of hair</li>
            <li> First let me describe my hair: I am in between type 3b and 3c, shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I watched all videos I could find on how to use it and most say it only requires one pass to straighten her</li>
            <li> Heats up FAST!</li>
            <li> Also handles got really hot.</li>
            <li> I love the beveled edges of the GHD eclipse as I like to make curls with it, and the titanium plates are definitely an extra benefit.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of all the buzz and reviews but if to be honest with you, it is not that different from any other more affordable straightener.</li>
            <li> and it makes me a little more comfortable that I will not accidentally burn myself when it is cooling on counter.</li>
            <li> I think in the long run it is better for my hair not to expose it to too hot temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, I have very curly mixed hair, and I am able to straighten it usually but it requires a really good tool.</li>
            <li> A co-worker had purchased one (although not the same model) and really liked it, so that made me feel a little better.  </li>
            <li> She was absolutely thrilled when I told her I had bought it for her because she had picked it out previously</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but my hair stays straight for days.</li>
            <li> It literally takes about 10 seconds to heat up, from the time I push the button to the time the alarm sounds to let me know that it&#x27;s ready to use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this straightener for absolutely anyone.</li>
            <li> Before this I had two Sedus, the pro and then the revolution which worked very well.</li>
            <li> The only thing is you have to let the curls set because they do fall pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> It makes a cute on and off sound which is different from other brands.</li>
            <li> ( it would not do this if hair was relaxed), and I also live in humid hot Texas.</li>
            <li> Slightly better thank the chi but not sure it is worth the price difference...</li>
            <li> my hair is back to frizzie and a huge afro after as little as 10 minutes exposed to heat and humidity, but  Not with this Eclipse iron, it was able to withstand very well considering the weather.</li>
            <li> works great on my thick coarse hair!!!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to worry about a temp setting because it&#x27;s smart enough to know the right temp.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a thousand times better than any CHI or other professional brand styler that I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> the price is way too high.</li>
            <li> It IS easier on my hair, but it is not as hot as other GHD models so it takes more concentration to get the same look.</li>
            <li> Remove towel and use styler as normal.</li>
            <li> Was told it was normal.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not too heavy :)</li>
            <li> I live in Florida.  </li>
            <li> I wanna see if I can change it for a new one or??</li>
            <li> My GHD Eclipse heats up very quickly and I especially like the heat-resistant glove that I can slip over the end of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> The Eclipse not only leaves my hair feeling healthy (a hard task after a lot of color-treatments) and also keeps it straight and smooth even after being outside in the humidity.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of reviews about this flat iron, and was willing to pay the high ticket price to try it out.</li>
            <li> I do recommend this iron,and I hope it lasts a long time to make it worth the investment.</li>
            <li> This thing easily cut my styling time in half!  </li>
            <li> Because I was not prepared to make such a large purchase,  I drove home feeling</li>
            <li> I received this as a gift from a friend who purchased it directly from ghd.</li>
            <li> I allowed a rep to try them out on my hair at the beauty supply store that I frequent.</li>
            <li> my hair is natural</li>
            <li> I had the old GHD 1 inch</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t over heat my colored hair with this flat iron, and love the little silicone cover</li>
            <li> I do wish it would work in one pass to eliminate the need to run it various times and expose my hair to a lot of heat, but the final result and ability to withstand a lot of humidity and hot TX temperatures offsets that issue.</li>
            <li> , I dislike it when other brands place the button right where your fingers go when you are using iron</li>
            <li> Specifically, if the internal temperature of the styler is below 8 degrees, it will not switch on and heat up normally.</li>
            <li> You can tell it is a quality product, the materials look very nice and not cheap like other plastics used on other flat irons.</li>
            <li> If you experience this you should complete the following steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Atfer telling my husband about them, he surprised me the following week.  </li>
            <li> Some parts will go back to wavy after some time, I believe this happens because I have natural hair</li>
            <li> I did however notice how soft and silky it left my hair!</li>
            <li> But it also takes a really long time to cool down</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was much softer after using this iron than my old one (I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> Friends have been coming up to me asking if I&#x27;ve had a professional blow dry!</li>
            <li> I am keeping this flat iron because it is fast heating up and does tend to make my hair shiner, but not much better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> I love GHD flat irons, and I bought this one because it is supposed to be less hard on the hair.</li>
            <li> I live in coastal SC, humidity central, and not only does this straighten my hair in half the time it used to take</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so high tech and makes this little noise when you turn it on</li>
            <li> If you are thinking about purchasing this flat iron....</li>
            <li> I have used the flat iron about 8 times now.</li>
            <li> ; where if the device gets too cold you will not be able to use it and it then needs to be wrapped in a blanket like a child and re-heated.</li>
            <li> The purpose of this feature is to stop any kind of electrical failure due to a build up of condensation which can occur if a styler is left in a cold climate.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair iron for about 2 months now and recently when I turn it on it just beeps every few seconds and does not heat up.</li>
            <li> I did lots of research before I spent over $200 on a straightener</li>
            <li> Result was flat limp hair with no body.</li>
            <li> I have had straighteners from other places for years and years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The symptoms described above are usually associated with a feature of the ghd IV stylers called &amp;#34;Shiver Mode&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It is definitely not worth $245 or $265 price at Sephora.</li>
            <li> the other half still has some slight straightening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was always a Chi girl, but their quality has gone way down.  </li>
            <li> My hair doesn&#x27;t appear to take any damage and the amount of time I spend on my hair has been cut in half.</li>
            <li> Typically, this feature is mistaken as a fault with styler.</li>
            <li> so half</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair</li>
            <li> With other irons I have used in the past ( including chi and baby bliss)</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It heats up in seconds and straightens hair within a few run throughs.</li>
            <li> It was very expensive, but it is a very sleek design!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s impossible to get my ends straight</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase because of a few negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> but it usually requires about 3 passes to truly straighten.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s the little things!!)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a little skeptical ordering this here, especially since it&#x27;s so expensive.</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed in this product and ghd because apparently this happens all the time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the one I got was fake or refurbished, but it caught on my hair and the plates didn&#x27;t align well.</li>
            <li> I really mean it!  </li>
            <li> To make matters worse, customer service will not return emails in a timely fashion.  </li>
            <li> I went out on a limb to purchase such an expensive item and am very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and When I turn it on it makes like a weird beep.</li>
            <li> so if you have thin hair, beware!</li>
            <li> It also curls very easily, usually I&#x27;m really bad at curling my hair with a straightener</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this hyped up product.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> works great on my thick coarse hair!!!</li>
            <li> This styler is life changing. I have mixed girl frizzy hair and it&#x27;s impossible to get my ends straight but that&#x27;s not the case with this styler. This is the straightest and smoothest my hair has ever been. My hair doesn&#x27;t appear to take any damage and the amount of time I spend on my hair has been cut in half. I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> this is my first GHD product and i just dont  have words.&lt;br /&gt;😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍</li>
            <li> The god eclipse is absolutely AMAZING! Ive been waiting since February of last year to get one and once I received it in the mail i just died of excitement. Does the perfect job each and every use that i have used mine so far and i straighten my hair every day. works great with a god Air Blow Dryer!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t enough about  this styler...really makes a difference...great purchase and worth the money...&lt;br /&gt;thanks&lt;br /&gt;sue</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work after one day.  Obviously they are selling defective products.  I would not buy this product here.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best flat iron you will rver purchase.  I&#x27;ve tried Chi an T3.  While they are OK, nothing compares to the GHD Eclipse Professional.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about a temp setting because it&#x27;s smart enough to know the right temp.  One pass and your hair is smooth, straight and silky.  I live in Florida.  Humidity is usually above 60% most days and during the summer closer to 90%.  No frizz at all.  It&#x27;s so worth the price.  I never want to be without so I have two.  Love this product.</li>
            <li> I was always a Chi girl, but their quality has gone way down.  I heard good ylyhings about the straightener so I thought I would try it.  I am soooo glad I did.  It is even better than my original Chi (which was much better than the ones they make today).  But this is by far the best straightener I have ever used.  I live in coastal SC, humidity central, and not only does this straighten my hair in half the time it used to take but my hair stays straight for days. Love love love it.  It&#x27;s exepensive but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this through Amazon, but through the GHD site itself.  I was hesitant to purchase because of a few negative reviews.  I didn&#x27;t want to shell out a pretty big chunk of change for something that either wasn&#x27;t going to work, or wasn&#x27;t going to work any better than what I had--which was a Bioionic One Pass.  After thinking about it for several weeks, I visited their website saw that they were running a discount--$60.00 off of this model so I thought I would go for it.  A co-worker had purchased one (although not the same model) and really liked it, so that made me feel a little better.  I received the iron about 1 week later and couldn&#x27;t wait to try it!  I took it out of the box and was immediately impressed with the quality.  I plugged it in and when I turned it on it made a cute little electronic sound! (It&#x27;s the little things!!)  This baby was ready in 5-10 seconds--no exaggeration!  I passed the iron through the first section of hair and I was in disbelief!  It slid through my hair like butter!  Words cannot express the happiness I felt after using this just ONE time!!  When I say this will change your life....I really mean it!  This thing easily cut my styling time in half!  One pass is truly all it takes!  I noticed my hair was much softer after using this iron than my old one (I&#x27;m not sure why but I&#x27;m not gonna complain!) If you are thinking about purchasing this flat iron....stop thinking and just do it!  You will NOT regret it!</li>
            <li> I have finally decided to take the plunge to get myself a straightener. My thoughts were if I was going to spend the money, I wanted to make sure I get a really good one because I am quite particular if I am going to splurge on something. I had read many reviews of all the different straighteners that is available, and I chose the GHD Eclipse. This product have exceeded my expectations. It literally takes about 10 seconds to heat up, from the time I push the button to the time the alarm sounds to let me know that it&#x27;s ready to use. My hair glides right through the straightener without any snags. Overall, this product exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I returned this iron. I&#x27;m not sure if the one I got was fake or refurbished, but it caught on my hair and the plates didn&#x27;t align well. I returned it after 1 attempt at using it.</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY!!! I received this as a gift from a friend who purchased it directly from ghd. I have not even had it for two years and it is making a beeping sound and flashing. I tried everything they recommended to get it to stop and it still does not work. I am extremely disappointed in this product and ghd because apparently this happens all the time so you would think they&#x27;d fix it. Please don&#x27;t waste your money. I have had straighteners from other places for years and years.</li>
            <li> I purchased this from QVC and it broke after 4 and a half months - the &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; light just kept blinking and wouldn&#x27;t warm up.  I went out on a limb to purchase such an expensive item and am very disappointed.  To make matters worse, customer service will not return emails in a timely fashion.  I&#x27;ve been waiting three days for a response.</li>
            <li> Excelent I love ghd eclipse</li>
            <li> Not bad but not as good as they are saying. Slightly better thank the chi but not sure it is worth the price difference...i bought 150$ chi.</li>
            <li> My wife is so happy with this and she had no problem with the product registration</li>
            <li> Originally I was extremely impressed with this straightener, its sleek, it doesn&#x27;t pull out your hair, it heats up extremely fast and holds the heat; however, after about three weeks of use, I tried turning on the styler and after about 7 seconds it started to beep, a beep that would occur about every 10-15 seconds all while NOT heating up. I looked into this issue online only to find that the product has a &amp;#34;feature&amp;#34; called &amp;#34;Shiver Mode&amp;#34; where if the device gets too cold you will not be able to use it and it then needs to be wrapped in a blanket like a child and re-heated. My apartment where I keep it is room temperature, not the arctic. I have no idea why it is in shiver mode and no matter what i do, i cannot get it to come out of &amp;#34;shiver mode&amp;#34;. Honestly, the most bazaar product I&#x27;ve ever bought. Do not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The symptoms described above are usually associated with a feature of the ghd IV stylers called &amp;#34;Shiver Mode&amp;#34;. The purpose of this feature is to stop any kind of electrical failure due to a build up of condensation which can occur if a styler is left in a cold climate.  Specifically, if the internal temperature of the styler is below 8 degrees, it will not switch on and heat up normally. Typically, this feature is mistaken as a fault with styler. If you experience this you should complete the following steps:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;• Make sure the styler is switched off and unplugged.&lt;br /&gt;• Wrap your styler in a dry towel and place in a warm room. An airing cupboard is ideal if you have one, alternatively, you can place the wrapped styler close by a radiator (at least 6 inches away). *&lt;br /&gt;• Leave the styler to warm back up to room temperature gradually - this make take anywhere from 20 - 90 minutes depending on start temperature.&lt;br /&gt;• Remove towel and use styler as normal.</li>
            <li> I really love my GHD Eclipse Straightener! It&#x27;s a thousand times better than any CHI or other professional brand styler that I&#x27;ve owned!</li>
            <li> My wife, who has naturally curly red hair, says that this is the best, most efficient straightener she has ever used! She was absolutely thrilled when I told her I had bought it for her because she had picked it out previously and I saw the ad on her desk. It is an amazing tool, a bit pricey, but worth every penny that any woman who wants to straighten her hair will attest to.</li>
            <li> I had this for about 2months already and When I turn it on it makes like a weird beep. I wanna see if I can change it for a new one or??..... if u can please contact me if you can Georgeblive3416@gmail.com&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> After months of use, no complains at all (According to a friend this was a gift, just wanted to drop by and leave a review).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair iron for about 2 months now and recently when I turn it on it just beeps every few seconds and does not heat up. Is this something I can fix or is this a defect? I&#x27;d like to actually be able to use it since it was so expensive.</li>
            <li> Love them! I have the original ghd iron, but I must say that I find the eclipse to be a step up. I allowed a rep to try them out on my hair at the beauty supply store that I frequent. Because I was not prepared to make such a large purchase,  I drove home feeling that section  he straighten the hold ride home. Atfer telling my husband about them, he surprised me the following week.  I have to tell you if you can afford them, treat yourself to them. Awesome irons.</li>
            <li> Great job! Very fast delivery.</li>
            <li> I had read a lot of reviews about this flat iron, and was willing to pay the high ticket price to try it out. I have used the flat iron about 8 times now. First let me describe my hair: I am in between type 3b and 3c, shoulder length. I used to relax my hair chemically but have not in about one year so half my hair is natural the other half still has some slight straightening.&lt;br /&gt;The iron itself- I love how the iron looks, great feel on your hand, and very light compared to others. The iron heats up super fast which is great when you are retouching in the morning and do not have much time. It comes with a rubber heat guard you can use right after you finish using iron. I feel it protects the iron when you store it and it makes me a little more comfortable that I will not accidentally burn myself when it is cooling on counter. You can tell it is a quality product, the materials look very nice and not cheap like other plastics used on other flat irons. It makes a cute on and off sound which is different from other brands. I also like where the on off button is located, I dislike it when other brands place the button right where your fingers go when you are using iron and you accidentally turn off the appliance, you wont have that problem with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The function - I watched all videos I could find on how to use it and most say it only requires one pass to straighten her, I did not find this to be the case every time. I do not know if my hair is just too curly but it usually requires about 3 passes to truly straighten. Some parts will go back to wavy after some time, I believe this happens because I have natural hair ( it would not do this if hair was relaxed), and I also live in humid hot Texas. I must say that this is the best iron that has held up my hair the best under this extreme weather I live in. It is humid and very hot during the summer and my hair looks good after straightening with the GHD. With other irons I have used in the past ( including chi and baby bliss) my hair is back to frizzie and a huge afro after as little as 10 minutes exposed to heat and humidity, but  Not with this Eclipse iron, it was able to withstand very well considering the weather. I feel this iron is not as hot as others I have used in the past and you cannot control the temperature, but I think in the long run it is better for my hair not to expose it to too hot temperatures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary I do recommend this iron,and I hope it lasts a long time to make it worth the investment. I do wish it would work in one pass to eliminate the need to run it various times and expose my hair to a lot of heat, but the final result and ability to withstand a lot of humidity and hot TX temperatures offsets that issue.</li>
            <li> My daughter and I love it but nowhere in the info does it say what the temperature is nor is there a setting  for temperature control. Is it the same for everyone? How does it work?what is the tsmperature?</li>
            <li> I purchased this straigtener after my Keratin Perfect one finally died on me. I would recommend this straightener for absolutely anyone. I have fine, medium length hair that has a natural wave to it so any kind of humidity will ruin any attempt at straightening. The Eclipse not only leaves my hair feeling healthy (a hard task after a lot of color-treatments) and also keeps it straight and smooth even after being outside in the humidity. PERFECT purchase!</li>
            <li> Easy ship took 2 -3 days and wife likes it.</li>
            <li> Light weight. Heats up FAST!</li>
            <li> I am actually upset by this product. I bought it because of all the buzz and reviews but if to be honest with you, it is not that different from any other more affordable straightener. It is definitely not worth $245 or $265 price at Sephora. It is VERY hot so if you have thin hair, beware! Plus it gives my hair that burnt smell that I can&#x27;t get rid of even if I use it lightly, and it doesn&#x27;t make my hair very straight.  I cannot return it but would love to if I could. Very disappointed in this hyped up product.</li>
            <li> Hair straightener made a rattling sound. Was told it was normal. I paid a lot for the straightener! I don&#x27;t want it rattling. Also handles got really hot.</li>
            <li> I like that I can&#x27;t over heat my colored hair with this flat iron, and love the little silicone cover so I can quickly put it away without fear of catching something on fire.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and was able to register it with the ghd website. Works great!</li>
            <li> I am keeping this flat iron because it is fast heating up and does tend to make my hair shiner, but not much better than my old one.  the price is way too high.</li>
            <li> I love GHD flat irons, and I bought this one because it is supposed to be less hard on the hair. It IS easier on my hair, but it is not as hot as other GHD models so it takes more concentration to get the same look. But it still does the job in the same amount of time, and I have the hardest to straighten hair that me or my stylist have ever seen.</li>
            <li> It straightened my fine curly hair fine, but the waves did not hold. Result was flat limp hair with no body.</li>
            <li> This is by far my most favorite straighter I have ever owned!!! It is easier on my hair as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was a little skeptical ordering this here, especially since it&#x27;s so expensive. But I have it a shot and hoped for the best, and I&#x27;m glad I did. I received the real deal and was able to register it on ghds website. I saved so much money buying it here!! Also, I have very curly mixed hair, and I am able to straighten it usually but it requires a really good tool. Before this I had two Sedus, the pro and then the revolution which worked very well. This is my first ghd and it  was able to straighten my hair in one or two passes, but I didn&#x27;t notice a change in the amount of time. I did however notice how soft and silky it left my hair! It also curls very easily, usually I&#x27;m really bad at curling my hair with a straightener but this one is a dream! The only thing is you have to let the curls set because they do fall pretty quickly. Finally, I love how sleek this straightener is, it&#x27;s so high tech and makes this little noise when you turn it on and when it&#x27;s heated up. It heats up SUPER FAST! But it also takes a really long time to cool down so keep that in mind so you don&#x27;t burn yourself!</li>
            <li> I have long thick wavy hair and I&#x27;ve never been able to successfully straighten my hair before as it takes so long and I don&#x27;t have the patience for it. I had the old GHD 1 inch and my arm would ache after using it. The GHD eclipse is so awesome, right from the very first beep. It heats up quickly and straightens smoothly to a very glossy shine. Friends have been coming up to me asking if I&#x27;ve had a professional blow dry! Comes with a handy sleeve to cover the hot blades when you&#x27;re done, allowing me to stow it away easily in a drawer. This was the best purchase ever!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this.  I was looking for something that was quality and could work both in the US and overseas without needing a transformer.  This fits the bill!</li>
            <li> This is the best flat iron I have ever used! My hair dresser recommended it as it uses a lower temperature than most flat irons but does a superior job in straightening hair.</li>
            <li> I did lots of research before I spent over $200 on a straightener and I was not disappointed. My GHD Eclipse heats up very quickly and I especially like the heat-resistant glove that I can slip over the end of the flat iron.</li>
            <li> This burnt my hair, severely damaged it. &amp; caused a lot of hair loss. WAY too hot for fine hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this hair straightener for my daughter. She loves it. It heats up in seconds and straightens hair within a few run throughs. I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> I did like this hair straightener but I thought it could have a more miraculous outcome on my hair then it did (especially for the price). My Babyliss Titanium works just as well so I decided to return this product. It was very expensive, but it is a very sleek design!</li>
            <li> excellent product. no frizz, one pass through most of the time.  quick on and off</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this tool.  My hair is one of my best asset, so I really take care of it.  The GHD is perfect for my hair.  Even my friends had to have their own when I showed them my GHD!!!</li>
            <li> All of the GHD flat irons have the smart chip sensor in it to heat up evenly to 365 degrees, which is the perfect temperature for your hair not to be burned and the shine come through. I love the beveled edges of the GHD eclipse as I like to make curls with it, and the titanium plates are definitely an extra benefit. Also the dual voltage benefit allows me to travel with my favorite tool anywhere in the world. And it&#x27;s not too heavy :)&lt;br /&gt;The closest other flat iron I can think of is the Paul Mitchel Neuro Styler, which has also the smart chip sensor and excellent quality plates. But the Neuro Styler doesn&#x27;t have this fancy wake up sound when you push the start button :) I also like the auto shut off function of the GHD as I sometimes forget to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a great warranty, excellent customer service and the product quality is awesome. Though I would recommend to buy it from your hair stylist as they get it from their local beauty supply store for a better prize, plus some of the stores offer free return and exchange for the warranty period of 2 years in store, taking away the hassle of calling customer service or waiting for the replacement to arrive.</li>
