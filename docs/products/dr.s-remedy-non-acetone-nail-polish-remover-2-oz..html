            <li>My nails look more moist &amp; shiny after using but not oily.</li>
            <li>Better for my cats, too, when they come over to see what I&#x27;m doing.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see a difference, but I wanted a non acetone polish remover just to be safe.</li>
            <li>I love this non-acetone nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>I bought this product since it was supposed to be better than the over-the-counter nail polish removers.</li>

            <li>The polish removes quickly and easily, a great improvement over the regular remover.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy that I was able to find nail polish remover without all of the harsh chemicals.</li>

            <li>I love all of Dr. Remedy&#x27;s products; his nail colors are beautiful and long lasting.</li>
            <li>I first saw this nail polish remover in a catalog and checked to see if Amazon had it, and of course it was available.  </li>
            <li>so even if it was effective It would evaporate before next time</li>
            <li>Even so, it is totally worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>It is a smaller size bottle for a bit more money, but if I can use a more enviromnentally friendly product and a healthier one, then it&#x27;s worth the extra cost.  </li>

            <li>I really like this stuff.</li>

            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>It does take a little more work than regular polish remover to get the nail polish off, but I think the extra effort is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>My podiatrist recommended Dr.&#x27;s Remedy clear polish for my toenail fungus (along with medicine).</li>
            <li>You dont need much so this will last a while.</li>

            <li>For all the money I spent on this product, I got about half the bottle, so it wasn&#x27;t worth it for me.</li>

            <li> It seems expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Took it to my nail salon and asked my nail tech to use it instead of his usual remover.</li>
            <li> Not the usual odor of acetone that feel like its stingy your brain.  </li>
            <li> It worked well and wasn&#x27;t as hard on my skin as acetone polish remover.</li>
            <li> The package came damaged -- there was a crack in the neck of the bottle, which I noticed too late -- once the nail polish remover started evaporating.</li>

            <li> I use sparingly as it is expensive for a 2 oz.</li>

            <li> Not ineffective at all used 85% of it to take  nail polish off my hands the cap was so hard to remove had to use a monkey wrench which crack the cap so even if it was effective It would evaporate before next time I needed to use again when I purchased it was more 9.95  not worth it more of wasted money. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Excellent nail polish remover.  A tiny bit goes a long way. I love the fact that it has tea tree oil and other natural ingredients to keep my nails healthy.  Glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Great product when you have toe fungas. Love using it with that tea tree oil in it because I know it is safe for my toes.</li>
            <li> I order two of the same item.  One Bottle was complete empty with a broken lid, and the other bottle was not sealed. It was poorly packaged and looked like it had been used.  Will not order again from this seller.</li>
            <li> It is good, you don&#x27;t have have to use a lot. Also it does not have the smell like the other remover.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. My boyfriend always complains when I paint or remove my nail polish due to the smells but this kind doesnt have a strong smell to it. You dont need much so this will last a while. It seems to be more healthy on my nails as well. Great product.</li>
            <li> Works well but I had to use a lot to remove my nail polish.  I will keep using it though since it seems to be healthier for my nails.</li>
            <li> Great polish remover!  I love all of Dr. Remedy&#x27;s products; his nail colors are beautiful and long lasting.</li>
            <li> It worked well and wasn&#x27;t as hard on my skin as acetone polish remover. I gave it four stars because it still has a really strong stinky smell, but it&#x27;s not worse than other removers. I would recommend it as an alternative to acetone. It seems expensive, but a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Best remover ever.  My toenail looks better.  Not drying at all.  Was delivered ahead of schedule and well wrapped.  Wish it came in larger bottles.  Thank you</li>
            <li> This remover does a great job of removing nail polish and does not damage my nails.  I have sensitive skin/nails and all other removers I have used are too harsh for me.  This stuff works great!</li>
            <li> Same volatile, toxic ingredients as drug store variety, only FIVE times the cost.  Ohh but wait, Dr&#x27;s Scam adds a few drops of snake oil, and vitamins.  And to think this product is promoted in doctors offices and treatment rooms!!</li>
            <li> nice product. pleased!</li>
            <li> I prefer using this remover than acetone.  The scent is more tolerable, it removes polish more easily, and I hope it helps to eliminate my nail problem.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this polish remover--takes polish off much better than standard acetone removers and my nails are visibly healthier after a few short weeks of using it (also using Dr. Remedy&#x27;s nail polish).  I just ordered three more bottles so I don&#x27;t find myself without it!  I did take off one star for the price though--a little remover does go a super long way, but the bottle is small ( only 2oz) and it is $6 or so, depending where you get it.  Even so, it is totally worth the cost.  Truly one of the most surprisingly good products I&#x27;ve bought in a while.</li>
            <li> Never used it before now, but seems to take polish off easier  I am still &amp;#34;learning&amp;#34; about the polish and remover (as the polish comes off almost too easily) sometimes opting for my old remover after.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always looking for better nail care products. I am very pleased with how gentle , thorough and easy this is to use. My nails look more moist &amp; shiny after using but not oily. I ran out &amp; used another product and it took my nails 3 weeks to recover from the drying. Now I order 2 bottle at a time so there&#x27;s no running out.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived on time, packed well &amp; as described.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really happy that I was able to find nail polish remover without all of the harsh chemicals. It does take a little more work than regular polish remover to get the nail polish off, but I think the extra effort is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I first saw this nail polish remover in a catalog and checked to see if Amazon had it, and of course it was available.  It originates from Footsmart and contains Tea Tree Oil, Wheat Protein, Vitamins C and E, and Garlic Bulb.  I&#x27;d rather use something like this than the regular acetone nail polish removers that just about take my breath away while using them.  They also tend to dry out my nails.  I don&#x27;t keep polish on my nails all the time, but when I want to polish them, I wanted a good remover to first of all clean up the mistakes I make doing my own nails and to have a good remover as well when I want to take the color off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is advertised as helping to prevent fungus infections around the nails.  I don&#x27;t have it and I sure don&#x27;t want it!  It is a smaller size bottle for a bit more money, but if I can use a more enviromnentally friendly product and a healthier one, then it&#x27;s worth the extra cost.  Better for my cats, too, when they come over to see what I&#x27;m doing.  They won&#x27;t squint their eyes and take off running like they do when they smell acetone!</li>
            <li> Took it to my nail salon and asked my nail tech to use it instead of his usual remover. He did not complain.</li>
            <li> My podiatrist recommended Dr.&#x27;s Remedy clear polish for my toenail fungus (along with medicine). I don&#x27;t see a difference, but I wanted a non acetone polish remover just to be safe.</li>
            <li> love this product for the quality but its expensive, Good for nails , will buy again.</li>
            <li> I love this non-acetone nail polish remover. My nails appear stronger and my cuticles are softer and not as dry. I use sparingly as it is expensive for a 2 oz. nail polish remover. Removes Dr. Remedy clear nontoxic polish easily.</li>
            <li> Does the job but the smell is even stronger than regular nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I bought this product since it was supposed to be better than the over-the-counter nail polish removers. Although it does a good job removing the polish, the skin and cuticles turn white and look like they are extremely dry. Of course I immediately wash my hands and put on a very good mosturizer afterwards. I will not purchase this product in the future.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent and very gentle. I will order it again. It was packaged with care and that matters! It came in perfect condition. Thank you all!</li>
            <li> Wow!  This is product is great.  Not the usual odor of acetone that feel like its stingy your brain.  Not sure what the difference is from Acetone (normal stuff) and this product, which has Ethyl Acetate, but it isn&#x27;t nearly as offensive.  The polish removes quickly and easily, a great improvement over the regular remover.  I don&#x27;t mind the cost increase due to these pluses. I am very happy to find this product.</li>
            <li> Same with this one and the nail polish  (color)</li>
            <li> it smelled terribly and didn&#x27;t remove my nail polish.</li>
