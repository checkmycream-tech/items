            <li>This is an excellent daily moisturizer!  </li>
            <li>Nothing more is needed but rouge and lipstick.</li>

            <li>I love Image Skin Prevention and have been using it for about 3 years.  </li>
            <li>I love this tinted moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use this in place of liquid foundation sometimes and love it.</li>
            <li>does not make me breakout (I&#x27;m prone) and I love the bit of color it has.  </li>
            <li>If I want more &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll mix in a bit of powdered foundation with it.</li>
            <li>I have medium skin tone and it was more of a primer.</li>
            <li>Love the Image product line</li>
            <li>I LOVE this Moisturizer</li>
            <li>I have never had so many compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Love Image skin care products - always moisturizers without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>So glad Amazon carries products of this nature.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Amazon is also a great place to shop, easy fast and painless.</li>
            <li>Keeps my 50-something face perfectly moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li>This one has a light tint that I like which gives me a more refreshed looked.</li>
            <li>i have dark skin and it works great on me and my daughter who has fair skin.</li>
            <li>Awesome, I have been using this along with other image products for 2 years now and can see a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer, leaves a natural teint, light formula.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy it again, very satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li>This is hands down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li>The sunscreen works fine</li>
            <li>Perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to wear makeup but would like a little color and moister.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of image products.  </li>
            <li>My hands get very greasy after applying this product, can&#x27;t get it off by washing with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li>Heavy, greasy, shiny, not up to the standards of all of the wonderful Image skin care products!!!!</li>
            <li>the coverage was great and it felt like silk on my face .this is my second tube</li>
            <li>but this is no longer available for the tinted.</li>
            <li>People remark how smooth my skin looks...</li>
            <li>It sits on top of your skin without being absorbed.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product for those of us who don&#x27;t put sun screen on regularly.  </li>
            <li>Feels light on the face too.</li>
            <li>The &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is very transparent, yet works to even skin tone out quite nicely.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as the old formula was.</li>
            <li>Very nice facial cleanser</li>
            <li>I first got it at a spa in Phoenix and it was a lot more money than what Amazon charged, so I bought two.  </li>
            <li>Super light weight.</li>
            <li>I would have given this product only one star but for the fact that it is pleasantly scented for a sunscreen product.  </li>
            <li>And the price is right too!</li>
            <li>It also protects my skin with adequate protection.</li>
            <li>Love the light coverage..and gives natural look.</li>
            <li>Received product quickly.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a high SPF &amp; does not leave my face feeling oily at all.  </li>
            <li>I first bought this tinted moisturizer at the skin doctor office and I loved it instantly.</li>
            <li>So light and really evens skin tone.</li>
            <li>This is great as an everyday lotion.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the feel of this on my skin.  </li>
            <li>It is just enough to cover any imperfections and it&#x27;s nice knowing</li>
            <li>It actually blends in nicely with my skin tone and has yet to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li>I definitely like this product,  it gives my skin a nice hue.</li>
            <li>I have been using I Image facial products for several years and they are by far the best ever!  </li>
            <li>but I believe this would work from fair skinned people to dark complexions.</li>
            <li>I love this tinted sunscreen, but I am almost as fair as a red head, so this tinted sunscreen is too dark by itself.  </li>
            <li>Wife enjoys this product very much.</li>
            <li>I like the Image products very much.  </li>
            <li>so I love the having the tint--evens out the skin tone while being protective at the same time.</li>
            <li>I was only able to purchase at a day spa before</li>
            <li>This older woman appreciates the effortlessness of applying this product quickly.</li>
            <li>Second purchase of this moisturizer and love it.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t hurt that its a much better price through amazon than through a local retailer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and love it.  </li>
            <li>I like this product because it protects as well as providing a light sheer tint.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for about a year and really like it.</li>
            <li>It matches very closely.</li>
            <li>Really like the feel and that it&#x27;s tinted, it looks like foundation</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t cover up as much as foundation.</li>
            <li>but there isn&#x27;t much tint to it for me.</li>
            <li>My face has improve so much since using thia line (acne).</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I had never ordered the tinted, and I find that it has too much tint for me.  </li>
            <li>I use this product everyday, it covers nice and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel smooth and clean and gives me just a little tint and cover.</li>
            <li>Secondly, it has a significant orange tint that creates a quite unnatural finish.  </li>
            <li>The tint may look dark for some at first, but it spreads easy &amp; you can&#x27;t see it when you&#x27;re done at all.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>I love this slight coverage with sun screen moisture.  </li>
            <li>I just started using this particular product about 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend this skin care line, and this product in particular.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying this product for its high zinc, you will no longer be getting that benefit from this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I really liked this moisturizer initially and bought it quite a few times because the zinc oxide in the product was 18%.</li>
            <li>I only give it 4 stars because only one tint shade is available.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy mess, and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li>The packaging was factory sealed &amp; not past expiration.  </li>
            <li>This SPF moisturizer took me a very long time to find (no white cast with high zinc and does not go on super greasy).</li>
            <li>I wear it in the summer and only need a little powder on top to set it.</li>
            <li>It was very high for an SPF moisturizer and this tinted version does not leave a white cast unlike the non-tinted version.</li>
            <li>Leave my skin soft and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>Vital C Anti Aging Serum and Cleanser.</li>
            <li>Provides just enough coverage that you dont need makeup plus very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and it is tinted which I completely need</li>
            <li>but with my sensitive skin it broke me out.</li>
            <li>Not for sensitive breakout prone skin</li>
            <li>So far there is no other product / line that will make me chanche.</li>
            <li>It goes on light, and seems a little dark at first</li>
            <li>I have oily skin and the moisturizer leaves a very greasy wet feeling.</li>
            <li>Not runny or too thick, goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li>My old face (65 years) loves the stuff - it is a little costly, but if you check Amazon periodically you can find decent prices.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this Moisturizer</li>
            <li> I have never had so many compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Love Image skin care products - always moisturizers without feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> So glad Amazon carries products of this nature.  </li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Amazon is also a great place to shop, easy fast and painless.</li>
            <li> Keeps my 50-something face perfectly moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> This one has a light tint that I like which gives me a more refreshed looked.</li>
            <li> i have dark skin and it works great on me and my daughter who has fair skin.</li>
            <li> Awesome, I have been using this along with other image products for 2 years now and can see a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, leaves a natural teint, light formula.</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy it again, very satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!!</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works fine</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to wear makeup but would like a little color and moister.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of image products.  </li>
            <li> My hands get very greasy after applying this product, can&#x27;t get it off by washing with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> Heavy, greasy, shiny, not up to the standards of all of the wonderful Image skin care products!!!!</li>
            <li> the coverage was great and it felt like silk on my face .this is my second tube</li>
            <li> but this is no longer available for the tinted.</li>
            <li> People remark how smooth my skin looks...</li>
            <li> It sits on top of your skin without being absorbed.  </li>
            <li> This is a great product for those of us who don&#x27;t put sun screen on regularly.  </li>
            <li> Feels light on the face too.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is very transparent, yet works to even skin tone out quite nicely.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as the old formula was.</li>
            <li> Very nice facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I first got it at a spa in Phoenix and it was a lot more money than what Amazon charged, so I bought two.  </li>
            <li> Super light weight.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product only one star but for the fact that it is pleasantly scented for a sunscreen product.  </li>
            <li> And the price is right too!</li>
            <li> It also protects my skin with adequate protection.</li>
            <li> Love the light coverage..and gives natural look.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a high SPF &amp; does not leave my face feeling oily at all.  </li>
            <li> I first bought this tinted moisturizer at the skin doctor office and I loved it instantly.</li>
            <li> So light and really evens skin tone.</li>
            <li> This is great as an everyday lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the feel of this on my skin.  </li>
            <li> It is just enough to cover any imperfections and it&#x27;s nice knowing</li>
            <li> It actually blends in nicely with my skin tone and has yet to irritate my skin.</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product,  it gives my skin a nice hue.</li>
            <li> I have been using I Image facial products for several years and they are by far the best ever!  </li>
            <li> but I believe this would work from fair skinned people to dark complexions.</li>
            <li> I love this tinted sunscreen, but I am almost as fair as a red head, so this tinted sunscreen is too dark by itself.  </li>
            <li> Wife enjoys this product very much.</li>
            <li> I like the Image products very much.  </li>
            <li> so I love the having the tint--evens out the skin tone while being protective at the same time.</li>
            <li> I was only able to purchase at a day spa before</li>
            <li> This older woman appreciates the effortlessness of applying this product quickly.</li>
            <li> Second purchase of this moisturizer and love it.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt that its a much better price through amazon than through a local retailer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and love it.  </li>
            <li> I like this product because it protects as well as providing a light sheer tint.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and really like it.</li>
            <li> It matches very closely.</li>
            <li> Really like the feel and that it&#x27;s tinted, it looks like foundation</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t cover up as much as foundation.</li>
            <li> but there isn&#x27;t much tint to it for me.</li>
            <li> My face has improve so much since using thia line (acne).</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I had never ordered the tinted, and I find that it has too much tint for me.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday, it covers nice and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel smooth and clean and gives me just a little tint and cover.</li>
            <li> Secondly, it has a significant orange tint that creates a quite unnatural finish.  </li>
            <li> The tint may look dark for some at first, but it spreads easy &amp; you can&#x27;t see it when you&#x27;re done at all.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I love this slight coverage with sun screen moisture.  </li>
            <li> I just started using this particular product about 2 weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend this skin care line, and this product in particular.  </li>
            <li> If you are buying this product for its high zinc, you will no longer be getting that benefit from this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I really liked this moisturizer initially and bought it quite a few times because the zinc oxide in the product was 18%.</li>
            <li> I only give it 4 stars because only one tint shade is available.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy mess, and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> The packaging was factory sealed &amp; not past expiration.  </li>
            <li> This SPF moisturizer took me a very long time to find (no white cast with high zinc and does not go on super greasy).</li>
            <li> I wear it in the summer and only need a little powder on top to set it.</li>
            <li> It was very high for an SPF moisturizer and this tinted version does not leave a white cast unlike the non-tinted version.</li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft and lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> Vital C Anti Aging Serum and Cleanser.</li>
            <li> Provides just enough coverage that you dont need makeup plus very moisturizing.</li>
            <li> and it is tinted which I completely need</li>
            <li> but with my sensitive skin it broke me out.</li>
            <li> Not for sensitive breakout prone skin</li>
            <li> So far there is no other product / line that will make me chanche.</li>
            <li> It goes on light, and seems a little dark at first</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and the moisturizer leaves a very greasy wet feeling.</li>
            <li> Not runny or too thick, goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li> My old face (65 years) loves the stuff - it is a little costly, but if you check Amazon periodically you can find decent prices.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a few days and so far I like it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not big on heavy make up, but big on sunscreen</li>
            <li> I wear it every single day.</li>
            <li> I have very pale &amp; sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Not much coverage at all, have to mix some liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I received the a recent order of the product, the ingredients (drug facts) were not included on the back like it did on the old bottle.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Despite the claim of being &#x27;oil-free&#x27; the product is extremely greasy.  </li>
            <li> I use other Image products an like them....</li>
            <li> just a little wet looking on the face.</li>
            <li> This is not a product that is made for dark skinned women..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still more greasy than I&#x27;d prefer so use it without any moisturizer or base.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell-not too overbearing.  </li>
            <li> Very dark reddish colored tint and too greasy.</li>
            <li> thank you for being there to help a desperate older woman!</li>
            <li> Not a very good tinted moisturizer as it leaves a film and not much blending or coverage of tinting!  </li>
            <li> I feel like it has contributed to a few break outs on my face.</li>
            <li> but as your skin absorbs it, it fades in a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Not greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> I have used it for a few years.  </li>
            <li> My go-to face moisturizer; slightly heavy yet not acne causing.</li>
            <li> I prefer the SPF 50 version which contains less zinc (therefore less whitening), is less thick, and doesn&#x27;t seem as &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; (which is the waterproofing).  </li>
            <li> 1st thing I put on my face everyday.</li>
            <li> It leaves a moist feeling and a slight tint!  </li>
            <li> it leaves you looking extremely pale..</li>
            <li> I have used it in the past, and that&#x27;s why I ordered it again.  </li>
            <li> I usually get it at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> As I mentioned, I have very pale skin</li>
            <li> My skin is so hard to match with the name brand cover ups</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed with this product as it leaves my face a bit greasy, so I mainly use it on my neck.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The moisturizer is old (there is on expiration date on it) but the substance is separating. :(</li>
            <li> It gives a little tint to your skin without looking fake.</li>
            <li> the zinc oxide for the tinted moisturizer is just a mere 6% ([...]</li>
            <li> wrong color match</li>
            <li> Looked like a fake tan</li>
            <li> I went to their site and to my disappointment,</li>
            <li> I have medium skin tone and was afraid of the color not matching my skin tone, but gave this sunscreen a shot.</li>
            <li> What a waist :(</li>
            <li> Even though l intended to use this product alone, I can&#x27;t imagine using this as a base under makeup either.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is an excellent daily moisturizer!  Goes on very smooth and silky and gives uniform coverage.  I also use a foundation over it, but for some it may not be necessary.  I have been using I Image facial products for several years and they are by far the best ever!  Amazon has the best prices for these products.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Leaves my face smooth and covers blemishes very nicely.</li>
            <li> Not much coverage at all, have to mix some liquid foundation. My hands get very greasy after applying this product, can&#x27;t get it off by washing with soap and warm water. I&#x27;m not purchasing this again.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion!  So light and really evens skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Use it every day and no foundation needed.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> I cannot do without this sunscreen which also serves as my make up. Nothing more is needed but rouge and lipstick.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the old formula was. But I will use this bottle and see how it goes.</li>
            <li> Coverage isn&#x27;t so good for me. I have better luck with another drugstore product. It does have a nice texture, no smell.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and the moisturizer leaves a very greasy wet feeling. I feel like it has contributed to a few break outs on my face. I do not like this product.</li>
            <li> This stuff is good but as good as the old one</li>
            <li> Heavy, greasy, shiny, not up to the standards of all of the wonderful Image skin care products!!!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Would highly recommend this skin care line, and this product in particular.  The tint noticeably balances your skin immediately.</li>
            <li> Very nice facial cleanser</li>
            <li> I am sold on the Image line of products. My old face (65 years) loves the stuff - it is a little costly, but if you check Amazon periodically you can find decent prices.</li>
            <li> Prompt service, as advertised.</li>
            <li> Just start using this product and like it a lot.  I&#x27;m not big on heavy make up, but big on sunscreen so I love the having the tint--evens out the skin tone while being protective at the same time.</li>
            <li> I first bought this tinted moisturizer at the skin doctor office and I loved it instantly. the coverage was great and it felt like silk on my face .this is my second tube and I will always use it I love it.</li>
            <li> I love Image products. I use this moisturizer every morning and every evening! It&#x27;s perfect!</li>
            <li> Great product!  I&#x27;ve used it for years!</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t like  to use foundation. Image&#x27;s tinted moisturizer is a great substitute.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff but I got something else from you that I didn&#x27;t order-baby banana toothbrush for infants??!!!!! I did not order it..</li>
            <li> love this product.  Keeps the sun from damaging your face.  Wont go to the beach without it.</li>
            <li> I have sun spots &amp; this helps blend them &amp; gives me protection. I wish the tint was darker like the one I brought a couple years ago.</li>
            <li> Perfect, light, blends beautifully. This product does not feel greasy - it makes a great sun-screen foundation.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by my esthetician. It is a nice light coverage. If I want a fuller coverage I add some mineral powder.</li>
            <li> Great product. My dermathologist recommended. Loved it!</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of image products.  I use this product everyday, it covers nice and is not greasy.  Does not have that sunsreen smell which is wonderful!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because I wanted to let consumers know that the zinc oxide content has changed for this product. I really liked this moisturizer initially and bought it quite a few times because the zinc oxide in the product was 18%. It was very high for an SPF moisturizer and this tinted version does not leave a white cast unlike the non-tinted version. This SPF moisturizer took me a very long time to find (no white cast with high zinc and does not go on super greasy). Unfortunately, when I received the a recent order of the product, the ingredients (drug facts) were not included on the back like it did on the old bottle. I went to their site and to my disappointment, the zinc oxide for the tinted moisturizer is just a mere 6% ([...] If you are buying this product for its high zinc, you will no longer be getting that benefit from this product. The non-tinted, hydrating formula still contains the 18% but this is no longer available for the tinted. I&#x27;m now giving it 3 stars as, in my opinion, it lost a very important feature.</li>
            <li> Great product. Makes my skin feel smooth and clean and gives me just a little tint and cover. Not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it protects as well as providing a light sheer tint.</li>
            <li> If you have to have a tint this is the one!</li>
            <li> I use this daily, it is awesome!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and love it.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy mess, and is easy to remove.</li>
            <li> Not a very good tinted moisturizer as it leaves a film and not much blending or coverage of tinting!  Better products and coverage out there (for example clarions)</li>
            <li> This product make me look younger. I am no longer waering makeup.  I totally recommended this skincare line..</li>
            <li> Awesome, I have been using this along with other image products for 2 years now and can see a difference with my skin.</li>
            <li> I love Image products. Great for summer. Will definitely but it again. Great product</li>
            <li> I loved this product. I have used it in the past, and that&#x27;s why I ordered it again.  It is a wonderful moisturizer. The best I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the feel of this on my skin.  I have received compliments about my skin but it feels like makeup.  The packaging was factory sealed &amp; not past expiration.  Seller integrity legit.</li>
            <li> Love it. It is a moisturizer, sunscreen and has tint so I do not have to wear any foundation.  Three products in one.  Leave my skin soft and lasts all day.  I am so glad I found it on line.  I was only able to purchase at a day spa before</li>
            <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. Super light weight. I don&#x27;t use foundation, so if you are looking for something that is like foundation, this isn&#x27;t it. It gives a little tint to your skin without looking fake. Doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.</li>
            <li> Adds color, moisture and sunscreen in seconds. Throw it on to run to the store. This older woman appreciates the effortlessness of applying this product quickly. You can put mineral powder and blush over it and it looks great. I only give it 4 stars because only one tint shade is available.</li>
            <li> I love Image Skin Prevention and have been using it for about 3 years.  People remark how smooth my skin looks...looks like I&#x27;m no wearing any makeup.  Then, my dermatologist that I was getting a facial said they weren&#x27;t carrying it anymore.  So, I turned to Amazon...thank you for being there to help a desperate older woman!</li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer.  I wear it in the summer and only need a little powder on top to set it.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product only one star but for the fact that it is pleasantly scented for a sunscreen product.  Despite the claim of being &#x27;oil-free&#x27; the product is extremely greasy.  It sits on top of your skin without being absorbed.  Secondly, it has a significant orange tint that creates a quite unnatural finish.  Even though l intended to use this product alone, I can&#x27;t imagine using this as a base under makeup either.</li>
            <li> This is the best tinted moisturizer. I no longer use any foundation, liquid or mineral powder.</li>
            <li> Second purchase of this moisturizer and love it.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt that its a much better price through amazon than through a local retailer.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Really great product!</li>
            <li> This is the only moisturizer I use.  I don&#x27;t even have to use foundation anymore.</li>
            <li> Great stuff!  All you need in summer to protect and even skin tone.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer, leaves a natural teint, light formula. Smells nice. I would certainly buy it again, very satisfied with this item.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for about a year and really like it. Seems to be a great sunblock but feels light and evens out skin tone some as well. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Favorite tinted sunblock with moisture &amp; smells great too. I use this in place of liquid foundation sometimes and love it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a tinted moisturizer with an SPF over 20. I use other Image products an like them....Vital C Anti Aging Serum and Cleanser. I&#x27;ve only had this a few days and so far I like it.  I have dryish skin but this seems to hydrate and leave a dewy finish without being greasy.</li>
            <li> I love this tinted sunscreen, but I am almost as fair as a red head, so this tinted sunscreen is too dark by itself.  So, to match my skin tone, I mix one part (a pea size) of this tinted sunscreen and one part of the Image Skin Care Prevention Hydrating Sunscreen spf 30 (or use whatever Image Skin Care Prevention Sunscreen of your choice).  It matches very closely.</li>
            <li> My skin is so hard to match with the name brand cover ups and I don&#x27;t have to worry&lt;br /&gt;about that with this one.</li>
            <li> Great product! Provides just enough coverage that you dont need makeup plus very moisturizing. I would recommend this product to friends.</li>
            <li> My skin actually improves when using this product.  And has SPF as lagniappe.</li>
            <li> Great stuff&lt;br /&gt;I ttc</li>
            <li> A bit disappointed with this product as it leaves my face a bit greasy, so I mainly use it on my neck.</li>
            <li> This product is great--not oily or greasy. It also protects my skin with adequate protection. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the Image line! I just started using this particular product about 2 weeks ago. It is just enough to cover any imperfections and it&#x27;s nice knowing my face is protected with a sunscreen of 30 and getting moisturized at the same time. It goes on light, and seems a little dark at first but as your skin absorbs it, it fades in a few minutes. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Really like the feel and that it&#x27;s tinted, it looks like foundation but it doesn&#x27;t cover up as much as foundation.</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this moisturizer!  Lasts forever and will continue to buy when it does eventually run out.  Not runny or too thick, goes on silky smooth.</li>
            <li> Very dark reddish colored tint and too greasy.</li>
            <li> Perfect for someone who doesn&#x27;t want to wear makeup but would like a little color and moister.</li>
            <li> This is great as an everyday lotion.  does not make me breakout (I&#x27;m prone) and I love the bit of color it has.  If I want more &amp;#34;coverage&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll mix in a bit of powdered foundation with it.</li>
            <li> It does have a slight smell-not too overbearing.  The sunscreen works fine but there isn&#x27;t much tint to it for me. I have medium skin tone and it was more of a primer. I didn&#x27;t feel I could use it like make up.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for those of us who don&#x27;t put sun screen on regularly.  Feels light on the face too.</li>
            <li> This is not a product that is made for dark skinned women.. it leaves you looking extremely pale.. wrong color match</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost a year.  I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> helps in the CO winter</li>
            <li> Best tinted moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used. Love the Image product line</li>
            <li> I like the product and it works well just a little wet looking on the face.</li>
            <li> The tint was not flattering to my fair to medium skin. Looked like a fake tan</li>
            <li> It is good as most Image products are- but I did notice a change in quality between the one I ordered here and the one I bought from my dermatologist&#x27;s office. The one here is a bit sub standard in my assessment.</li>
            <li> Love the light coverage..and gives natural look.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this Moisturizer and it is tinted which I completely need but I believe this would work from fair skinned people to dark complexions. AND It has SPF 30 in it.. WooHoo another Bonus. OF Course I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great price and product wonderful. Amazon is also a great place to shop, easy fast and painless.</li>
            <li> This is great for sunscreen and gives your face a great glow.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from my esthetician, but it is a lot cheaper online. Great product for any skin type, and I prefer it to actual make up.  I wear it every single day.</li>
            <li> Great. Will purchase again</li>
            <li> This is hands down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever used!! It makes your skin look bright and flawless! I have never had so many compliments about my skin.</li>
            <li> I have been  using this moisturizer for a while now and I love it. I usually get it at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;This time I got it here and what a disappointment&lt;br /&gt;The moisturizer is old (there is on expiration date on it) but the substance is separating. :( What a waist :(</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I discovered it while getting a facial.  It goes on smooth and the color is great!</li>
            <li> Wife enjoys this product very much. Will buy more when needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these line for over 3 month now. So far there is no other product / line that will make me chanche. I love this slight coverage with sun screen moisture.  I&#x27;ve been buying it and will keep buying it. My face has improve so much since using thia line (acne).</li>
            <li> I ordered this by mistake thinking I was getting the matte moisturizer. This one has a light tint that I like which gives me a more refreshed looked.</li>
            <li> Received product quickly.  Very pleased!</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful!  It leaves a moist feeling and a slight tint!  It will be great for Summer Fun!</li>
            <li> I intended to order the SPF 50 moisturizing lotion and ordered this by mistake, and I am very happy I did!  The &amp;#34;tint&amp;#34; is very transparent, yet works to even skin tone out quite nicely.  Very glad to have this in my drawer!</li>
            <li> I have medium skin tone and was afraid of the color not matching my skin tone, but gave this sunscreen a shot. It actually blends in nicely with my skin tone and has yet to irritate my skin. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> I used it in Costa Rica and never got sunburned. I only needed to apply it once for the day and it didn&#x27;t wash off after playing in the ocean waves. Awesome product! I also used it on my arms.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!  i have dark skin and it works great on me and my daughter who has fair skin.</li>
            <li> Happy with the way this worked out</li>
            <li> I definitely like this product,  it gives my skin a nice hue. Great product.</li>
            <li> Love it - great for the Phoenix sun.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Keeps my skin hydrated and protects from thhe sun.</li>
            <li> Love Image skin care products - always moisturizers without feeling greasy.  And the price is right too!</li>
            <li> Loved this product for three years.  It&#x27;s still more greasy than I&#x27;d prefer so use it without any moisturizer or base. Very effective sun screen</li>
            <li> Great tinted moisturizer!</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I first got it at a spa in Phoenix and it was a lot more money than what Amazon charged, so I bought two.  So glad Amazon carries products of this nature.  Plus using Prime is great. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love this!! Works great and very light. Not greasy or heavy at all.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used it for a few years.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
            <li> My go-to face moisturizer; slightly heavy yet not acne causing. Keeps my 50-something face perfectly moisturized all day long.</li>
            <li> I love this tinted moisturizer. I purchased it for a trip to Hawaii and have used it daily since then. It gives great protection from the sun plus feels good and covers perfectly.</li>
            <li> I like the Image products very much.  I have used this brand for a while.  I had never ordered the tinted, and I find that it has too much tint for me.  I would next time order the non-tinted.  It was packaged well and arrived in a timely manner.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer but with my sensitive skin it broke me out. Gave to my sister in law and she loves it. Not for sensitive breakout prone skin</li>
            <li> Image products do smell very nice.  For my combination skin this facial moisturizer does not clog up the pores. I prefer the SPF 50 version which contains less zinc (therefore less whitening), is less thick, and doesn&#x27;t seem as &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; (which is the waterproofing).  This SPF 30 will probably get moved to body sunscreen and I&#x27;ll get the SPF 50 again for my face.</li>
            <li> I have very pale &amp; sensitive skin.  This is the only moisturizer I can use and the tint helps offset some of the redness I get in my skin when I wash it.  I love that it has a high SPF &amp; does not leave my face feeling oily at all.  The tint may look dark for some at first, but it spreads easy &amp; you can&#x27;t see it when you&#x27;re done at all.  As I mentioned, I have very pale skin &amp; it does not show on me.</li>
            <li> Good and very Quick !</li>
            <li> 1st thing I put on my face everyday. Can be worn alone or under makeup. I even wear it to the gym.</li>
