            <li> This soap is amazing. It smells great. The lather is so creamy and leaves my skin really soft. I&#x27;m driving my husband nuts because I keep asking him to feel how soft my skin is. I&#x27;ve had these little red bumps on the back of my upper arms and after about 3 weeks of using goat milk soap, they are going away. I&#x27;ve had those bumps for years. I don&#x27;t think I will go back to commercial soap ever again.</li>
