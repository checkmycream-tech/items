            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>A great basic soap!</li>
            <li>It also takes a lot of water to get this soap to rub smoothly on your skin.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s like a non oily clean moisturized feeling.</li>

            <li>I gave him the lye soap to stop the itch &amp; it cleared up whatever it was quickly and soothed the itch.</li>

            <li>It a nice big hunk.</li>

            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>Evidently &amp;#34;pure soap&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have noticed that my hair is not as oily, my skin is softer and more supple, and I&#x27;ve actually received compliments from people I&#x27;ve known that would never dare say anything to me about my face (especially when it was full of acne!).</li>
            <li>My skin has never felt so squeaky clean and clear since childhood, and my ACNE IS GONE.</li>
            <li>Pure, clean, long lasting, effective ....</li>
            <li>Ok, this is going to be a long one</li>
            <li>Well, I have only been using this soap for a few days but so far I am totally impressed.</li>
            <li>No, not completely.. but mostly.</li>
            <li>It has been three days of using this product and my face has really cleared up.</li>
            <li>I do lather it quite a bit on my face and really work it into my pores with my fingertips quite well.</li>
            <li>(haha).</li>
            <li>Remwood Products was very responsive.</li>
            <li>I bought this soap at my neighborhood pharmacy for my grandson, he has has eczema since birth, after spending so much money on OTC products specifically made for this condition</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not all sudsy like modern bar soaps.  </li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>Very pure and soft.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately my black lab puppy decided to eat most of it before I opened it to use for myself.</li>
            <li>I have combination skin and blemishes most of the time, along with the recent (possible) diagnosis of rosacea.</li>
            <li>would highly recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>My co-worker gave me a free sample to try when I&#x27;d told her earlier that i&#x27;d tried everything to get rid of my acne, and nothing really worked or only gave modest results.</li>
            <li>I have mild/moderate keratosis pilaris on my legs and arms, and it&#x27;s winter here in new england</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive so this helps.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with this soap.</li>
            <li>It seems to open the pores up more than usual because I can really feel my treatments at work on my skin afterwards.</li>
            <li>My skin feels smooth and TIGHT.  </li>
            <li>I would prefer it was 2 smaller bars instead of one large one.</li>
            <li>I must note that I am EXTREMELY sensitive to scent</li>
            <li>My keratosis is completely gone too.</li>
            <li>It is now my soap of choice and it makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by this soap.  </li>
            <li>This was recommended to my by my doctor for my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not harsh at all.</li>
            <li>Wow this soap has replaced all others and my shampoo.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It seems to last much longer than the Dove White soap I was using.</li>
            <li>I also noticed it has not made things worse before getting better..</li>
            <li>so my skin is doing the whole simultaneously oily and dry thing in different spots.</li>
            <li>In general the soap has a bit of a strange scent to it because it is all natural and there are no perfumes added.</li>
            <li>Though it did not go away completely, he is not constantly scratching and breaking out, 16 months old and relief is a bath away and lasts all night and until the next bathtime.</li>
            <li>It leaves no residue and has no extras that irritate, but does NOT dry out your skin.  </li>
            <li>I have noticed that my face is MUCH less red and somehow it manages to get rid of the oilyness but at the same time leave my skin with just the right amount of moisture.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a month and a half or so and I have never had skin this soft in my adult life.</li>

            <li> The bars are long lasting.  </li>
            <li> I have dealt with skin issues for as long as I can remember and I am one of thse people where nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strange</li>
            <li> , it lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> When I wash my face twice a day, the oily and dry patches are gone, and the redness is fading.  </li>
            <li> When I rub some soap on these spots and let it dry, the size and redness goes away.  </li>
            <li> I have also noticed that no new blemishes appear to be forming at all.</li>
            <li> bar was a little hard to handle at first due to its size and hardness, but I chose a larger bar for the value.  </li>
            <li> I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> My forehead and nose have always been extremely oily,, while my cheekbones have begun to dry, flake and wrinkle.  </li>
            <li> I had a few of those deep pimples and those are all but one gone.</li>
            <li> It will also sting your eyes, so be careful there.  </li>
            <li> Note, this is soap, not a detergent like other cleansers.</li>
            <li> I use this soap in place of any other cleanser and use my treatments same as usual after.</li>
            <li> I have used lye soap a lot in the past and have difficulty finding it locally.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know any other way to express it.  </li>
            <li> My pores, which were always small, are even smaller now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used this on my hair due to build up of hair sprays.  </li>
            <li> It does dry your skin a little, but a little coconut oil after the shower will take care of that.  </li>
            <li> I can get some pretty bad redness and sometimes I get those really deep cystic blemishes OUCH!!</li>
            <li> it was all natural it couldn&#x27;t make anything worse.</li>
            <li> As I remember it, Granny&#x27;s lye soap was a little hit or miss but this stuff is consistant with every batch.  </li>
            <li> Not made for little hands.  </li>
            <li> To begin with let me just say that I was very skeptical the first time I tried this product.</li>
            <li> I bought it for poison ivy, but the lye soaps I remember from childhood dried my skin and made it itchy.  </li>
            <li> I always heard lye soap was, well lye and lye is harsh but not so with this soap.  </li>
            <li> but this soap is anything but harsh on the skin.</li>

            <li> I personally don&#x27;t use this but my sister loves this stuff and says it helps with rashes and itching.  She loves it.</li>
            <li> Ignore all the ads -- forget all the hype -- ignore all the pundits!! THIS is the BEST soap ever, period! Pure, clean, long lasting, effective .... what else can I say?!  Note, this is soap, not a detergent like other cleansers.</li>
            <li> Ok, this is going to be a long one but I want to cover everything. Well, I have only been using this soap for a few days but so far I am totally impressed. I have dealt with skin issues for as long as I can remember and I am one of thse people where nothing seems to work. Or, if it does only for a while. I have combination skin and blemishes most of the time, along with the recent (possible) diagnosis of rosacea. I can get some pretty bad redness and sometimes I get those really deep cystic blemishes OUCH!! I have an event coming up and I had totally broken out and I was desperate.. so I decided to give this a whirl. I figured that being it was all natural it couldn&#x27;t make anything worse. It has been three days of using this product and my face has really cleared up. No, not completely.. but mostly. I had a few of those deep pimples and those are all but one gone. the rest of my skin is looking very nice as well. I also noticed it has not made things worse before getting better.. it just got better. One of the deep blemishes along my jawline was hanging on for dear life. I decided to dampen my finger a rub it in the soap to make a bit of creamy residue and apply that onto the blemish under my sulfer mask overnight as spot treatment, and it actually reduced the swelling quite a bit. In general the soap has a bit of a strange scent to it because it is all natural and there are no perfumes added. I must note that I am EXTREMELY sensitive to scent and I find it a bit bothersome, though my friend didn&#x27;t notice anything at all. That being said, I would not stop using it just because of the smell. It isn&#x27;t that bad and goes away after you are finished using it. I have noticed that my face is MUCH less red and somehow it manages to get rid of the oilyness but at the same time leave my skin with just the right amount of moisture. It&#x27;s strange it&#x27;s like a non oily clean moisturized feeling. Something I haven&#x27;t seen before. I love that because I can&#x27;t use lotions they make mebreak out. (yes all kinds) I have also noticed that no new blemishes appear to be forming at all. Another great thing is that it removes makeup and dirt unlike anything I have ever used.. poof it&#x27;s gone. I do lather it quite a bit on my face and really work it into my pores with my fingertips quite well. It seems to open the pores up more than usual because I can really feel my treatments at work on my skin afterwards. I have noticed that if it gets in my eyes it doesn&#x27;t feel too nice so I would not recommend that (haha). I use this soap in place of any other cleanser and use my treatments same as usual after. All that being said, I understand that not everything works for everyone but I DO think this is worth trying.</li>
            <li> I have mild/moderate keratosis pilaris on my legs and arms, and it&#x27;s winter here in new england so my skin is doing the whole simultaneously oily and dry thing in different spots. I&#x27;ve been using this soap for a month and a half or so and I have never had skin this soft in my adult life. I even started using it on my face instead of acne wash and my acne is gone. My keratosis is completely gone too. I am also only halfway through one bar and I use it every time I shower, it lasts a long time. Well worth the cheap price, I highly recommend this soap to anyone. It&#x27;s super mild, gentle, and unscented. Love it.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great for poison ivy. Don&#x27;t have a great smell which I knew it wouldn&#x27;t but the smell isn&#x27;t unbearable considering the wonders it does.</li>
            <li> To begin with let me just say that I was very skeptical the first time I tried this product. I have had acne since I was a teenager well into my adult life, and as a result have tried desperately to find a solution. My co-worker gave me a free sample to try when I&#x27;d told her earlier that i&#x27;d tried everything to get rid of my acne, and nothing really worked or only gave modest results. Well, she swore to me that this would help, if not cure, my acne and more - so I thought, why not? Simply put, the results were spectacular. My skin has never felt so squeaky clean and clear since childhood, and my ACNE IS GONE. I don&#x27;t have to wake up every morning and worry about blemishes and unsightly white-heads, I am more confident and feel much better about myself. The soap does not stop there though, since using it I have noticed that my hair is not as oily, my skin is softer and more supple, and I&#x27;ve actually received compliments from people I&#x27;ve known that would never dare say anything to me about my face (especially when it was full of acne!). The feeling is really just more than I can put into words, but I have since opened up a wonderful friendship with my co-worker, and I get excited every time my soap arrives in the mail! Please if you are suffering from acne, or just want to have great skin, you owe it to yourself to get this soap! It really does miracles!</li>
            <li> my friend contracted some sort of allergic reaction to the bed while in the hospital . I gave him the lye soap to stop the itch &amp; it cleared up whatever it was quickly and soothed the itch. I love outdoor planting and run into some itchy plants &amp; such. The lye soap works better on some things than hydrocortisone or calamine lotion.  It seems to do &#x27;good things&#x27; for your skin. Who knows why?&lt;br /&gt;I will always try to keep a bar handy</li>
            <li> I bought this because my mom brought me some lye soap from Helen,Ga that worked amazingly.i ran out so I searched for some here.It didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin.I actually ended up spending,like 16 dollars on this with shipping,and it just does&#x27;nt work.</li>
            <li> My mother uses this whenever she gets a bug bite. She swears by it - better than hydrocortisone for bug bites in her opinion.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry. I&#x27;ve used it on my face and I&#x27;ve noticed that my skin is smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I have used lye soap a lot in the past and have difficulty finding it locally.  A great basic soap!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even know that this was still around. I bought it to bathe my itching dogs and ended up using it for an allergic reaction to latex. It worked. It is now my soap of choice and it makes your skin so soft. I&#x27;m not sure why we ever stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I use it on my face and body. I didnt think it would make enough suds but it does. It makes you feel clean without drying you out and having perfumes and stuff in it. My skin is very sensitive so this helps.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin.  This soap is great.  It leaves no residue and has no extras that irritate, but does NOT dry out your skin.  It just leaves you feeling clean.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by this soap.  I bought it for poison ivy, but the lye soaps I remember from childhood dried my skin and made it itchy.  This soap did seem to help the poison ivy but never left me with flaky skin.  I&#x27;ve been using it for six weeks and I really like it!</li>
            <li> Works fine. I was thinking this was the kind of soap a friend told me I needed to get a stain out of clothing but it was another kind. Unfortunately my black lab puppy decided to eat most of it before I opened it to use for myself. Evidently &amp;#34;pure soap&amp;#34; taste good to puppies? LOL It a nice big hunk. I would prefer it was 2 smaller bars instead of one large one. Would fit into my soap dished better.</li>
            <li> I did not buy this product through Amazon but we have been using it for several years now.  I have very dry skin.  My husband has Rosacea.  All of my children have differing degrees of Psoriasis.  All of us use this soap.  For one of my sons using this soap allows him to not have to use medications to control his Psoriasis and for me I no longer get flaky skin.  The bars are long lasting.  Do not expect to get a lot of lather.  I always heard lye soap was, well lye and lye is harsh but not so with this soap.  I don&#x27;t know why but this soap is anything but harsh on the skin. We love it and use nothing except this soap.  $5.00 seems a lot for a bar of soap but it lasts for months.  I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This was recommended to my by my doctor for my sensitive skin and I love it.  Some people complain about the smell, but I actually like it.  It does dry your skin a little, but a little coconut oil after the shower will take care of that.  It will also sting your eyes, so be careful there.  What I like is that I don&#x27;t break out or have any skin reactions with it.</li>
            <li> excellent type does great on rough skin and old skin</li>
            <li> Remwood Products was very responsive. I would order from them again.</li>
            <li> As I remember it, Granny&#x27;s lye soap was a little hit or miss but this stuff is consistant with every batch.  I have a ton of allergies and this soap is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at my neighborhood pharmacy for my grandson, he has has eczema since birth, after spending so much money on OTC products specifically made for this condition I brought this soap home, his mom was sceptical but tried it, Amazing!! Though it did not go away completely, he is not constantly scratching and breaking out, 16 months old and relief is a bath away and lasts all night and until the next bathtime.</li>
            <li> My forehead and nose have always been extremely oily,, while my cheekbones have begun to dry, flake and wrinkle.  On top of that, my face has been growing progressively redder on my cheeks, nose and eyebrows.  I had already been interested in making my own lye soap, and thought I&#x27;d try a bar to see if it was too abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not find the smell of this bar offensive like some reviewers.  It just smells like soap.  Once you rinse it, it smells like nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no problem with the bar lathering up, admittedly, it&#x27;s not all sudsy like modern bar soaps.  When I wash my face twice a day, the oily and dry patches are gone, and the redness is fading.  I don&#x27;t even use foundation anymore, and I had gotten to the point where I put it on any time I was meeting people. My skin feels smooth and TIGHT.  I don&#x27;t know any other way to express it.  Even some of the wrinkles that had begun forming on my forehead seem to be gone. My pores, which were always small, are even smaller now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only problem is that since I used antibacterial soap all my life, I now have a bit of acne on my jaw and chin since I entered menopause.  When I rub some soap on these spots and let it dry, the size and redness goes away.  I just can&#x27;t seem to get rid of it completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bar was a little hard to handle at first due to its size and hardness, but I chose a larger bar for the value.  It just keeps lasting and lasting, even with two people using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. It&#x27;s not harsh at all. I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with this soap. It seems to last much longer than the Dove White soap I was using.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of getting skin clean and clear. Priced on par with over the counter lye soaps I have seen but there are cheaper lye soaps on line.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Wow this soap has replaced all others and my shampoo.  The compliments about how soft my skin is and how good it looks started right after I showered with the soap.  They just keep coming.  Same with my hair.</li>
            <li> Big, really big bars of soap.  Not made for little hands.  It also takes a lot of water to get this soap to rub smoothly on your skin.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best soaps I have ever used.  Skin feels squeaky clean and fresh.  No harsh chemicals.  I&#x27;ve also used this on my hair due to build up of hair sprays.  Works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product.  Now I am going to try different products from this company.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap because its old timely smell and washes real good too I would recommend this to my family</li>
            <li> Prefer lye soap to antiperspirant.  Watching this soap get used up was difficult for me.</li>
            <li> Usually get this at Ace. The only bar soap I use!</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my face, hands, body and hair. It&#x27;s great as a shampoo. Very pure and soft.</li>
            <li> The smell of lard is rather disconcerting.</li>
            <li> Hey this stuff does everything it says it does and it has lots of uses. So whatever you have a idea of trying it for try it. It&#x27;s good for acne, athletes feet etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I heard it was good for bug bites.  Haven&#x27;t used it yet,  waiting for mosquito session</li>
