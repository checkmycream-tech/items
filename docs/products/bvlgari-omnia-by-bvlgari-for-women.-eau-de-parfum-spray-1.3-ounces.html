            <li>I love this scent</li>

            <li>I love it because it stays with you all day.  </li>
            <li>I love this scent.  </li>
            <li>This is my most favorite perfum.</li>
            <li>My favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>This perfume is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  </li>
            <li>I really love the fragrance when she wears it.  </li>
            <li>Who could ask for more?</li>
            <li>Luckily my wife dropped a hint or two that she liked this one.</li>
            <li>I love Omnia&#x27;s crisp, warm fragrance.  </li>
            <li>This makes my wife smell nice, and makes her smile.  </li>
            <li>My friend would always say how much she liked it, so I gave Omnia to her on her Birthday.</li>
            <li>enjoy.</li>
            <li>-free shopping!&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Most perfumes are overly powerful and make me sneeze a lot.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the scent of this perfume, but it does not interact with my body right.</li>
            <li>so I was so excited when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Not every scent smells the same on every person and to be able to find one that compliments your own chemistry is bliss.  </li>
            <li>This is my absolute favorite scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27; not too sweet smelling</li>
            <li>It truly saddens me that they have discontinued the fragrance and nothing has really come close to the uniqueness and sexy complexity of the componants it is made up of.  </li>
            <li>It is stronger and I purchased this one consistently when it was still out in the market and easily bought.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will be ordering more as soon as the 2 bottles I ordered get low:)</li>
            <li>Quick delivery</li>
            <li>If they&#x27;re nice I actually tell them the truth.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li>Smaller than I expected but smells wonderful</li>
            <li>This was my favorite and was sexy and not strong.  </li>
            <li>I will most definitely order from you guys again.</li>
            <li>I first smelled it on a friend of mine at the beach in 2004, I have been wearing it ever since.  </li>
            <li>I first discovered this perfume while vacationing in Orlando, Florida about7 years ago.</li>
            <li>It starts off a bit strong  but quickly becomes a subtle, lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, its light but long lasting, I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li>but if the girl in your life wants it get it for her.</li>
            <li>And I got it very quitely from Amazon.</li>
            <li>I received it and really see the difference.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>The perfume is very watery which makes me question it&#x27;s authenticity.</li>
            <li>Delivery was good, the item not good.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how many times women have chased me down the sidewalk or across restaurants to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li>It is the only fragrance I&#x27;ve worn all of these years that actually makes me FEEL sexy when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Decent price.</li>
            <li>But other than that, It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>and I just don&#x27;t live the smell of it.  </li>
            <li>I will be looking for a new \\&quot;me\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li>magnet!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m married, so my husband definitely likes it!</li>
            <li>I had to send the first bottle back</li>
            <li>Women and men have gone wild to smell my wrist when I&#x27;m wearing it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li>When she started using it, she immediately noticed the smell does not last for more than a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I tend to like heavier scents, a little musky, a little exotic, and this is just the right amount, not too heavy but enough that I can still enjoy it hours after putting it on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m concerned that this product is either very old or possibly a knock-off.</li>
            <li>This perfume is very watered down.</li>

            <li> This perfume is very watered down.</li>
            <li> I had a big bottle &amp; it lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Not the same as my previous perfume.  </li>
            <li> I think this perfume is probably fake as it wears off very quickly, not the the original one i bought.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get them mixed up, Omnia comes in other flavors, but Omnia Bronze is the bomb!!!</li>
            <li> Perfume is hard to buy for the opposite sex.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume hate the price</li>
            <li> This is unacceptable, I expect when I order an item that I receive that item, not a watered down version of it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s heavily sweet/vanilla/floral.</li>
            <li> after a couple uses I found out half has leaked onto my dresser thru a small chip in glass.</li>
            <li> It is not a common fragrance and may not be for everyone, but  I have known people to go crazy over it.  </li>
            <li> I am very sad that Bulgari has decided not to continue with this particular scent and have now stocked up on it.  </li>
            <li> I also bought  Crystalline in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it in the past and knew what I was getting.  </li>
            <li> You can hardly smell it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m stopped at least 2 or 3 times asking for the name of my perfume.</li>
            <li> It is subtle, and I am always getting complements on how &amp;#34;good</li>
            <li> hard to find..exactly what my wife wanted!</li>
            <li> if this is a gift idea, it won&#x27;t fail.  </li>
            <li> I would be crazy to do that</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t know if they will like it or hate it.</li>
            <li> hate going to the mall.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Great original product!  Love the fragrance and have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Product arrived within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;The scent wears of a bit faster than the one I had before.  But other than that, It&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> The fragrence does not last! I&#x27;m concerned that this product is either very old or possibly a knock-off. I ordered this product for my wife since she loves this specific Bulgari scent and has worn it for years. When she started using it, she immediately noticed the smell does not last for more than a few minutes. As if it was mostly just water. I contacted the seller (Perfume Boutique) and they refused to do anything about it. I have filed an Amazon Claim and we will see what happens. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I just Love,Love, Love this colonge. It has been discontinued in the stores so I was so excited when I found it on Amazon. I get compliments all time and asked &amp;#34;What are you wearing&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering more as soon as the 2 bottles I ordered get low:)</li>
            <li> Perfume is hard to buy for the opposite sex. You don&#x27;t know if they will like it or hate it. Luckily my wife dropped a hint or two that she liked this one. I think she did a good job faking the surprise for Mothers day but she loves it and I think it smells nice on her. So would I recommend it? I would be crazy to do that but if the girl in your life wants it get it for her. I have not been disappointed!</li>
            <li> Not the same as my previous perfume.  Hope they did not change the formula, but for some reason I don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> This perfume never goes outta style! I been wearing it for 4yrs! It is always a huge hit! My favorite always.</li>
            <li> Delivery was good, the item not good. It doesn&#x27;t smell at all.</li>
            <li> This is my mother&#x27;s favorite. It arrived on time and she is happy as ever. It also was in good condition.I will most definitely order from you guys again.</li>
            <li> Quick delivery&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good product. I love it. Nice and good smell. And I got it very quitely from Amazon. Thank you for good service.</li>
            <li> What does a man know about perfume?  For me, nothing and I bought based on what others said about it.  I lucked out.  She likes it.</li>
            <li> With hints of vanilla, chocolate and spicier scents, this perfume is definitely sexy. I get SO many compliments when I where this perfume. I think it&#x27;s a sure-fire &amp;#34;guy magnet!&amp;#34; I&#x27;m married, so my husband definitely likes it!</li>
            <li> This is my absolute favorite scent. I can&#x27;t tell you how many times women have chased me down the sidewalk or across restaurants to ask me what I&#x27;m wearing. If they&#x27;re nice I actually tell them the truth. Love, love, love this sexy perfume.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the scent of this perfume, but it does not interact with my body right. I am not sure whether that is a normal experience, but my natural body odor smelled off whenever I used this product.</li>
            <li> Favorite perfume EVER</li>
            <li> I always get compliments when I wear Omnia. My friend would always say how much she liked it, so I gave Omnia to her on her Birthday.</li>
            <li> Wonderful perfume and great service! Thank you!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite scents. I also bought  Crystalline in the past. Nice light scent, even for a tween to wear.</li>
            <li> Bulgari is one of my favorite perfumes.  Omnia is a wonderful smell.  Don&#x27;t get them mixed up, Omnia comes in other flavors, but Omnia Bronze is the bomb!!!</li>
            <li> I think this perfume is probably fake as it wears off very quickly, not the the original one i bought.</li>
            <li> This is the second bottle of Bulgari Omnia I have purchased, and I will continue to order them as needed.</li>
            <li> When out in public I&#x27;m stopped at least 2 or 3 times asking for the name of my perfume. I was in a deep depression when informed this scent was being discontinued. Thank you for rethinking that decision and distributing it again. It&#x27;s AWESOME! !</li>
            <li> after a couple uses I found out half has leaked onto my dresser thru a small chip in glass. It took the varnsih off my dresser. I have had illness in my family so I havent had time to e-mail you.</li>
            <li> delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell</li>
            <li> This is my signature...</li>
            <li> I love Omnia&#x27;s crisp, warm fragrance.  I think Bvlgari discontinued it and am delighted I can still buy it here.</li>
            <li> This perfume is very watered down. You can hardly smell it at all. I am very disappointed in this product! This is unacceptable, I expect when I order an item that I receive that item, not a watered down version of it!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, its light but long lasting, I get compliments all the time. Will definately need to purchase more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it in the past and knew what I was getting.  I love this fragrance and am always receiving compliments.  It starts off a bit strong  but quickly becomes a subtle, lovely fragrance.</li>
            <li> Simply love this perfume! I get so many compliments on this scent. It&#x27; not too sweet smelling but rather has a deep earthy feel about it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this scent. It is great for daytime use, but also a night on the town. Absolutely fantastic!!</li>
            <li> Regardless of if I wear it, it&#x27;s spritzed on clothing or someone else, it&#x27;s not musky, woodsy or gingery.  It&#x27;s heavily sweet/vanilla/floral.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and I was so happy to find it as such a great price.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you the number of compliments I&#x27;ve gotten when wearing this perfume.  Women and men have gone wild to smell my wrist when I&#x27;m wearing it.  It truly saddens me that they have discontinued the fragrance and nothing has really come close to the uniqueness and sexy complexity of the componants it is made up of.  I first smelled it on a friend of mine at the beach in 2004, I have been wearing it ever since.  It is not a common fragrance and may not be for everyone, but  I have known people to go crazy over it.  It is the only fragrance I&#x27;ve worn all of these years that actually makes me FEEL sexy when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a friend and it smells awesome.  if this is a gift idea, it won&#x27;t fail.  enjoy.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume.&lt;br /&gt;I hate going to the mall. This was a great experience.&lt;br /&gt;Pain-free shopping!&lt;br /&gt;Very happy,&lt;br /&gt;Jinx McDonald</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell fresh.  It is stronger and I purchased this one consistently when it was still out in the market and easily bought.  This was my favorite and was sexy and not strong.  It was my day and night parfum.  Well, I saw it here for a good price.  I received it and really see the difference.  It was as if I bought it in the department store, wrapped and packaged as a store would sell it.  It&#x27;s just old.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Decent price. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love the perfume hate the price</li>
            <li> I had to send the first bottle back and I just don&#x27;t live the smell of it.  The perfume is very watery which makes me question it&#x27;s authenticity.</li>
            <li> I first discovered this perfume while vacationing in Orlando, Florida about7 years ago. I had a big bottle &amp; it lasted a long time. When I ran out my husband bought me another perfume from Bvlgari, but it wasn&#x27;t the same. I took a chance and bought this perfume on amazon and was so ecstatic that it&#x27;s the same scent that I longed for! It is such a distinctive perfume &amp; I love it!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.  I love it because it stays with you all day.  I only wish they didn&#x27;t discontinue this fragrance.</li>
            <li> This makes my wife smell nice, and makes her smile.  Well worth the $$$.</li>
            <li> I love this scent.  I tend to like heavier scents, a little musky, a little exotic, and this is just the right amount, not too heavy but enough that I can still enjoy it hours after putting it on.  Not to mention, I get alot of compliments on it.  Not every scent smells the same on every person and to be able to find one that compliments your own chemistry is bliss.  I am very sad that Bulgari has decided not to continue with this particular scent and have now stocked up on it.  I will be looking for a new \\&quot;me\\&quot; scent.</li>
            <li> hard to find..exactly what my wife wanted!</li>
            <li> Smaller than I expected but smells wonderful</li>
            <li> This is my most favorite perfum. The scent is musk like with floral undertones.  It is subtle, and I am always getting complements on how &amp;#34;good I smell&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> it was smaller than the last one I bought</li>
            <li> My favorite scent.  Great price, packaged well, arrived quickly.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Very happy with this seller and the product.</li>
            <li> This perfume is my wife&#x27;s favorite.  I really love the fragrance when she wears it.  Most perfumes are overly powerful and make me sneeze a lot.  This one doesn&#x27;t.  It appears that Bulgari no longer produces this fragrance, so I was happy to find it available here.</li>
            <li> To get this designer fragrance at this price was amazing.  My wife loved it.  That says it all.  Right price and a happy wife.  Who could ask for more?</li>
