            <li>Great stuff!</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and it makes my skin feel great.  </li>
            <li>Great skincare product</li>
            <li>It is a great way to try the product out and if you are a smoker, diabetic, or eat junk don&#x27;t expect miracles.</li>
            <li>I love this product and great price through amazon!</li>
            <li>Purchased twice - good value.</li>
            <li>I was blessed with good genes from dad and do not have a lot of wrinkles</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!  </li>
            <li>Great product, but I wasn&#x27;t aware that they were the mini sizes!</li>
            <li>this is my new best friend :)</li>
            <li>Not the best anti aging product I will stick with Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li>The skin renewal kit (Murad Age Reform line) is great for those of us showing the first signs of age.  </li>
            <li>Great skin treatment, be aware this is a trail size.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering from Hollys Best Products for all my future Murad purchases.</li>
            <li>Love this kit.</li>
            <li>I love Murad</li>
            <li>I like this Brand and has healthy ingredients.  </li>
            <li>Better than some of the Drug Store products</li>
            <li>so I thought this was a pretty good deal...</li>
            <li>Very fast service, courteous people.</li>
            <li>n smooth.  </li>
            <li>But hey we are worth it!</li>
            <li>Its not clogging my pours and my complexion stays clean</li>
            <li>My fine lines around eyes do look more plump and bridge of nose not as obvious.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and fantastic product.</li>
            <li>and I think that should have been made more clear in the title.  </li>
            <li>how nice of a complexion i have, shortly after using Murad products!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much.</li>
            <li>I looked and looked for a particular skin cream from Murad to replace the one I was talked into buying at a place that does facials.  </li>
            <li>If you are buying a kit like this one then I highly recommend which ever kit you choose for your skin type</li>
            <li>Just because it is a high rated product does not mean it will work for you.</li>
            <li>I started using the Murad line 3 months ago and saw huge improvements in the appearance and feel of my skin in less than a month.  </li>
            <li>the day cream is 0.7 fl oz, the complete reform is .33</li>
            <li>I am in one of those categories and have had friends in the other and honestly this is one of the few products we all agree on that works even when we cringe at the price.</li>
            <li>Great for travel, but very expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>Cleanser is ok not sure about other products.</li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t beat travel size price, last me almost 3 weeks as I do not use glycolic cream everyday.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Cleanser is ok not sure about other products.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;love the product am only giving it four stars cause the description is missing the oz each one has. They are travel size bottles/jars. The cleanser is 1.5 fl oz. the day cream is 0.7 fl oz, the complete reform is .33 fl oz and the hyrdo-dynamic is .25 fl oz. If the oz had been stated in the description I would have just bought the cleanser...&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Purchased twice - good value.</li>
            <li> Not the best anti aging product I will stick with Bare Minerals.</li>
            <li> moisturizing, not think or cakey.  I love it.</li>
            <li> I am hitting Big 50 soon. I was blessed with good genes from dad and do not have a lot of wrinkles HOWEVER I do have some around eyes and bridge of nose even deeper. I feel the glycolic cream tingle and I can tell a difference in skin. My fine lines around eyes do look more plump and bridge of nose not as obvious. Can&#x27;t beat travel size price, last me almost 3 weeks as I do not use glycolic cream everyday. And I alternate with EL face wash and daywear.</li>
            <li> I started using the Murad line 3 months ago and saw huge improvements in the appearance and feel of my skin in less than a month.  The skin renewal kit (Murad Age Reform line) is great for those of us showing the first signs of age.  I doubt I&#x27;ll ever use anything else again.</li>
            <li> Seems to work.  Time will tell.</li>
            <li> I tried this product after a receiving a recommendation.  It is not greasy and it makes my skin feel great.  They sell this product in a local spa as well.</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!  Fast delivery and fantastic product. Will be ordering from Hollys Best Products for all my future Murad purchases.</li>
            <li> Great skincare product</li>
            <li> I love this product and great price through amazon!</li>
            <li> I am a murad fan, but it took me a while to find what worked. I mix this line with the vitamin c mask for lightening and the resurgence eye cream. I would say to anyone considering a murad purchase to go to the murad website and take their skin test and also look at the resources for skin as well. Not all murad products are for you. Just because it is a high rated product does not mean it will work for you. Do your research and then purchase accordingly for any of their larger products. If you are buying a kit like this one then I highly recommend which ever kit you choose for your skin type this is the way to go. It is a great way to try the product out and if you are a smoker, diabetic, or eat junk don&#x27;t expect miracles. I am in one of those categories and have had friends in the other and honestly this is one of the few products we all agree on that works even when we cringe at the price. But hey we are worth it!</li>
            <li> I looked and looked for a particular skin cream from Murad to replace the one I was talked into buying at a place that does facials.  I was very happy with the cream.  This &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; was the closest I could find.  One tube alone is very expensive so I thought this was a pretty good deal...until I received it and found out it was only a sample.  These tubes were tiny tiny and I think that should have been made more clear in the title.  &amp;#34;SAMPLE renewal kit&amp;#34; or renewal kit - sample size.  Great for travel, but very expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> Love this kit.My aunt introduced me to it.I would order it again</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Got a compliment how nice of a complexion i have, shortly after using Murad products!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for 3 days now but my dry skin problems have ceased to exist and my skin feels smoother and looks healthier already.</li>
            <li> this is my new best friend :)</li>
            <li> I love Murad products.i have never been disappointed by a Murad product yet. Very fast service, courteous people. Thanks so much.</li>
            <li> Face broke out so bad I couldn&#x27;t go out for2 1/2 weeks. I aasked for a return label 2weeks ago and i&#x27;m still waiting. .  very disappointed</li>
            <li> Great product, but I wasn&#x27;t aware that they were the mini sizes!</li>
            <li> I like this Brand and has healthy ingredients.  Its not clogging my pours and my complexion stays clean n smooth.  Its not a miracle product as I still notice some dullness on my forehead.  Maybe a scrub or mask could help.  Since I wasnt amazed, I would keep testing their line.  Better than some of the Drug Store products</li>
            <li> Great skin treatment, be aware this is a trail size.</li>
            <li> My face broke out doesn&#x27;t work at all</li>
            <li> Use the product for 30 days no change</li>
    </ol>
