            <li>The bottles were in great condition, but one of the bottles leaked a teeny bit.</li>

            <li>Great value for the price</li>
            <li>Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>Which is very popular here in hawaii.</li>
            <li>Too many coats to show awesome colors</li>
            <li>They will be a pleasant addition to my glitter collection.</li>
            <li>The Chrome is a pleasant surprise.</li>
            <li>These are actually really beautiful top coats and a great value.</li>
            <li>They sparkle in the sun and shine brightly.</li>
            <li>However, it is fairly well regarded in the polish community.</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t really good to use alone unless you just want a glitter look.  </li>
            <li>, anyway... the matte nailpolish is good though</li>
            <li>They look great as a top coat are by them self.</li>
            <li>Love this collection ♡♡♡ great deal from Pandora collection...</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>
            <li>I had never used Klean Color polish before, but i have to say I love these!</li>
            <li>Colors are as pretty on the nails as in the bottle, and when the sun hits they shine and produce perfect holos.  </li>
            <li>and if you love nail polish like I do this would be the place!</li>
            <li>I liked the colors.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous and shiny, buy it :)</li>
            <li>This set is a nice addition to my collection...</li>
            <li>Nice polish.</li>
            <li>A nice touch.</li>
            <li>The colors were beautiful (the holographic ones in particular!), and arrived in good packaging.</li>
            <li>Best used with a fast drying top coat :)</li>
            <li>The colors are gorgeous and wonderfully unique.</li>
            <li>So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li>Do try the matte topcoat to give the holo effect even more depth and drama.</li>
            <li>I thought I was purchasing hologram nail polish, instead it was just a glitter top coat.</li>
            <li>I use them with the Kleancolor matte finish polishes, the put one of these on top.</li>
            <li>and they were all quite pleased.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not tried out the matte polish yet, but will update this review if there is anything interesting to say about it.</li>
            <li>Love the brand, so I&#x27;m just adding to my collection.</li>
            <li>Just ok.  </li>
            <li>The longevity of the polish seems to be 4 - 5 days without a top coat and 8+ days with a top coat.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li>It is more of a pink/fuchsia color.</li>
            <li>I would love to contact someone about this.</li>
            <li>Love the colors and would order again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>The polishes are thicker and take more &amp;#34;talent&amp;#34; to paint your nails</li>
            <li>You would have to use more than 3 coats.</li>
            <li>All these colors are quite unique and eye catching.</li>
            <li>One of them would have been fine; this many is too many.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t used these yet, not real crazy about some of the colors, but look like a good winter set.</li>
            <li>I really love these - they are great for creating different effects.  </li>
            <li>The colors are bright and many only require one coat!</li>
            <li>Enjoy all the others as well.</li>
            <li>The free earring gift was a plastic purple bow jewel.</li>
            <li>you move your hand or the light changes on them.</li>
            <li>This selection includes a nice range of vibrant colored jellies/transparents with fiery interference and rainbow holo glitter.</li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re still pretty on my nails :)</li>
            <li>I found this product and was intrigued by the unique color and effect.</li>
            <li>These aren&#x27;t the same kind of holos like Color Club and China Glaze, these are jellies with holographic glitter (except for the Chrome one, that one looks like it&#x27;ll be more of a holographic polish like CC and CG type).  </li>
            <li>They all are beautiful whether used alone or together with their other polishes for stamping.</li>
            <li>The glitter quality is excellent compared to other brands and it&#x27;s very well distributed; you don&#x27;t have clumping or inconsistent separation where the glitter falls to the bottom of the bottle</li>
            <li>far loving the colors I tried and can&#x27;t wait to use the others.</li>
            <li>I would have given this set a 3 star rating because the colors aren&#x27;t different enough to really need this many bottles, and you have to use a thicker top coat over it to get the polish smooth; but, for the price it&#x27;s a great deal.  </li>
            <li>It shipped right away, and was packaged securely.</li>
            <li>They are still very pretty though, and I am not returning them.</li>
            <li>Was shipped and received super fast!!</li>
            <li>I ended up giving away quite few of them to friends, (because honestly, how many glitter top coats does one REALLY need?)</li>
            <li>I cannot wait to give as gifts to my many tweens, teenager, and young women nieces!</li>
            <li>Smooth polish considering how much glitter is in them.</li>
            <li>The Chunky Holos are not meant to be used on their own to make an opaque (solid) color on your nail.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful as topcoats over similarly-toned polishes and eye-catching over black, but really, the possibilities are endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The color combinations are complimentary but very eye-catching and unique.</li>
            <li>Some of the nailpolish where good but other</li>
            <li>I did rasberry pink scented polish and put holo candy on top looked pretty cute.</li>
            <li>These colors work best over an opaque coat of polish like black or white.</li>
            <li>They admired  the original color I purchased, black chunky halo, so I know they will be thrilled with these.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t think they would make a great present for anyone younger.</li>
            <li>The free earring was a black plastic bow that is not something I&#x27;d wear, but as a free gift I can give to someone who will enjoy it.  </li>
            <li>Lots of higher end dupes included.</li>
            <li>But I think it should be used on top of regular polish because this is glitter polish..  </li>
            <li>Oh also I love the way how they came in sets of 4 double wrapped in bubble wrap!</li>
            <li>I love all the different colors to choose from!  </li>
            <li>If you want to get these amazing colors for your preteen or younger kleancolor has metallic and so many other sets of colors</li>
            <li>More of a top coat, unless you are willing to do at least 4 coats.</li>
            <li>Nail polish can be tricky; these particular ones look as if they are all holographic and pretty, but they are all more glazes than solid colors.</li>
            <li>It took about 10 days to ship, which was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>it was exactly what I wanted, with a free pair of earrings included in as well as a couple of extra nail polish thrown in as well.</li>
            <li>These are pretty but they aren&#x27;t quite what I was expecting them to be, they also take forever to dry and have a really strong plastic type smell to them.</li>
            <li>very mucht</li>
            <li>I am highly upset!</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>but after when i looked at them in a different light i could see the differences</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t appreciate the colors by looking at pictures or the screen of a computer.</li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s a lot like Icing&#x27;s &#x27;Epic Winning&#x27; color, just with smaller sparkles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>love the colors but one bottle arrived broken and got all over the other bottles....but still happy</li>
            <li>This is especially true since they&#x27;re jellies, since you&#x27;ll probably want several coats if you&#x27;re not layering over other colors.</li>
            <li>Also, most of them have the same glitter in them, making them all pretty much look the same.</li>
            <li>Kleancolor also tends to have more odor than other polishes.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more dark.</li>
            <li>I prefer black, it makes the colors pop out more, so to speak.</li>
            <li>my favorite  is the black chunky holo.</li>
            <li>The holo Black is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li>I am so in love with the metallic and the black.</li>
            <li>I gave this set three out of five stars because I haven&#x27;t used any of the colors yet, but from what I can see they look like mainly glitter.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get the Chunky Holo Bluebell, though I was aware it might not come with my set, due to the complaints of others.  </li>
            <li>I have used many different kinds of  kleancolor nail polish and this is the only kind I&#x27;ve found to be sticky and hard to put on.</li>
            <li>Wish it was a little more vibrant.</li>
            <li>One was broken, but can be very easily fixed, and I got them for free, so I won&#x27;t complain and wear them. :)</li>
            <li>When they first arrived they looked like all the same color and was very upset</li>
            <li>but i do wish the sparkles were more green than orange.</li>
            <li>I love the different colors but the consistency of  nail polish is sticky and it takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li>and it definitely requires more patience to wait until they are dry.</li>
            <li>The only thing that i didn&#x27;t care for was the smell, but it&#x27;s nail polish, they all stink right?</li>
            <li>If you are new to nail polish, you might want to look up the polish names online to see examples of what it looks like.</li>
            <li>I wondered at first if they mislabeled it or something, but the only difference I can tell between the two is one is just a tiiiiiny bit darker than the other if there isn&#x27;t any light hitting it.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t call it holo , its more like glitter polish, its clear and only works if you put it over another colour, that is why they send you the white (which is super chunky and dries weirdly), but if you put it over another brand or colour it looks pretty cool.</li>
            <li>I will have to use a regular polish under the holos in the future for these, which is not difficult, just a little more effort and time.  </li>
            <li>, however they don&#x27;t exactly match the colors shown they look more red than anything (except the blue and green).</li>
            <li>While a few of the colors are quite nice, they don&#x27;t really have a whole lot of variation like the seem to in the bottle, but there is a noticeable difference if you are using it over black or white bases.</li>
            <li>I guarantee you that multiple bloggers have already done that with the whole collection.</li>
            <li>BUT it is NOT anywhere near a blue/purple color as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li>The color shows up better and is more intense when there&#x27;s a base color along with the glitter.</li>
            <li>I also have to use a different solid color on the bottom because the colors are so clear they don&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li>I have not seen any other nail polish products sold that have the colorful dimension that kleancolor has.</li>
            <li>They go decent over another nail color (white/black) but they are &#x27;waery&#x27; and take several coats even with a basecoat to come close to what they look like it the bottle.</li>
            <li>For chunky polish, it goes on evenly in a few coats and will stay as long as you use a top coat.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a sparkly blue and white mixture, still quite pretty, despite not being what I ordered.</li>
            <li>Did the white with holo blue bell on my toes because the white chips off so fast doesnt really work on fingers well.</li>
            <li>You have to either be patient and let it dry thoroughly between coats (maybe 10-15 minutes) or use a thick, quick dry top coat (Seche Vite, Poshe).</li>
            <li>Not because  there&#x27;s anything wrong with the polish but because the user really needs to have more patience with these specifically.  </li>
            <li>I was a little put down, because that was one of the colors I was looking forward to the most.</li>
            <li>Kleancolor polish as a general rule is thicker and sometimes long-drying.</li>
            <li>As with most Kleancolor polishes, set aside a little extra time for your mani due to longer drying times.</li>
            <li>I own over 1,500 bottles of polish (including the normal Kleancolor holos and a Chunky) and actively seek offbeat and vintage nail polish.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure how they would do over real nails since glitter polishes often come off easily on real nails because of the texture variation and the need to use several coats of different polish as I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>

            <li> They are beautiful as topcoats over similarly-toned polishes and eye-catching over black, but really, the possibilities are endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The color combinations are complimentary but very eye-catching and unique.</li>
            <li> Some of the nailpolish where good but other</li>
            <li> I did rasberry pink scented polish and put holo candy on top looked pretty cute.</li>
            <li> These colors work best over an opaque coat of polish like black or white.</li>
            <li> They admired  the original color I purchased, black chunky halo, so I know they will be thrilled with these.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t think they would make a great present for anyone younger.</li>
            <li> The free earring was a black plastic bow that is not something I&#x27;d wear, but as a free gift I can give to someone who will enjoy it.  </li>
            <li> Lots of higher end dupes included.</li>
            <li> But I think it should be used on top of regular polish because this is glitter polish..  </li>
            <li> Oh also I love the way how they came in sets of 4 double wrapped in bubble wrap!</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors to choose from!  </li>
            <li> If you want to get these amazing colors for your preteen or younger kleancolor has metallic and so many other sets of colors</li>
            <li> More of a top coat, unless you are willing to do at least 4 coats.</li>
            <li> Nail polish can be tricky; these particular ones look as if they are all holographic and pretty, but they are all more glazes than solid colors.</li>
            <li> It took about 10 days to ship, which was pretty fast.</li>
            <li> it was exactly what I wanted, with a free pair of earrings included in as well as a couple of extra nail polish thrown in as well.</li>
            <li> These are pretty but they aren&#x27;t quite what I was expecting them to be, they also take forever to dry and have a really strong plastic type smell to them.</li>
            <li> very mucht</li>
            <li> I am highly upset!</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> but after when i looked at them in a different light i could see the differences</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t appreciate the colors by looking at pictures or the screen of a computer.</li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s a lot like Icing&#x27;s &#x27;Epic Winning&#x27; color, just with smaller sparkles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> love the colors but one bottle arrived broken and got all over the other bottles....but still happy</li>
            <li> This is especially true since they&#x27;re jellies, since you&#x27;ll probably want several coats if you&#x27;re not layering over other colors.</li>
            <li> Also, most of them have the same glitter in them, making them all pretty much look the same.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor also tends to have more odor than other polishes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more dark.</li>
            <li> I prefer black, it makes the colors pop out more, so to speak.</li>
            <li> my favorite  is the black chunky holo.</li>
            <li> The holo Black is probably my favorite.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with the metallic and the black.</li>
            <li> I gave this set three out of five stars because I haven&#x27;t used any of the colors yet, but from what I can see they look like mainly glitter.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get the Chunky Holo Bluebell, though I was aware it might not come with my set, due to the complaints of others.  </li>
            <li> I have used many different kinds of  kleancolor nail polish and this is the only kind I&#x27;ve found to be sticky and hard to put on.</li>
            <li> Wish it was a little more vibrant.</li>
            <li> One was broken, but can be very easily fixed, and I got them for free, so I won&#x27;t complain and wear them. :)</li>
            <li> When they first arrived they looked like all the same color and was very upset</li>
            <li> but i do wish the sparkles were more green than orange.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors but the consistency of  nail polish is sticky and it takes forever to dry.  </li>
            <li> and it definitely requires more patience to wait until they are dry.</li>
            <li> The only thing that i didn&#x27;t care for was the smell, but it&#x27;s nail polish, they all stink right?</li>
            <li> If you are new to nail polish, you might want to look up the polish names online to see examples of what it looks like.</li>
            <li> I wondered at first if they mislabeled it or something, but the only difference I can tell between the two is one is just a tiiiiiny bit darker than the other if there isn&#x27;t any light hitting it.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it holo , its more like glitter polish, its clear and only works if you put it over another colour, that is why they send you the white (which is super chunky and dries weirdly), but if you put it over another brand or colour it looks pretty cool.</li>
            <li> I will have to use a regular polish under the holos in the future for these, which is not difficult, just a little more effort and time.  </li>
            <li> , however they don&#x27;t exactly match the colors shown they look more red than anything (except the blue and green).</li>
            <li> While a few of the colors are quite nice, they don&#x27;t really have a whole lot of variation like the seem to in the bottle, but there is a noticeable difference if you are using it over black or white bases.</li>
            <li> I guarantee you that multiple bloggers have already done that with the whole collection.</li>
            <li> BUT it is NOT anywhere near a blue/purple color as shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> The color shows up better and is more intense when there&#x27;s a base color along with the glitter.</li>
            <li> I also have to use a different solid color on the bottom because the colors are so clear they don&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any other nail polish products sold that have the colorful dimension that kleancolor has.</li>
            <li> They go decent over another nail color (white/black) but they are &#x27;waery&#x27; and take several coats even with a basecoat to come close to what they look like it the bottle.</li>
            <li> For chunky polish, it goes on evenly in a few coats and will stay as long as you use a top coat.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sparkly blue and white mixture, still quite pretty, despite not being what I ordered.</li>
            <li> Did the white with holo blue bell on my toes because the white chips off so fast doesnt really work on fingers well.</li>
            <li> You have to either be patient and let it dry thoroughly between coats (maybe 10-15 minutes) or use a thick, quick dry top coat (Seche Vite, Poshe).</li>
            <li> Not because  there&#x27;s anything wrong with the polish but because the user really needs to have more patience with these specifically.  </li>
            <li> I was a little put down, because that was one of the colors I was looking forward to the most.</li>
            <li> Kleancolor polish as a general rule is thicker and sometimes long-drying.</li>
            <li> As with most Kleancolor polishes, set aside a little extra time for your mani due to longer drying times.</li>
            <li> I own over 1,500 bottles of polish (including the normal Kleancolor holos and a Chunky) and actively seek offbeat and vintage nail polish.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how they would do over real nails since glitter polishes often come off easily on real nails because of the texture variation and the need to use several coats of different polish as I&#x27;ve mentioned above.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, just needs a solid-color base coat to get the whole effect of it.</li>
            <li> colors in my pack: Candy, Poppy, Fuchsia, Scarlet, Clover, Teal, Purple, Black, Chrome, and the Madly Matte finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t receive any free earrings with mine, but that had no bearing on my choice of purchase, so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> The Chunky Holos are meant to be glitter toppers, and they&#x27;re supposed to go over other colors of polish to give them a holographic or different color sheen to them.</li>
            <li> Some of the colors don&#x27;t dry well and are goopy.</li>
            <li> OR just a few layers to make it solid enough for the nail.  </li>
            <li> A red, yellow, &amp;green .</li>
            <li> The color shifting glitter in a slightly tinted base is great for layering over other polishes...</li>
            <li> recently I ordered the 12 set metallic and the BLUEBELL chunky holo and the and the chunky holo black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely different, just a little bit darker than the ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> JUST be patient though, these take longer to dry than their other colors, which makes sense because they are thicker to make it 3-d.</li>
            <li> There was also one bottle that was Blue Diamond (a glitter), so I&#x27;m missing one of the holos.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed by the colors or how easily it spreads on your nails, how long the color lasts or how long your manicure lasts.</li>
            <li> Received package on schedule, but there was a shattered bottle with polish on ALL the other bottles.</li>
            <li> The polish has stronger smell &amp; longer drying time than other brands...</li>
            <li> Not sure why it looks different.</li>
            <li> As a small side note, I already had a bottle of the Holo Fuschia that I had found in a store in the local mall.</li>
            <li> The problems I had with this purchase was, I did not receive the free gift and my Madly Matte was dried up, cannot even use that one.</li>
            <li> These polishes are just thin, runny, clear polishes with glitter in them</li>
            <li> other than that no complaints!</li>
            <li> They were packed nearly in two little boxes, separated by thin cardboard, and wrapped in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> On black nails</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like they all have little rainbows in their bottle.</li>
            <li> For example - using a royal blue base under Chunky Holo Black will give you a certain look.</li>
            <li> There was also a complaint about that on the link to the Bluebell by itself, so at least I&#x27;m not the only one.  </li>
            <li> Wasted money</li>
            <li> Also, I received a pink sparkle named Jasmine Night instead of the Chunky Holo Candy, which I&#x27;m also disappointed by, but not overly much.  </li>
            <li> I tested them on fake nails without any base coat and they mostly look sparkly with an edge to them, but I&#x27;m sure once I put a base coat on it</li>
            <li> Hardly deposits color just a slight color deposit.</li>
            <li> However, it came, and I&#x27;m sad to say it&#x27;s almost/exactly the same color as the Chunky Holo Purple.  </li>
            <li> and they are VERY heavily laced with glitter.</li>
            <li> So these are effect polishes that need to be used over a dark base coat, which is what I expected when purchasing.</li>
            <li> They do not have enough color pigment to wear alone as a color, you need a base color underneath to help them out.</li>
            <li> It makes me sad to see people downvoting this because they don&#x27;t know how to use</li>
            <li> im so sad with this</li>
            <li> Disappointing</li>
            <li> I hate these polishes,  even tried to return them and failed.</li>
            <li> I however am disappointed with the BLUEBELL, it is labeled BLUEBELL</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> So worth the money really good quality.</li>
            <li> No duplicate colors, variety of different colors</li>
            <li> Received package on schedule, but there was a shattered bottle with polish on ALL the other bottles. There was also one bottle that was Blue Diamond (a glitter), so I&#x27;m missing one of the holos.</li>
            <li> I liked the colors. It shipped right away, and was packaged securely. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Great polishes for a great price.  These aren&#x27;t the same kind of holos like Color Club and China Glaze, these are jellies with holographic glitter (except for the Chrome one, that one looks like it&#x27;ll be more of a holographic polish like CC and CG type).  They are beautiful as topcoats over similarly-toned polishes and eye-catching over black, but really, the possibilities are endless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors in my pack: Candy, Poppy, Fuchsia, Scarlet, Clover, Teal, Purple, Black, Chrome, and the Madly Matte finisher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t receive any free earrings with mine, but that had no bearing on my choice of purchase, so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li> The colors are nice, just needs a solid-color base coat to get the whole effect of it. I prefer black, it makes the colors pop out more, so to speak. OR just a few layers to make it solid enough for the nail.  The problems I had with this purchase was, I did not receive the free gift and my Madly Matte was dried up, cannot even use that one. Also, I did not receive #233 Bluebell, instead I received #94 Holo Chrome.</li>
            <li> This selection includes a nice range of vibrant colored jellies/transparents with fiery interference and rainbow holo glitter. The color combinations are complimentary but very eye-catching and unique. As with most Kleancolor polishes, set aside a little extra time for your mani due to longer drying times. This is especially true since they&#x27;re jellies, since you&#x27;ll probably want several coats if you&#x27;re not layering over other colors. Do try the matte topcoat to give the holo effect even more depth and drama. Gorgeous!</li>
            <li> Nail polish can be tricky; these particular ones look as if they are all holographic and pretty, but they are all more glazes than solid colors. Also, most of them have the same glitter in them, making them all pretty much look the same. One of them would have been fine; this many is too many.</li>
            <li> Very nice item&lt;br /&gt;thank u very mucht</li>
            <li> All these colors are quite unique and eye catching. I cannot wait to give as gifts to my many tweens, teenager, and young women nieces! They admired  the original color I purchased, black chunky halo, so I know they will be thrilled with these.</li>
            <li> I love the different colors but the consistency of  nail polish is sticky and it takes forever to dry.  I have used many different kinds of  kleancolor nail polish and this is the only kind I&#x27;ve found to be sticky and hard to put on. I also have to use a different solid color on the bottom because the colors are so clear they don&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> The Chunky Holos are not meant to be used on their own to make an opaque (solid) color on your nail. If you put on 3-4 coats, you can possibly achieve that, but it may still seem sheer and goopy. The Chunky Holos are meant to be glitter toppers, and they&#x27;re supposed to go over other colors of polish to give them a holographic or different color sheen to them. For example - using a royal blue base under Chunky Holo Black will give you a certain look. Kleancolor polish as a general rule is thicker and sometimes long-drying. You have to either be patient and let it dry thoroughly between coats (maybe 10-15 minutes) or use a thick, quick dry top coat (Seche Vite, Poshe). Kleancolor also tends to have more odor than other polishes. However, it is fairly well regarded in the polish community. If you are new to nail polish, you might want to look up the polish names online to see examples of what it looks like. I guarantee you that multiple bloggers have already done that with the whole collection. It makes me sad to see people downvoting this because they don&#x27;t know how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Source: Me. I own over 1,500 bottles of polish (including the normal Kleancolor holos and a Chunky) and actively seek offbeat and vintage nail polish.</li>
            <li> I gave this set three out of five stars because I haven&#x27;t used any of the colors yet, but from what I can see they look like mainly glitter. The color shows up better and is more intense when there&#x27;s a base color along with the glitter.</li>
            <li> These are actually really beautiful top coats and a great value. Lots of higher end dupes included.</li>
            <li> Very sheer colors. Hardly deposits color just a slight color deposit. Wish it was a little more vibrant.</li>
            <li> The colors are bright and many only require one coat!</li>
            <li> More of a top coat, unless you are willing to do at least 4 coats. Gorgeous and shiny, buy it :)</li>
            <li> I thought I was purchasing hologram nail polish, instead it was just a glitter top coat. I am highly upset! I would not refer this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really love these - they are great for creating different effects.  They aren&#x27;t really good to use alone unless you just want a glitter look.  I use them with the Kleancolor matte finish polishes, the put one of these on top.</li>
            <li> So these are effect polishes that need to be used over a dark base coat, which is what I expected when purchasing. While a few of the colors are quite nice, they don&#x27;t really have a whole lot of variation like the seem to in the bottle, but there is a noticeable difference if you are using it over black or white bases. I would have given this set a 3 star rating because the colors aren&#x27;t different enough to really need this many bottles, and you have to use a thicker top coat over it to get the polish smooth; but, for the price it&#x27;s a great deal.  I ended up giving away quite few of them to friends, (because honestly, how many glitter top coats does one REALLY need?) and they were all quite pleased. The glitter quality is excellent compared to other brands and it&#x27;s very well distributed; you don&#x27;t have clumping or inconsistent separation where the glitter falls to the bottom of the bottle and they are VERY heavily laced with glitter. It seems to stay well on the nail, but I use these over acrylic so I&#x27;m not sure how they would do over real nails since glitter polishes often come off easily on real nails because of the texture variation and the need to use several coats of different polish as I&#x27;ve mentioned above. I&#x27;ve not tried out the matte polish yet, but will update this review if there is anything interesting to say about it.</li>
            <li> This set is a nice addition to my collection... The color shifting glitter in a slightly tinted base is great for layering over other polishes... The polish has stronger smell &amp; longer drying time than other brands... Best used with a fast drying top coat :)</li>
            <li> The colors were beautiful (the holographic ones in particular!), and arrived in good packaging. The person I gave these  as a gift to were happy. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Not only did this item come in on time it was exactly what I wanted, with a free pair of earrings included in as well as a couple of extra nail polish thrown in as well. I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> Some of the nailpolish where good but other i cant even see the diference, so im so sad with this, anyway... the matte nailpolish is good though</li>
            <li> I hate these polishes,  even tried to return them and failed. These polishes are just thin, runny, clear polishes with glitter in them</li>
            <li> These colors are beautiful...in the bottle. They go decent over another nail color (white/black) but they are &#x27;waery&#x27; and take several coats even with a basecoat to come close to what they look like it the bottle. If you are looking for some inexpensive colors for your tweens, you can&#x27;t beat the price on these.</li>
            <li> Love the brand, so I&#x27;m just adding to my collection.</li>
            <li> Just ok.  Some of the colors don&#x27;t dry well and are goopy.</li>
            <li> Too many coats to show awesome colors</li>
            <li> I was worried about the packaging when they arrived, but all of the bottles were intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***IMPORTANT*** These colors work best over an opaque coat of polish like black or white. They are very sheer colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far loving the colors I tried and can&#x27;t wait to use the others. The longevity of the polish seems to be 4 - 5 days without a top coat and 8+ days with a top coat. The Fushia color is slightly different than the picture. It&#x27;s more dark. Not sure why it looks different.</li>
            <li> I love these! They look great as a top coat are by them self. The only thing is that they are glittered so does take time to get it off the nails.</li>
            <li> Love this collection ♡♡♡ great deal from Pandora collection... my favorite  is the black chunky holo. On black nails it&#x27;s totally holographic. A red, yellow, &amp;green . Which is very popular here in hawaii. Enjoy all the others as well. Smooth polish considering how much glitter is in them.</li>
            <li> Nice polish. But I think it should be used on top of regular polish because this is glitter polish..  But I like</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used these yet, not real crazy about some of the colors, but look like a good winter set. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> love the colors but one bottle arrived broken and got all over the other bottles....but still happy</li>
            <li> Beautiful colors but definitely not holo they&#x27;re just glittery and have all the same glitter undertones. Disappointing but they&#x27;re still pretty on my nails :)</li>
            <li> These are pretty but they aren&#x27;t quite what I was expecting them to be, they also take forever to dry and have a really strong plastic type smell to them.</li>
            <li> I bought this set thinking I was getting holographic/prismatic polishes, but they are actually just tinted prismatic glitter polishes. They do not have enough color pigment to wear alone as a color, you need a base color underneath to help them out. They are still very pretty though, and I am not returning them. They will be a pleasant addition to my glitter collection. But if you are looking for holographic/prismatic polishes then I suggest looking for another brand.</li>
            <li> I had never used Klean Color polish before, but i have to say I love these! The only thing that i didn&#x27;t care for was the smell, but it&#x27;s nail polish, they all stink right? Was shipped and received super fast!!</li>
            <li> For the value - this is a great collection of holos.  Colors are as pretty on the nails as in the bottle, and when the sun hits they shine and produce perfect holos.  The only issue I had was after 3 coats on the two colors I used, I still had visible nail lines.  I will have to use a regular polish under the holos in the future for these, which is not difficult, just a little more effort and time.  The Matt White worked on the glitter polish I covered quite well.  I was happy with the variety of colors, the matt and the value for the money.  I can recommend, with the note you&#x27;ll need to provide an undercoat of solid polish.  The free earring was a black plastic bow that is not something I&#x27;d wear, but as a free gift I can give to someone who will enjoy it.  A nice touch.</li>
            <li> I found this product and was intrigued by the unique color and effect. It took about 10 days to ship, which was pretty fast. They were packed nearly in two little boxes, separated by thin cardboard, and wrapped in bubble wrap. The bottles were in great condition, but one of the bottles leaked a teeny bit. The colors are very beautiful. The pictures don&#x27;t do it justice. The holo Black is probably my favorite. For chunky polish, it goes on evenly in a few coats and will stay as long as you use a top coat. (Although an under coat may be necessary.) They sparkle in the sun and shine brightly. As a small side note, I already had a bottle of the Holo Fuschia that I had found in a store in the local mall. It&#x27;s not an issue, but the Fuschia I received in this order is a different color. It&#x27;s not completely different, just a little bit darker than the ordered one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture says there&#x27;s a color called &#x27;Bluebell&#x27; included, but I did not receive it. I was a little put down, because that was one of the colors I was looking forward to the most. But I received a color called &#x27;Holo Chrome&#x27; in it&#x27;s place. The Chrome is a pleasant surprise. It&#x27;s a sparkly blue and white mixture, still quite pretty, despite not being what I ordered. (It&#x27;s a lot like Icing&#x27;s &#x27;Epic Winning&#x27; color, just with smaller sparkles.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else was ship-shape. The colors are gorgeous and wonderfully unique. The free earring gift was a plastic purple bow jewel. One was broken, but can be very easily fixed, and I got them for free, so I won&#x27;t complain and wear them. :)</li>
            <li> I just got this set today after hemming and hawing over the price for weeks.  I was excited to get the Chunky Holo Bluebell, though I was aware it might not come with my set, due to the complaints of others.  However, it came, and I&#x27;m sad to say it&#x27;s almost/exactly the same color as the Chunky Holo Purple.  There was also a complaint about that on the link to the Bluebell by itself, so at least I&#x27;m not the only one.  I wondered at first if they mislabeled it or something, but the only difference I can tell between the two is one is just a tiiiiiny bit darker than the other if there isn&#x27;t any light hitting it.  Also, I received a pink sparkle named Jasmine Night instead of the Chunky Holo Candy, which I&#x27;m also disappointed by, but not overly much.  I assume it looks about the same.  Otherwise, I got the rest of the colors and I&#x27;m very happy with them.  I tested them on fake nails without any base coat and they mostly look sparkly with an edge to them, but I&#x27;m sure once I put a base coat on it&#x27;ll look great.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with them.</li>
            <li> recently I ordered the 12 set metallic and the BLUEBELL chunky holo and the and the chunky holo black. I am so in love with the metallic and the black. I however am disappointed with the BLUEBELL, it is labeled BLUEBELL BUT it is NOT anywhere near a blue/purple color as shown in the picture. It is more of a pink/fuchsia color. I would love to contact someone about this. other than that no complaints! Oh also I love the way how they came in sets of 4 double wrapped in bubble wrap!</li>
            <li> I love all the different colors to choose from!  Great value for the price and if you love nail polish like I do this would be the place!</li>
            <li> Even though those were my only issue...The product is Awsome... Love the colors and would order again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it holo , its more like glitter polish, its clear and only works if you put it over another colour, that is why they send you the white (which is super chunky and dries weirdly), but if you put it over another brand or colour it looks pretty cool. I did rasberry pink scented polish and put holo candy on top looked pretty cute. Did the white with holo blue bell on my toes because the white chips off so fast doesnt really work on fingers well.</li>
            <li> I did not receive the blueberry color chunky holo that was shown in the picture.</li>
            <li> When they first arrived they looked like all the same color and was very upset but after when i looked at them in a different light i could see the differences, however they don&#x27;t exactly match the colors shown they look more red than anything (except the blue and green). The main reason i bought it was for the chunky holo black. It was perfect like the picture but i do wish the sparkles were more green than orange.</li>
            <li> They are perfect for making 3-dimensional stamping designs. JUST be patient though, these take longer to dry than their other colors, which makes sense because they are thicker to make it 3-d. I have not seen any other nail polish products sold that have the colorful dimension that kleancolor has. They all are beautiful whether used alone or together with their other polishes for stamping. They turn different shades of their specific color ever time you move your hand or the light changes on them. It&#x27;s like they all have little rainbows in their bottle. You really can&#x27;t appreciate the colors by looking at pictures or the screen of a computer. It just does not do them justice.&lt;br /&gt;These are perfect for adults or teens but I don&#x27;t think they would make a great present for anyone younger. Not because  there&#x27;s anything wrong with the polish but because the user really needs to have more patience with these specifically.  The polishes are thicker and take more &amp;#34;talent&amp;#34; to paint your nails and it definitely requires more patience to wait until they are dry. If you want to get these amazing colors for your preteen or younger kleancolor has metallic and so many other sets of colors you can be sure they won&#x27;t get bored with the same colors. All their sets have absolutely beautiful and brilliant colors that just can&#x27;t be described. You will not be disappointed by the colors or how easily it spreads on your nails, how long the color lasts or how long your manicure lasts.</li>
            <li> Polish is to sheer. You would have to use more than 3 coats. Wasted money</li>
