            <li>It did not rinse out like the original, and it made my hair feel almost greasy.</li>
            <li>This product is not the original (which I found in a salon yesterday and purchased.</li>

            <li>Smells like the original, but something was different.</li>

            <li> I tried this and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny my hair is.  </li>
            <li> It was very dry and coarse and I have tried several products at salons that say they will fix your hair from breaking off and paid major money to only be let down.  </li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair that has been foiled and colored for years.  </li>
            <li> When I say I&#x27;ve spent over $800 trying to find a Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that actually works</li>
            <li> My hair is soo SOFT &amp; Fluffy.</li>

            <li> It tends to be on the dry side</li>
            <li> Amazon &amp; they dry my hair out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to blow dry my hair, so if the texture changes I&#x27;ll update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I belive, so they always dry your hair out.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time for me since only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> Such a shame, because this product is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I prefer the healthysexyhair products to the silkysexyhair, they seem to work better for my type of hair and they don&#x27;t have that annoying smell.</li>
            <li> Half black Half</li>
            <li> I have thick and long hair, and I have to say this conditioner works wonders.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times.</li>

            <li> Without it my hair is hard to brush through.  </li>
            <li> As a surfer in the sun and ocean all day my waist length thick wavy hair was in knots (think fat ropes)</li>

            <li> I have combination hair thats mostly curly and frizzy, but slightly wavy in parts. It tends to be on the dry side so conditioner is a huge deal for me. I did not find that this conditioner did too much for my hair. It didn&#x27;t make it feel any drier than using my previous conditioner, and I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell. It&#x27;s kind of like an apple jolly rancher smell, which was great at first, but got old by the third wash. Luckily it doesn&#x27;t linger in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t reccomend this conditioner to anyone, but it isn&#x27;t terrible either. I prefer the healthysexyhair products to the silkysexyhair, they seem to work better for my type of hair and they don&#x27;t have that annoying smell.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over five years and it has never lost its effectiveness.  My hair drinks in the moisture, even during swimming season and even with ten years of constant hair color.  It&#x27;s the best.  I never write reviews but saw an opportunity to write this one so here it is!  Try it.  So glad my stylist carried it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my daughter - she uses it religiously!</li>
            <li> I already have straight  fine hair but uses this just the same. Love that it makes my hair soft and smooth even more.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of conditioners and this is great for my dry hair.  I love it.</li>
            <li> My kids are mixed chicks.  Half black Half white1  This is great because it is not to oily in my hair (I am White) and it is excellent in my girls hair.  I would definitely recommend for mixed kids hair, or coarse hair... This stuff has helped bring my hair and the kids hair back to silky smooth... Love it just not to fond of the smell, it smells like grape children&#x27;s Tylenol to me</li>
            <li> Been using this product for years.  Best I have found for my hair.  Lasts a long time for me since only need a small amount.</li>
            <li> As a surfer in the sun and ocean all day my waist length thick wavy hair was in knots (think fat ropes) WOW! SHS conditioner is bliss! Love it, shared it, using it forever! Ocean Girl Project!</li>
            <li> nothing can compare to this product for thick/course hair......enough said!&lt;br /&gt;it was recommend by my hair salon, so I.purchased the product there; however, after using &amp; experiencing the shine, silkiness &amp; feel of thinned out hair.....I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to find a larger quantity, so I checked out Amazon....there it was!  I like to find the best bang for my buck.</li>
            <li> This is the only conditioner I use. It&#x27;s the only product I&#x27;ve found that truly lives up to it&#x27;s name. My hair is softer &amp; more manageable than it is with any other product.</li>
            <li> So I purchased this hoping it was the real thing. I used it a few times. Smells like the original, but something was different. It did not rinse out like the original, and it made my hair feel almost greasy. Then the itching started. The original NEVER made my head itch (usually due to added sulfates, which I am very sensitive to.) This product is not the original (which I found in a salon yesterday and purchased. Night and day difference.) Such a shame, because this product is hard to find. I thought I had found a new supplier, but no luck.</li>
            <li> I have very long blonde hair that has been foiled and colored for years.  It was very dry and coarse and I have tried several products at salons that say they will fix your hair from breaking off and paid major money to only be let down.  I tried this and couldn&#x27;t believe how soft and shiny my hair is.  Even the hair dresser say I have beautiful hair and its so soft and shiny.  I really think this is the best I have used ever!</li>
            <li> Meh. Smells good, not very thick.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this conditioner.  Without it my hair is hard to brush through.  This smells wonderful and fruity and makes your hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used - even by third day - hair still looks good.  Not the second day greasy.</li>
            <li> Great product, came faster than expected and that is a plus!</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!  I&#x27;VE BEEN USING THIS FOR YEARS...ABSOLUTELY THE BEST FOR YOUR HAIR!!</li>
            <li> OMGEE! When I say I&#x27;ve spent over $800 trying to find a Shampoo &amp; Conditioner that actually works....... (-_-) I mean it.  BUT This Conditioner (^○^)/ I just used it and washed my hair out. My hair is soo SOFT &amp; Fluffy. I&#x27;ve bought some of the top brands for course hair &amp; they didn&#x27;t work. I also bought the big orange bottles (other brand) off Amazon &amp; they dry my hair out. NOT This one. I&#x27;m about to blow dry my hair, so if the texture changes I&#x27;ll update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I accidentally ordered the wrong shampoo so I&#x27;m not sure how that one works. Shampoo contains sodium? I belive, so they always dry your hair out. I just stick to conditioner, and organic egg treatment. TRY IT! Omgee. I have to tell EVERYONE ♡♡</li>
            <li> I have thick and long hair, and I have to say this conditioner works wonders. Ever since I began using this conditioner, I have noticed my hair looks and feels more healthy and silky. While the conditioner does smell like bananas, I do not mind the smell because it works great on my hair.</li>
