            <li>Excellent product!</li>
            <li>and i am thrilled with t!!!!!!</li>
            <li>Really great for frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li>Best of all, it moisturizes without making my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>and I thought I had found the ideal conditioner.  </li>
            <li>A good sign!</li>
            <li>My hair feels good after use!</li>
            <li>Smells great too.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, I use it weekly, my hair feels and looks great.  </li>
            <li>but even if I just wait a minute before I rinse it still does a great job.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li>This rehab cream worked really great.</li>
            <li>hair - lol.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 6 weeks and may hair looks great....</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li>My hair certainly isn&#x27;t perfect now, but it&#x27;s better than before and a good start toward healthier hair.</li>
            <li>It has a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>/&gt;First off, he loved this stuff.  </li>
            <li>surprise was that I also loved this product.  </li>
            <li>the good side,</li>
            <li>This product is supposed to be good for damaged and color dyed hair and is supposed to make your hair feel softer.  </li>
            <li>I really love this creme!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>Works best if started at ends first and then worked into rest of hair.</li>
            <li>I had great hopes as the creme smells fantastic and made my hair feel silky in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I color and sometimes use heat (flat-iron, blow drier) on my hair, and this product seemed to treat my hair nicely.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The smell is minty, which is a nice change from the gamut of floral and/or fruity products out there.  </li>
            <li>Nice minty</li>
            <li>The smell was nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>It seemed to work best in addition, but it&#x27;s pretty potent.</li>
            <li>It was easy to use and nice going in.</li>
            <li>The first thing you notice is the smell, smells very nice, like a salon...</li>
            <li>feel satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave your hair silky, looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li>Not quite the magic fix I had hoped.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love a citrus or even better an exotic woodsy or spicy scent--why don&#x27;t more shampoos and conditioners go for the spicy or citrus or woodsy?</li>
            <li>Love what this does for my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is smoother, silkier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>The biggest surprise for me is it didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy in about two days like most conditioners.</li>
            <li>Of course how many treatments you get out of a tube will depend on the thickness and length of your hair.</li>
            <li>It love the way it makes my hair feel and it was cheaper here than at Target.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this on my colored hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make the color wear out faster.  </li>
            <li>Leave your hair smooth and silky!</li>
            <li>No greasy or weighted feeling, shiny, healthy-looking hair with no frizz or static.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li>I was pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this treatment.</li>
            <li>So really not terrible cost-wise.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I have healthy hair.</li>
            <li>My hair as never been in better condition.</li>
            <li>shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li>It is supposed to be weekly, and you might be able to get a month out of it if you stretch it.  </li>
            <li>Product is OK.</li>
            <li>love it have to admit I want to use it more than once a week-</li>
            <li>This is just okay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Update:  I still love this product.  </li>
            <li>The Weekly Rehab is nice but nothing special.</li>
            <li>Is pretty good for its price point.</li>
            <li>He felt it left his hair smooth and shiny, plus he couldn&#x27;t get over the wonderful smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This works great and makes my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>My hair was fine for most of the time.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Pantene products....seems there shampoos and conditioners and everything else does better for my hair than anyone else&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li>It helps smooth my hair and also gives it a healthy look which dyes can sometimes seem to strip away for a bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite drugstore brand treatment, but it worked pretty well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>Made my hair SUPER GREASY as I followed the instructions perfectly, yet still had to shower the next morning because my hair worked like a grease-ball.</li>
            <li>It has a refreshi8ng fragrance and goes on easily.</li>
            <li>and it came very quickly</li>
            <li>My hair has always been fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, for the downsides: I can&#x27;t say that I was super impressed with the results, as everything that I mentioned that it did, any number of other conditioners also accomplish.  </li>
            <li>Have noticed it does a good job of that (although hard to measure more than using good conditioners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great conditioning cream.</li>
            <li>My ends looked smooth and were not pointing in every direction.</li>
            <li>It’s important to know</li>
            <li>Something to smooth the fried hair and help keep it from breaking when brushing and styling it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m really excited about the results.</li>
            <li>Not as rich as I had hoped.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will probably buy it in the future.</li>
            <li>At the end of the day, contrasting my experience with those others have had, I just think this product works best on hair that is pretty much the opposite of mine.  </li>
            <li>Normally, my hair will tangle very easily, but after I got out of the shower and towel-dried my hair, my wet-brush slipped through my hair like &amp;#34;buttah.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>This is a good conditioner, though I&#x27;m not sure it does amazing repairs to damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>However, once dried my hair had none of the promised brilliant shine and smoothness.  </li>
            <li>I love Pantene but the Weekly Rehab doesn’t seem to be more conditioning than any of the regular</li>
            <li>This really, however, isn&#x27;t a good choice for my baby fine hair - perhaps for someone with a different hair texture would benefit.</li>
            <li>This tube is good for a travel size I get about about 3 uses out of it, I have long hair,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair feeling nice and soft after use, which is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li>As an added note, it seems to work nicely in conjunction with the Pantene Pro-V Expert Dry Conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light</li>
            <li>I use it mainly right before and right after I color my hair, and on special occasions.</li>
            <li>very baby fine &amp; hi-lighted  </li>
            <li>However, if you do have fine hair, then I don&#x27;t truly recommend it unless you have products that really help add volume.  </li>
            <li>However, if you do have fine hair, then I don&#x27;t truly recommend it unless you have products that really help add volume.  </li>
            <li>My hair is still a little fly away, but it is much easier to smooth</li>
            <li>The Mosa mint oil smells great, even though I don&#x27;t really know what Mosa is, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin or sensitive nose, so that is a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a far more in-depth treatment for all your hair problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s mint extract in this conditioner, which surprised me, but I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li>So, I thought it was worth the try.</li>
            <li>All in all i would say that this isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>The aroma also isn&#x27;t super strong, so all of those who are sensitive to fragrances will probably not have any issues on that front with this.  </li>
            <li>hair was soft and amazingly for something like this it did not look or feel oily any sooner than it normally would have.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I wish it smelled mintier and tingled more, but that&#x27;s hardly a deal-breaker.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I keep going back for it as it works so well at such a great price.  </li>
            <li>it was so super straight.  </li>
            <li>cream is most definitely thicker than I am used to.</li>
            <li>this is the weekly rehab creme (which is step 4 of the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34;), and it does what it says.</li>
            <li>This has really helped!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it with an after hair-wash conditioner with the dryer and a curly hair product.  </li>
            <li>It works pretty well for me</li>
            <li>It leaves hair extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>The first time i used this though, after my hair (air) dryed i noticed an immediate difference  </li>
            <li>This is just what ive been looking for, it makes my hair feel soft and look smooth.</li>
            <li>so I do have a mix of wiry hair mixed in with super fine strands),</li>
            <li>After drying my hair it was definitely soft, smooth, and silky.  </li>
            <li>After using this my hair is smooth and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, which is both unexpected from a conditioning treatment and a welcome surprise.  </li>
            <li>I tried sprucing it up some, but my bangs were having none of it, and just fell flatly in my eye&#x27;s instead of doing a cute swoop.  </li>
            <li>- maybe this would be good for ends only, and as I said below, only if I&#x27;m not going anywhere.</li>
            <li>This rehab cream is exactly the type of intense conditioner I need.</li>
            <li>The slight minty scent and feel are also nice.</li>
            <li>My ends get easily damaged and well its really obvious that they are split.  </li>
            <li>My hair has been super soft since using this.</li>
            <li>While rendered incredibly soft by the creme, my fine, naturally curly hair remained stubbornly poofy.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really expect that much when I tossed it in my cart, but it certainly delivered.</li>
            <li>This comes in a tiny tube, though you don&#x27;t need very much to get a full condition.  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll want to rinse your hair very well after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t need as much of this as I do shampoo to get an even coverage.</li>
            <li>this works very well.</li>
            <li>It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Well, I tried this shampoo and really did not see any noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li>This is most likely a lovely combination of my heritage (Spanish, French, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll just have to keep using my apple cider vinegar rinse until this product returns to a reasonable price again.</li>
            <li>My super frizzy hair is barely frizzy at all.</li>
            <li>I let it dry naturally, and it&#x27;s very smooth and silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, no tangles, easy to comb through.</li>
            <li>hair: Shoulder length, color-treated, baby fine, dry, some waviness</li>
            <li>really it felt like i was just putting normal conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li>Depending on hair length and thickness, I don&#x27;t think this would last longer than about a month of weekly uses, but at $3.99 (Amazon price) and using it to set your hair back on track, I think that&#x27;s an OK price to pay.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big fan of the Pantene hair care line but this weekly rehab creme left me wanting more.  </li>
            <li>when it was all said and done, I found that the conditioner had done a decent job with detangling.  </li>
            <li>don&#x27;t feel like the rehab creme did much more than my regular daily conditioner did.  </li>
            <li>It probably works best on those with thick, longer hair that needs some taming after humid days and hair that needs some &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; after being color dyed and dried with a hair dryer for some time.  </li>
            <li>Overall my hair was shiny smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad conditioner, per se, especially since so many have had great experiences with it, and other than a bit of resulting dryness, it worked okay for me.  </li>
            <li>It made my hair super silky, it did feel revitalized, it was definitely smoother than it normally is when I finish blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>It works just ok for me for temporary use, or when budget is tight.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my experience, and subsequently reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I fully agree with the other reviewers who have suggested that this product likely works best on those who have finer hair; it just didn&#x27;t have much of an impact on mine, at all.  </li>
            <li>I think if one would have fine hair, however, then you would not want to use as much as it might flatten it a bit and weigh it down.  </li>
            <li>And you only have to use a little bit for such great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s maybe a little thicker than most conditioners and is designed to really go to work and cut down on frizz and make your hair smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s not nearly as thick as I was expecting it to be, and I found that it took quite a bit before my hair felt truly coated by the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>I have really curly, soft hair.  </li>
            <li>Further, as someone who has ultra sensitive skin, many products can cause breakouts for me, but this has not, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still, I find that in the harsh Louisiana heat, my hair sometimes isn’t as healthy as it could be.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about this when I first read about it, but after using it I am happy to report that I do see a different in the smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to try this out of desperation and WOW!</li>
            <li>It seems to do the job much better than ordinary conditioners you might use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Further, when it comes to the softness issue - and it does deliver that in varying degrees - I found that it also made my hair pretty frizzy.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li>If you are coloring your hair or abusing it in other ways this probably will give it just a bit more extra help.</li>
            <li>I would always have fine hairs sticking out making me look a mess.</li>
            <li>Otherwise you will be left with super flat hair that sticks to your head.</li>
            <li>It makes a clear difference.</li>
            <li>This creme makes my hair feel luxurious, soft, and healthy....and look that way too.</li>
            <li>For as inexpensive as it is, my hair is shiny and soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li>I find that using this product weekly, as directly, my hair gets a bit of an oomph factor.  </li>
            <li>So far, it seems to work for me.  </li>
            <li>Pantene makes it soft.....</li>
            <li>lives my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I couldn’t believe how soft my hair was after just one use.</li>
            <li>I follow the directions to apply after shampooing, comb through with fingers, making sure the ends are thoroughly drenched with product, rinsing after at least 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Made my hair soft, so I will use sparingly to finish then not purchase again....</li>
            <li>I tried this based on a recommendation I&#x27;d read and it made my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>: this made my hair limp and greasy looking at the scalp - more than I anticipated - the next morning, I looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in days</li>
            <li>It gives a slight mint tingle when first put on the hair, though it doesn&#x27;t really smell like mint.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use this weekly, mainly since I&#x27;ve gotten my hair used to only being washed every four or five days anyhow.</li>
            <li>I usually use better conditioner that comes in a big tub.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t condition it properly, my baby fine hair tends to go wild and frizzy; however, if I over-condition it, it becomes limp and drab and life-less.</li>
            <li>Certainly it won&#x27;t hurt, but it is smaller and pricier than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li>hair is color treated (lightly highlighted) but has damage due to repeated use of a hot comb over the past six months.  </li>
            <li>I have very ruly, dry course hair and this product</li>
            <li>I have short, dry, flay away hair ad live in the southern California desert where there is usually a hot wind blowing.  </li>
            <li>I washed my hair as usual, and then applied about a quarter size of the Pantene, rubbed my palms together, and then distributed the conditioner throughout my hair, paying special attention to the ends, and let it set for two minutes while I showered, then rinsed.  </li>
            <li>No build-up, soft hair, without being too voluminous (my hair has enough volume, it doesn&#x27;t need anymore from products).</li>
            <li>\\&quot;rehab creme\\&quot; left my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li>And if you ask me how long does the product work, well let me start by reiterating that I do wash my hair every day, and I&#x27;m on day five after using the product, and my hair is still softer than it normally is.  </li>
            <li>I used a good quarter-sized amount for my shoulder-length thick hair and left it in for a few minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i am going to get the other 3 components to see how they all interact.&lt;br /&gt;but, as a stand-alone component, this really does what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>This once a week treatment is top quality, as you would expect from Pantene, but I found I needed to use if sparingly and concentrate on the ends of my hair or it could be a little limp.</li>
            <li>the humid weather I live in, and the fact that I have to wash and dry my hair every morning which has damaged it.  </li>
            <li>My hair looks wild and frizzy, like cotton candy on a bad day at the fair.  </li>
            <li>I tried the creme multiple times but got the same soft cotton puff like results whether I air-dried or used a hair-dryer.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the shampoo in the same line to try as well, but I found this conditioner surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li>time I used it without the second product, just the pro-creme, no other product..  </li>
            <li>My dry, brittle, breaking hair is soft!</li>
            <li>first, I was a bit surprised how small the tube is, but then I did that thing called &amp;#34;reading&amp;#34; and realized that this product isn&#x27;t for daily or every shower use but for weekly use.</li>
            <li>My hair was fine, not remarkable but fine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have fine hair &amp; if I use it all over, it leaves my hair weighed down &amp; limp.</li>
            <li>I just choose a day when I have nowhere to go, condition my hair, and let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise you will be left with super flat hair that sticks to your head.ofter than they usually are.  </li>
            <li>The type of conditioner one might normally use every other week</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s Very easy to use, and though the tube is fairly small, even with thick hair</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Works great!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!</li>
            <li> and i am thrilled with t!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Really great for frizzy hair!  </li>
            <li> Best of all, it moisturizes without making my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> and I thought I had found the ideal conditioner.  </li>
            <li> A good sign!</li>
            <li> My hair feels good after use!</li>
            <li> Smells great too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it weekly, my hair feels and looks great.  </li>
            <li> but even if I just wait a minute before I rinse it still does a great job.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m happy.  </li>
            <li> This rehab cream worked really great.</li>
            <li> hair - lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 6 weeks and may hair looks great....</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  </li>
            <li> My hair certainly isn&#x27;t perfect now, but it&#x27;s better than before and a good start toward healthier hair.</li>
            <li> It has a pleasant scent</li>
            <li> /&gt;First off, he loved this stuff.  </li>
            <li> surprise was that I also loved this product.  </li>
            <li> the good side,</li>
            <li> This product is supposed to be good for damaged and color dyed hair and is supposed to make your hair feel softer.  </li>
            <li> I really love this creme!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> Works best if started at ends first and then worked into rest of hair.</li>
            <li> I had great hopes as the creme smells fantastic and made my hair feel silky in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I color and sometimes use heat (flat-iron, blow drier) on my hair, and this product seemed to treat my hair nicely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The smell is minty, which is a nice change from the gamut of floral and/or fruity products out there.  </li>
            <li> Nice minty</li>
            <li> The smell was nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> It seemed to work best in addition, but it&#x27;s pretty potent.</li>
            <li> It was easy to use and nice going in.</li>
            <li> The first thing you notice is the smell, smells very nice, like a salon...</li>
            <li> feel satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave your hair silky, looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> Not quite the magic fix I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love a citrus or even better an exotic woodsy or spicy scent--why don&#x27;t more shampoos and conditioners go for the spicy or citrus or woodsy?</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is smoother, silkier and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> The biggest surprise for me is it didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy in about two days like most conditioners.</li>
            <li> Of course how many treatments you get out of a tube will depend on the thickness and length of your hair.</li>
            <li> It love the way it makes my hair feel and it was cheaper here than at Target.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this on my colored hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make the color wear out faster.  </li>
            <li> Leave your hair smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> No greasy or weighted feeling, shiny, healthy-looking hair with no frizz or static.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ll buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this treatment.</li>
            <li> So really not terrible cost-wise.</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I have healthy hair.</li>
            <li> My hair as never been in better condition.</li>
            <li> shiny and healthy.  </li>
            <li> It is supposed to be weekly, and you might be able to get a month out of it if you stretch it.  </li>
            <li> Product is OK.</li>
            <li> love it have to admit I want to use it more than once a week-</li>
            <li> This is just okay.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Update:  I still love this product.  </li>
            <li> The Weekly Rehab is nice but nothing special.</li>
            <li> Is pretty good for its price point.</li>
            <li> He felt it left his hair smooth and shiny, plus he couldn&#x27;t get over the wonderful smell.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This works great and makes my hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> My hair was fine for most of the time.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Pantene products....seems there shampoos and conditioners and everything else does better for my hair than anyone else&#x27;s products.  </li>
            <li> It helps smooth my hair and also gives it a healthy look which dyes can sometimes seem to strip away for a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite drugstore brand treatment, but it worked pretty well and has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Made my hair SUPER GREASY as I followed the instructions perfectly, yet still had to shower the next morning because my hair worked like a grease-ball.</li>
            <li> It has a refreshi8ng fragrance and goes on easily.</li>
            <li> and it came very quickly</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, for the downsides: I can&#x27;t say that I was super impressed with the results, as everything that I mentioned that it did, any number of other conditioners also accomplish.  </li>
            <li> Have noticed it does a good job of that (although hard to measure more than using good conditioners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great conditioning cream.</li>
            <li> My ends looked smooth and were not pointing in every direction.</li>
            <li> It’s important to know</li>
            <li> Something to smooth the fried hair and help keep it from breaking when brushing and styling it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m really excited about the results.</li>
            <li> Not as rich as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will probably buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> At the end of the day, contrasting my experience with those others have had, I just think this product works best on hair that is pretty much the opposite of mine.  </li>
            <li> Normally, my hair will tangle very easily, but after I got out of the shower and towel-dried my hair, my wet-brush slipped through my hair like &amp;#34;buttah.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner, though I&#x27;m not sure it does amazing repairs to damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> However, once dried my hair had none of the promised brilliant shine and smoothness.  </li>
            <li> I love Pantene but the Weekly Rehab doesn’t seem to be more conditioning than any of the regular</li>
            <li> This really, however, isn&#x27;t a good choice for my baby fine hair - perhaps for someone with a different hair texture would benefit.</li>
            <li> This tube is good for a travel size I get about about 3 uses out of it, I have long hair,&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling nice and soft after use, which is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> As an added note, it seems to work nicely in conjunction with the Pantene Pro-V Expert Dry Conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light</li>
            <li> I use it mainly right before and right after I color my hair, and on special occasions.</li>
            <li> very baby fine &amp; hi-lighted  </li>
            <li> However, if you do have fine hair, then I don&#x27;t truly recommend it unless you have products that really help add volume.  </li>
            <li> However, if you do have fine hair, then I don&#x27;t truly recommend it unless you have products that really help add volume.  </li>
            <li> My hair is still a little fly away, but it is much easier to smooth</li>
            <li> The Mosa mint oil smells great, even though I don&#x27;t really know what Mosa is, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin or sensitive nose, so that is a plus.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a far more in-depth treatment for all your hair problems.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s mint extract in this conditioner, which surprised me, but I enjoyed it.  </li>
            <li> So, I thought it was worth the try.</li>
            <li> All in all i would say that this isn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> The aroma also isn&#x27;t super strong, so all of those who are sensitive to fragrances will probably not have any issues on that front with this.  </li>
            <li> hair was soft and amazingly for something like this it did not look or feel oily any sooner than it normally would have.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I wish it smelled mintier and tingled more, but that&#x27;s hardly a deal-breaker.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I keep going back for it as it works so well at such a great price.  </li>
            <li> it was so super straight.  </li>
            <li> cream is most definitely thicker than I am used to.</li>
            <li> this is the weekly rehab creme (which is step 4 of the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34;), and it does what it says.</li>
            <li> This has really helped!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it with an after hair-wash conditioner with the dryer and a curly hair product.  </li>
            <li> It works pretty well for me</li>
            <li> It leaves hair extremely soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> The first time i used this though, after my hair (air) dryed i noticed an immediate difference  </li>
            <li> This is just what ive been looking for, it makes my hair feel soft and look smooth.</li>
            <li> so I do have a mix of wiry hair mixed in with super fine strands),</li>
            <li> After drying my hair it was definitely soft, smooth, and silky.  </li>
            <li> After using this my hair is smooth and soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, which is both unexpected from a conditioning treatment and a welcome surprise.  </li>
            <li> I tried sprucing it up some, but my bangs were having none of it, and just fell flatly in my eye&#x27;s instead of doing a cute swoop.  </li>
            <li> - maybe this would be good for ends only, and as I said below, only if I&#x27;m not going anywhere.</li>
            <li> This rehab cream is exactly the type of intense conditioner I need.</li>
            <li> The slight minty scent and feel are also nice.</li>
            <li> My ends get easily damaged and well its really obvious that they are split.  </li>
            <li> My hair has been super soft since using this.</li>
            <li> While rendered incredibly soft by the creme, my fine, naturally curly hair remained stubbornly poofy.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really expect that much when I tossed it in my cart, but it certainly delivered.</li>
            <li> This comes in a tiny tube, though you don&#x27;t need very much to get a full condition.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll want to rinse your hair very well after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t need as much of this as I do shampoo to get an even coverage.</li>
            <li> this works very well.</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried this shampoo and really did not see any noticeable difference.  </li>
            <li> This is most likely a lovely combination of my heritage (Spanish, French, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll just have to keep using my apple cider vinegar rinse until this product returns to a reasonable price again.</li>
            <li> My super frizzy hair is barely frizzy at all.</li>
            <li> I let it dry naturally, and it&#x27;s very smooth and silky, and shiny.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, no tangles, easy to comb through.</li>
            <li> hair: Shoulder length, color-treated, baby fine, dry, some waviness</li>
            <li> really it felt like i was just putting normal conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li> Depending on hair length and thickness, I don&#x27;t think this would last longer than about a month of weekly uses, but at $3.99 (Amazon price) and using it to set your hair back on track, I think that&#x27;s an OK price to pay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Pantene hair care line but this weekly rehab creme left me wanting more.  </li>
            <li> when it was all said and done, I found that the conditioner had done a decent job with detangling.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t feel like the rehab creme did much more than my regular daily conditioner did.  </li>
            <li> It probably works best on those with thick, longer hair that needs some taming after humid days and hair that needs some &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; after being color dyed and dried with a hair dryer for some time.  </li>
            <li> Overall my hair was shiny smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad conditioner, per se, especially since so many have had great experiences with it, and other than a bit of resulting dryness, it worked okay for me.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair super silky, it did feel revitalized, it was definitely smoother than it normally is when I finish blow drying my hair.  </li>
            <li> It works just ok for me for temporary use, or when budget is tight.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my experience, and subsequently reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I fully agree with the other reviewers who have suggested that this product likely works best on those who have finer hair; it just didn&#x27;t have much of an impact on mine, at all.  </li>
            <li> I think if one would have fine hair, however, then you would not want to use as much as it might flatten it a bit and weigh it down.  </li>
            <li> And you only have to use a little bit for such great results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s maybe a little thicker than most conditioners and is designed to really go to work and cut down on frizz and make your hair smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s not nearly as thick as I was expecting it to be, and I found that it took quite a bit before my hair felt truly coated by the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> I have really curly, soft hair.  </li>
            <li> Further, as someone who has ultra sensitive skin, many products can cause breakouts for me, but this has not, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still, I find that in the harsh Louisiana heat, my hair sometimes isn’t as healthy as it could be.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this when I first read about it, but after using it I am happy to report that I do see a different in the smoothness of my hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to try this out of desperation and WOW!</li>
            <li> It seems to do the job much better than ordinary conditioners you might use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Further, when it comes to the softness issue - and it does deliver that in varying degrees - I found that it also made my hair pretty frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and shiny!  </li>
            <li> If you are coloring your hair or abusing it in other ways this probably will give it just a bit more extra help.</li>
            <li> I would always have fine hairs sticking out making me look a mess.</li>
            <li> Otherwise you will be left with super flat hair that sticks to your head.</li>
            <li> It makes a clear difference.</li>
            <li> This creme makes my hair feel luxurious, soft, and healthy....and look that way too.</li>
            <li> For as inexpensive as it is, my hair is shiny and soft when I use it.  </li>
            <li> I find that using this product weekly, as directly, my hair gets a bit of an oomph factor.  </li>
            <li> So far, it seems to work for me.  </li>
            <li> Pantene makes it soft.....</li>
            <li> lives my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I couldn’t believe how soft my hair was after just one use.</li>
            <li> I follow the directions to apply after shampooing, comb through with fingers, making sure the ends are thoroughly drenched with product, rinsing after at least 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> Made my hair soft, so I will use sparingly to finish then not purchase again....</li>
            <li> I tried this based on a recommendation I&#x27;d read and it made my hair feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> : this made my hair limp and greasy looking at the scalp - more than I anticipated - the next morning, I looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in days</li>
            <li> It gives a slight mint tingle when first put on the hair, though it doesn&#x27;t really smell like mint.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this weekly, mainly since I&#x27;ve gotten my hair used to only being washed every four or five days anyhow.</li>
            <li> I usually use better conditioner that comes in a big tub.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t condition it properly, my baby fine hair tends to go wild and frizzy; however, if I over-condition it, it becomes limp and drab and life-less.</li>
            <li> Certainly it won&#x27;t hurt, but it is smaller and pricier than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> hair is color treated (lightly highlighted) but has damage due to repeated use of a hot comb over the past six months.  </li>
            <li> I have very ruly, dry course hair and this product</li>
            <li> I have short, dry, flay away hair ad live in the southern California desert where there is usually a hot wind blowing.  </li>
            <li> I washed my hair as usual, and then applied about a quarter size of the Pantene, rubbed my palms together, and then distributed the conditioner throughout my hair, paying special attention to the ends, and let it set for two minutes while I showered, then rinsed.  </li>
            <li> No build-up, soft hair, without being too voluminous (my hair has enough volume, it doesn&#x27;t need anymore from products).</li>
            <li> \\&quot;rehab creme\\&quot; left my hair soft and shiney.</li>
            <li> And if you ask me how long does the product work, well let me start by reiterating that I do wash my hair every day, and I&#x27;m on day five after using the product, and my hair is still softer than it normally is.  </li>
            <li> I used a good quarter-sized amount for my shoulder-length thick hair and left it in for a few minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i am going to get the other 3 components to see how they all interact.&lt;br /&gt;but, as a stand-alone component, this really does what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This once a week treatment is top quality, as you would expect from Pantene, but I found I needed to use if sparingly and concentrate on the ends of my hair or it could be a little limp.</li>
            <li> the humid weather I live in, and the fact that I have to wash and dry my hair every morning which has damaged it.  </li>
            <li> My hair looks wild and frizzy, like cotton candy on a bad day at the fair.  </li>
            <li> I tried the creme multiple times but got the same soft cotton puff like results whether I air-dried or used a hair-dryer.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the shampoo in the same line to try as well, but I found this conditioner surprisingly effective.</li>
            <li> time I used it without the second product, just the pro-creme, no other product..  </li>
            <li> My dry, brittle, breaking hair is soft!</li>
            <li> first, I was a bit surprised how small the tube is, but then I did that thing called &amp;#34;reading&amp;#34; and realized that this product isn&#x27;t for daily or every shower use but for weekly use.</li>
            <li> My hair was fine, not remarkable but fine.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; if I use it all over, it leaves my hair weighed down &amp; limp.</li>
            <li> I just choose a day when I have nowhere to go, condition my hair, and let it dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise you will be left with super flat hair that sticks to your head.ofter than they usually are.  </li>
            <li> The type of conditioner one might normally use every other week</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Very easy to use, and though the tube is fairly small, even with thick hair</li>
            <li> The only thing I need to flat iron at the moment is just my ends.</li>
            <li> Since I followed the directions to the letter the first time that I used it,I decided to leave it on quite a bit longer the next time, thinking that maybe it just takes the product longer to penetrate thick, coarse hair; however, the results were the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do believe I will continue to use this product, but only on my ends, and not once a week, but perhaps once every two weeks, as it really does work, and makes my ends softer than they usually are.  </li>
            <li> this will be important a bit later, my hair is mid-back, thick, coarse, on the dry side, and has been subject to coloring and heat styling.  </li>
            <li> In fact, I didn&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair</li>
            <li> The totally flat look just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  </li>
            <li> No major changes were noticed.</li>
            <li> I only get one use from each tube because I have shoulder length, curly, coarse, Irish, - in other words a lot of think</li>
            <li> My hair is long and after a long rinse I had to soap up my back and legs in order to remove the creamy leftover slipperiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so would not last long on long hair.  </li>
            <li> But unfortunately for me it was also unmanageable, as the creme made it so silky and fine that it didn&#x27;t want to stay up, curl, or do anything but lay flat.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone from dark brunette to blonde then back to brunette again all in about a years time.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to leave it on long, a couple of minutes.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3/4 of a year now, but I still have a long ways to go.</li>
            <li> husbands hair is thick and very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My regular shampoo/conditioner (Pantene for curly hair) was starting to work less well, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
            <li> Since moving back to my mountain cove, my hair needs some extra attention, because of the dry air here (elevation about 3400 where my little log house is).</li>
            <li> My hair is very thick and grows very fast</li>
            <li> I have curly, color-treated hair, so it&#x27;s basically the dictionary definition of dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin and has a tendency to get weighed down and greasy looking if I use any kind of leave-in product (conditioner, mousse, gel, spray) or when I use moisturizing shampoos and/or heavy</li>
            <li> My wife loves Pantene products, so she looked forward to this, But, and she has naturally curly and thick hair, this left that limp and dry all week after she used this twice.</li>
            <li> What I look for in a deep conditioner is a little different, though--for a weekly use, I want that deeper conditioning and don&#x27;t mind if my hair is a little bit limper.</li>
            <li> My hair is a little limp, but I expected this with a heavier deep conditioner, and as I said above, I don&#x27;t mind it when I have nowhere to go (which is often - ha!).  </li>
            <li> But I do use it every few weeks, and especially after I&#x27;ve dyed my hair again.</li>
            <li> Then I spent 3 days at an indoor water park.  </li>
            <li> My hair is definitely long, reaching down to the middle of my back, layered all over from razored bangs to the sides being tapered, and my hair is also crazy straight.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any drastic difference other than it being easier to comb my hair while it&#x27;s still wet.</li>
            <li> tube is quite small, only about 2oz (1.9oz officially), which means if you have long hair you might be using nearly half the tube to do your hair.  </li>
            <li> , so it does not compete with any of my other hair products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I’m not sure that I would purchase it in the future.</li>
            <li> My hair is damaged due to sun (I garden) and using a blow dryer.  </li>
            <li> I buy it locally at Target or Wal-Mart and it usually averages about $4 a tube.</li>
            <li> just once, I need to use every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My main complaint would be that the package is a bit too small.</li>
            <li> If you have long or thick hair, this tube isn&#x27;t going to last you very long at all, so it could get expensive if you need to buy a new tube every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> The only down side is it is fairly expensive, and this sized tube is pretty small</li>
            <li> I imagine that it would be too much for someone with thin or limp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So, while your results with different hair (and we have hard water, too) may vary, she cannot recommend this.</li>
            <li> Not really worth it.</li>
            <li> It was &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but tended to weigh my hair down a lot.  </li>
            <li> My hair also seems to be handling the summer humidity with significantly less frizz.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair and this product smoothes things out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then one bad application with a high lift on some already bleached hair left sections of my hair damaged beyond repair.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry and damaged hair.</li>
            <li> It imparted a little bit of shine, and it added a touch of softness to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The biggest &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for me was that, the little bit of increased softness aside, my hair didn&#x27;t feel all that moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I had a baby a few months ago and my hair is not doing well.</li>
            <li> I have fairly long thick hair and can usually manage to get two uses/applications out of each tube.</li>
            <li> My hair looks worse than it has in a long time.</li>
            <li> But as I age its beginning to dry out , and to make matters worse</li>
            <li> I tried it both as a substitute for my usual conditioner and in addition too.</li>
            <li> Not many shampoos today seem to make my hair shine.  </li>
            <li> The tube is quite small.</li>
            <li> I have chronically frizzy and dull</li>
            <li> Everything seems to be \\&quot;cleanse, detox, rehab\\&quot; lately</li>
            <li> I have color-treated, medium-long, thick, wavy hair.  </li>
            <li> It’s a very small tube - 1.9-oz, which is about the size that you get included in home hair coloring kits.</li>
            <li> The product does NOT leave my very thin hair greasy or weighed down.  </li>
            <li> My only caveat: the scent is a little boring -</li>
            <li> I have medium length thin hair</li>
            <li> Since I now have thyroid problems, I thought maybe this shampoo would help with all the broken hairs</li>
            <li> Bought this in Florida  on holiday when my hair turned into a mad frizzy mess!  </li>
            <li> The faint scent goes away when I rinse it out.</li>
            <li> But also crazy frizzy.  </li>
            <li> Sorry Pantene!  </li>
            <li> The same boring &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;body lotion&amp;#34; scents are, well, boring me.</li>
            <li> Badly damaged hair.</li>
            <li> But send your hair to &amp;#34;rehab&amp;#34; and try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t you just hate when that happens (sigh).  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I accidentally received this product from the Amazon Vine program when requesting a different Pantene product; they have since sent me the correct product, but I did end up using this for a short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, I was a bit surprised how small the tube is, but then I did that thing called &amp;#34;reading&amp;#34; and realized that this product isn&#x27;t for daily or every shower use but for weekly use. It&#x27;s a far more in-depth treatment for all your hair problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is most definitely thicker than I am used to. I used a good quarter-sized amount for my shoulder-length thick hair and left it in for a few minutes before rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel satisfied with the results. I color and sometimes use heat (flat-iron, blow drier) on my hair, and this product seemed to treat my hair nicely. No build-up, soft hair, without being too voluminous (my hair has enough volume, it doesn&#x27;t need anymore from products). Depending on hair length and thickness, I don&#x27;t think this would last longer than about a month of weekly uses, but at $3.99 (Amazon price) and using it to set your hair back on track, I think that&#x27;s an OK price to pay. As an added note, it seems to work nicely in conjunction with the Pantene Pro-V Expert Dry Conditioner too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by:&lt;br /&gt;*C.S. Light*</li>
            <li> I had a baby a few months ago and my hair is not doing well. I decided to try this out of desperation and WOW! My dry, brittle, breaking hair is soft! And I can actually run my fingers through it. I&#x27;ve only used it once but I&#x27;m really excited about the results.</li>
            <li> Not as rich as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> Works great! Makes my hair feel like silk! Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> this is the weekly rehab creme (which is step 4 of the &amp;#34;system&amp;#34;), and it does what it says. it rehabs the frizzy ends of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;easy to use - just follow the directions on the box.&lt;br /&gt;light scent, so it does not compete with any of my other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;i am going to get the other 3 components to see how they all interact.&lt;br /&gt;but, as a stand-alone component, this really does what it promises.&lt;br /&gt;definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This is a cream that is supposed to be used weekly to restore or detox your hair. It has a refreshi8ng fragrance and goes on easily. Rinsing is another matter. My hair is long and after a long rinse I had to soap up my back and legs in order to remove the creamy leftover slipperiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was soft and amazingly for something like this it did not look or feel oily any sooner than it normally would have. It seems to do the job much better than ordinary conditioners you might use.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave your hair silky, looking and feeling healthy.</li>
            <li> I decided to let my husband try this so that I could offer two different perspectives on this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is color treated (lightly highlighted) but has damage due to repeated use of a hot comb over the past six months.  It&#x27;s very thin and has a tendency to get weighed down and greasy looking if I use any kind of leave-in product (conditioner, mousse, gel, spray) or when I use moisturizing shampoos and/or heavy conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husbands hair is thick and very healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, he loved this stuff.  He felt it left his hair smooth and shiny, plus he couldn&#x27;t get over the wonderful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The surprise was that I also loved this product.  It smoothed the frayed cuticle of my hair and gave it terrific body and shine.  And you only have to use a little bit for such great results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely add this to my grooming repertoire.</li>
            <li> Give back to your hair once a week after all the processing you&#x27;ve done to it!  This creme makes my hair feel luxurious, soft, and healthy....and look that way too. And its simple enough to use!</li>
            <li> Saved my processed highlights!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of the Pantene hair care line but this weekly rehab creme left me wanting more.  I had great hopes as the creme smells fantastic and made my hair feel silky in the shower.  However, once dried my hair had none of the promised brilliant shine and smoothness.  While rendered incredibly soft by the creme, my fine, naturally curly hair remained stubbornly poofy.  I tried the creme multiple times but got the same soft cotton puff like results whether I air-dried or used a hair-dryer. Not quite the magic fix I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I’ve been using Pantene Weekly Rehab Creme for about a month now and I like it but I’m not sure that I would purchase it in the future. It’s a very small tube - 1.9-oz, which is about the size that you get included in home hair coloring kits. The Weekly Rehab is nice but nothing special. I love Pantene but the Weekly Rehab doesn’t seem to be more conditioning than any of the regular conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it but I can purchase a regular full-size bottle for the same price and get the same results.</li>
            <li> hair length: below shoulders type: very baby fine &amp; hi-lighted  Update: this made my hair limp and greasy looking at the scalp - more than I anticipated - the next morning, I looked like I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in days - maybe this would be good for ends only, and as I said below, only if I&#x27;m not going anywhere. This really, however, isn&#x27;t a good choice for my baby fine hair - perhaps for someone with a different hair texture would benefit. Sorry Pantene!  Since moving back to my mountain cove, my hair needs some extra attention, because of the dry air here (elevation about 3400 where my little log house is). If I don&#x27;t condition it properly, my baby fine hair tends to go wild and frizzy; however, if I over-condition it, it becomes limp and drab and life-less. What I look for in a deep conditioner is a little different, though--for a weekly use, I want that deeper conditioning and don&#x27;t mind if my hair is a little bit limper. I just choose a day when I have nowhere to go, condition my hair, and let it dry naturally.  I washed my hair as usual, and then applied about a quarter size of the Pantene, rubbed my palms together, and then distributed the conditioner throughout my hair, paying special attention to the ends, and let it set for two minutes while I showered, then rinsed.  Normally, my hair will tangle very easily, but after I got out of the shower and towel-dried my hair, my wet-brush slipped through my hair like &amp;#34;buttah.&amp;#34; A good sign! I let it dry naturally, and it&#x27;s very smooth and silky, and shiny. My hair is a little limp, but I expected this with a heavier deep conditioner, and as I said above, I don&#x27;t mind it when I have nowhere to go (which is often - ha!).  My only caveat: the scent is a little boring - I&#x27;d love a citrus or even better an exotic woodsy or spicy scent--why don&#x27;t more shampoos and conditioners go for the spicy or citrus or woodsy? The same boring &amp;#34;sweet&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;flowery&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;body lotion&amp;#34; scents are, well, boring me. Spice it up, y&#x27;all!</li>
            <li> Love what this does for my hair.  For as inexpensive as it is, my hair is shiny and soft when I use it.  I will continue to purchase!  Smells great too.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this when I first read about it, but after using it I am happy to report that I do see a different in the smoothness of my hair. After years of wearing my hair short, I&#x27;m growing my hair out, so I am relearning how to take care of longer hair. My hair was looking frizzy after blow-drying it regularly, so I went in search of something to help. This has really helped! My hair certainly isn&#x27;t perfect now, but it&#x27;s better than before and a good start toward healthier hair.</li>
            <li> I have short, dry, flay away hair ad live in the southern California desert where there is usually a hot wind blowing.  After using this a couple of time I could feel the difference it made.  My hair is smoother, silkier and more manageable.  My hair is still a little fly away, but it is much easier to smooth so it doesn&#x27;t look like I stuck my finger in an electrical socket.  My hair looks shiny.  So far I&#x27;m very happy with this product and will probably buy it in the future.</li>
            <li> This conditioning treatment has some relatively lofty claims, so my expectations were on the high-side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this will be important a bit later, my hair is mid-back, thick, coarse, on the dry side, and has been subject to coloring and heat styling.  So, when I read what this product is supposed to do, I was intrigued and hopeful.  The question, of course, is whether or not it delivered, and the answer to that is both yes and no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not nearly as thick as I was expecting it to be, and I found that it took quite a bit before my hair felt truly coated by the conditioner.  As such, I&#x27;d say that someone with hair similar to mine could get maybe 4-ish uses out of this, depending on how stingy with the product one was being.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is minty, which is a nice change from the gamut of floral and/or fruity products out there.  The aroma also isn&#x27;t super strong, so all of those who are sensitive to fragrances will probably not have any issues on that front with this.  Further, as someone who has ultra sensitive skin, many products can cause breakouts for me, but this has not, which is a big plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the good side, when it was all said and done, I found that the conditioner had done a decent job with detangling.  It didn&#x27;t weigh my hair down at all, which is both unexpected from a conditioning treatment and a welcome surprise.  It imparted a little bit of shine, and it added a touch of softness to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, for the downsides: I can&#x27;t say that I was super impressed with the results, as everything that I mentioned that it did, any number of other conditioners also accomplish.  Further, when it comes to the softness issue - and it does deliver that in varying degrees - I found that it also made my hair pretty frizzy.  The biggest &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; for me was that, the little bit of increased softness aside, my hair didn&#x27;t feel all that moisturized.  Since I followed the directions to the letter the first time that I used it,I decided to leave it on quite a bit longer the next time, thinking that maybe it just takes the product longer to penetrate thick, coarse hair; however, the results were the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my experience, and subsequently reading other people&#x27;s reviews, I fully agree with the other reviewers who have suggested that this product likely works best on those who have finer hair; it just didn&#x27;t have much of an impact on mine, at all.  That&#x27;s not necessarily a knock on the product, since not everyone&#x27;s hair responds the same to all (or any) products, but it is something to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t a bad conditioner, per se, especially since so many have had great experiences with it, and other than a bit of resulting dryness, it worked okay for me.  At the end of the day, contrasting my experience with those others have had, I just think this product works best on hair that is pretty much the opposite of mine.  So, those who don&#x27;t have hair that&#x27;s on the finer side may want to keep that in mind when deciding whether or not to give this a try, and you will definitely want to manage your expectations before using it.</li>
            <li> Everything seems to be \\&quot;cleanse, detox, rehab\\&quot; lately so I guess it&#x27;s no surprise that hair products are jumping on the band-wagon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \\&quot;rehab creme\\&quot; left my hair soft and shiney. The biggest surprise for me is it didn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy in about two days like most conditioners. Nice minty scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing your hair you \\&quot;comb\\&quot; the creme through with your fingers and leave it about 2 minutes then rinse it out.  Of course how many treatments you get out of a tube will depend on the thickness and length of your hair.</li>
            <li> I think this stuff is hair crack. It love the way it makes my hair feel and it was cheaper here than at Target.</li>
            <li> I have color-treated, medium-long, thick, wavy hair.  I heat style my hair (curling iron, straightener, hair dryer) 4-5 days a week.  I wasn&#x27;t sure about using this on my colored hair, but it didn&#x27;t seem to make the color wear out faster.  The Mosa mint oil smells great, even though I don&#x27;t really know what Mosa is, but it doesn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin or sensitive nose, so that is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like the rehab creme did much more than my regular daily conditioner did.  It left my hair soft, no tangles, easy to comb through. No major changes were noticed.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Leave your hair smooth and silky!</li>
            <li> This is a good conditioner, though I&#x27;m not sure it does amazing repairs to damaged hair.  This comes in a tiny tube, though you don&#x27;t need very much to get a full condition.  I have quite a lot of hair, and my hair was fully conditioned with just a bit of this product.  There&#x27;s mint extract in this conditioner, which surprised me, but I enjoyed it.  It gives a slight mint tingle when first put on the hair, though it doesn&#x27;t really smell like mint.  To be honest, I wish it smelled mintier and tingled more, but that&#x27;s hardly a deal-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Pantene&#x27;s conditioners to be pretty darn moisturizing, so while this works well, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s necessary if you&#x27;re already using a Pantene conditioner.  Certainly it won&#x27;t hurt, but it is smaller and pricier than regular conditioner.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, I use it weekly, my hair feels and looks great.  No greasy or weighted feeling, shiny, healthy-looking hair with no frizz or static. I leave it on for a while if I have time but even if I just wait a minute before I rinse it still does a great job.</li>
            <li> This once a week treatment is top quality, as you would expect from Pantene, but I found I needed to use if sparingly and concentrate on the ends of my hair or it could be a little limp. You&#x27;ll want to rinse your hair very well after use. It has a pleasant scent and I&#x27;ll buy more when this runs out.</li>
            <li> I really love this creme!  I have chronically frizzy and dull hair- it smoothes and softens my hair and adds shine without any oily feel or look.  I&#x27;ll be using this for years to come.  The slight minty scent and feel are also nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this weekly, mainly since I&#x27;ve gotten my hair used to only being washed every four or five days anyhow. But I do use it every few weeks, and especially after I&#x27;ve dyed my hair again. It makes a clear difference. It helps smooth my hair and also gives it a healthy look which dyes can sometimes seem to strip away for a bit. It&#x27;s Very easy to use, and though the tube is fairly small, even with thick hair I&#x27;ve found I don&#x27;t need as much of this as I do shampoo to get an even coverage.</li>
            <li> I have blond, olored, curly hair and regularly use and value Pantene products.  I have used Pantene Weekly Rehab Creme twice now.  The first time I used it with an after hair-wash conditioner with the dryer and a curly hair product.  My hair was fine, not remarkable but fine.&lt;br /&gt;This time I used it without the second product, just the pro-creme, no other product..  My hair looks wild and frizzy, like cotton candy on a bad day at the fair.  My hair looks worse than it has in a long time.I will try it again and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big problem:  when you toss away the box, there are no directions about how to use the product.  For those of us who do not keep the box (especially in the shower) or memorize the directions this is a marketing &amp;#34;no-no&amp;#34;.  I will not buy this product again for these reasons.  I rate it a two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;jodie marino nachison - spouse</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair that tends to frizzy (especially in humidity) but it&#x27;s not damaged. My regular shampoo/conditioner (Pantene for curly hair) was starting to work less well, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t get the shampoo in the same line to try as well, but I found this conditioner surprisingly effective. It made my hair a lot smoother, and I got several compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it on a weekly schedule, and it seems to be an overall improvement. I tried it both as a substitute for my usual conditioner and in addition too. It seemed to work best in addition, but it&#x27;s pretty potent. I imagine that it would be too much for someone with thin or limp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Curious to see how it will work with the shampoo as well. Will try both when I reorder.</li>
            <li> I have used Pantene products for years and I keep going back for it as it works so well at such a great price.  This weekly conditioner is no exception.  My hair is damaged due to sun (I garden) and using a blow dryer.  I find that using this product weekly, as directly, my hair gets a bit of an oomph factor.  It doesn&#x27;t last forever, so I have to use it again a week later.  I especially like it for use during the summer when I will be out in the sun and the pool and my hair can use the extra help.</li>
            <li> I used this product once a week, for five weeks.  It was &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but tended to weigh my hair down a lot.  I prefer the results of my regular daily conditioner (Dove Color Care) to this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair: Shoulder length, color-treated, baby fine, dry, some waviness</li>
            <li> Pantene makes quality shampoos and conditioners and I was eager to try this product.  I have used Pantene throughout the years.  This product is supposed to be good for damaged and color dyed hair and is supposed to make your hair feel softer.  So far, it seems to work for me.  After using it a few times, I have noticed my hair is definitely softer and does not frizz as much.  It even looks somewhat shinier.  Not many shampoos today seem to make my hair shine.  It looks healthier too.  You don&#x27;t have to leave it on long, a couple of minutes.  I think if one would have fine hair, however, then you would not want to use as much as it might flatten it a bit and weigh it down.  It probably works best on those with thick, longer hair that needs some taming after humid days and hair that needs some &amp;#34;healing&amp;#34; after being color dyed and dried with a hair dryer for some time.  It works pretty well for me so I am recommending it.  The only down side is it is fairly expensive, and this sized tube is pretty small so would not last long on long hair.  Taking off a star for the expense.  But send your hair to &amp;#34;rehab&amp;#34; and try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have curly, color-treated hair, so it&#x27;s basically the dictionary definition of dry. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of treatment conditioners, and this one? Is pretty good for its price point. It&#x27;s not my favorite drugstore brand treatment, but it worked pretty well and has a nice scent. It leaves my hair feeling nice and soft after use, which is exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. My main complaint would be that the package is a bit too small. If you have long or thick hair, this tube isn&#x27;t going to last you very long at all, so it could get expensive if you need to buy a new tube every couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I was pleased with this product. I felt that my hair was shinier and smoother. It was easy to use and nice going in. i have a lot of hair, so I did need to use a bit, but it did help. It didn&#x27;t add a lot of weight or residue. The smell was nice. It also felt softer. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this treatment. I use it mainly right before and right after I color my hair, and on special occasions. It leaves hair extremely soft and smooth. The tube is quite small. It is 1.9 fluid ounces. I have fairly long thick hair and can usually manage to get two uses/applications out of each tube. If you have shorter or thinner hair I could see you getting three or four applications from this. I buy it locally at Target or Wal-Mart and it usually averages about $4 a tube. So really not terrible cost-wise. Overall this is a great conditioning cream.</li>
            <li> this works very well.</li>
            <li> Bought this in Florida  on holiday when my hair turned into a mad frizzy mess!  It did the trick and I thought I had found the ideal conditioner.  I was horrified when I got back to UK and found it was not sold here!  I ordered 10 packs from US and I&#x27;m happy.  It works on hair that is susceptible to humidity and damp.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Pantene products....seems there shampoos and conditioners and everything else does better for my hair than anyone else&#x27;s products.  This works great and makes my hair very soft.  I have medium length thin hair and i dye it so it is damaged......Pantene makes it soft.....use this weekly and it helps.....prdered it and it came very quickly and i am thrilled with t!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have very ruly, dry course hair and this product lives my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and shiny!  Love this product!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing!  I have really curly, soft hair.  My ends get easily damaged and well its really obvious that they are split.  The first time i used this though, after my hair (air) dryed i noticed an immediate difference  My ends looked smooth and were not pointing in every direction. Overall my hair was shiny smooth and soft. This will definitely be a staple in my hair washing routine</li>
            <li> I liked it. Hair is soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair &amp; if I use it all over, it leaves my hair weighed down &amp; limp. So, I use it just on my ends. I don&#x27;t see any drastic difference other than it being easier to comb my hair while it&#x27;s still wet. Works about the same as regular conditioner for me. Not really worth it.</li>
            <li> I usually use better conditioner that comes in a big tub.This tube is good for a travel size I get about about 3 uses out of it, I have long hair,&lt;br /&gt;and It works just ok for me for temporary use, or when budget is tight.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been fine. But as I age its beginning to dry out , and to make matters worse I color it. I would always have fine hairs sticking out making me look a mess. This is just what ive been looking for, it makes my hair feel soft and look smooth. I will definitely buy it again, i put it on my subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> I have healthy hair. I don’t use a lot of heat on it and don’t have any coloring in it. Still, I find that in the harsh Louisiana heat, my hair sometimes isn’t as healthy as it could be. This rehab cream worked really great. I couldn’t believe how soft my hair was after just one use. It’s important to know this is not a leave in conditioner. It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Well, I tried this shampoo and really did not see any noticeable difference.  Of course, I have never dyed my hair nor done anything else to change the texture or feel of my hair. Since I now have thyroid problems, I thought maybe this shampoo would help with all the broken hairs but it has not.This is obviously not the repair shampoo that I was hoping it would be.  I&#x27;ll have to keep looking and experimenting.</li>
            <li> My hair as never been in better condition. I&#x27;ve been using for over a year now after hair cuts, about 14 times now. I like to think it&#x27;s properties seal the cuticle until the next cut. I only get one use from each tube because I have shoulder length, curly, coarse, Irish, - in other words a lot of think hair - lol. I follow the directions to apply after shampooing, comb through with fingers, making sure the ends are thoroughly drenched with product, rinsing after at least 2 minutes.</li>
            <li> I have thick, dry and damaged hair. Badly damaged hair. I&#x27;ve gone from dark brunette to blonde then back to brunette again all in about a years time. My hair was fine for most of the time. Then one bad application with a high lift on some already bleached hair left sections of my hair damaged beyond repair. I&#x27;ve been using all kinds of treatments to strengthen the hair, but for my everyday showers, I needed an intense conditioner. The type of conditioner one might normally use every other week just once, I need to use every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m doing what I can to keep my hair manageable until it&#x27;s grown out and I can cut off all the damage I did. It&#x27;s been about 3/4 of a year now, but I still have a long ways to go. This rehab cream is exactly the type of intense conditioner I need. Something to smooth the fried hair and help keep it from breaking when brushing and styling it. It works well, I just wish it came in an even bigger bottle!</li>
            <li> My wife loves Pantene products, so she looked forward to this, But, and she has naturally curly and thick hair, this left that limp and dry all week after she used this twice. So, while your results with different hair (and we have hard water, too) may vary, she cannot recommend this.</li>
            <li> I found that the Pantene Pro-V Weekly Rehab Creme works as it says.  It made my hair super silky, it did feel revitalized, it was definitely smoother than it normally is when I finish blow drying my hair.  In fact, I didn&#x27;t even have to flat iron my hair it was so super straight.  But let me tell you about my hair before you make a snappy decision.  My hair is definitely long, reaching down to the middle of my back, layered all over from razored bangs to the sides being tapered, and my hair is also crazy straight.  But also crazy frizzy.  This is most likely a lovely combination of my heritage (Spanish, French, etc. so I do have a mix of wiry hair mixed in with super fine strands), the humid weather I live in, and the fact that I have to wash and dry my hair every morning which has damaged it.  Not to mention I do highlight my hair, and that has also helped the damage along.  So I thought I&#x27;d give this weekly creme a try to see if it could help my ends any keep my frizz at minimum.  And it actually worked!  After drying my hair it was definitely soft, smooth, and silky.  But unfortunately for me it was also unmanageable, as the creme made it so silky and fine that it didn&#x27;t want to stay up, curl, or do anything but lay flat.  And I&#x27;m one of those people who need volume.  The totally flat look just doesn&#x27;t do it for me.  I tried sprucing it up some, but my bangs were having none of it, and just fell flatly in my eye&#x27;s instead of doing a cute swoop.  I eventually had to clip them up on one side to even make it look presentable.  And if you ask me how long does the product work, well let me start by reiterating that I do wash my hair every day, and I&#x27;m on day five after using the product, and my hair is still softer than it normally is.  The only thing I need to flat iron at the moment is just my ends. I do believe I will continue to use this product, but only on my ends, and not once a week, but perhaps once every two weeks, as it really does work, and makes my ends softer than they usually are.  However, if you do have fine hair, then I don&#x27;t truly recommend it unless you have products that really help add volume.  Otherwise you will be left with super flat hair that sticks to your head.ofter than they usually are.

            <li> Really great for frizzy hair!  Smooths hair and adds shine.  I&#x27;ve used 6 weeks and may hair looks great....shiny and healthy.  Works best if started at ends first and then worked into rest of hair.</li>
            <li> My hair has been super soft since using this. I use it once a week in combination with the Pantene Damage Detox Shampoo and Conditioner. My hair also seems to be handling the summer humidity with significantly less frizz.</li>
            <li> This is just a small bottle of what essentially is a conditioner, although what Pantene Pro-V claims to be a higher powered &#x27;rehab creme&#x27;.  The first thing you notice is the smell, smells very nice, like a salon...a sort of minty/tea tree smell.  It&#x27;s maybe a little thicker than most conditioners and is designed to really go to work and cut down on frizz and make your hair smooth.  Have noticed it does a good job of that (although hard to measure more than using good conditioners).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube is quite small, only about 2oz (1.9oz officially), which means if you have long hair you might be using nearly half the tube to do your hair.  It is supposed to be weekly, and you might be able to get a month out of it if you stretch it.  If you are coloring your hair or abusing it in other ways this probably will give it just a bit more extra help.</li>
            <li> I am a Redken fan. I don&#x27;t mind spending for products to preserve my locks. I read in a magazine that Giselle Bundchen uses this and loves it. So, I thought it was worth the try. I have been using this product for over a year now and I swear by it. I swear it works. Buy it. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> Product is OK. Made my hair SUPER GREASY as I followed the instructions perfectly, yet still had to shower the next morning because my hair worked like a grease-ball. Made my hair soft, so I will use sparingly to finish then not purchase again....</li>
            <li> This works for me where nothing else, (even salon products) has.  My hair is very thick and grows very fast so I dye it ... a lot.  Then I spent 3 days at an indoor water park.  My hair was straw.  I tried this based on a recommendation I&#x27;d read and it made my hair feel so soft.  I thought I was going to have to cut my off it was so damaged and start again but not since using this.  It&#x27;s going to be a staple in my shower from now on.</li>
            <li> love it have to admit I want to use it more than once a week- My hair feels good after use!</li>
            <li> This is just okay. I was expecting a sort of deep conditioning experience, but really it felt like i was just putting normal conditioner on my hair. The bottle is pretty small for a regular sort of conditioner. All in all i would say that this isn&#x27;t worth it. I don&#x27;t feel like any of my hair was repaired or any softer than before.</li>
            <li> Finally, something that smooths my frizzy hair! I got this locally. Didn&#x27;t really expect that much when I tossed it in my cart, but it certainly delivered. After using this my hair is smooth and soft and shiny. My super frizzy hair is barely frizzy at all. Best of all, it moisturizes without making my hair greasy. The faint scent goes away when I rinse it out. I will buy again.</li>
            <li> The product does NOT leave my very thin hair greasy or weighed down.  I have slightly wavy hair and this product smoothes things out beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I still love this product.  I just wanted to express my sorrow that it has doubled in price!  And it&#x27;s not on Subscribe and Save any longer.  Don&#x27;t you just hate when that happens (sigh).  I&#x27;ll just have to keep using my apple cider vinegar rinse until this product returns to a reasonable price again.</li>
