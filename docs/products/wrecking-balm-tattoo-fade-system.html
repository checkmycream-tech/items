            <li>Depends on the quality and coloring more than anything else.</li>
            <li>Your better off using sandpaper and body lotion.</li>
            <li>That on top of that will definately help you.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re peeling away your skin and then putting lotion on it after wards.youcan easily get an infection.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend laser removal.</li>
            <li>full fade am better tattoo over it or with toothpaste</li>
            <li>Cheap tool.</li>
            <li>Basically just light sandpaper.</li>
            <li>However this summer I have noticed that my skin around the tattoo is much more sensitive to the sun, I have blisters from the sun under and around my tattoo and nowhere else.</li>
            <li>it looks like it does at first</li>
            <li>please read this first</li>
            <li>It only made the tat show better.</li>
            <li>If you want this exact same treatment at for free go get a rock and some lotion.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference</li>
            <li>fast shipping would recommend seller.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your time and money unless, you&#x27;re into self mutilation. :-)</li>
            <li>It seems this tattoo removal works better on pale skin.</li>
            <li>Worked fine until sanding round part broke.</li>
            <li>Used this with the removal brush for 5 months did not remove or even lighten the tattoo this does not work do not waste your money</li>
            <li>i suggest you cough up the money and go see a professional laser treatment service or have it surgically removed.</li>
            <li>So a tattoo floats under the epidermis of your skin, in the dermis near the border.  </li>
            <li>I had my tattoo nearly two years and wanted it removed to get something else.</li>
            <li>I used it over my entire tattoo for 6 months and didn&#x27;t really know whether it was lighter or not.</li>
            <li>Its a lil early on to say it doesn&#x27;t work, but</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t work so far............</li>
            <li>do not waste your mony on this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty much just a salicylic acid scrub and a piece of sand paper that you could buy at home depot for way less money.  </li>
            <li>At first it looks like its working, because your skin is dry and ashy.</li>
            <li>and it pops like no other...</li>
            <li>not sure if its working or not havent really seen any fading yet so cant really say</li>
            <li>My recruiter told me abiut this , i need my tattoo removed for the military, and this is absolutely helping.</li>
            <li>Read other reviews and expected it to only slightly fade, which it did slightly on a real light tattoo I had.  </li>
            <li>So not disappointed due to my expectations from reading other reviews.</li>
            <li>i used it for the first few applications and its fading well and quickly the dark color is basically a grey color now.</li>

            <li> i used it for the first few applications and its fading well and quickly the dark color is basically a grey color now.</li>
            <li> but i think tca will work because it is a chemical that peels your skin there for new skin will grow over that tatoo pushing the ink further down and making it less visable</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money used this crap for over a year on a light tatt with light gray ink no color</li>
            <li> The idea is sound, but the price is a fail.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of time &amp; money.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> Its a rather annoying side effect but otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> but thats because your skin is so dry that its ashy and makes the tattoo look lighter itself</li>
            <li> But it breaks down the color, to finish off and break it down and get it completely removed..</li>
            <li> So, I started using it on only half of my tattoo to see if I&#x27;d see any difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really what I thought.</li>
            <li> you get it wet or add lotion to it</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected and I have such a small tattoo.</li>
            <li> Three sessions in and the side I used the wrecking balm on for the additional 6 months is WAY lighter than the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i am negative about it because its all lies the only way it coulda taken the 8 ball off</li>
            <li> All my tattoo is is a little black cat silhouette, nothing complicated or large at all</li>
            <li> seriously i thought this baby had some power to it, to actually</li>
            <li> I can even see it removing a very poorly done tattoo in several (SEVERAL) months of treatment, but it&#x27;d take time and dedication.</li>
            <li> You put cream on it put it on your skin no longer than 48 seconds.its basically sanding your skin of a little each use.</li>
            <li> This has faded the tattoo a little....</li>
            <li> Nothing but a little peeled screen maybe you need a few boxes to get rid of it ?  </li>
            <li> Painful but worth it.</li>
            <li> i will update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> waste of money.</li>
            <li> the others used it at like 5% and burned themself pretty bad stupid mistake in the first place</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff a while ago and used it to lighten a poorly done black tattoo so I can get it covered.</li>
            <li> Sucks.</li>
            <li> Rip off.the box even admits the product sucks.</li>
            <li> slowly</li>
            <li> *** out of my arm all day with a brillow pad, instead of using this mediocre little scrubber that comes included in the box.</li>
            <li> yea walmart for 47$$ used it just how it says and nothing at allo but a tiny scar this product consists of a sanding bad a bad smelling gell and a lotion and that is it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a fail</li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
            <li> Noticed no change at all, I suggest get a laser tattoo treatment, and forget about these fake items.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon unfortunately</li>
            <li> It left a horrible scar on my husband face.</li>
            <li> sorry for the bad news.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it</li>
            <li> and it hurt really bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Cant rate this product yet just started using it but i will in do time</li>
            <li> Nothing but a little peeled screen maybe you need a few boxes to get rid of it ?  Didn&#x27;t work for me. It&#x27;s a fail I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money used this crap for over a year on a light tatt with light gray ink no color no difference, no change...Bulls**t product!</li>
            <li> Product arrived on time and everything that is said to come with it is all there. The actually product is just a piece of sand paper that you have attached to a plastic holder that vibrates... essentialy you are running away your tattoo. I did it for about a week and it hurt really bad. There wasn&#x27;t any changes in the color of my tattoo, just scarring around the tattoo from it scanning. You&#x27;re peeling away your skin and then putting lotion on it after wards.youcan easily get an infection. I would recommend just getting laser done.</li>
            <li> It burnt my skin. I will not use it again or recommend it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything. It hurts and it irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> not sure if its working or not havent really seen any fading yet so cant really say</li>
            <li> Used this with the removal brush for 5 months did not remove or even lighten the tattoo this does not work do not waste your money</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty much just a salicylic acid scrub and a piece of sand paper that you could buy at home depot for way less money.  The idea is sound, but the price is a fail.</li>
            <li> In retrospect, I should have taken the same amount of money, bought a fifth of liquor and a belt sander.</li>
            <li> Worked fine until sanding round part broke. Cheap tool.</li>
            <li> This product is a complete waste of time &amp; money. It is like sanding your skin &amp; will not fade your tattoo. It actually harms your skin. Laser is the only way to remove a tattoo.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money unless, you&#x27;re into self mutilation. :-)</li>
            <li> Complete waste of time and money. I used it as directed for weeks no results whatsoever. It is just a dermal abrasion tool and some lotion. If you want this exact same treatment at for free go get a rock and some lotion. Rub the rock on your tattoo and put lotion on it. Same thing with same result. If you have a tattoo that need taken off i suggest you cough up the money and go see a professional laser treatment service or have it surgically removed. These are those ONLY viable options you have.... sorry for the bad news.</li>
            <li> NOT IMPRESSED WITH THIS PRODUCT AT ALL</li>
            <li> Noticed no change at all, I suggest get a laser tattoo treatment, and forget about these fake items.</li>
            <li> So a tattoo floats under the epidermis of your skin, in the dermis near the border.  There is NO POSSIBLE WAY a cream or sanding can get to it.  Only a laser will get rid of tattoos.  Do yourself a favor and don&#x27;t hurt yourself with this product.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT AND IT WORKS</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. Waist of money.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product from Amazon unfortunately but i bought it offline years ago from their site. I used it and seen zero results and they wouldn&#x27;t refund my money. This is key to a product made from garbage by garbage people. Do not buy. I repeat do not buy. If there was a zero star i would have given Wrecking Balm a zero.. or even maybe like -1000 stars for basically stealing my money, because when i bought this product from their site, it was over 150$</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really what I thought. There&#x27;s a pad that looks like sand paper. You put cream on it put it on your skin no longer than 48 seconds.its basically sanding your skin of a little each use. I did it once and threw it away.</li>
            <li> Ok- here&#x27;s the deal (and make sure to read til the end)...I had my tattoo nearly two years and wanted it removed to get something else. I figured I&#x27;d save money and try the wrecking balm. I used it over my entire tattoo for 6 months and didn&#x27;t really know whether it was lighter or not. So, I started using it on only half of my tattoo to see if I&#x27;d see any difference. Another 6 months and I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference so I called it quits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER (and here&#x27;s the kicker), I finally decided to pay up and get the laser removal done. Three sessions in and the side I used the wrecking balm on for the additional 6 months is WAY lighter than the other side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So will this remove your entire tattoo? Probably not. Depends on the quality and coloring more than anything else. Will it fade your tattoo? Probably. I can even see it removing a very poorly done tattoo in several (SEVERAL) months of treatment, but it&#x27;d take time and dedication.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work out too good</li>
            <li> It seems this tattoo removal works better on pale skin. Its a lil early on to say it doesn&#x27;t work, but seriously i thought this baby had some power to it, to actually like,...make you believe it&#x27;s doing anything! I can take apricot scrub and rub the s*** out of my arm all day with a brillow pad, instead of using this mediocre little scrubber that comes included in the box. Seriousy.</li>
            <li> Used as directed. Tattoos are not gone.</li>
            <li> This has faded the tattoo a little.... I guess I just need to keep doing it and hope the Tattoo goes away eventually</li>
            <li> DID NOT WORK AT ALL !!!!</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work so far............</li>
            <li> i bought this stuff at walmart... yea walmart for 47$$ used it just how it says and nothing at allo but a tiny scar this product consists of a sanding bad a bad smelling gell and a lotion and that is it. it doesnt fade it it looks like it does at first but thats because your skin is so dry that its ashy and makes the tattoo look lighter itself untillllll you get it wet or add lotion to it and it pops like no other... do not waste your mony on this product please read this first i am negative about it because its all lies the only way it coulda taken the 8 ball off that guys neck is if he sat there with the bottle of oilntment on his neck for 3 days along with his neck being sandblasted with walnuts.... dont buy it. i hear tca peel works ive whatched vids on it ive read alot of reviews and some come out good if you use it riught the others used it at like 5% and burned themself pretty bad stupid mistake in the first place but i think tca will work because it is a chemical that peels your skin there for new skin will grow over that tatoo pushing the ink further down and making it less visable im buying it to try it out i will update in a few weeks</li>
            <li> Was not what I expected and I have such a small tattoo.</li>
            <li> This is a gimmick! Does not work at all!!! Do not buy!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff a while ago and used it to lighten a poorly done black tattoo so I can get it covered. It definitely lightened it in fact I&#x27;m considering buying a second kit to try to lighten it further. However this summer I have noticed that my skin around the tattoo is much more sensitive to the sun, I have blisters from the sun under and around my tattoo and nowhere else. Its a rather annoying side effect but otherwise a good product.</li>
            <li> Yes its working .....slowly but it is working</li>
            <li> product as described. fast shipping would recommend seller. product works great and has already shown result. would buy again and suggest to others.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t give it s star this stuff scared me</li>
            <li> Read other reviews and expected it to only slightly fade, which it did slightly on a real light tattoo I had.  So not disappointed due to my expectations from reading other reviews.</li>
            <li> No. It left a horrible scar on my husband face. Didn&#x27;t even remove tattoo.  Won&#x27;t be  purchasing again...</li>
            <li> All my tattoo is is a little black cat silhouette, nothing complicated or large at all and it did NOTHING but irritate my skin. It&#x27;s just sandpaper with a motor. At first it looks like its working, because your skin is dry and ashy. It doesnt even get through 1 layer of skin.</li>
            <li> It has done anything to fade my tattoo. it looked just like what it did online, just didn&#x27;t work like the item was shown.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t wok to bring s full fade am better tattoo over it or with toothpaste</li>
            <li> Sucks. Does not work. Your better off using sandpaper and body lotion.</li>
            <li> Rip off.the box even admits the product sucks.</li>
            <li> On time and functional</li>
            <li> Only been at it for one month now and already its working.  Painful but worth it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a scam. waste of money. tattoo won&#x27;t fade at all</li>
            <li> My recruiter told me abiut this , i need my tattoo removed for the military, and this is absolutely helping. I could definately see the difference, it fades it well. It obviously doesnt get rid of the tattoo, I meant that tattoo is deep for gosh sakes. But it breaks down the color, to finish off and break it down and get it completely removed.. I would strongly recommend laser removal. That on top of that will definately help you.</li>
            <li> It only made the tat show better. It would take months to finally get rid of it. Will not use it again and will not recommend it to anyone else.</li>
            <li> Basically just light sandpaper. It got rid of my tan nicely but no noticeable change in the tattoo even using it multiple times a week for longer than recommended.</li>
            <li> I bought this product to fade an exs name on my finger i used it for the first few applications and its fading well and quickly the dark color is basically a grey color now. I would recommend. This product.</li>
