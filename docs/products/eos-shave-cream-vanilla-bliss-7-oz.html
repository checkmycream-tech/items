    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>/&gt;It is AWESOME.</li>
            <li>Best of all, any leftover cream that I had on my legs could just be rubbed in like lotion after I was finished shaving.</li>
            <li>and after a couple of days I&#x27;m still good!!!</li>
            <li>This shave cream is awesome!</li>
            <li>I recommend this product to anyone and often give it to friends as gifts, so they can be introduced to how great of a product it is!</li>
            <li>I find that the Venus razor rinses best with shave lotion.</li>
            <li>Wonderful shaving cream!</li>
            <li>The Vanilla scent is a great way to leave my shaven face in the morning!</li>
            <li>Excellent choice for a women&#x27;s shaving cream.</li>
            <li>It looks like nothing is on your legs, however when you shave, it&#x27;s the best.  </li>
            <li>I hope they never discontinue this - best shave gel or cream</li>
            <li>the price, this stuff is INCREDIBLE.</li>
            <li>*smells great  </li>
            <li>I truly think this stuff is great.</li>
            <li>Smells great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li>This smells great and leaves my legs</li>
            <li>It smells nice, works perfectly.</li>
            <li>I have never been so happy with something as trivial as shaving cream.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is great.</li>
            <li>Great deal on what was a great product.</li>
            <li>The EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream multi packs are a great deal</li>
            <li>The bottle is attractive.</li>
            <li>Sigh. :P</li>
            <li>This has a pleasant vanilla scent, works well, and lasts longer than shaving cream or gel too.</li>
            <li>Lotion after shaving is still recommended, but this product leaves your skin smooth and smelling delicious.</li>
            <li>Plus the vanilla scent smells really good.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very effective -- and moisturizing.</li>
            <li>But the smell is great, and makes my legs amazingly smooth!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this shave cream !</li>
            <li>Smells great, moisturizes, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t leave foam or clumps all over the place.  </li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is pleasant, not overpowering, so it&#x27;s perfect for people who are perfume sensitive.</li>
            <li>Eos Vanilla Bliss smells really great and leaves your areas incredibly smooth, including the bikini zone.</li>
            <li>This smells amazing and feels amazing</li>
            <li>Shame, EOS made a great product and for whatever reason it is just no longer available.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>But this is amazing.</li>
            <li>The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>and you have to kind of pound the bottle until the rest comes out.  </li>
            <li>It was kind of a pain to keep doing that, but I still finished my legs faster than it takes me to do it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it has a nice fragrance without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li>I also liked that the bottle did not have metal on the bottom and did not leave rust in my tub.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute BEST!  </li>
            <li>like I need to wash afterwards although it rinses off nicely.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li>I liked the fact that it was non-aerosol and that its packaging didn&#x27;t look like a can of caffeinated malt beverage that was aimed at college freshmen with tattoos.  </li>
            <li>The bottle has a great shape and makes gripping easy.</li>
            <li>But it did shave very easily.</li>
            <li>This is, by far, the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>It does kind of clog up your razor so make sure to rinse it often when you&#x27;re in the process of shaving.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best shaving cream I have used over the years.   </li>
            <li>This smells sooooo wonderful and leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave a rust stain.</li>
            <li>Easy to shave with, lasts forever!</li>
            <li>The scents are also mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t burn and it cleaned up just fine with paper towels (I told you I was not at home!).</li>
            <li>*cute packaging  </li>
            <li>I have to change razors WAY more often when I use this because they get so gunky they stop working.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this stuff smells, but because of the way it gums up my razor, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li>I do love the smell of the vanilla.</li>
            <li>It did a nice job and my legs felt smooth afterwords - no dryness, no irritation, and no bumps.</li>
            <li>so I use more.</li>
            <li>The Vanilla Bliss is much better if you are trying to decide between the two.</li>
            <li>I also can tell better when I&#x27;ve missed a spot.  </li>
            <li>I wanted to like this product, the smell was great and it did moisturize my legs really well.</li>
            <li>This is definitely more like a body butter in terms of texture and the way it feels coming out of the pump.</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs feeling so smooth that I don&#x27;t need to use any lotion or follow up product!</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I love vanilla, but it smells more like musk than vanilla.</li>
            <li>It may be ok for a man, but I was turned off by the scent.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I love eos lip balm and figured this product would be on par.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I would not purchase this again, but maybe others will have better luck</li>
            <li>I love lotion and this shaving cream</li>
            <li>And my legs were so smooth!</li>
            <li>Smooth, and moisturized!</li>
            <li>Made my skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li>It says shave cream in its name, which it is, but it is more of a lotion than a foamy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You shouldn&#x27;t use a razor too many times to avoid infections from the cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It also smelled much better than most shaving creams.  </li>
            <li>I still plan to use EOS until something significantly better comes along.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the razor clogging problem others have had, but I do have good water pressure in my shower, so hair and cream just slide right off.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this really does anything spectacular in terms of giving you a better shave, but it&#x27;s a nice change from</li>
            <li>Wow!  Great product.  </li>
            <li>The smell is a nice, sweet vanilla - not too strong.</li>
            <li>:) I use it with the mach3 razor for a super close shave!</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>but you have to use a lot because it doesn&#x27;t spread easily</li>
            <li>It smells great and leaves skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li>(it is strong so if you are scent averse don&#x27;t buy it)</li>
            <li>The berry one might be a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li>If you are sure to exfoliate before shaving with this cream and a 3 blade razor, you&#x27;ll get a super close shave.</li>
            <li>It leaves you moisturized however, it gums up a razor and QUICK!</li>
            <li>Razor burn has always been a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li>If I had an unlimited, free supply of razors, I would use this stuff forever.</li>
            <li>My legs feel so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing, and it feels nice on the skin even after you have rinsed it off.</li>
            <li>THIS stuff however gets the job done of shaving and my skin IS exceptionally smooth afterwords.  </li>
            <li>My partner asked me how I get my bikini so smooth without waxing</li>
            <li>not pump then smooth</li>
            <li>Love the natural warm vanilla scent, not overly sweet or strong.</li>
            <li>packaging is cute and fun as is true for all EOS products.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find this product.  </li>
            <li>It takes a bit of getting used to, and I have to rinse out my razor every 2-3 strokes, but it&#x27;s so completely worth it!  </li>
            <li>Great for dry shaving as well.</li>
            <li>I feel like it protects my skin and leaves me feeling super smooth in all the places I shave with no razor burns.  </li>
            <li>so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great love the way it makes me feel, fortunately and not so fortunate my hair grows fast and is dark</li>
            <li>The vanilla scent is prominent, but doesn&#x27;t really stick around after rinsing.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many different things in order to have smooth skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li>and I really don&#x27;t like many &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s packaging is recyclable, it has a nice light scent, it leaves your skin smooth, and does a way better job at preventing razor burns than typical foam shaving cream.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to use a lot (two pumps will give you enough for a whole leg) and it stays on much more effectively than foaming gels.</li>
            <li>This stuff seemed like the best of the lot - since I didn&#x27;t want full on foaming shave cream or sticky gross gel as I was dry</li>
            <li>love this EOS cream because it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it leaves my skin after shaving!  </li>
            <li>It gets you a pretty close shave, and is SO moisturizing!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth, soft, and smells super clean :) leaves legs feeling soft and clean</li>
            <li>I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the price and the smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li>For those of you searching for a different kind of shaving cream...</li>
            <li>I had been a longtime Skintimate fan before trying this, but I didn&#x27;t like the idea of throwing away metal cans (no recycling for them in my area) and putting isobutane on freshly shaven skin.</li>
            <li>Works so well and is definitely worth it</li>
            <li>I rarely get razor burn when I use this shave lotion.  </li>
            <li>Well I am sure glad I did, this cream is unlike any other I have tried...</li>
            <li>I use barbosol right now</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t ever had such easy shaving!  </li>
            <li>I bought Eos shave cream for the first time because it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li>This shaving cream is exactly that...a cream.</li>
            <li>Protects my legs better than regular shaving cream -- and doesn&#x27;t leave the yucky foam in the bath.</li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;m a sucker for attractive</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t lather but it&#x27;s soft, moisturizing and smooth, helps me get a close shave</li>
            <li>Plus I&#x27;m really funny about smells</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;d ever bought a cream instead of a gel.</li>
            <li>But overall it&#x27;s okay.....</li>
            <li>This product takes some getting used to if you have used a shave gel or standard shaving cream (from an aerosol can) like most people use.</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure your skin is properly covered for the razor to glide on.</li>
            <li>bought my EOS cream at my local CVS pharmacy and didn&#x27;t pay more than $5/bottle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very different from anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried; it comes out of the bottle looking more like lotion than a shaving product.  </li>
            <li>There are some things I loved about it, and some things I really disliked...  </li>
            <li>, I think it smells delicious (at least the vanilla fragrance which I tried), and it really did leave my legs quite soft.     </li>
            <li>Also love the good ingredients, hard to find a shaving cream without parabens, petrolatum, or especially triethanolamine.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything.</li>
            <li>The scent was great, but there are plenty of other shaving creams out there with a similar scent without these pesky negatives.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It did get clogged in between my razor blades after several swipes, but a second or two under warm running water cleared it right up.</li>
            <li>Again, due to the product&#x27;s consistency, when the level is very low, and you can&#x27;t even manage to shake more product out of the top of the container with the pump removed, there will still be product in the container.  </li>
            <li>On one hand, I love the packaging (it comes in a pretty plastic bottle which is a bit textured and has grips, so it doesn&#x27;t slip from wet hands and won&#x27;t leave rust rings on the counter)</li>
            <li>Also my biggest problem is when shaving I constantly have to keep rinsing my razor after 3 strokes which is fine</li>
            <li>I seriously will never buy another kind of shaving cream again!</li>
            <li>really moisturizes  </li>
            <li>As others may have stated, you may want to pump a couple of times to really get enough all over your entire leg, but the softness of the skin post-shave is amazing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really silky and creamy and spreads really well.</li>
            <li>It really is moisturizing.</li>
            <li>It leaves my legs &amp; arms smooth and silky and now 6 hours later as I&#x27;m writing this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only shave cream that I&#x27;ve ever used that gives me a close, smooth shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li>and I ended up using about 6 per leg because it doesn&#x27;t really spread well</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>so it really helps prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li>but I will say that I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li>Be prepared for some trial and error while you figure out how much you need.</li>
            <li>Really smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much, and you get the smoothest shave.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d rather use real shower cream..</li>
            <li>I went through my first bottle of it very quickly since I used too much, expecting a lather like other foams and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>you haven&#x27;t used non-foaming cream before, you should know that you&#x27;ll have to rinse your razor more to unclog it, just as you would with any other shave lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because its like a lotion, it does seem to be more moisturizing than other products.</li>
            <li>would give it 5 stars but for a few things that are less than ideal about it.  </li>
            <li>I am an average size person, and it took a lot more than 1-2 pumps like it claims to cover my legs.</li>
            <li>I love both amazon and eos shaving cream (btw), I&#x27;ve seen bad and good reviews</li>
            <li>I have even been in a rush and not lotioned, and my legs still looked decent.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I wonder about cosmetics that I buy on Amazon, because they can be old or expired, or seconds or something.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the Vanilla, and it&#x27;s a light scent.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product, that&#x27;s if you want to be risky.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found that I have to replace my blades more often, as other reviews have; the trick is just to rinse the blades frequently as you shave, for me anyway.  </li>
            <li>I got a bottle of this at Target on a whim, because my normal go-to shave gel was out of stock.</li>
            <li>So I saw this at a local drugstore and decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li>DEFINITELY worth the price over regular brands</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my &#x27;lady parts&#x27; like many of the heavily scented shaving foams marketed specifically for women do.</li>
            <li>It left my legs super soft and completely stubble-free.</li>
            <li>I know that with regular cream or body wash my hair gets more coarse, but with EOS shaving cream my hair actually comes out smoother and don&#x27;t have to shave as often.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to not feel any razor burn, and I think this was the first time in several years that I didn&#x27;t knick myself shaving even once!</li>
            <li>I love that this can be used on both dry and wet skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m kind of pressed for time in the morning, really bugged by tedious time wasters.</li>
            <li>haven&#x27;t dry-shaved since my highschool swim team days; back then, it consisted of using hand lotion on my legs and underarms in the locker room before meets, and getting intense razor burn for a couple days afterward.</li>
            <li>the are just as soft.</li>
            <li>I shave with it before I shower, because it is a bit greasy, but after I&#x27;m finished and showered my face feels incredibly soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband LOVES how soft it makes my legs.  </li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I wish they made something similar for your whole body.</li>
            <li>, I find it really eliminated razor burn, especially in bikini area.    </li>
            <li>No problem for me, I get my skin moist and then do a section at a time with no trouble.</li>
            <li>My 12 year old daughter has even stolen one</li>
            <li>Made my legs feel soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The smell is divine and even after bathing my legs and armpits still feel soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, pick something else.</li>
            <li>B0000536EY Aveeno  Therapeutic Shave Gel with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal 7 oz (198 g)]]</li>
            <li>Most products don&#x27;t do enough to moisturize as I&#x27;m using them, and I end up with irritated skin that I can&#x27;t shave again for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I love that the shaving lotion is a lotion and thick, unlike gels.</li>
            <li>I know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and a lot of things come into play with razor burn and such (if you shave when you first get in the shower, the type of shaver, how new the blades are, the cream)</li>
            <li>I mean it left my legs feeling amazing</li>
            <li>There was only one left, and they were on sale, so I assumed it must be pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Though I do like this product; it leaves my legs very soft, not dry like foam products.</li>
            <li>It is a little thick, but I just wet my legs first and smooth it on lightly.  </li>
            <li>and I love it however hard to find female version easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I went into Walgreen&#x27;s last month to pick up a new can and discovered EOS on the shaving goods shelf; I had never seen it before.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise I could see how it may seem that the blades are getting dull, but my Gillette Venus blades have held up just fine.</li>
            <li>After shaving my skin is left soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>After I&#x27;m done, lotion is an option now - it leaves my skin soft enough</li>
            <li>The tendency is to want to use more, to get some lather, but that is unnecessary.  </li>
            <li>It feels like lotion when you are putting it on, which was a bit odd at first.</li>
            <li>Even a few days after shaving, my legs are pretty</li>
            <li>My skin is sensitive and gets dry and irritated from shaving.</li>
            <li>first I was a little skeptical: it didn&#x27;t foam up like most shave gel.</li>
            <li>for wet shaving where it really shines is for dry shaving.</li>
            <li>No need to pile it on, just apply  a thin layer in opposite direction of hair growth and it does fine.  </li>

    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> /&gt;It is AWESOME.</li>
            <li> Best of all, any leftover cream that I had on my legs could just be rubbed in like lotion after I was finished shaving.</li>
            <li> and after a couple of days I&#x27;m still good!!!</li>
            <li> This shave cream is awesome!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone and often give it to friends as gifts, so they can be introduced to how great of a product it is!</li>
            <li> I find that the Venus razor rinses best with shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaving cream!</li>
            <li> The Vanilla scent is a great way to leave my shaven face in the morning!</li>
            <li> Excellent choice for a women&#x27;s shaving cream.</li>
            <li> It looks like nothing is on your legs, however when you shave, it&#x27;s the best.  </li>
            <li> I hope they never discontinue this - best shave gel or cream</li>
            <li> the price, this stuff is INCREDIBLE.</li>
            <li> *smells great  </li>
            <li> I truly think this stuff is great.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  </li>
            <li> This is a great shaving cream.  </li>
            <li> This smells great and leaves my legs</li>
            <li> It smells nice, works perfectly.</li>
            <li> I have never been so happy with something as trivial as shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is great.</li>
            <li> Great deal on what was a great product.</li>
            <li> The EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream multi packs are a great deal</li>
            <li> The bottle is attractive.</li>
            <li> Sigh. :P</li>
            <li> This has a pleasant vanilla scent, works well, and lasts longer than shaving cream or gel too.</li>
            <li> Lotion after shaving is still recommended, but this product leaves your skin smooth and smelling delicious.</li>
            <li> Plus the vanilla scent smells really good.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very effective -- and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> But the smell is great, and makes my legs amazingly smooth!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Love this!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shave cream !</li>
            <li> Smells great, moisturizes, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t leave foam or clumps all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is pleasant, not overpowering, so it&#x27;s perfect for people who are perfume sensitive.</li>
            <li> Eos Vanilla Bliss smells really great and leaves your areas incredibly smooth, including the bikini zone.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and feels amazing</li>
            <li> Shame, EOS made a great product and for whatever reason it is just no longer available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> But this is amazing.</li>
            <li> The smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> and you have to kind of pound the bottle until the rest comes out.  </li>
            <li> It was kind of a pain to keep doing that, but I still finished my legs faster than it takes me to do it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it has a nice fragrance without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
            <li> I also liked that the bottle did not have metal on the bottom and did not leave rust in my tub.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST!  </li>
            <li> like I need to wash afterwards although it rinses off nicely.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice.  </li>
            <li> I liked the fact that it was non-aerosol and that its packaging didn&#x27;t look like a can of caffeinated malt beverage that was aimed at college freshmen with tattoos.  </li>
            <li> The bottle has a great shape and makes gripping easy.</li>
            <li> But it did shave very easily.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It does kind of clog up your razor so make sure to rinse it often when you&#x27;re in the process of shaving.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving cream I have used over the years.   </li>
            <li> This smells sooooo wonderful and leaves your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave a rust stain.</li>
            <li> Easy to shave with, lasts forever!</li>
            <li> The scents are also mild and pleasant.  </li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t burn and it cleaned up just fine with paper towels (I told you I was not at home!).</li>
            <li> *cute packaging  </li>
            <li> I have to change razors WAY more often when I use this because they get so gunky they stop working.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this stuff smells, but because of the way it gums up my razor, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I do love the smell of the vanilla.</li>
            <li> It did a nice job and my legs felt smooth afterwords - no dryness, no irritation, and no bumps.</li>
            <li> so I use more.</li>
            <li> The Vanilla Bliss is much better if you are trying to decide between the two.</li>
            <li> I also can tell better when I&#x27;ve missed a spot.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to like this product, the smell was great and it did moisturize my legs really well.</li>
            <li> This is definitely more like a body butter in terms of texture and the way it feels coming out of the pump.</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs feeling so smooth that I don&#x27;t need to use any lotion or follow up product!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I love vanilla, but it smells more like musk than vanilla.</li>
            <li> It may be ok for a man, but I was turned off by the scent.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love eos lip balm and figured this product would be on par.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I would not purchase this again, but maybe others will have better luck</li>
            <li> I love lotion and this shaving cream</li>
            <li> And my legs were so smooth!</li>
            <li> Smooth, and moisturized!</li>
            <li> Made my skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li> It says shave cream in its name, which it is, but it is more of a lotion than a foamy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You shouldn&#x27;t use a razor too many times to avoid infections from the cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It also smelled much better than most shaving creams.  </li>
            <li> I still plan to use EOS until something significantly better comes along.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the razor clogging problem others have had, but I do have good water pressure in my shower, so hair and cream just slide right off.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this really does anything spectacular in terms of giving you a better shave, but it&#x27;s a nice change from</li>
            <li> Wow!  Great product.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a nice, sweet vanilla - not too strong.</li>
            <li> :) I use it with the mach3 razor for a super close shave!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> but you have to use a lot because it doesn&#x27;t spread easily</li>
            <li> It smells great and leaves skin soft and smooth</li>
            <li> (it is strong so if you are scent averse don&#x27;t buy it)</li>
            <li> The berry one might be a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> If you are sure to exfoliate before shaving with this cream and a 3 blade razor, you&#x27;ll get a super close shave.</li>
            <li> It leaves you moisturized however, it gums up a razor and QUICK!</li>
            <li> Razor burn has always been a huge issue for me.</li>
            <li> If I had an unlimited, free supply of razors, I would use this stuff forever.</li>
            <li> My legs feel so smooth afterwards.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing, and it feels nice on the skin even after you have rinsed it off.</li>
            <li> THIS stuff however gets the job done of shaving and my skin IS exceptionally smooth afterwords.  </li>
            <li> My partner asked me how I get my bikini so smooth without waxing</li>
            <li> not pump then smooth</li>
            <li> Love the natural warm vanilla scent, not overly sweet or strong.</li>
            <li> packaging is cute and fun as is true for all EOS products.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find this product.  </li>
            <li> It takes a bit of getting used to, and I have to rinse out my razor every 2-3 strokes, but it&#x27;s so completely worth it!  </li>
            <li> Great for dry shaving as well.</li>
            <li> I feel like it protects my skin and leaves me feeling super smooth in all the places I shave with no razor burns.  </li>
            <li> so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great love the way it makes me feel, fortunately and not so fortunate my hair grows fast and is dark</li>
            <li> The vanilla scent is prominent, but doesn&#x27;t really stick around after rinsing.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many different things in order to have smooth skin after shaving.  </li>
            <li> and I really don&#x27;t like many &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s packaging is recyclable, it has a nice light scent, it leaves your skin smooth, and does a way better job at preventing razor burns than typical foam shaving cream.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to use a lot (two pumps will give you enough for a whole leg) and it stays on much more effectively than foaming gels.</li>
            <li> This stuff seemed like the best of the lot - since I didn&#x27;t want full on foaming shave cream or sticky gross gel as I was dry</li>
            <li> love this EOS cream because it leaves my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it leaves my skin after shaving!  </li>
            <li> It gets you a pretty close shave, and is SO moisturizing!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth, soft, and smells super clean :) leaves legs feeling soft and clean</li>
            <li> I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the price and the smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li> For those of you searching for a different kind of shaving cream...</li>
            <li> I had been a longtime Skintimate fan before trying this, but I didn&#x27;t like the idea of throwing away metal cans (no recycling for them in my area) and putting isobutane on freshly shaven skin.</li>
            <li> Works so well and is definitely worth it</li>
            <li> I rarely get razor burn when I use this shave lotion.  </li>
            <li> Well I am sure glad I did, this cream is unlike any other I have tried...</li>
            <li> I use barbosol right now</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t ever had such easy shaving!  </li>
            <li> I bought Eos shave cream for the first time because it&#x27;s not tested on animals.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is exactly that...a cream.</li>
            <li> Protects my legs better than regular shaving cream -- and doesn&#x27;t leave the yucky foam in the bath.</li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;m a sucker for attractive</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather but it&#x27;s soft, moisturizing and smooth, helps me get a close shave</li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;m really funny about smells</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever bought a cream instead of a gel.</li>
            <li> But overall it&#x27;s okay.....</li>
            <li> This product takes some getting used to if you have used a shave gel or standard shaving cream (from an aerosol can) like most people use.</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure your skin is properly covered for the razor to glide on.</li>
            <li> bought my EOS cream at my local CVS pharmacy and didn&#x27;t pay more than $5/bottle.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very different from anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried; it comes out of the bottle looking more like lotion than a shaving product.  </li>
            <li> There are some things I loved about it, and some things I really disliked...  </li>
            <li> , I think it smells delicious (at least the vanilla fragrance which I tried), and it really did leave my legs quite soft.     </li>
            <li> Also love the good ingredients, hard to find a shaving cream without parabens, petrolatum, or especially triethanolamine.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything.</li>
            <li> The scent was great, but there are plenty of other shaving creams out there with a similar scent without these pesky negatives.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It did get clogged in between my razor blades after several swipes, but a second or two under warm running water cleared it right up.</li>
            <li> Again, due to the product&#x27;s consistency, when the level is very low, and you can&#x27;t even manage to shake more product out of the top of the container with the pump removed, there will still be product in the container.  </li>
            <li> On one hand, I love the packaging (it comes in a pretty plastic bottle which is a bit textured and has grips, so it doesn&#x27;t slip from wet hands and won&#x27;t leave rust rings on the counter)</li>
            <li> Also my biggest problem is when shaving I constantly have to keep rinsing my razor after 3 strokes which is fine</li>
            <li> I seriously will never buy another kind of shaving cream again!</li>
            <li> really moisturizes  </li>
            <li> As others may have stated, you may want to pump a couple of times to really get enough all over your entire leg, but the softness of the skin post-shave is amazing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really silky and creamy and spreads really well.</li>
            <li> It really is moisturizing.</li>
            <li> It leaves my legs &amp; arms smooth and silky and now 6 hours later as I&#x27;m writing this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only shave cream that I&#x27;ve ever used that gives me a close, smooth shave without razor burn.</li>
            <li> and I ended up using about 6 per leg because it doesn&#x27;t really spread well</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> so it really helps prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> but I will say that I really like this cream.  </li>
            <li> Be prepared for some trial and error while you figure out how much you need.</li>
            <li> Really smells like vanilla.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much, and you get the smoothest shave.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d rather use real shower cream..</li>
            <li> I went through my first bottle of it very quickly since I used too much, expecting a lather like other foams and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you haven&#x27;t used non-foaming cream before, you should know that you&#x27;ll have to rinse your razor more to unclog it, just as you would with any other shave lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because its like a lotion, it does seem to be more moisturizing than other products.</li>
            <li> would give it 5 stars but for a few things that are less than ideal about it.  </li>
            <li> I am an average size person, and it took a lot more than 1-2 pumps like it claims to cover my legs.</li>
            <li> I love both amazon and eos shaving cream (btw), I&#x27;ve seen bad and good reviews</li>
            <li> I have even been in a rush and not lotioned, and my legs still looked decent.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I wonder about cosmetics that I buy on Amazon, because they can be old or expired, or seconds or something.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the Vanilla, and it&#x27;s a light scent.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product, that&#x27;s if you want to be risky.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found that I have to replace my blades more often, as other reviews have; the trick is just to rinse the blades frequently as you shave, for me anyway.  </li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this at Target on a whim, because my normal go-to shave gel was out of stock.</li>
            <li> So I saw this at a local drugstore and decided it was worth a shot.</li>
            <li> DEFINITELY worth the price over regular brands</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my &#x27;lady parts&#x27; like many of the heavily scented shaving foams marketed specifically for women do.</li>
            <li> It left my legs super soft and completely stubble-free.</li>
            <li> I know that with regular cream or body wash my hair gets more coarse, but with EOS shaving cream my hair actually comes out smoother and don&#x27;t have to shave as often.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to not feel any razor burn, and I think this was the first time in several years that I didn&#x27;t knick myself shaving even once!</li>
            <li> I love that this can be used on both dry and wet skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m kind of pressed for time in the morning, really bugged by tedious time wasters.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t dry-shaved since my highschool swim team days; back then, it consisted of using hand lotion on my legs and underarms in the locker room before meets, and getting intense razor burn for a couple days afterward.</li>
            <li> the are just as soft.</li>
            <li> I shave with it before I shower, because it is a bit greasy, but after I&#x27;m finished and showered my face feels incredibly soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband LOVES how soft it makes my legs.  </li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I wish they made something similar for your whole body.</li>
            <li> , I find it really eliminated razor burn, especially in bikini area.    </li>
            <li> No problem for me, I get my skin moist and then do a section at a time with no trouble.</li>
            <li> My 12 year old daughter has even stolen one</li>
            <li> Made my legs feel soft &amp; silky.</li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> The smell is divine and even after bathing my legs and armpits still feel soft and moisturised.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, pick something else.</li>
            <li> B0000536EY Aveeno  Therapeutic Shave Gel with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal 7 oz (198 g)]]</li>
            <li> Most products don&#x27;t do enough to moisturize as I&#x27;m using them, and I end up with irritated skin that I can&#x27;t shave again for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I love that the shaving lotion is a lotion and thick, unlike gels.</li>
            <li> I know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and a lot of things come into play with razor burn and such (if you shave when you first get in the shower, the type of shaver, how new the blades are, the cream)</li>
            <li> I mean it left my legs feeling amazing</li>
            <li> There was only one left, and they were on sale, so I assumed it must be pretty good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Though I do like this product; it leaves my legs very soft, not dry like foam products.</li>
            <li> It is a little thick, but I just wet my legs first and smooth it on lightly.  </li>
            <li> and I love it however hard to find female version easily.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I went into Walgreen&#x27;s last month to pick up a new can and discovered EOS on the shaving goods shelf; I had never seen it before.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise I could see how it may seem that the blades are getting dull, but my Gillette Venus blades have held up just fine.</li>
            <li> After shaving my skin is left soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> After I&#x27;m done, lotion is an option now - it leaves my skin soft enough</li>
            <li> The tendency is to want to use more, to get some lather, but that is unnecessary.  </li>
            <li> It feels like lotion when you are putting it on, which was a bit odd at first.</li>
            <li> Even a few days after shaving, my legs are pretty</li>
            <li> My skin is sensitive and gets dry and irritated from shaving.</li>
            <li> first I was a little skeptical: it didn&#x27;t foam up like most shave gel.</li>
            <li> for wet shaving where it really shines is for dry shaving.</li>
            <li> No need to pile it on, just apply  a thin layer in opposite direction of hair growth and it does fine.  </li>
            <li> However, the cream was really thick and clogged up my razor, leaving me with a less smooth shave than a gel.</li>
            <li> To accumulate a decent amount of product quickly requires depressing plunger and pulling it back up over &amp; over &amp; over.</li>
            <li> When I got it home and tried it, I was surprised to see how little foam it produced; essentially none.  </li>
            <li> so I stopped at the local store and looked for something that would work to dry shave.</li>
            <li> but It left me feeling really dry though</li>
            <li> This is the only shave cream I have found that doesn&#x27;t completely dry out my legs.</li>
            <li> I only use a little because you actually don&#x27;t need to lather up as with regular shaving creams.</li>
            <li> but my bottles have lasted a long time.</li>
            <li> Still, these are minor quibbles.  </li>
            <li> It last longer than I expected to after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li> I shoved it to the back of the cabinet only to pull it back out a few months later after I ran out of what I had been previously using.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have razor clogging issues like the other reviewers here; I use a generic version of the Gillette Venus Embrace 5 blade and had no problems.</li>
            <li> However due to age the product has hardened enough it does not come out of the pump!</li>
            <li> Finally, the thickness of the product means that it doesn&#x27;t rinse out of the razor as easily as do other products.  </li>
            <li> It felt like I was dry shaving.</li>
            <li> First, because of the product&#x27;s thick consistency -- about that of sour cream -- the pump doesn&#x27;t manage to dispense it well.  </li>
            <li> I can shave every single day with it, and I do.  </li>
            <li> For a dry shave I can give this my recommendation!</li>
            <li> this is soooo creamy you need less than regular shave creams/gels.</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the bottle, you can shave wet or dry.</li>
            <li> One bottle lasts a long time, so buying a three pack is extremely cost-effective.</li>
            <li> I used to use shaving creams and even gels and even body wash which would make my razor scrape loudly across my skin and dull my blade.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that the pump doesn&#x27;t get out the last 1/4 of the product, so I have to unscrew it and shake it out.  </li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t smell it on me a few hours later.</li>
            <li> It is thick but works well &amp; leaves skin incredibly soft.  </li>
            <li> The down side is that it does seem to need to be used in smaller patches than the old stand by shave gels or creams, and that can slow the process down a bit.  </li>
            <li> *a little goes a long way  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t foam like other shave gels out there</li>
            <li> I was changing mine every other shave which I have NEVER had to do before.</li>
            <li> I have always been a blade-shaver and, for the past ten or so years of my 35-year shaving history, have used Aveda, Aveeno and other \\&quot;premium\\&quot; shaving gels.  </li>
            <li> But the litmus test of a shaving gel/cream is if it creates a lubricating film that allows the razor to glide over the skin and this, EOS does extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I have had fewer nicks than usual since switching to EOS and my facial skin is noticeably softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> did have one bottle that clogged my razor, but the other 4 didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I would probably try a different scent next time, but this one isn&#x27;t terrible (and I am usually pretty sensitive to perfume-y things).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little does go quite a ways, I usually do 2-3 pumps per leg and it leaves a visible enough layer that I can still see where I&#x27;ve gone over.</li>
            <li> Other down side is the usual trouble with a pump container, the bottom always has product left</li>
            <li> It is very sweet smelling and to some it may be a little sickly.</li>
            <li> your going back and forth at least try it once and see if it&#x27;s something for you.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the pump bottle.</li>
            <li> but since it&#x27;s so thick and creamy it&#x27;s the struggle to actually rinse off my razor.</li>
            <li> It still stayed thick enough to use and let me get the rest out of the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Once you get 2/3 through the container, there isn&#x27;t sufficient pressure from the product settling down to push it into the intake tube, so you will have to shake it down every time you pump.  </li>
            <li> No more dry skin.  </li>
            <li> If anything it has made them less clogged.</li>
            <li> all the typical shaving gels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still trying to adapt to using less--</li>
            <li> half a week without shaving.</li>
            <li> so I just added some water to it and shook it up a little.  </li>
            <li> I also bought this and didn&#x27;t know it was non foaming and was mad at first.</li>
            <li> I used about 4 pumps per leg (and I have long legs)--you really only need a very thin layer of it to shave.</li>
            <li> It takes a few uses to get used to using this if switching from shave gel.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s almost too fluffy and creamy.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty bad luck with shaving creams and gels.</li>
            <li> While I was shaving, I felt like my razor was dragging, not gliding like it usually does with foaming shaving creams, and I got a few small cuts on the backs of my calves.     </li>
            <li> I bought the cream for the shaving purposes though, and for that I unfortunately have to go back to skintamite.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is in it that helps with softening hair as it grows.</li>
            <li> I usually used body wash as a shave cream and always had razor burn - I also realized after using this I stopped getting razor burn.</li>
            <li> Also, the spring is too weak to reliably return the pump head to the up position; you&#x27;ll often have to pull it upwards after pushing down.  </li>
            <li> It dispenses very little product per pump and device rebounds slowly.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t use a dull or overused razor because it will knick your skin, but I think that&#x27;s a 101 of shaving anyway.</li>
            <li> It has a nice-enough scent...just a generic, artificial vanilla smell.</li>
            <li> This has a thick creamy texture that coats skin</li>
            <li> It does get really thick at the bottom of the bottle when there is still plenty in there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried it out for about half the bottle, but unfortunately will be throwing the remaining out.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is just simply not a good product.</li>
            <li> This cream is the only one that I can use that doesn&#x27;t anger my skin.  </li>
            <li> Why do natural, paraben-free products have to be so bloody pricey?</li>
            <li> You use a pump and need just a thin layer on your skin for it to do its job.</li>
            <li> I was a little apprehensive about using this Eos to dry-shave, given my past experience, but I also hate the hassle of shaving in the bathtub</li>
            <li> I suppose that this could be used for dry shaving, but that method always gives me nasty little nicks.</li>
            <li> As well, the vanilla smell is very subtle, during and after use, and didn&#x27;t overpower my nose.  </li>
            <li> the price, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This gums up my razors like crazy.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem is that it clogs up your razor like crazy.</li>
            <li> I was never a fan of the cream-based shaving gels, but I thought that I would give this a try, and was disappointed once again.</li>
            <li> I had always had issues with painful razor burn on my bikini line and underarms and there were NONE after using this!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Easy to shave with, lasts forever! I used to use shaving creams and even gels and even body wash which would make my razor scrape loudly across my skin and dull my blade. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had pretty bad luck with shaving creams and gels. I&#x27;m stocking up on this one! Eos Vanilla Bliss smells really great and leaves your areas incredibly smooth, including the bikini zone. The vanilla scent is prominent, but doesn&#x27;t really stick around after rinsing. Plus, the bottle has these nifty grooves so that the bottle doesn&#x27;t slip and slide while pumping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only bitty-bat is the price. Why do natural, paraben-free products have to be so bloody pricey? Sigh. :P</li>
            <li> I bought Eos shave cream for the first time because it&#x27;s not tested on animals. There are some things I loved about it, and some things I really disliked...  PROS:  *smells great  *really moisturizes  *not tested on animals  *cute packaging  *a little goes a long way  CONS:  *This gums up my razors like crazy. I have to change razors WAY more often when I use this because they get so gunky they stop working.  *Towards the end of the bottle, the pump stops working and you have to kind of pound the bottle until the rest comes out.  I love the way this stuff smells, but because of the way it gums up my razor, I probably won&#x27;t buy it again. If I had an unlimited, free supply of razors, I would use this stuff forever.</li>
            <li> I truly think this stuff is great. The bottle has a great shape and makes gripping easy. I love that the shaving lotion is a lotion and thick, unlike gels. As others may have stated, you may want to pump a couple of times to really get enough all over your entire leg, but the softness of the skin post-shave is amazing. I do love the smell of the vanilla. It&#x27;s not too over powering and I don&#x27;t smell it on me a few hours later.</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is exactly that...a cream. It doesn&#x27;t foam like other shave gels out there and that&#x27;s the beauty of it. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot (two pumps will give you enough for a whole leg) and it stays on much more effectively than foaming gels. The cream formula also moisturizes, so you won&#x27;t have to use lotion after you get out of the shower. The vanilla scent is pleasant, not overpowering, so it&#x27;s perfect for people who are perfume sensitive.</li>
            <li> Smells great.  Easy to use.  Protects my legs better than regular shaving cream -- and doesn&#x27;t leave the yucky foam in the bath.</li>
            <li> While this works o.k. for wet shaving where it really shines is for dry shaving. I was needing to shave and was not at home (no I&#x27;m not gonna tell you why!) so I stopped at the local store and looked for something that would work to dry shave. This stuff seemed like the best of the lot - since I didn&#x27;t want full on foaming shave cream or sticky gross gel as I was dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell (it is strong so if you are scent averse don&#x27;t buy it) but it didn&#x27;t burn and it cleaned up just fine with paper towels (I told you I was not at home!). It did a nice job and my legs felt smooth afterwords - no dryness, no irritation, and no bumps. I didn&#x27;t try bikini area or anything - just the legs. For a dry shave I can give this my recommendation!</li>
            <li> I like the plastic bottle so there is no \\&quot;rust ring\\&quot; like with some shaving gels. I like the scent and the cream consistency but it feels like you are shaving with conditioner. It takes a few uses to get used to using this if switching from shave gel. I also have the EOS Shave Cream Lavender Jasmine scent and it is a thinner consistency so I use more. The Vanilla Bliss is much better if you are trying to decide between the two. I would probably buy this or another brand&#x27;s shave cream, depending on what is on sale.</li>
            <li> This is, by far, the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used. And I&#x27;ve pretty much tried everything. It smells amazing, and it&#x27;s very effective -- and moisturizing. One bottle lasts a long time, so buying a three pack is extremely cost-effective. I will only be buying this from now on.</li>
            <li> I got a bottle of this at Target on a whim, because my normal go-to shave gel was out of stock. I guess I&#x27;m a sucker for attractive packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t dry-shaved since my highschool swim team days; back then, it consisted of using hand lotion on my legs and underarms in the locker room before meets, and getting intense razor burn for a couple days afterward. I was a little apprehensive about using this Eos to dry-shave, given my past experience, but I also hate the hassle of shaving in the bathtub so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is AWESOME. It&#x27;s really silky and creamy and spreads really well. I used about 4 pumps per leg (and I have long legs)--you really only need a very thin layer of it to shave. I was pleasantly surprised to not feel any razor burn, and I think this was the first time in several years that I didn&#x27;t knick myself shaving even once! Best of all, any leftover cream that I had on my legs could just be rubbed in like lotion after I was finished shaving. It left my legs super soft and completely stubble-free. It has a nice-enough scent...just a generic, artificial vanilla smell. I would probably try a different scent next time, but this one isn&#x27;t terrible (and I am usually pretty sensitive to perfume-y things).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did get clogged in between my razor blades after several swipes, but a second or two under warm running water cleared it right up. It was kind of a pain to keep doing that, but I still finished my legs faster than it takes me to do it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely an Eos convert now.</li>
            <li> Smells great, moisturizes, easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t leave foam or clumps all over the place.  You do have to go through quite a bit of it but my bottles have lasted a long time. My son even uses it to shave his face and loves it and husband with his skull shaver. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used foams and I&#x27;ve used gels, but never used a shave cream before.  I&#x27;m a convert.  It really is moisturizing. My legs feel so smooth afterwards.  I also can tell better when I&#x27;ve missed a spot.  This has a pleasant vanilla scent, works well, and lasts longer than shaving cream or gel too.</li>
            <li> I bought this shaving cream at target because there was a $1 off coupon on the razors I buy... Well I am sure glad I did, this cream is unlike any other I have tried... It leaves my legs &amp; arms smooth and silky and now 6 hours later as I&#x27;m writing this the are just as soft. People have said that it clogs razors, well I have not had this problem... If anything it has made them less clogged.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t lather but it&#x27;s soft, moisturizing and smooth, helps me get a close shave but you have to use a lot because it doesn&#x27;t spread easily</li>
            <li> I bought this at the local Walgreens. There was only one left, and they were on sale, so I assumed it must be pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this stuff is INCREDIBLE. It&#x27;s the only shave cream that I&#x27;ve ever used that gives me a close, smooth shave without razor burn. Razor burn has always been a huge issue for me. I&#x27;ve used every preventative treatment imaginable, and this stuff does the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, it feels a bit like shea cocoa butter. I shave with it before I shower, because it is a bit greasy, but after I&#x27;m finished and showered my face feels incredibly soft and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, you cannot go wrong.</li>
            <li> Although I didn&#x27;t purchase it from Amazon I love both amazon and eos shaving cream (btw), I&#x27;ve seen bad and good reviews and once I saw it at WalMart for three  dollars so I decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great love the way it makes me feel, fortunately and not so fortunate my hair grows fast and is dark so I feel like I&#x27;m constantly shaving! with this I felt like I got a close shave and after a couple of days I&#x27;m still good!!! Plus I&#x27;m really funny about smells and it has a nice fragrance without being overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;If your going back and forth at least try it once and see if it&#x27;s something for you.</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d ever bought a cream instead of a gel. I will not be going back. I wanted to like this product, the smell was great and it did moisturize my legs really well. However, the cream was really thick and clogged up my razor, leaving me with a less smooth shave than a gel. I also liked that the bottle did not have metal on the bottom and did not leave rust in my tub. I bought the cream for the shaving purposes though, and for that I unfortunately have to go back to skintamite.</li>
            <li> This smells amazing and feels amazing but it&#x27;s almost too fluffy and creamy. The bottle said to use 2 to 3 pumps and I ended up using about 6 per leg because it doesn&#x27;t really spread well and it&#x27;s almost like a lotion and smears. Also my biggest problem is when shaving I constantly have to keep rinsing my razor after 3 strokes which is fine but since it&#x27;s so thick and creamy it&#x27;s the struggle to actually rinse off my razor. But overall it&#x27;s okay.....I mean it left my legs feeling amazing so I&#x27;m not complaining.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute BEST!  My husband LOVES how soft it makes my legs.  Great for dry shaving as well.</li>
            <li> This is definitely more like a body butter in terms of texture and the way it feels coming out of the pump. It does kind of clog up your razor so make sure to rinse it often when you&#x27;re in the process of shaving. Otherwise, it has worked well. It is very moisturizing, and it feels nice on the skin even after you have rinsed it off. I have even been in a rush and not lotioned, and my legs still looked decent. I don&#x27;t think this really does anything spectacular in terms of giving you a better shave, but it&#x27;s a nice change from all the typical shaving gels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is cute and fun as is true for all EOS products. The smell may be hit or miss. It is very sweet smelling and to some it may be a little sickly. If you&#x27;re picky about smells, I would opt out of this one. Although after I lotion (even with unscented lotions) I can&#x27;t really smell it anymore.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many different things in order to have smooth skin after shaving.  I have really sensitive skin and I really don&#x27;t like many &amp;#34;smells&amp;#34; that cosmetics and skincare companies use, because they are just too pungent.  THIS stuff however gets the job done of shaving and my skin IS exceptionally smooth afterwords.  As well, the vanilla smell is very subtle, during and after use, and didn&#x27;t overpower my nose.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This has a thick creamy texture that coats skin well so it really helps prevent razor burn. Love the natural warm vanilla scent, not overly sweet or strong. Also love the good ingredients, hard to find a shaving cream without parabens, petrolatum, or especially triethanolamine.</li>
            <li> This shave cream is awesome! It leaves my legs feeling so smooth that I don&#x27;t need to use any lotion or follow up product! The thickness and moisture the product produces helps to prevent any nicks/cuts! I recommend this product to anyone and often give it to friends as gifts, so they can be introduced to how great of a product it is!</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I love vanilla, but it smells more like musk than vanilla. It may be ok for a man, but I was turned off by the scent. And now I&#x27;m stuck with 3 cof them, because it was the only way to purchase it.</li>
            <li> This is a great shaving cream.  It&#x27;s like using lotion to shave your legs, which works by the way, only a bit lighter.</li>
            <li> Love this! My skin is sensitive and gets dry and irritated from shaving. This smells great and leaves my legs hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t used non-foaming cream before, you should know that you&#x27;ll have to rinse your razor more to unclog it, just as you would with any other shave lotion. I find that the Venus razor rinses best with shave lotion.</li>
            <li> Wow!  Great product.  I can&#x27;t believe the difference it makes in moisture on my legs.  No more dry skin.  I wish they made something similar for your whole body.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I love eos lip balm and figured this product would be on par.  It felt like I was dry shaving. I have used several non foaming shave creams and never got a result like this. I recommend dr carvers shave butter, it is sold by dollar shave club.</li>
            <li> I love it it&#x27;s smooth, soft, and smells super clean :) leaves legs feeling soft and clean :) I use it with the mach3 razor for a super close shave!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so conflicted about this product... On one hand, I love the packaging (it comes in a pretty plastic bottle which is a bit textured and has grips, so it doesn&#x27;t slip from wet hands and won&#x27;t leave rust rings on the counter), I think it smells delicious (at least the vanilla fragrance which I tried), and it really did leave my legs quite soft.     However, there are definitely some cons to this product as well. I had to use a lot of the cream to shave - around ten pumps per leg, which felt like it made a hefty dent in the total weight of the bottle. I was never a fan of the cream-based shaving gels, but I thought that I would give this a try, and was disappointed once again. The cream is not water-soluble, so it comes off in big, greasy clumps which stick to the sides of bathtubs and showers, even clogging up the drain a bit. I suppose that this could be used for dry shaving, but that method always gives me nasty little nicks. While I was shaving, I felt like my razor was dragging, not gliding like it usually does with foaming shaving creams, and I got a few small cuts on the backs of my calves.     I would not purchase this again, but maybe others will have better luck - I&#x27;m sticking to my Aveeno for now.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best shaving cream I have used over the years.   No itching or feeling like I need to wash afterwards although it rinses off nicely. It smells great and leaves skin soft and smooth, I find it really eliminated razor burn, especially in bikini area.    The down side is that it does seem to need to be used in smaller patches than the old stand by shave gels or creams, and that can slow the process down a bit.  No problem for me, I get my skin moist and then do a section at a time with no trouble. No need to pile it on, just apply  a thin layer in opposite direction of hair growth and it does fine.  Other down side is the usual trouble with a pump container, the bottom always has product left and it&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
            <li> For those of you searching for a different kind of shaving cream...this is it.  I love lotion and this shaving cream is like rubbing lotion on your skin.  I haven&#x27;t ever had such easy shaving!  After shaving my skin is left soft and moisturized.  I was so excited to find this product.  A family member who shaves his head uses it daily and recommended it.</li>
            <li> I went on a trip and forgot to bring shaving cream, so I borrowed this from my friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I was a little skeptical: it didn&#x27;t foam up like most shave gel. But it did shave very easily. And my legs were so smooth! Smooth, and moisturized! I didn&#x27;t even need to put lotion on my legs after I shave. It smells nice, works perfectly. I have never been so happy with something as trivial as shaving cream. Even a few days after shaving, my legs are pretty soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t find it at my Target, so I ordered a three pack from Amazon. I seriously will never buy another kind of shaving cream again!</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is just simply not a good product. The biggest problem is that it clogs up your razor like crazy. I was changing mine every other shave which I have NEVER had to do before. I am an average size person, and it took a lot more than 1-2 pumps like it claims to cover my legs. The scent was great, but there are plenty of other shaving creams out there with a similar scent without these pesky negatives. I&#x27;ve tried it out for about half the bottle, but unfortunately will be throwing the remaining out.</li>
            <li> It is thick but works well &amp; leaves skin incredibly soft.  Makes it so I can even shave my legs during the winter without worry of severe dryness.</li>
            <li> I know that everyone&#x27;s skin is different and a lot of things come into play with razor burn and such (if you shave when you first get in the shower, the type of shaver, how new the blades are, the cream) but I will say that I really like this cream.  I&#x27;ve used a lot of gels (aveeno, skintimate, gilette) and the only one that never gave me issues before was the skintimate cream but It left me feeling really dry though and I prefer products not tested on animals.  So I tried this one and it&#x27;s nice.  It is a little thick, but I just wet my legs first and smooth it on lightly.  I feel like it protects my skin and leaves me feeling super smooth in all the places I shave with no razor burns.  My partner asked me how I get my bikini so smooth without waxing and I know it&#x27;s this product.  It does get really thick at the bottom of the bottle when there is still plenty in there so I just added some water to it and shook it up a little.  It still stayed thick enough to use and let me get the rest out of the bottle.  I definitely think it&#x27;s worth the price and the smell is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Made my skin nice and smooth</li>
            <li> I had been a longtime Skintimate fan before trying this, but I didn&#x27;t like the idea of throwing away metal cans (no recycling for them in my area) and putting isobutane on freshly shaven skin. So I saw this at a local drugstore and decided it was worth a shot. I&#x27;m so glad I got it! I had always had issues with painful razor burn on my bikini line and underarms and there were NONE after using this! I didn&#x27;t have razor clogging issues like the other reviewers here; I use a generic version of the Gillette Venus Embrace 5 blade and had no problems. A little does go quite a ways, I usually do 2-3 pumps per leg and it leaves a visible enough layer that I can still see where I&#x27;ve gone over. After I&#x27;m done, lotion is an option now - it leaves my skin soft enough that I don&#x27;t have to moisturize if I don&#x27;t have time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this! It&#x27;s packaging is recyclable, it has a nice light scent, it leaves your skin smooth, and does a way better job at preventing razor burns than typical foam shaving cream.</li>
            <li> This product takes some getting used to if you have used a shave gel or standard shaving cream (from an aerosol can) like most people use. It says shave cream in its name, which it is, but it is more of a lotion than a foamy cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used Skintimate or Gillette gels and foams, but gave the Eos shave cream a try since the Vanilla Bliss smell sounded amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is like a lotion. You use a pump and need just a thin layer on your skin for it to do its job. Be prepared for some trial and error while you figure out how much you need. I went through my first bottle of it very quickly since I used too much, expecting a lather like other foams and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because its like a lotion, it does seem to be more moisturizing than other products. Lotion after shaving is still recommended, but this product leaves your skin smooth and smelling delicious.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it leaves my skin after shaving!  My 12 year old daughter has even stolen one so she can use it too</li>
            <li> Though I do like this product; it leaves my legs very soft, not dry like foam products.The scents are also mild and pleasant.  My only complaint is the pump bottle. It dispenses very little product per pump and device rebounds slowly. To accumulate a decent amount of product quickly requires depressing plunger and pulling it back up over &amp; over &amp; over. I&#x27;m kind of pressed for time in the morning, really bugged by tedious time wasters.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately didn&#x27;t work for me. Ended up with lots of nicks.</li>
            <li> Wonderful shaving cream! The Vanilla scent is a great way to leave my shaven face in the morning!</li>
            <li> This shaving cream is great. It feels like lotion when you are putting it on, which was a bit odd at first. This is the only shave cream I have found that doesn&#x27;t completely dry out my legs. If you are sure to exfoliate before shaving with this cream and a 3 blade razor, you&#x27;ll get a super close shave.</li>
            <li> I read some of the reviews and it seems the consensus is that they need to use a lot of cream. Well, it&#x27;s actually the opposite. I only use a little because you actually don&#x27;t need to lather up as with regular shaving creams. You just need to make sure your skin is properly covered for the razor to glide on. Also, don&#x27;t use a dull or overused razor because it will knick your skin, but I think that&#x27;s a 101 of shaving anyway. You shouldn&#x27;t use a razor too many times to avoid infections from the cuts.&lt;br /&gt;I love this EOS cream because it leaves my skin very soft. And I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient is in it that helps with softening hair as it grows. I know that with regular cream or body wash my hair gets more coarse, but with EOS shaving cream my hair actually comes out smoother and don&#x27;t have to shave as often.&lt;br /&gt;I bought my EOS cream at my local CVS pharmacy and didn&#x27;t pay more than $5/bottle. Plus the vanilla scent smells really good. The berry one might be a bit strong for my taste.</li>
            <li> Great deal on what was a great product. However due to age the product has hardened enough it does not come out of the pump! Shame, EOS made a great product and for whatever reason it is just no longer available.</li>
            <li> This smells sooooo wonderful and leaves your skin so soft. Really smells like vanilla. Excellent choice for a women&#x27;s shaving cream.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of the scent (vanilla) or how it works. Doesn&#x27;t help imo. Won&#x27;t re-order</li>
            <li> Still trying to adapt to using less-- this is soooo creamy you need less than regular shave creams/gels. But the smell is great, and makes my legs amazingly smooth! DEFINITELY worth the price over regular brands</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff.  The EOS Ultra Moisturizing Shave Cream multi packs are a great deal just wish they had a variety pack.</li>
            <li> I have always been a blade-shaver and, for the past ten or so years of my 35-year shaving history, have used Aveda, Aveeno and other \\&quot;premium\\&quot; shaving gels.  I went into Walgreen&#x27;s last month to pick up a new can and discovered EOS on the shaving goods shelf; I had never seen it before.  I liked the fact that it was non-aerosol and that its packaging didn&#x27;t look like a can of caffeinated malt beverage that was aimed at college freshmen with tattoos.  When I got it home and tried it, I was surprised to see how little foam it produced; essentially none.  It also smelled much better than most shaving creams.  But the litmus test of a shaving gel/cream is if it creates a lubricating film that allows the razor to glide over the skin and this, EOS does extremely well.  I have had fewer nicks than usual since switching to EOS and my facial skin is noticeably softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars but for a few things that are less than ideal about it.  First, because of the product&#x27;s thick consistency -- about that of sour cream -- the pump doesn&#x27;t manage to dispense it well.  Once you get 2/3 through the container, there isn&#x27;t sufficient pressure from the product settling down to push it into the intake tube, so you will have to shake it down every time you pump.  Also, the spring is too weak to reliably return the pump head to the up position; you&#x27;ll often have to pull it upwards after pushing down.  Again, due to the product&#x27;s consistency, when the level is very low, and you can&#x27;t even manage to shake more product out of the top of the container with the pump removed, there will still be product in the container.  I have to literally cut the container open so I can get into it with a spatula to get access to the final 1 - 2 tablespoons of product!  Finally, the thickness of the product means that it doesn&#x27;t rinse out of the razor as easily as do other products.  Still, these are minor quibbles.  I still plan to use EOS until something significantly better comes along.</li>
            <li> I have easily-irritated skin.  I&#x27;ve tried every combination of shaving creams/gels and razors you can think of.  Most products don&#x27;t do enough to moisturize as I&#x27;m using them, and I end up with irritated skin that I can&#x27;t shave again for a few days.  In the South in the middle of the summer, that just won&#x27;t do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter EOS.  This cream is the only one that I can use that doesn&#x27;t anger my skin.  I can shave every single day with it, and I do.  It&#x27;s very different from anything else I&#x27;ve ever tried; it comes out of the bottle looking more like lotion than a shaving product.  It takes a bit of getting used to, and I have to rinse out my razor every 2-3 strokes, but it&#x27;s so completely worth it!  I haven&#x27;t found that I have to replace my blades more often, as other reviews have; the trick is just to rinse the blades frequently as you shave, for me anyway.  Otherwise I could see how it may seem that the blades are getting dull, but my Gillette Venus blades have held up just fine.</li>
            <li> I paid for what I got!&lt;br /&gt;And I love it! Made my legs feel soft &amp; silky. It last longer than I expected to after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Went half a week without shaving. Highly recommend this product, that&#x27;s if you want to be risky.</li>
            <li> This shave cream took a bit to get used to.  This has no lather.  The consistency is like lotion, and when you apply the cream, it looks like it disappears.  The tendency is to want to use more, to get some lather, but that is unnecessary.  To shave the lower portion of my legs, I use only one pump.  It looks like nothing is on your legs, however when you shave, it&#x27;s the best.  I am on my 5th bottle, and I have not cut myself one time since I&#x27;ve used this cream!  It&#x27;s a great, smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I did have one bottle that clogged my razor, but the other 4 didn&#x27;t.  Sometimes I wonder about cosmetics that I buy on Amazon, because they can be old or expired, or seconds or something.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used the Vanilla, and it&#x27;s a light scent.  I definitely recommend this cream.  You don&#x27;t need much, and you get the smoothest shave.  Only complaint is that the pump doesn&#x27;t get out the last 1/4 of the product, so I have to unscrew it and shake it out.  But I can deal with that.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shave cream ! The smell is a nice, sweet vanilla - not too strong. I also bought this and didn&#x27;t know it was non foaming and was mad at first. I shoved it to the back of the cabinet only to pull it back out a few months later after I ran out of what I had been previously using. It gets you a pretty close shave, and is SO moisturizing! So moisturizing that I don&#x27;t even need to use lotion on my legs after shaving anymore. Wow. No shaving cream or body wash has ever done that for me, even so called &#x27;moisturizing&#x27; ones. But this is amazing. I usually used body wash as a shave cream and always had razor burn - I also realized after using this I stopped getting razor burn. It doesn&#x27;t burn or sting my &#x27;lady parts&#x27; like many of the heavily scented shaving foams marketed specifically for women do. Yay! Works so well and is definitely worth it, It has lasted me well over 3 months.</li>
            <li> Does what it says on the bottle, you can shave wet or dry. The smell is divine and even after bathing my legs and armpits still feel soft and moisturised. I haven&#x27;t had the razor clogging problem others have had, but I do have good water pressure in my shower, so hair and cream just slide right off. I hope they never discontinue this - best shave gel or cream I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only wish they sold this stuff in the UK so I didn&#x27;t have to wait until trips back to the States to get it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a shaving cream I like that can be found anywhere. I use barbosol right now and I love it however hard to find female version easily.&lt;br /&gt;I figured why not. The bottle is attractive. The smell is amazing. It leaves you moisturized however, it gums up a razor and QUICK! This also makes it take 10x longer to shave. You tend to shave the same area 2-3 times cause of how it gums the razor up. Then you can&#x27;t get it out of the razor!&lt;br /&gt;I think it&#x27;d rather squirt it on my legs not pump then smooth, just makes a big ol mess!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see buying another bottle..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d rather use real shower cream..</li>
            <li> The consistency of this is like a lotion, it doesn&#x27;t foam or lather at all. It doesn&#x27;t protect your skin at all from cuts or razor burn. My skin was quite irritated after shaving with this. If you have sensitive skin, pick something else. I recommend aveeno. [[ASIN:B0000536EY Aveeno  Therapeutic Shave Gel with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal 7 oz (198 g)]]</li>
            <li> I love that this can be used on both dry and wet skin.  I rarely get razor burn when I use this shave lotion.  It smells amazing and love the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave a rust stain.</li>
