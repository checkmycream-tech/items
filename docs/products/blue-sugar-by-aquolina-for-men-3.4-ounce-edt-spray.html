            <li>It smells edible (a delicious mixture of caramel, licorice, cotton candy, and musk) -</li>
            <li>The recipient was VERY happy to receive this.  </li>
            <li>Every time he wears it, women are sniffing and smiling and saying how great he smells!</li>

            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>I love this scent!!!</li>
            <li>It is really great.  </li>
            <li>(he should, I thought it smelled great on a man...</li>
            <li>It is a great conversation starter...</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t smell great.  </li>
            <li>What smells so good?</li>
            <li>No kidding, good compliments ever where I go.</li>
            <li>It is STRONG,but smells good once it dries and the bottom notes come out.</li>
            <li>Great smell and for a better price</li>
            <li>I sure am glad they included it!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had so many people stop me in the grocery store before!  </li>
            <li>Ladies love it!</li>
            <li>I wore each of them on different days and ranked them according to which I liked best.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also pretty uncommon and has a bit of novelty to it if you like branching out from the mainstream.</li>
            <li>i bought this for my husband and completely love it on him.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m telling you, I love this cologne.</li>
            <li>My man smells so sexy with this on.</li>
            <li>I recommended this to everybody :}</li>
            <li>I feel it would work better as an air freshener.</li>
            <li>I received a tester of this with another cologne, and the sample was actually pretty good stuff..</li>
            <li>If it smells strong at first and not so great,wait til it warms to the skin,it smells much better!</li>
            <li>Way Way too strong of a scent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a few years and it&#x27;s the best.</li>
            <li>would describe the smell as a sweet, light, somewhat sugary scent.</li>
            <li>Clean scent and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>but when I got a full bottle.. i regretted it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product a 4, because it seems to appeal to women (which is honestly the main reason I purchased this product), and it was pretty inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Just make sure that you&#x27;re okay with possibly being bitten!</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with this cologne which has the fragrance of freshly baked birthday cake, I came back for a second.</li>
            <li>Oh, the smell and the whole of bottle are very exact!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t give it a five, because I don&#x27;t personally enjoy the smell a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Smells amazing every time in run low</li>
            <li>I loved the women&#x27;s version, Pink Sugar, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>Fun times.</li>
            <li>Some reviews say that this could be unisex but I would categorize this scent as masculine for sure.</li>
            <li>I was trying Blue Sugar to see if I liked it</li>
            <li>Oh and SUPER fast shipping was a plus!</li>
            <li>I find myself sniffing him out in the grocery store and it leads me right to him.</li>
            <li>At first, I was hesitate to order this due to \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot; as its very cheaper than where i bought it for 50 dollars.</li>
            <li>However, after having it for a couple weeks in my room and giving it a second try - the smell seems to have thinned out a pit into something much more tolerable.</li>
            <li>I tried wearing it a couple times and got some positive feedback.</li>
            <li>The first time I bought it I bought a whole bottle in 2008 and it took me 2011 to finish it.</li>
            <li>but i strong enough to smell it on him at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>When I ordered all of the scents, a free sample of Blue Sugar was included with one of the scents I ordered.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something a bit different and  without breaking the bank, this would be a sound choice.</li>
            <li>I love the Pink sugar perfume, so I thought reading all of the reviews I would like this one for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Really amazon.</li>
            <li>If you spray this stuff somewhere and air it out for about 20 min, it comes close to smelling like the vial I got as a sample, but it is so intense</li>
            <li>Well,let me start by saying WOW!!!</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I wear and LOVE Pink Sugar!</li>
            <li>It smells musty and then dries sweeter which starts to smell a little better</li>
            <li>I have also bought Pink Sugar for two past girlfriends who agree that the two scents smell great together.</li>
            <li>It is a strong, unique scent though, so just a little goes a long way.    </li>
            <li>This is the only cologne my husband wants to use!</li>
            <li>/&gt;After I finished ranking all the colognes, the 1st large bottle I ordered was the 3.4 Ounce bottle of Blue</li>
            <li>I purchased this fragrance after reading all the positive reviews also let me just say I&#x27;m not a very picky person</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m feeling sorry for telling you all what an amazing fragrance</li>
            <li>I ordered 10 different tester colonges from Amazon ranging from different names (example: various Givenchi scents, CK scents, Victoria&#x27;s Secret (Very Sexy), etc.)</li>
            <li>your face\\&quot; and some you could barely even smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing blue sugar for 3 years, I always try new stuff, but NEVER get the reaction I get from Blue Sugar.  </li>
            <li>Not many chaps can pull off this scent - which makes it kinda rare, in that aspect.</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for a few years and it&#x27;s the best. Not many chaps can pull off this scent - which makes it kinda rare, in that aspect. It&#x27;s definitely not for the faint at heart. In fact, I&#x27;m feeling sorry for telling you all what an amazing fragrance it is cause then you might wanna wear it.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my husband and completely love it on him. The scent it not overwhelming but i strong enough to smell it on him at the end of the day. i would recommend this cologne to any man.</li>
            <li> I highy recommend this perfume to any man. It smells edible (a delicious mixture of caramel, licorice, cotton candy, and musk) - which is, believe me, what you want when you&#x27;re around a lady. Just make sure that you&#x27;re okay with possibly being bitten! ;o)</li>
            <li> I loved the women&#x27;s version, Pink Sugar, so I tried this one.  It is really great.  I hear they are going to stop making it...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time I go out, I get mad compliments and lots of \\&quot;I want to take you home and eat you\\&quot; kinds of comments.  Fun times.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift.  The recipient was VERY happy to receive this.  Every time he wears it, women are sniffing and smiling and saying how great he smells!</li>
            <li> I ordered 10 different tester colonges from Amazon ranging from different names (example: various Givenchi scents, CK scents, Victoria&#x27;s Secret (Very Sexy), etc.) I wore each of them on different days and ranked them according to which I liked best. When I ordered all of the scents, a free sample of Blue Sugar was included with one of the scents I ordered. I sure am glad they included it!! It smells soooo good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of all the colognes I had ordered and ranked, this one got the only 10 out of 10 score (the next in line was Givenchy Pi that got a 9 out of 10). I did not factor in cost b/c I concentrated only on the scent of the colognes. Some were overpowering. Some were too \\&quot;in your face\\&quot; and some you could barely even smell. Blue Sugar was perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would describe the smell as a sweet, light, somewhat sugary scent. Some reviews say that this could be unisex but I would categorize this scent as masculine for sure. I&#x27;m telling you, I love this cologne. I get compliments non-stop so you should expect the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I finished ranking all the colognes, the 1st large bottle I ordered was the 3.4 Ounce bottle of Blue Sugar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I want this to get around too much, but I can&#x27;t go anyplace that I don&#x27;t get a \\&quot; What smells so good? has somebody got cookies or cotton candy? If you want to smell like tasty food, this scent is for you. No kidding, good compliments ever where I go. Hey, stop trying to bite my neck, ya animal!</li>
            <li> This is the only cologne my husband wants to use! Smells wonderful. Clean scent and not overpowering. It is very hard to find, and when found the prices are very high...usually 40 percent above retail!</li>
            <li> My man smells so sexy with this on. I find myself sniffing him out in the grocery store and it leads me right to him. Great smell and for a better price then I have seen.also try pink sugar for women it has my hunny going crazy over the smell.</li>
            <li> This is the type of cologne I have been wanting for years, not too overpowering, yet it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I was trying Blue Sugar to see if I liked it but it has that one note I didn&#x27;t like.  I did like it enough to leave it for my boyfriend who did find it about 3 weeks later and now wears it to work so I think that its a hit.  Don&#x27;t know if he gets compliments on it (he should, I thought it smelled great on a man...while I adore Pink Sugar for women)</li>
            <li> At first, I was hesitate to order this due to \\&quot;too good to be true\\&quot; as its very cheaper than where i bought it for 50 dollars. Oh, the smell and the whole of bottle are very exact! I recommended this to everybody :}</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I wear and LOVE Pink Sugar! So I thought I&#x27;d buy this for my Fiance&#x27; to try. Well,let me start by saying WOW!!! It is STRONG,but smells good once it dries and the bottom notes come out. My advice,give it a chance. If it smells strong at first and not so great,wait til it warms to the skin,it smells much better! Oh and SUPER fast shipping was a plus!</li>
            <li> This is my second 3.4-ounce bottle that I have bought off of Amazon. The first time I bought it I bought a whole bottle in 2008 and it took me 2011 to finish it. I was so impressed with this cologne which has the fragrance of freshly baked birthday cake, I came back for a second. I have also bought Pink Sugar for two past girlfriends who agree that the two scents smell great together.</li>
            <li> I originally gave this product 2 stars, because out of the box it had a sickeningly sweet/syrupy smell like shoving your head in an unwashed cotton candy machine after a long day of use. However, after having it for a couple weeks in my room and giving it a second try - the smell seems to have thinned out a pit into something much more tolerable. I tried wearing it a couple times and got some positive feedback. Therefore, my conscience would not allow my 2 star rating to remain unaltered.   I&#x27;m giving this product a 4, because it seems to appeal to women (which is honestly the main reason I purchased this product), and it was pretty inexpensive. It&#x27;s also pretty uncommon and has a bit of novelty to it if you like branching out from the mainstream. I didn&#x27;t give it a five, because I don&#x27;t personally enjoy the smell a whole lot. If you&#x27;re looking for something a bit different and  without breaking the bank, this would be a sound choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing blue sugar for 3 years, I always try new stuff, but NEVER get the reaction I get from Blue Sugar.  I literally have people stop me all over the place to ask what I&#x27;m wearing.  It is a great conversation starter...I&#x27;ve never had so many people stop me in the grocery store before!  It is a strong, unique scent though, so just a little goes a long way.    I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years, so I know what it should smell like and how long a few sprays should last.  This stuff that I&#x27;ve ordered seems watered down.  The scent lasts for only a short time...requires a lot of respray. Of course at about $20 a bottle, what can you expect!</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance after reading all the positive reviews also let me just say I&#x27;m not a very picky person so it does not take much for me to be satisfied, however this fragrance is just terrible. Initially when sprayed your immediately disappointed after a while the smell just becomes tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For anyone that thinks you get what you pay for this is it, I&#x27;m a bit disappointed. Oh well on the to the next one.</li>
            <li> Great product! Only thing I wear</li>
            <li> Perfection. Smells amazing every time in run low I re-order! Ladies love it!</li>
            <li> I love the Pink sugar perfume, so I thought reading all of the reviews I would like this one for my husband.  Yikes its awful! It smells musty and then dries sweeter which starts to smell a little better but the two smells together doesn&#x27;t smell great.  I have worked in fragrances before and I don&#x27;t think I have smelled something this bad in awhile.  I wish I would have known that you can&#x27;t return this item.  Really amazon.</li>
            <li> This product was a cheap fake.  I bought one from Nordstrom to compare and it is night/day.</li>
            <li> Way Way too strong of a scent.  I received a tester of this with another cologne, and the sample was actually pretty good stuff.. but when I got a full bottle.. i regretted it.  If you spray this stuff somewhere and air it out for about 20 min, it comes close to smelling like the vial I got as a sample, but it is so intense I feel it would work better as an air freshener.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!!! I get compliments all the time.</li>
            <li> This does not actually taste like sugar so buyer beware. However, it does smell yummy.</li>
