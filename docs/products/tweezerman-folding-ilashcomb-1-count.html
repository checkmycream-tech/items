            <li>Very nice product.</li>
            <li>I did more research and and found that the ones with brass teeth and a cover to protect the teeth were the best.</li>
            <li>The best, and most compact of them all.</li>
            <li>Good job guys.</li>
            <li>I was delighted to find it was still a well made product.  </li>
            <li>Plastic is just not as good as metal combs.  </li>
            <li>Good quality.</li>
            <li>Nice fine teeth and the perfect length.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this eye lash comb.  </li>
            <li>Works great and can&#x27;t see not owning more than one.  </li>
            <li>I honestly thought that this product would be good because my lashes always stick together</li>

            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love these!</li>

            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Amazing lash comb.</li>
            <li>this lash comb is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s best to skip it if you are in a real hurry with your makeup one morning.</li>
            <li>It seperates the lashes nicely.</li>
            <li>With this thing, I&#x27;ve never had to worry about what kind of mascara I get because it fixes any clumps or eyelash sticking that the mascara causes.  </li>
            <li>The girls in my family all own them.</li>
            <li>and i honestly thought this would help separate them but</li>
            <li>Nice quality.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery and amazingly great product!!</li>
            <li>Removes any clumping, separates nicely.</li>
            <li>the comb by running warm water over it when you are done - AFTER EVERY USE.  </li>
            <li>This eyelash comb design is the best for separating your lashes and removing any clumped mascara - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>Cleans very easily and separates each lash.</li>
            <li>It worked perfectly the first time and it was easy.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best make up tool</li>
            <li>Also, this model is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>Works so much better than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li>I bought one of these years ago, and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Many of the teeth have since fallen out, but since I have not been able to find another one I just keep using it as it is.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s just enough mascara that came off of my uppers on the comb that I can get the perfect amount on my lowers.  </li>
            <li>so I bought two more.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to wipe the teeth clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So glad to have found this online.  </li>
            <li>None of them stayed in possession more than a week.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I can find this on Amazon now.</li>
            <li>so I may see beneath my eyelashes and am able to aim accordingly.</li>
            <li>What I love about this comb, is the way it is designed.</li>
            <li>Because of the step, where it folds out, I can get a better angle on the lashes, thereby doing a better job.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>I have not been able to find an eyelash comb made of metal for years and</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>Folds to keep the metal comb safe.  </li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s a thousand times better than my plastic lash comb which didn&#x27;t go between my lashes at all.</li>
            <li>So much better than a plastic comb.</li>
            <li>so you can reapply more if you want to amp it up.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>This is one of the best products I have in my makeup back; I don&#x27;t leave home for an overnight stay without it.</li>
            <li>Love this....but kinda pricey.</li>
            <li>I love these folding eyelash combs.  </li>
            <li>but for the most part, this comb does the trick.  </li>
            <li>Used to be able to buy them at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond but not now....</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>The cotton ball is better</li>
            <li>Works 1000 times better than a brush.</li>
            <li>Very easy clean up and the comb teeth are very strong...</li>
            <li>I like my eyelashes to be very clean and combed when I put on mascara, so</li>
            <li>if you use it carefully for what it&#x27;s intended for (excellent lash separation), then you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li>Make sure to clean with a damp napkin after use.</li>
            <li>so they don&#x27;t fall out so easily.</li>
            <li>It is true, a metal comb is much better than plastic.</li>
            <li>The Q-tip is good but doesn&#x27;t really get it clean.</li>
            <li>but I have been wearing contact lenses for over 15 years so its fine.</li>
            <li>The metal tines slip between lashes easily and smoothly separate lashes.</li>
            <li>Trust me, if you don&#x27;t already have this, do yourself a huge favor and get yourself one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>I am a huge fan of Tweezerman products.  </li>
            <li>It does a great job of separating my lashes prior to applying mascara.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews say the teeth fall out easily, so I don&#x27;t want to clean it too vigorously.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, combs lashes without pulling or tearing.  </li>
            <li>I apply my mascara and use this product to smooth out the hairs and it does the trick 100%.</li>
            <li>I also use it after applying waterproof eyeliner as that seems to clump up make-up free eyelashes.</li>
            <li>The next best thing to separating lashes with a straight pin.</li>
            <li>Quickly and easily  fixes that issue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my original Tweemani for years.  </li>
            <li>Love this so much!</li>
            <li>East to clean.</li>
            <li>I try to clean it with a cotton pad and eye makeup remover, which sort of works</li>
            <li>Keep it clean or it won&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li>I use a baby wipe to clean the comb after each use and eventually the baby wipe pulls out the pin tips.  </li>
            <li>My problem with it is that in order to clean it, I use either a cotton ball or Q-tip with eyemake-up remover.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d recommend soaking the teeth in hydrogen peroxide to clean it</li>
            <li>I use it after applying my 3D fiber lash mascara to just clean up a bit and it folds up to go right in the case!</li>
            <li>Worked good but the prongs kept falling out when I tried to clean them, probably only after using it about a month.</li>
            <li>I was curious to see if there were metal ones and was happy to see there were.</li>
            <li>I love this tool so much I bought two.  </li>
            <li>Take the mascara wand &amp; gently apply mascara to the tips of this comb by tapping on the top of the teeth.  </li>
            <li>The clumps get combed out and my lashes are full and even.</li>
            <li>They work great but be VERY CAREFUL.</li>
            <li>Sometimes this happens fairly quickly (3-6 months)</li>
            <li>I just take a toothbrush (I got free from my dentist) to clean it when it gets too much mascara between the prongs.</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>I use waterproof mascara and clean the separator first with dental floss and then with Lancome eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li>It is the sharpest one I have found and it replaces my old Kurlash but better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>I wanted a more natural effect for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li>Sure beats the old hat pin</li>
            <li>Nice, simple lash comb.</li>
            <li>The lashcomb doesn&#x27;t break, the teeth are metal with the right spacing, and the price is worth it.</li>
            <li>It will even comb when mascara is dry, but best results come from combing as you are applying mascara to each eye (and you could loosen lashes if you wait till it&#x27;s dry).  </li>
            <li>This time I am gently using eye makeup remover on a qtip to clean it</li>
            <li>This is a much neater/easier way to apply &amp; it goes on lightly/dries quickly</li>
            <li>I had one for 10 years and it finally broke, so I was happy to replace it with the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li>Luckily these little combs are so cheap that buying one or two a year is OK by me.</li>
            <li>I got this as a set with the tweezerman eyelash curler because I heard good things about their curler, little</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anyway this has become perhaps my favorite part of putting on makeup these days, it&#x27;s so satisfying to actually use a tiny comb on your lashes</li>
            <li>Should have thrown it away the first time I poked my self.</li>
            <li>I WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li>This lash comb does exactly what it needs to do.  </li>
            <li>First....</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I was looking for to comb through my lashes after applying mascara.</li>
            <li>It works ten times better than the plastic one.</li>
            <li>So I am hopeful this will hold up better and last longer.</li>
            <li>To clean the comb I simply use a tissue after each use and to REALLY clean it</li>
            <li>Not to mention also really brings out the beauty in a lot of mascaras that are unfortunately clumpy but otherwise wonderful</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only online looking for a new one now because I&#x27;m pretty sure that I should from a hygienic standpoint.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not meant for eyelash extensions though but works awesome on fake lashes and your normal lashes.</li>
            <li>recommend this handy little tool that I wish I&#x27;d had years ago.  </li>
            <li>Really gets out the clumps.</li>
            <li>did I know I&#x27;d be finding such a valuable tool as a free gift.</li>
            <li>Does its job very well.</li>
            <li>I like the metal tines as they get in between the lashes very well.  </li>
            <li>THE LOWER LASHES,use this baby on the uppers, then gently use it on the lowers.  </li>
            <li>They are gentle.  </li>
            <li>I have always seen people use the plastic ones and they&#x27;ve never made much sense to me since it seems to glide along the lashes rather than into...</li>
            <li>I really like that</li>
            <li>I have very straight/long lashes</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t uncurl with this tool, because mascara is going on very lightly &amp; really separating</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very nearsighted</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m used to getting very close to the mirror when applying eye makeup anyway</li>
            <li>Your lashes will look like butterfly wings instead of looking like lashes gunky with too much mascara.</li>
            <li>I like that the comb is very compact and that it folds, protecting the bristles and the user.</li>
            <li>Very well made.  </li>
            <li>really well though.</li>
            <li>I love this lash comb: the metal teeth are fine and sharp enough to separate lashes.</li>
            <li>Get dirty, but works great if you keep it clean.</li>
            <li>To prevent poking myself (and I have directly in the eye when I first used it!)I position a mirror in a way</li>
            <li>This product seemed the best choice and not so expensive considering it will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li>Just depends on that particular brush.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very sharp and strong and really gets through thicker mascara.</li>
            <li>Love this little comb for my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li>I love this little gadget.</li>
            <li>I know, sounds silly, but this a GREAT comb for mustaches, beards and sideburns...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a simple step, but it really makes a huge difference with mascara application.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li>I thought I was buying a new item.  </li>
            <li>This is the best tool to combat the thick sticky mascara that you can purchase lately.</li>
            <li>I love this little tool!  </li>
            <li>If you use makeup remover to clean it it rusts but if you do it any other way the teeth can pull out.</li>
            <li>Anyway, it works really well at separating and de-clumping my eyelashes and teasing them into the right position, as my lashes like to crisscross each other and point in wild directions.</li>
            <li>They came back to me absolutely like new ......</li>
            <li>Super sharp - if you are buying this it is not just to remove clumps but to truly comb between every lash and get that evenly spaced feathery lash look.  </li>
            <li>It combs your lashes for complete separation, which gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li>It gets out all the old glue and mascara.</li>
            <li>I bought this Tweezeman to replace my old Tweezeman.</li>
            <li>I like makeup to look a bit natural and this comb does the trick.</li>
            <li>Since the teeth are so close together they separate each of the lashes beautifully!I will definitely be purchasing this product again if I need to and highly recommend it to anyone!    </li>
            <li>Wow, after reading some of the reviews I half-expected this lash comb to come to life in my hand and impale my eyeball.</li>
            <li>&amp; they nearly always would uncurl soon after applying mascara.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been using all my adult life for separating clumpy lashes,</li>
            <li>but since i am asian- they tend to be stick straight</li>
            <li>This comb is nice &amp; thin.  </li>
            <li>Be careful near year eyes as the comb is metal and very sharp but that is what I love about it.</li>
            <li>It is fine enough to work in between individual lashes, without clumping them to other lashes.  </li>
            <li>I purchased several different plastic ones but they don&#x27;t really work to separate the lashes.  </li>
            <li>I know YOU won&#x27;t be that dumb and will use it with more care than I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The problem with most of them is they are too thick to get between lashes, this one does the trick!  </li>
            <li>highly recommended if you have long lashes.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure eye doctors hate this kind of device - be careful!</li>
            <li>I have been using Tweezerman folding lash comb since high school, quite a few years ago, of course back then they did not cost as much as  </li>
            <li>It can be hard to get in the grooves to clean out the mascara</li>
            <li>but if you clean to hard, the metal teeth seem to fall out.</li>
            <li>This is one of my can&#x27;t-live-without beauty products - I bought this to replace my old Tweezerman lashcomb that finally broke after ten years of use.  </li>
            <li>All in all though, this flaw is not enough to make me toss the comb and go back to using my old safety pin full-time.  </li>
            <li>I have a spare...but still using my original one form a few years ago!!</li>
            <li>The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is that it&#x27;s hard to clean.  </li>
            <li>Gently brush down the teeth.  </li>
            <li>You can comb straight up to make lashes look longest or angle to the side for that &amp;#34;Butterfly&amp;#34; look as long as the mascara stays wet.  </li>
            <li>Sounds crazy that I am SO in love with this item, but I am!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m due for a new one.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use my lash comb every day but its great to have when my mascara leaves my lashes clumpy.  </li>
            <li> Great for making lashes look great and seperated.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.</li>
            <li> I did more research and and found that the ones with brass teeth and a cover to protect the teeth were the best.</li>
            <li> The best, and most compact of them all.</li>
            <li> Good job guys.</li>
            <li> I was delighted to find it was still a well made product.  </li>
            <li> Plastic is just not as good as metal combs.  </li>
            <li> Good quality.</li>
            <li> Nice fine teeth and the perfect length.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this eye lash comb.  </li>
            <li> Works great and can&#x27;t see not owning more than one.  </li>
            <li> I honestly thought that this product would be good because my lashes always stick together</li>
            <li> Save your precious cornea!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love these!</li>
            <li> I really love this comb!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Amazing lash comb.</li>
            <li> this lash comb is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s best to skip it if you are in a real hurry with your makeup one morning.</li>
            <li> It seperates the lashes nicely.</li>
            <li> With this thing, I&#x27;ve never had to worry about what kind of mascara I get because it fixes any clumps or eyelash sticking that the mascara causes.  </li>
            <li> The girls in my family all own them.</li>
            <li> and i honestly thought this would help separate them but</li>
            <li> Nice quality.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery and amazingly great product!!</li>
            <li> Removes any clumping, separates nicely.</li>
            <li> the comb by running warm water over it when you are done - AFTER EVERY USE.  </li>
            <li> This eyelash comb design is the best for separating your lashes and removing any clumped mascara - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Cleans very easily and separates each lash.</li>
            <li> It worked perfectly the first time and it was easy.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best make up tool</li>
            <li> Also, this model is very comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than the plastic ones.  </li>
            <li> I bought one of these years ago, and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Many of the teeth have since fallen out, but since I have not been able to find another one I just keep using it as it is.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s just enough mascara that came off of my uppers on the comb that I can get the perfect amount on my lowers.  </li>
            <li> so I bought two more.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to wipe the teeth clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So glad to have found this online.  </li>
            <li> None of them stayed in possession more than a week.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I can find this on Amazon now.</li>
            <li> so I may see beneath my eyelashes and am able to aim accordingly.</li>
            <li> What I love about this comb, is the way it is designed.</li>
            <li> Because of the step, where it folds out, I can get a better angle on the lashes, thereby doing a better job.</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I have not been able to find an eyelash comb made of metal for years and</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> Folds to keep the metal comb safe.  </li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s a thousand times better than my plastic lash comb which didn&#x27;t go between my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> So much better than a plastic comb.</li>
            <li> so you can reapply more if you want to amp it up.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have in my makeup back; I don&#x27;t leave home for an overnight stay without it.</li>
            <li> Love this....but kinda pricey.</li>
            <li> I love these folding eyelash combs.  </li>
            <li> but for the most part, this comb does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Used to be able to buy them at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond but not now....</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> The cotton ball is better</li>
            <li> Works 1000 times better than a brush.</li>
            <li> Very easy clean up and the comb teeth are very strong...</li>
            <li> I like my eyelashes to be very clean and combed when I put on mascara, so</li>
            <li> if you use it carefully for what it&#x27;s intended for (excellent lash separation), then you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Make sure to clean with a damp napkin after use.</li>
            <li> so they don&#x27;t fall out so easily.</li>
            <li> It is true, a metal comb is much better than plastic.</li>
            <li> The Q-tip is good but doesn&#x27;t really get it clean.</li>
            <li> but I have been wearing contact lenses for over 15 years so its fine.</li>
            <li> The metal tines slip between lashes easily and smoothly separate lashes.</li>
            <li> Trust me, if you don&#x27;t already have this, do yourself a huge favor and get yourself one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Tweezerman products.  </li>
            <li> It does a great job of separating my lashes prior to applying mascara.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews say the teeth fall out easily, so I don&#x27;t want to clean it too vigorously.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, combs lashes without pulling or tearing.  </li>
            <li> I apply my mascara and use this product to smooth out the hairs and it does the trick 100%.</li>
            <li> I also use it after applying waterproof eyeliner as that seems to clump up make-up free eyelashes.</li>
            <li> The next best thing to separating lashes with a straight pin.</li>
            <li> Quickly and easily  fixes that issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my original Tweemani for years.  </li>
            <li> Love this so much!</li>
            <li> East to clean.</li>
            <li> I try to clean it with a cotton pad and eye makeup remover, which sort of works</li>
            <li> Keep it clean or it won&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> I use a baby wipe to clean the comb after each use and eventually the baby wipe pulls out the pin tips.  </li>
            <li> My problem with it is that in order to clean it, I use either a cotton ball or Q-tip with eyemake-up remover.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend soaking the teeth in hydrogen peroxide to clean it</li>
            <li> I use it after applying my 3D fiber lash mascara to just clean up a bit and it folds up to go right in the case!</li>
            <li> Worked good but the prongs kept falling out when I tried to clean them, probably only after using it about a month.</li>
            <li> I was curious to see if there were metal ones and was happy to see there were.</li>
            <li> I love this tool so much I bought two.  </li>
            <li> Take the mascara wand &amp; gently apply mascara to the tips of this comb by tapping on the top of the teeth.  </li>
            <li> The clumps get combed out and my lashes are full and even.</li>
            <li> They work great but be VERY CAREFUL.</li>
            <li> Sometimes this happens fairly quickly (3-6 months)</li>
            <li> I just take a toothbrush (I got free from my dentist) to clean it when it gets too much mascara between the prongs.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> I use waterproof mascara and clean the separator first with dental floss and then with Lancome eye makeup remover.</li>
            <li> It is the sharpest one I have found and it replaces my old Kurlash but better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> I wanted a more natural effect for my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Sure beats the old hat pin</li>
            <li> Nice, simple lash comb.</li>
            <li> The lashcomb doesn&#x27;t break, the teeth are metal with the right spacing, and the price is worth it.</li>
            <li> It will even comb when mascara is dry, but best results come from combing as you are applying mascara to each eye (and you could loosen lashes if you wait till it&#x27;s dry).  </li>
            <li> This time I am gently using eye makeup remover on a qtip to clean it</li>
            <li> This is a much neater/easier way to apply &amp; it goes on lightly/dries quickly</li>
            <li> I had one for 10 years and it finally broke, so I was happy to replace it with the exact same thing.  </li>
            <li> Luckily these little combs are so cheap that buying one or two a year is OK by me.</li>
            <li> I got this as a set with the tweezerman eyelash curler because I heard good things about their curler, little</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anyway this has become perhaps my favorite part of putting on makeup these days, it&#x27;s so satisfying to actually use a tiny comb on your lashes</li>
            <li> Should have thrown it away the first time I poked my self.</li>
            <li> I WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> This lash comb does exactly what it needs to do.  </li>
            <li> First....</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I was looking for to comb through my lashes after applying mascara.</li>
            <li> It works ten times better than the plastic one.</li>
            <li> So I am hopeful this will hold up better and last longer.</li>
            <li> To clean the comb I simply use a tissue after each use and to REALLY clean it</li>
            <li> Not to mention also really brings out the beauty in a lot of mascaras that are unfortunately clumpy but otherwise wonderful</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only online looking for a new one now because I&#x27;m pretty sure that I should from a hygienic standpoint.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not meant for eyelash extensions though but works awesome on fake lashes and your normal lashes.</li>
            <li> recommend this handy little tool that I wish I&#x27;d had years ago.  </li>
            <li> Really gets out the clumps.</li>
            <li> did I know I&#x27;d be finding such a valuable tool as a free gift.</li>
            <li> Does its job very well.</li>
            <li> I like the metal tines as they get in between the lashes very well.  </li>
            <li> THE LOWER LASHES,use this baby on the uppers, then gently use it on the lowers.  </li>
            <li> They are gentle.  </li>
            <li> I have always seen people use the plastic ones and they&#x27;ve never made much sense to me since it seems to glide along the lashes rather than into...</li>
            <li> I really like that</li>
            <li> I have very straight/long lashes</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t uncurl with this tool, because mascara is going on very lightly &amp; really separating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very nearsighted</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m used to getting very close to the mirror when applying eye makeup anyway</li>
            <li> Your lashes will look like butterfly wings instead of looking like lashes gunky with too much mascara.</li>
            <li> I like that the comb is very compact and that it folds, protecting the bristles and the user.</li>
            <li> Very well made.  </li>
            <li> really well though.</li>
            <li> I love this lash comb: the metal teeth are fine and sharp enough to separate lashes.</li>
            <li> Get dirty, but works great if you keep it clean.</li>
            <li> To prevent poking myself (and I have directly in the eye when I first used it!)I position a mirror in a way</li>
            <li> This product seemed the best choice and not so expensive considering it will last you quite a while.</li>
            <li> Just depends on that particular brush.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very sharp and strong and really gets through thicker mascara.</li>
            <li> Love this little comb for my eyelashes.  </li>
            <li> I love this little gadget.</li>
            <li> I know, sounds silly, but this a GREAT comb for mustaches, beards and sideburns...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a simple step, but it really makes a huge difference with mascara application.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.  </li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a new item.  </li>
            <li> This is the best tool to combat the thick sticky mascara that you can purchase lately.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool!  </li>
            <li> If you use makeup remover to clean it it rusts but if you do it any other way the teeth can pull out.</li>
            <li> Anyway, it works really well at separating and de-clumping my eyelashes and teasing them into the right position, as my lashes like to crisscross each other and point in wild directions.</li>
            <li> They came back to me absolutely like new ......</li>
            <li> Super sharp - if you are buying this it is not just to remove clumps but to truly comb between every lash and get that evenly spaced feathery lash look.  </li>
            <li> It combs your lashes for complete separation, which gives you a natural look.</li>
            <li> It gets out all the old glue and mascara.</li>
            <li> I bought this Tweezeman to replace my old Tweezeman.</li>
            <li> I like makeup to look a bit natural and this comb does the trick.</li>
            <li> Since the teeth are so close together they separate each of the lashes beautifully!I will definitely be purchasing this product again if I need to and highly recommend it to anyone!    </li>
            <li> Wow, after reading some of the reviews I half-expected this lash comb to come to life in my hand and impale my eyeball.</li>
            <li> &amp; they nearly always would uncurl soon after applying mascara.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using all my adult life for separating clumpy lashes,</li>
            <li> but since i am asian- they tend to be stick straight</li>
            <li> This comb is nice &amp; thin.  </li>
            <li> Be careful near year eyes as the comb is metal and very sharp but that is what I love about it.</li>
            <li> It is fine enough to work in between individual lashes, without clumping them to other lashes.  </li>
            <li> I purchased several different plastic ones but they don&#x27;t really work to separate the lashes.  </li>
            <li> I know YOU won&#x27;t be that dumb and will use it with more care than I did.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem with most of them is they are too thick to get between lashes, this one does the trick!  </li>
            <li> highly recommended if you have long lashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure eye doctors hate this kind of device - be careful!</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman folding lash comb since high school, quite a few years ago, of course back then they did not cost as much as  </li>
            <li> It can be hard to get in the grooves to clean out the mascara</li>
            <li> but if you clean to hard, the metal teeth seem to fall out.</li>
            <li> This is one of my can&#x27;t-live-without beauty products - I bought this to replace my old Tweezerman lashcomb that finally broke after ten years of use.  </li>
            <li> All in all though, this flaw is not enough to make me toss the comb and go back to using my old safety pin full-time.  </li>
            <li> I have a spare...but still using my original one form a few years ago!!</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is that it&#x27;s hard to clean.  </li>
            <li> Gently brush down the teeth.  </li>
            <li> You can comb straight up to make lashes look longest or angle to the side for that &amp;#34;Butterfly&amp;#34; look as long as the mascara stays wet.  </li>
            <li> Sounds crazy that I am SO in love with this item, but I am!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m due for a new one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had any other lashcomb do as complete of a job.</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> The non-Tweezerman brand was not made very well as the teeth would come out with just a small amount of pull when cleaning.</li>
            <li> Long enough?</li>
            <li> I ordered a similar comb (not a Tweezerman brand) not too long ago however it was not a folding comb (thereby offering protection of the teeth as well as protection from the teeth!).</li>
            <li> BUT AFTER A LONG, LONG TIME.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit that I still have to use my trusty old safety pin to get a few problem lashes here and there,</li>
            <li> I try to be careful when cleaning them so as to make them last longer.  </li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t think this would be any different for any other comb.</li>
            <li> Then let it air dry.  </li>
            <li> These are metal and very sharp (so you do need to be careful with them and they are not for a young makeup wearer because the needles of the comb are about as sharp as a safety pin), so they glide through mascara and removes clumps.</li>
            <li> does exactly what I need with my false lash products.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s basically a tiny comb of needles, and very sharp.  </li>
            <li> But, I figure for less than ten bucks</li>
            <li> However the Tweezerman demands respect, so be careful or you&#x27;ll put an eye out like</li>
            <li> Just be careful because you can poke your eye.  </li>
            <li> but be careful not to poke yourself in your eye by not paying close attention,</li>
            <li> Just be careful, as you coukd poke your eye out.</li>
            <li> but there are still a few specks of mascara left.</li>
            <li> - BE CAREFUL -</li>
            <li> If you need to wipe off the water, don&#x27;t drag across the teeth, you may bend/break them.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never hurt myself with this, but I&#x27;m also careful with it.</li>

            <li> Be careful because it is really sharp metal.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that these little combs don&#x27;t always last.  </li>
            <li> I would not bother with any other type.</li>
            <li> the tines are sharp.</li>
            <li> or else you may poke out your eye as the bristles are extremely sharp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as sharp as a safety pin, however they are still a bit sharp.</li>
            <li> However be careful as the needles are sharp!</li>
            <li> But be very careful, we should use it with mirror, to prevent the damage of our eyes</li>
            <li> I must warn users to be very careful</li>
            <li> A couple of the &#x27;teeth&#x27; had broken off and it was time for a new one.  </li>

            <li> They are VERY sharp</li>
            <li> Very sharp little teeth in this comb.</li>
            <li> i started using latisse about 5 months ago, so my lashes are very long and thick now.  </li>
            <li> I agree with the other reviewers who recommend common sense when working with sharp tools.</li>
            <li> The teeth fell out, after my cleaning it, perhaps a little too vigorously.</li>
            <li> Like little safety pins that separate your lashes.  </li>
            <li> Just beware the ends are sharp!!  </li>
            <li> A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I had a pair purchased long ago and was having a hard time finding the replacement pair until now!</li>
            <li> I never found eyelash brushes to be useful in general (the plastic ones are awful)</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s usually about twice a year that the prongs fall out</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t pay attention you will poke your eye and believe me it hurts, but as long as you pay attention you won&#x27;t be sorry for purchasing this.</li>
            <li> They are stick pin thin and sharp!</li>
            <li> Yes, it could be, just use common sense and take your time.</li>

            <li> Now I just go verrrrrrrrry slow &amp; pay close attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was broken, missing some of the teeth in the comb.</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands when I was unable to find this one by Tweezerman.  </li>
            <li> people that i giving it a bad review because it&#x27;s sharp- well... just be careful!</li>
            <li> I got sick of the plastic lash brushed breaking</li>
            <li> I read ratings that stated that it is dangerous because of the sharp points.</li>

            <li> Great product.  Works well in separating your lashes and best price I found anywhere..</li>
            <li> Works so much better than the plastic ones.  Really gets out the clumps.</li>
            <li> I got this as a set with the tweezerman eyelash curler because I heard good things about their curler, little did I know I&#x27;d be finding such a valuable tool as a free gift. I never found eyelash brushes to be useful in general (the plastic ones are awful) but these are insane, you can groom the heck out of your lashes all you want with these things. However the Tweezerman demands respect, so be careful or you&#x27;ll put an eye out like I almost did because I&#x27;m hopeless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway this has become perhaps my favorite part of putting on makeup these days, it&#x27;s so satisfying to actually use a tiny comb on your lashes I have no idea why. Not to mention also really brings out the beauty in a lot of mascaras that are unfortunately clumpy but otherwise wonderful (I&#x27;m talking about you, Revlon Lash Potion... you know what you did). The aforementioned mascara that I was scolding went from my most hated makeup piece, to a staple in my everyday look because the tweezerman tames all the wild mascaras out there. Trust me, if you don&#x27;t already have this, do yourself a huge favor and get yourself one, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This is my go to lash comb. Does its job very well. I would not bother with any other type.</li>
            <li> I know, sounds silly, but this a GREAT comb for mustaches, beards and sideburns...just slip it in the pocket of your jeans</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a lashcomb before, but this worked wonderfully.  It worked perfectly the first time and it was easy.</li>
            <li> I ordered a similar comb (not a Tweezerman brand) not too long ago however it was not a folding comb (thereby offering protection of the teeth as well as protection from the teeth!). The non-Tweezerman brand was not made very well as the teeth would come out with just a small amount of pull when cleaning. I have not experienced that issue with the Tweezerman comb. Also, this model is very comfortable to use. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these years ago, and I love it.  Many of the teeth have since fallen out, but since I have not been able to find another one I just keep using it as it is.  My local drugstore told me no one made the metal ones anymore. I purchased several different plastic ones but they don&#x27;t really work to separate the lashes.  I decided to Google it and was ecstatic to find this one.  I have poked myself in the eye several times over the years, but no damage done...thankfully.  Just don&#x27;t get careless and in a hurry when you use it.  It&#x27;s best to skip it if you are in a real hurry with your makeup one morning.</li>
            <li> Amazing lash comb. It seperates each and every lash for a great no clump look</li>
            <li> This is a great beauty product. Gets rid of all the clumps in my mascara. Just be careful because you can poke your eye.  I&#x27;ve done it a couple of times when I&#x27;ve been in a hurry.</li>
            <li> This is the best tool to combat the thick sticky mascara that you can purchase lately. It combs your lashes for complete separation, which gives you a natural look. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after watching a video on getting the perfect lashes. It is true, a metal comb is much better than plastic. It seperates the lashes nicely.</li>
            <li> This item is very well made with firm metal prongs.  Works well to comb through false lashes when I&#x27;m cleaning them.  It gets out all the old glue and mascara. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love this little tool!  It works great!  I would not put on mascara without it!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best make up tool I have ever bought.  I couldn&#x27;t stand the clumping mascara and this prevents that.  I like the metal tines as they get in between the lashes very well.  Not as thick as plastic. but be careful not to poke yourself in your eye by not paying close attention,</li>
            <li> This lash comb is great, it has changed my life. My lashes are never clumpy now.&lt;br /&gt;I can see how the needles might make some people nervous but I have been wearing contact lenses for over 15 years so its fine.</li>
            <li> This is the best Lash comb I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for almost ten years.  I&#x27;m only online looking for a new one now because I&#x27;m pretty sure that I should from a hygienic standpoint.  With this thing, I&#x27;ve never had to worry about what kind of mascara I get because it fixes any clumps or eyelash sticking that the mascara causes.  I like to put mascara on my upper lashes,SKIP THE LOWER LASHES,use this baby on the uppers, then gently use it on the lowers.  There&#x27;s just enough mascara that came off of my uppers on the comb that I can get the perfect amount on my lowers.  The only reason why I didn&#x27;t give this product 5 stars is that it&#x27;s hard to clean.  However, I don&#x27;t think this would be any different for any other comb.</li>
            <li> Works great. Especially for those of us who are challenged in terms of applying mascara  (makeup) and not over doing it, and clumping. Quickly and easily  fixes that issue. Just be careful, as you coukd poke your eye out.</li>
            <li> ladies.  I do not recommend this.  Use a Disposable Eyelash Mascara Brushes/Wands instead.  You can wash them.  They are gentle.  And you don&#x27;t run the risk of poking yourself in the eye.  A waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have had a problem with the teeth coming out.  I use waterproof mascara and clean the separator first with dental floss and then with Lancome eye makeup remover. I have used care in cleaning but have had a problem with four different separators.</li>
            <li> Owned these before. They work great to separate lashes for that  gives a lushus princess look.  The girls in my family all own them. Great product. Good job guys. How&#x27;s this description? Long enough? I can push submit now and it will accept it?</li>
            <li> I purchased one of these years ago and it still works great. It&#x27;s not meant for eyelash extensions though but works awesome on fake lashes and your normal lashes.</li>
            <li> I love this tool so much I bought two.  Which were &#x27;borrowed&#x27; by family so I bought two more.  If the disappear, I will buy them again.  It does a great job of separating my lashes prior to applying mascara. Since they like to cross this help nothing clump and my eyes look bigger.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use. Ever harder from one eye to the other (You would have to use your left hand for your left eye otherwise you cannot see what you are doing). Save your precious cornea! Just came back from doctors office. The surface of my cornea is torn in flaps and may take weeks or years to heal. I&#x27;m trowing mine in the trash as we speak. Should have thrown it away the first time I poked my self. This company should be sued. Then again I was s$#@*d enough to use needles close to my eyes, what was I thinking? I might as well have used the tip of a knife to separate lashes.</li>
            <li> Don&amp;#34;t know how I&#x27;d get along without it!</li>
            <li> great for combing lashes after using clumpy mascara.  highly recommended if you have long lashes.</li>
            <li> I honestly thought that this product would be good because my lashes always stick together and i honestly thought this would help separate them but the tweezerman folding lash comb is to small.i would nit recommend this product to any one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace one I&#x27;ve had over 8 years...I love it! Best eyelash comb you will find out there.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST LASH COMB I HAVE EVER USED.  AFTER AWHILE THE TONGS DO FALL OUT BUT AFTER A LONG, LONG TIME.  I WILL BUY MORE IN THE FUTURE.</li>
            <li> I had a pair purchased long ago and was having a hard time finding the replacement pair until now! I love these! Best Lash comb ever in my opinion. Arrived on time with great service!</li>
            <li> Nice quality. Works great!</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this eye lash comb.  Nice fine teeth and the perfect length.</li>
            <li> Super sharp - if you are buying this it is not just to remove clumps but to truly comb between every lash and get that evenly spaced feathery lash look.  It is the sharpest one I have found and it replaces my old Kurlash but better.  It will even comb when mascara is dry, but best results come from combing as you are applying mascara to each eye (and you could loosen lashes if you wait till it&#x27;s dry).  You can comb straight up to make lashes look longest or angle to the side for that &amp;#34;Butterfly&amp;#34; look as long as the mascara stays wet.  Be sure to wipe the teeth clean.&lt;br /&gt;My advice is to deliberately blink just before you comb so that you do not accidentally blink while it is against your eye.  I&#x27;m sure eye doctors hate this kind of device - be careful!</li>
            <li> Love this little comb for my eyelashes.  So glad to have found this online.  Thank you</li>
            <li> They work great but be VERY CAREFUL. They are VERY sharp</li>
            <li> I bought this Tweezeman to replace my old Tweezeman. I was delighted to find it was still a well made product.  I&#x27;ve had my original Tweemani for years.  A couple of the &#x27;teeth&#x27; had broken off and it was time for a new one.  Will purchase again if they are still making them in 10 years!</li>
            <li> I love this little gadget. I have been using eye lash combs for years. I have tried other brands when I was unable to find this one by Tweezerman.  None of them stayed in possession more than a week. They were useless.  I am so glad I can find this on Amazon now. Hooray!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it!!!!! Purchased three so I will always have one. Fast delivery and amazingly great product!! I will use this again on my next order!!</li>
            <li> I really love this comb! I have always seen people use the plastic ones and they&#x27;ve never made much sense to me since it seems to glide along the lashes rather than into... I was curious to see if there were metal ones and was happy to see there were. I did more research and and found that the ones with brass teeth and a cover to protect the teeth were the best.This product seemed the best choice and not so expensive considering it will last you quite a while. It&#x27;s well worth the investment (however I did purchase my comb at Sally Beauty Supply since the store is only two minutes away) I like makeup to look a bit natural and this comb does the trick. Since the teeth are so close together they separate each of the lashes beautifully!I will definitely be purchasing this product again if I need to and highly recommend it to anyone!    **update**   I read a few complaints about people poking themselves with the teeth and also how difficult it is to clean. To prevent poking myself (and I have directly in the eye when I first used it!)I position a mirror in a way so I may see beneath my eyelashes and am able to aim accordingly. To clean the comb I simply use a tissue after each use and to REALLY clean it I use a toothbrush to get between the teeth. Simple.</li>
            <li> This lash comb does exactly what it needs to do.  It is fine enough to work in between individual lashes, without clumping them to other lashes.  The next best thing to separating lashes with a straight pin.</li>
            <li> Love it! Best eyelash comb I&#x27;ve ever used. However be careful as the needles are sharp!</li>
            <li> Very nice product. But be very careful, we should use it with mirror, to prevent the damage of our eyes</li>
            <li> Separates the lashes great after applying mascara.</li>
            <li> I had a &#x27;Sepralash&#x27; lash comb. The teeth fell out, after my cleaning it, perhaps a little too vigorously. What I love about this comb, is the way it is designed. Because of the step, where it folds out, I can get a better angle on the lashes, thereby doing a better job. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> I am a huge fan of Tweezerman products.  This comb is excellent.  I have not been able to find an eyelash comb made of metal for years and the plastic ones just don&#x27;t work.  I recently sent two pairs of tweezers back to them because years of use had dulled them.  They came back to me absolutely like new ...... no charge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using tweezerman eyelash separators for years. They are the best. I&#x27;ve never seen another product to compare it to so I will continue to use this one. My only gripe is that they don&#x27;t last very long. If you use makeup remover to clean it it rusts but if you do it any other way the teeth can pull out. But, I figure for less than ten bucks it&#x27;s a bargain</li>
            <li> Purchased it because I like the way it folds but wish the comb tines were closer together. It works ok.</li>
            <li> This comb is nice &amp; thin.  The problem with most of them is they are too thick to get between lashes, this one does the trick!  Removes any clumping, separates nicely.</li>
            <li> best lash comb.  Folds to keep the metal comb safe.  Travels well.  Like little safety pins that separate your lashes.  I had one for 10 years and it finally broke, so I was happy to replace it with the exact same thing.  Plastic is just not as good as metal combs.  East to clean.</li>
            <li> this is the best comb for eyelashes made</li>
            <li> The best, and most compact of them all.</li>
            <li> Wow, after reading some of the reviews I half-expected this lash comb to come to life in my hand and impale my eyeball. Well, that didn&#x27;t happen and I&#x27;ve used it several times already. A person would have to be a moron (or suffering from severe tremors) to poke their eye with this thing. Anyway, it works really well at separating and de-clumping my eyelashes and teasing them into the right position, as my lashes like to crisscross each other and point in wild directions. I try to clean it with a cotton pad and eye makeup remover, which sort of works but there are still a few specks of mascara left. Some of the reviews say the teeth fall out easily, so I don&#x27;t want to clean it too vigorously. I really like that it folds up so the teeth are protected. All in all, it&#x27;s a thousand times better than my plastic lash comb which didn&#x27;t go between my lashes at all.</li>
            <li> I love this lash comb: the metal teeth are fine and sharp enough to separate lashes. The plastic ones just don&#x27;t cut it. The Tweezerman Lash comb is the way to go!</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t live without it.  So much better than a plastic comb.</li>
            <li> Love this so much! I use it after applying my 3D fiber lash mascara to just clean up a bit and it folds up to go right in the case! Best ever!</li>
            <li> This is the BEST tool I have found for applying mascara &amp; keeping lashes separated.  I saw a video online of a makeup artist using one of these to apply mascara.  If you are like me &amp; have never had a lot of luck with those stupid brushes in mascara bottles, here is the answer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To apply mascara: Take the mascara wand &amp; gently apply mascara to the tips of this comb by tapping on the top of the teeth.  It will leave just a bit of mascara.  Then comb thru your lashes starting at the bottom - BE CAREFUL - You can damage your eye with this tool!!  This is a much neater/easier way to apply &amp; it goes on lightly/dries quickly so you can reapply more if you want to amp it up.  I have very straight/long lashes &amp; they nearly always would uncurl soon after applying mascara.  They don&#x27;t uncurl with this tool, because mascara is going on very lightly &amp; really separating/coating each lash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second time I used this I blinked &amp; poked my eye - OUCH.  Now I just go verrrrrrrrry slow &amp; pay close attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash the comb by running warm water over it when you are done - AFTER EVERY USE.  Then let it air dry.  If you need to wipe off the water, don&#x27;t drag across the teeth, you may bend/break them.  Gently brush down the teeth.  And NEVER use makeup remover on this tool - it will loosen the teeth.  Keep it clean or it won&#x27;t work well &amp; you could get an eye infection.</li>
            <li> First....It was broken, missing some of the teeth in the comb. Upon further inspection, I believe this item was used.  I thought I was buying a new item.  Ummmm</li>
            <li> This is one of my can&#x27;t-live-without beauty products - I bought this to replace my old Tweezerman lashcomb that finally broke after ten years of use.  I use it every time I put on mascara.  Just be careful - the tines are sharp.</li>
            <li> This is a great lashcomb. Never had one like this before. Probably will never go back to the cheep ones again. Fash shippng</li>
            <li> Great at separating lashes.</li>
            <li> An essential of mine. Works great</li>
            <li> The difference between this product and the plastic eyelash combs you get in makeup brush kits is like night and day. I&#x27;ve never hurt myself with this, but I&#x27;m also careful with it. The metal tines slip between lashes easily and smoothly separate lashes. It&#x27;s such a simple step, but it really makes a huge difference with mascara application.</li>
            <li> Sounds crazy that I am SO in love with this item, but I am! It is exactly what I was looking for to comb through my lashes after applying mascara. No plastic comb will ever come close!</li>
            <li> This lash comb is AWESOME. This is my second day using it and it&#x27;s like it makes my mascara do what it&#x27;s supposed to. The clumps get combed out and my lashes are full and even. I agree with the other reviewers who recommend common sense when working with sharp tools. I&#x27;m very nearsighted so I&#x27;m used to getting very close to the mirror when applying eye makeup anyway and that&#x27;s how I avoid poking my eye when using the comb.</li>
            <li> Excellent comb, but seriously, I poked myself in the eye with it once because I was moving too quickly. Use a mirror (magnifying if necessary) while using! Very sharp little teeth in this comb.</li>
            <li> I think this is the greatest lash comb there is.  I panic when I can&#x27;t find it immediately.  Order two and put one away.  Easy to clean, combs lashes without pulling or tearing.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Best eye lash comb out there! Been using this comb for years!</li>
            <li> This product is fab.. I love it, it makes any drug store mascara look like you paid a fortune for it...</li>
            <li> great product!  does exactly what I need with my false lash products.</li>
            <li> I have been using Tweezerman folding lash comb since high school, quite a few years ago, of course back then they did not cost as much as  they do today. Still a great lash comb.</li>
            <li> Get dirty, but works great if you keep it clean.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best products I have in my makeup back; I don&#x27;t leave home for an overnight stay without it. The lashcomb doesn&#x27;t break, the teeth are metal with the right spacing, and the price is worth it. I just take a toothbrush (I got free from my dentist) to clean it when it gets too much mascara between the prongs. Your lashes will look like butterfly wings instead of looking like lashes gunky with too much mascara.</li>
            <li> Wear makeup? You need this.</li>
            <li> Love this....but kinda pricey. But the plastic ones just don&#x27;t do it!!!  I have a spare...but still using my original one form a few years ago!!</li>
            <li> This is a helpful tool to separate clumped eye lashes. I like the sleek design and the thin bristles. I must warn users to be very careful or else you may poke out your eye as the bristles are extremely sharp. I like that the comb is very compact and that it folds, protecting the bristles and the user. Make sure to clean with a damp napkin after use.</li>
            <li> I love these folding eyelash combs.  I like my eyelashes to be very clean and combed when I put on mascara, so I&#x27;ve always used a safety pin to comb out each lash when I apply my mascara.  The traditional plastic eyelash comb never worked for me.  It always brushed over my lashes instead of through them.  This comb, however, is literally a row of safety pin tips lined up for combing lashes.  It&#x27;s great!  I&#x27;ll admit that I still have to use my trusty old safety pin to get a few problem lashes here and there, but for the most part, this comb does the trick.  My only complaint is that these little combs don&#x27;t always last.  I go through an average of about comb or two a year.  I use a baby wipe to clean the comb after each use and eventually the baby wipe pulls out the pin tips.  Sometimes this happens fairly quickly (3-6 months) and sometimes it happens after a year or so.  Just depends on that particular brush.  I try to be careful when cleaning them so as to make them last longer.  All in all though, this flaw is not enough to make me toss the comb and go back to using my old safety pin full-time.  Luckily these little combs are so cheap that buying one or two a year is OK by me.</li>
            <li> I got sick of the plastic lash brushed breaking so i bought this one. It works great to separate the lashes. It can be hard to get in the grooves to clean out the mascara but i found that soaking it in eye makeup remover once a week helps.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t even compare this to a plastic comb!!!  Just beware the ends are sharp!!  Works great and can&#x27;t see not owning more than one.  Used to be able to buy them at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond but not now.... so I order them from Amazon now.</li>
            <li> Worked good but the prongs kept falling out when I tried to clean them, probably only after using it about a month.</li>
            <li> I read ratings that stated that it is dangerous because of the sharp points. Yes, it could be, just use common sense and take your time. Cleans very easily and separates each lash. I&#x27;ve never had any other lashcomb do as complete of a job.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I wanted a more natural effect for my eyelashes. I apply my mascara and use this product to smooth out the hairs and it does the trick 100%. Very easy clean up and the comb teeth are very strong...no bending...!</li>
            <li> This eyelash comb design is the best for separating your lashes and removing any clumped mascara - can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li> Very well made.  Folds effortlessly but stays open in use.  I recommend</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use my lash comb every day but its great to have when my mascara leaves my lashes clumpy.  It&#x27;s basically a tiny comb of needles, and very sharp.  I accidently stabbed myself in the eye one morning and it hurt for a while. I know YOU won&#x27;t be that dumb and will use it with more care than I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this handy little tool that I wish I&#x27;d had years ago.  Sure beats the old hat pin I&#x27;d been using all my adult life for separating clumpy lashes,</li>
            <li> Great for making lashes look great and seperated. Be careful because it is really sharp metal. I always buy these over and over but it&#x27;s usually about twice a year that the prongs fall out and I&#x27;m due for a new one.</li>
            <li> Love this item. Took a while to find it and when I did I was so elated. It works ten times better than the plastic one. My problem with it is that in order to clean it, I use either a cotton ball or Q-tip with eyemake-up remover. The Q-tip is good but doesn&#x27;t really get it clean. The cotton ball is better but if you clean to hard, the metal teeth seem to fall out. You can get them back in, if you don&#x27;t lose them in the process. They need to construct them bettert so they don&#x27;t fall out so easily.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect cosmetic tool to separate your lashes after applying mascara. Works 1000 times better than a brush.</li>
            <li> This is the only eyelash comb I use now. The plastic ones do not separate or comb out clumps. These are metal and very sharp (so you do need to be careful with them and they are not for a young makeup wearer because the needles of the comb are about as sharp as a safety pin), so they glide through mascara and removes clumps.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t know how i have gone the last 15 years of wearing mascara without this!!!!  i started using latisse about 5 months ago, so my lashes are very long and thick now.  but since i am asian- they tend to be stick straight and i have to have a coat of mascara on before i can curl them...only problem is that then there are mascara clumps at the base of my lashes.  this lash comb is amazing.  combs through every lash without tugging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for people that i giving it a bad review because it&#x27;s sharp- well... just be careful! it&#x27;s not supposed to go in your eye! if you use it carefully for what it&#x27;s intended for (excellent lash separation), then you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
            <li> Be careful near year eyes as the comb is metal and very sharp but that is what I love about it. It cuts through the mascara and keeps my lashes from being clumped together. Had a similar one before and the tines came out when cleaning it. This time I am gently using eye makeup remover on a qtip to clean it and it&#x27;s working well. So I am hopeful this will hold up better and last longer. It&#x27;s very sharp and strong and really gets through thicker mascara.</li>
            <li> I used to use a safety pin to separate my lashes after mascara, and this tool is a life saver. It&#x27;s not as sharp as a safety pin, however they are still a bit sharp. If you don&#x27;t pay attention you will poke your eye and believe me it hurts, but as long as you pay attention you won&#x27;t be sorry for purchasing this.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a lash comb forget the crappy plastic ones. Do yourself a serious favor and get this!! It&#x27;s insane how well it combs through and separates my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend soaking the teeth in hydrogen peroxide to clean it really well though. Running it under water isn&#x27;t enough.</li>
            <li> Does the trick unclumping mascara. I also use it after applying waterproof eyeliner as that seems to clump up make-up free eyelashes. Just be careful the tines. They are stick pin thin and sharp!</li>
            <li> Nice, simple lash comb. Good quality.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I wanted! It combs through my lashes perfectly in between mascara that clumps. The plastic lash combs don&#x27;t even compare.</li>
