            <li>This is my second purchase of this items and the first one was amazing love it and use it everyday, but this one I have to go out get super glue to put it back together.</li>
            <li>They are really comparable to MAC&#x27;s makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really care.</li>
            <li>but overall i really like the brushes, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>for the price, they are very soft and dense</li>
            <li>The eye brushes are all pretty big.</li>
            <li>and you can totally wash them, i particularly used baby shampoo and they are as new.</li>
            <li>Definitely soft.</li>
            <li>They are SO SOFT and they DO NOT SHED.</li>
            <li>They are rill soft and beutiful, I used them aryday</li>
            <li>Love them, all of them are for foundation, contour and highlight, you could probably use the thin ones for blending your transition color on your eyes, but they are kindda big.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There was a smell as some have mentioned when I first opened them, but a little soap and water took that out.</li>

            <li> Bought three sets. So far so good. Definitely soft. Wish there was a small lip brush included though. The eye brushes are all pretty big. Even still it is a great set of brushes so we&#x27;re happy!</li>
            <li> I was really impressed with the quality of these brushes!  I bought them for my sister and law for Christmas, and she loves them!  I definitely recommend these to anyone looking for high quality brushes for an excellent price.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft but two of them came broken :( i had to glue it  but overall i really like the brushes, definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these brushes. They are SO SOFT and they DO NOT SHED. They are really comparable to MAC&#x27;s makeup brushes. I am glad that I took a chance and bought these brushes. Great purchase.</li>
            <li> I did not like these brushed,the eye shadow brushes were just to big and I couldn&#x27;t get the color to pick up on them.</li>
            <li> Love these brushes. I use them everyday! I recommend them :)</li>
            <li> I loved them!!!!!!!! What made it even better is that the seller contacted me to make sure everything was okay and that I had received my brushes. Which I received like 3 days later. The brushes are so awesome n soft you will love them!!</li>
            <li> LOVE THESE BRUSHES!!!!!! Excellent quality!</li>
            <li> Love them, all of them are for foundation, contour and highlight, you could probably use the thin ones for blending your transition color on your eyes, but they are kindda big.&lt;br /&gt;They are really really soft and stiff, they don&#x27;t come apart and you can totally wash them, i particularly used baby shampoo and they are as new. They don&#x27;t absorb your makeup, all the product gets equally and beautifully distributed in your skin. I TOTALLY LOVE THEM!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately...  These brushes arrived with the heads falling off of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;Oncd I buy some glue they should be good to go once fixed...!&lt;br /&gt;Pretty white colored handles.&lt;br /&gt;Soft bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all..  If these were constructed with a bit more care. I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;d be a decent buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot recommend because the lack of quality recieved.</li>
            <li> Good variety of brushes.</li>
            <li> Handle came off one brush when removing from the bag.</li>
            <li> Exactly like the picture!</li>
            <li> Very good, especially for the price. There was a smell as some have mentioned when I first opened them, but a little soap and water took that out. Three of the brushes have cracks in them along the handle, but it doesn&#x27;t interfere with use so I don&#x27;t really care. The brushes are soft, fluffy, and pick up pigment well. They also aren&#x27;t so large they don&#x27;t all fit in my makeup box which is nice. I am happy over all.</li>
            <li> Omg!!! This are the bes of the best!! They are rill soft and beutiful, I used them aryday 👍👍👍👍❤️❤️❤️❤️</li>
            <li> These brushes are simply &amp;#34;AWESOME&#x27;&#x27; I got these back in December 2014, I still use them they are&lt;br /&gt;great for the price, they are very soft and dense I&#x27;m sooo pleased them !</li>
            <li> Arrived fast, the bushes are soft good quality. Would recommend</li>
            <li> Fantastic value! Brushes are very soft and apply makeup beautifully. The entire set costs less than a single designer brush. I&#x27;m planning to buy additional sets as gifts for friends. I&#x27;ve washed the brushes several times using a gentle soap and water, and they have maintained their form beautifully.</li>
