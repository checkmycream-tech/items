            <li>Works so well over bold colors and helps the nail polish not to chip.</li>
            <li>I Highly recommend this lovely shade for the holidays.</li>
            <li>This is a nice color but the bottle is deceiving because I originally thought that the color was white with sparkles on it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very pretty over any color.</li>
            <li>use as a clear glitter top coat.  </li>
            <li>I have used this over various colors (most often Negligee) and it looks fabulous with all of them.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s good like all CND products</li>
            <li>and this was my first time applying shellac at home.  </li>
            <li>When I got it - the color is clear with really pretty colored sparkles!</li>
            <li>Much lovelier when put on than any picture can portray.</li>
            <li>Instead it offers a smooth coat of clear silky polish with gentle well defined sparkles of varying pastel colors.  </li>
            <li>There are very few sparkles in this, so if you&#x27;re getting it for a clear top coat, it would be fine, but if you&#x27;re looking for sparkles, this would not be what you want.</li>
            <li>I am new to gel polishes</li>
            <li>On the website, it looks like it&#x27;s white, but it&#x27;s actually clear, with colorful glitter.  </li>

            <li>This polish has sparkles within and can brighten your nails even when you choose to use just clear polish.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s actually clear with sparkles on it, so Cnd or Amazon should put clearly the description of this color.</li>

            <li>Please note that this is a CLEAR coat with sparkles it in, not</li>
            <li>I received the nail kit for Christmas, which I love, but am forced to select polish color on line.</li>
            <li>This is a clear shellac that adds sparkle only.  </li>
            <li>I somehow missed that this polish is clear with glitter, not white, which is what&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Barely any sparkle even after3 coats.</li>

            <li> use as a clear glitter top coat.  It is not white with glitter.</li>
            <li> Much lovelier when put on than any picture can portray. I Highly recommend this lovely shade for the holidays. Even nice for the summer. Great addition to all women to use. Lovely</li>
            <li> Sparkles are not easily visible over light or dark colors. Was looking for something with more &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; factor. Other than that it&#x27;s good like all CND products</li>
            <li> This color is what I would call a nail &#x27;effect&#x27;. It is clear gel w/ multi color sparkles. It works best when paired with an opaque color. It is a perfect finish when you want to add a little &#x27;sparkle&#x27; to your polish. Works best w/ darker colors! A another good one to add to your collection.</li>
            <li> The brush was messed up.  It is all hard and not flexible!  Disappointed...I have had 2 CND Shellacs like that.</li>
            <li> This polish has sparkles within and can brighten your nails even when you choose to use just clear polish. It is also great to apply on over colors for a bit of sparkle.</li>
            <li> This is a nice color but the bottle is deceiving because I originally thought that the color was white with sparkles on it, it&#x27;s actually clear with sparkles on it, so Cnd or Amazon should put clearly the description of this color.</li>
            <li> This is a quality addition to the CND Shellac system.  I have used this over various colors (most often Negligee) and it looks fabulous with all of them.  I work at a drug store and have seen zillions of so called \\&quot;glitter\\&quot; polishes.  None can hold a candle to this product.  This is not goopy and messy.  It doesn&#x27;t look like you spilled a bottle of craft glitter on your hands.  Instead it offers a smooth coat of clear silky polish with gentle well defined sparkles of varying pastel colors.  It is remarkable.</li>
            <li> Beautiful addition to any color polish that can be applied as top coat. Adds sparkle and glitz and extends the life of your manicure.</li>
            <li> This is a clear shellac that adds sparkle only.  It is great over other colors.  The sparkles are holographic?  They shimmer in several colors.</li>
            <li> Is clear. Barely any sparkle even after3 coats. Waste of money</li>
            <li> I received the nail kit for Christmas, which I love, but am forced to select polish color on line. I thought the description indicated a diamond-esque shimmer, but it fell flat. Have caution buyer: polish cannot be returned or exchanged due to flammable contents within.</li>
            <li> This is a color that I had applied at a salon and I really liked it.  I am not as good applying so it doesn&#x27;t work as well for me.</li>
            <li> I somehow missed that this polish is clear with glitter, not white, which is what&lt;br /&gt;I was wanting! It goes well over colors, but I was hoping it was white!</li>
            <li> Love this sparkle set.  Just to note these are the larger sparkles and not like the other sparkle option.  Works so well over bold colors and helps the nail polish not to chip.</li>
            <li> Used one coat of this over a coat of Beau.  Loved the sparkle it added.  Please note that this is a CLEAR coat with sparkles it in, not a white with sparkles.  Great wear and this was my first time applying shellac at home.  Very easy application.</li>
            <li> I liked adding this to my Shellac colors. It adds just enough sparkle to change any color I use it with.</li>
            <li> I am new to gel polishes so I thought this was a white with white sparkles. When I got it - the color is clear with really pretty colored sparkles! The sparkles are not huge, they don&#x27;t stick out of your polish - and there&#x27;s not so much sparkle that you can&#x27;t see the color under them. They also look really nice over clear. It was a great surprise! This has been over a neon pink for 4 days now and hasn&#x27;t chipped or peeled. LOVE!!!&lt;br /&gt;Seller is awesome as well!! I would definitely recommend!</li>
