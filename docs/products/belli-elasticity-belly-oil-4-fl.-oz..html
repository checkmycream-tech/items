    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>might be the best in the market.  </li>
            <li>GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>So, best method is to spray in hand and then rub on belly and thighs in circular motions.     </li>
            <li>B000V1BDIG BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil, 4 oz]] was probably one of the best moisturizers/</li>
            <li>Great product!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful this BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil is!</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>It is probably best during pregnancy and not after stretchmarks are already there.  </li>
            <li>It was soothing to my skin and smelled great too!</li>
            <li>A wonderful product.</li>
            <li>:D</li>
            <li>Stick to bio oil, it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>The Lavendar scent Smells great!</li>
            <li>I can not stand the smell of coco butter products, so this was the perfect solution for me.</li>
            <li>And it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li>It is so relaxing and perfect for bedtime!</li>
            <li>I was not, however, impressed with the moisturizing.</li>
            <li>a side note, the blemish treatment by Belli was GREAT!</li>
            <li>And best of all, well, I don&#x27;t want to jinx myself...</li>
            <li>the smell is wonderful and it helped stop the itching on my belly.</li>
            <li>awesome  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Secondly, it moisturize the skin perfectly.</li>
            <li>I would also recommend the product to all my non-pregnant girls.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing that i like about the product</li>
            <li>Amazing!!</li>
            <li>In my opinion it&#x27;s a very good product.</li>
            <li>I was very happy with the BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil because it is a great moisturizer for my skin.</li>
            <li>There is no fool-proof method of avoiding stretchmarks, but this belly oil smells wonderful and does a great job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li>Either i&#x27;ve got good genetics, or this product works, or maybe both!    </li>
            <li>I loved the smell and the way it made my skin feel!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li>All that being said, this oil has all kinds of great moisturizers for your skin.  </li>
            <li>Happy to say no stretchmarks after delivery.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any belly itching</li>
            <li>The price tag is steep and I&#x27;ve been happy with my burts bees</li>
            <li>the price on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li>for the oil itself - I was happy to see it absorbs into the skin and does not leave you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li>This seller&#x27;s S&amp;H was great.  </li>
            <li>The lavender and almond oil does truly have a great scent &amp; relaxing effect.</li>
            <li>but it seems to really be a great product.     </li>
            <li>great-</li>
            <li>This oil works great.</li>
            <li>Great results,</li>
            <li>The oil smells great and feels great on the skins</li>
            <li>this smells great and helped with my itchy belly.  </li>
            <li>It feels great however, on that itchy stretching skin.</li>
            <li>This oil worked great to prevent stretch marks and also kept my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li>(if you like lavendar)  I love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!!</li>
            <li>My wife used it throughout the pragnancy and find it very effective.</li>
            <li>This oil has a very nice texture.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs very nicely but is still an oil</li>
            <li>It does moisturize the skin very nicely and it does eliminate dryness, as well as preventing the formation of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>This is a very nice skin product.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>:^)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Lavender soothes headaches, and it&#x27;s just a pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>This body oil has a pleasant lavender scent that I find soothing and not at all offensive.</li>
            <li>I think the idea is great, and of course the ingredients used are wonderful for pampering the skin, but I have two complaints that detract from the success of this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually good to go!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I thought this was a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li>The lavender smell is just what the doctor ordered, but the relief I got isn&#x27;t as good</li>
            <li>bought a bottle of Belli Elasticity Belly Oil for my sister-in-law, who loved it, and used it throughout her pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, which did not have as good of a scent, nor did it feel as good on my skin as a sample of Belli.</li>
            <li>this smells really good.  </li>
            <li>It smells so good.</li>
            <li>She loved the smell as well.</li>
            <li>Good in a way that you don&#x27;t have to scramble for the cap  to close it every time (</li>
            <li>It is also a good oil for massages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Expensive, I consider a good price for a 4 oz for this type of oil to be under 15 bucks.</li>
            <li>The product smell so good, it is a relaxing moment.</li>
            <li>I have really liked using this oil- pleasant smell, makes my skin feel good, doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing or towels.  </li>
            <li>my best friend used it when she was pregnant with her baby.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Belli Elasticity Belly Oil does seem to have many great things to offer.</li>
            <li>Happy to say no stretch marks yet :-)</li>
            <li>Works great, smells fantastic!</li>
            <li>/&gt;First of all it feels and smells very healthy, so Im not worried about any impact on my baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;So, as you can see, I love the product!  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I love the smell of this oil!</li>
            <li>It smells amazing (like crack for pregnant women) and just feels incredible.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying, this stuff smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>The scent of the oil is amazing, and it reminds me of a spa.</li>
            <li>It was nice.</li>
            <li>It would make a nice massage oil also.</li>
            <li>No stretch marks and the smell is nice.  </li>
            <li>She said it was kind of sticky, so she used it when she was staying home</li>
            <li>This is a nice oil.</li>
            <li>My husband liked the scent</li>
            <li>it wasn&#x27;t too greasy or anything, so I liked that.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells like lavender and it&#x27;s soooo nice.</li>
            <li>Puts me in a Good mood for rest of day :)</li>
            <li>, I decided to try this out when I saw that it has a nice lavender smell...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled I found this.</li>
            <li>It smells pleasantly like lavender and is nice to rub on my pregnant belly!</li>
            <li>Sweet almond oil is a really great product for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Has a great smell, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and perfume-y</li>
            <li>but it was a very, very nice oil to put on my pregnant belly every evening.</li>
            <li>All in all, very impressed so far</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is now my favorite thing I own from Belli.</li>
            <li>Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We have also used the BELLI oil on shoulders for shoulder massages for stress, and the lavender is enjoyed by both of us.  </li>
            <li>Recommended, for sure.</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>I know I love the product pictured, because I have used it before.  </li>
            <li>I like that it has a spritzer top to efficiently apply the oil.</li>
            <li>As for the product, I love it...for the most part &#x3D;</li>
            <li>nothing will work - do your Kegels instead :)</li>
            <li>This product has none of those ingredients and the doctor who invented it seems to have gone out of his way to make sure everything in the bottle is safe to use.</li>
            <li>i love the scent of lavender that pervades the house when this is applied.    </li>
            <li>The scent of this may be my favorite thing...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d buy it - I probably will buy more even to use after pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Love the smell.</li>
            <li>Love the quality.</li>
            <li>Love the packaging.</li>
            <li>Love not having one stretch marks after a 10-lb baby.</li>
            <li>What more is there to say about this product.</li>
            <li>but I do love this oil and it does seem to soak in faster.  </li>
            <li>Being that this is a very oily product, your great skin might come at the cost of ruined clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Belli Elasticity Belly Oil carries a price that will place it out of reach for many and even those who can afford it could find the cost unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Belli Elasticity Belly Oil carries a price that will place it out of reach for many and even those who can afford it could find the cost unacceptable.</li>
            <li>sure, ANOTHER beauty product that promises the world and will not come through\\&quot;...</li>
            <li>I LOVE this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, a friend of mine just gave birth to twins and her OB/GYN</li>
            <li>More like vanilla almond to me.  </li>
            <li>Many of the ingredients are conducive to skin conditioning and repair.</li>
            <li>He gets bonus points for this; it has turned out to be a favorite ritual of mine.</li>
            <li>and I have gained more stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>This stuff worked better than lotion and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure how to rate this item.  </li>
            <li>I read where stretchmarks cannot be prevented and that most often it is heredity that will determine if you get them.</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Great moisture that lasts most of the day, although I apply this morning and night, because I love it so much.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells way better than coco butter oil</li>
            <li>However, I love to go to bed at night and massage my belly while I talk to my baby.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure the product itself is helpful in prevention of stretch marks</li>
            <li>I would love to use it for a baby lotion, too.</li>
            <li>love the smell</li>
            <li>and I have the feeling that I need put more quantity.</li>
            <li>and I used more bottles of Earth Mama Angel than Belli Oil ...</li>
            <li>Im enjoying the product so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really love the smell of this oil and the way it feels when I put it on.</li>
            <li>I love how smooth my skin feels after putting it on!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Honestly, for the price, you&#x27;d be wise to assume it&#x27;s just going to be a really nice, high quality body oil that smells great and really helps you to feel tranquil and at peace.</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>Every pregnant woman should get one of these, this smells so good, and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li>The product smells pretty good if you like lavender.</li>
            <li>I first tried this product as a freebie from when I created my registry--and loved it immediately.  </li>
            <li>I liked using this a lot when I was pregnant - it&#x27;s not too greasy, and seemed (I think) to help with the stretch marks.</li>
            <li>And while some complain about the spray, I happen to love it and thinks it makes it really easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The fragrance of lavendar is quite lovely, though perhaps a bit strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great to put on a bedtime, the smell is very relaxing if you enjoy lavender.</li>
            <li>With greater elasticity in the skin, it is therefore able to stretch more easily, thereby reducing the instance of stretch marks in pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will update this post after the baby is born to give a more accurate testimony to the product.</li>
            <li>Have used this product with both pregnancies and it works great with no stretch marks so far.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t mind the stretchmarks, I&#x27;m just happy that my skin is soft and itch-free.</li>
            <li>the oils are nice and easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Not every pregnant woman ends up with stretch marks but any mother to be would feel very pampered and wonderful rubbing this oil onto her belly, and if it should prevent stretch marks too, so much the better.</li>
            <li>You can be sure it&#x27;ll be on my wish list because if someone else wanted to buy it for me, it would make a great present, just too steep for my budget!</li>
            <li>It is also comes in an easy to use squirt bottle.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it has a mild smell and is safe for baby.</li>
            <li>So, by writing this.. you should know how strongly I feel that this is a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Yes, it is a strong lavender scent.</li>
            <li>It smells really nice and feels good on the skin, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to every pregnant women, I got a sample of this product from my doctor in our welcome pack when we registered with a new doctor.</li>
            <li>Used this throughout my entire first pregnancy and it was great!</li>
            <li>had first tried out Belli&#x27;s skincare line, since it was the only one I could find that was deemed pregnancy-safe, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it, so I decided to try this belly oil</li>
            <li>so fellas, buy this for your pregnant wife!  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t tell you how quickly they became PROS!  </li>
            <li>that&#x27;s what it gives pregnant women&#x27;s trench marks, the weight!</li>
            <li>The oil comes in a lovely glass bottle with a useful spray top and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>, i think it&#x27;s even more effective when you sart using it at the early stage of the pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I was HUGE.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t want to waste a bit of this great stuff!</li>
            <li>so save your money and get some cheap baby oil if you must...</li>
            <li>The oil has a light lavender scent.</li>
            <li>I do enjoy the scent and feel of the oil on my growing belly.  </li>
            <li>but it actually worked great.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li>helped Keep my wife&#x27;s belly stetchmark free throughout duration of pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothing.</li>
            <li>I liked it even if is very \\&quot;oil\\&quot;</li>
            <li>The oil itself is very soothing to the skin and has a lovely smell that&#x27;s not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>i can&#x27;t say if it really works, as that will take many more months to see.  </li>
            <li>Smells good and my skin is soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s awesome before a meditation or yoga session or after a long, hot soak in the tub.</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good (</li>
            <li>So far, so good at 15 weeks.</li>
            <li>No stretch marks to date is wonderful, and if her c-section scar is minimized by the treatments of this oil, then that is just plain awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Belli does have a wonderful scent that plain Vitamin E does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li>The oil is easy to apply and so far has been effective.</li>
            <li>First off i love the scent and feel of this oil.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve gotten nearer to the end of the pregnancy and getting to sleep at night has become more and more difficult, I find myself using this oil as almost like a Vicks Vapo Rub, except that smells excellent and is an aromatherapy thing.     </li>
            <li>Though some may think it&#x27;s pricey, I think it&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure stretch marks are based on your genetics, so I don&#x27;t know if you can prevent them.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t wait to write this review because I am so excited that I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this oil</li>
            <li>The scent is very soothing, and so far, my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s pleasant enough.</li>
            <li>But I really have enjoyed using this product and prefer using it over BioOil which I originally used.  </li>
            <li>This product is specially formulated to help the skin stretch more readily and thus prevent or reduce the formation of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>and I have used it on my belly and breasts to prevent stretch marks with great success with just a few more weeks to go.     </li>
            <li>is a product that you must rub in very well in order to safeguard clothing, and furthermore, be sure to wash your hands well immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>Over all I liked the product, but as far as preventing stretch marks it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>so Its not too strong for baby and I. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>The spray bottle is kind of a waste, they should make it more of a pump bottle, because it splats everywhere!  </li>
            <li>It is not overpowering but pleasant and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Belli</li>
            <li>Not to mention that lavender naturally relaxes you and could get you ready for a better more comfortable night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To me it feels like something from a fine boutique - its really lovely and far nicer than something I&#x27;d expect to find on a drugstore</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also sent it as a gift to spoil my pregnant girlfriends.</li>
            <li>but you do NOT go through it quickly, even when using twice a day as recommended.  </li>
            <li>that I know some pregnant women complain of.  </li>
            <li>if it goes quick, I might not buy another bottle.</li>
            <li>It also absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure that this oil will definitely prevent stretchmarks, but if you&#x27;re looking for a lightly scented moisturizing oil, this is for you!</li>
            <li>Stretch marks are a problem for many different people and most people wait until they have stretch marks to do something about them.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t have any immediate plans to get pregnant</li>
            <li>I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this for 3 months.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and haven&#x27;t seen a stretch mark yet.</li>
            <li>I am now 5 months pregnant</li>
            <li>I was lucky and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks on my belly.</li>
            <li>I started using it from about 2 1/2 to 3 months pregnant</li>
            <li>Dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>smell - pregnant women often have a heightened sense of smell.</li>
            <li>I had a co-worker of mine who was pregnant use this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 32 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m now 38weeks pregnant...</li>
            <li>Started using it while pregnant from 5 months till delivery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m four months pregnant</li>
            <li>Im 21 weeks pregnant and have been using this on my tummy and hips day and night since 14 weeks.</li>
            <li>eventhough she is trim and gained 50 pounds while pregnant.  </li>
            <li>but for me have a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li>any product that makes you feel sexy or sensual after a long hot bath couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li>the pregnant woman who wants to pamper her Belly, Belli is an excellent, albeit expensive and not 100% effective, choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I went to my 30 week appt &amp; the first thing the doctor said when she saw my huge belly was - &amp;</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased and would purchase again</li>
            <li>I do believe, however, that &amp;#34;tending&amp;#34; to skin that is being manipulated and stretched could always use a good moisturizing treatment.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I will continue to use the BELLI Elasticity oil throughout the rest of my pregnancy to leave my skin feeling smooth, not itchy and hopefully free of new stretch marks!</li>
            <li>My first bottle was given to me by a friend, and I love it so much, I now buy it for any of my pregnant friends to try.</li>
            <li>Only word of note is that it can make your clothes smell funny if you put something on right after you applied it so best to put it on when you can let your bare belly sit for a bit.</li>
            <li>The spray bottle makes it easy to apply where needed without using too much.  </li>
            <li>but my husband commented that it was definitely making my existing stretch marks look better!</li>
            <li>I started to get stretch marks while using another product and this not only helped reduce the development of more stretchmarks, but reduced the redness of the ones I had!  </li>
            <li>So far I like it, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure that it rubs in as easily or as quickly as others have</li>
            <li>I found that it is best applied after taking a bath because it made the moisturizing effect last longer (as opposed to applying it on a dry belly).</li>
            <li>I am 6 months pregnant and so far no strech marks :)</li>
            <li>I love the way this oil smells, and it makes skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li>This belly oil has been my morning and evening ritual of sensory escape to a calm and relaxing place.  </li>
            <li>If it does prevent stretchmarks, then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth every penny and</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t confirm that it&#x27;s reducing stretch marks as of yet, but I&#x27;m sure it is to a degree (being that it&#x27;s all natural).</li>
            <li>This was definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li>As a nursing mother, I was thrilled to try this product...because we all know the stomach is not the only place a mother gets stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Belli Elasticity Belly Oil won&#x27;t eliminate exisiting stretch marks, but it will control the ones that could appear in the future and it effectively moisturizes the skin to eliminate dryness.</li>
            <li>Belli Elasticity Belly Oil won&#x27;t eliminate exisiting stretch marks, but it will control the ones that could appear in the future and it effectively moisturizes the skin to eliminate dryness.</li>
            <li>One of my absolute favorites and a definite favorite of many of my friends and family members.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard a product called Mederma has some success on lessening the appearance of stretch marks (it&#x27;s made for reducing the appearance of scars) and I will try that next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Was it worth over $30?</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s totally worth it, and the smell is divine.</li>
            <li>Love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients,</li>
            <li>Smells good, but does not really do anything for stretch marks.</li>
            <li>so far (no stretch marks yet), but the smell is quite overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>This stuff is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Toxins like pesticides and hormones from the food we eat, and chemicals absorbed through the skin from the products we use.  </li>
            <li>does adhere to teratology screening for their products, including this one, so pregnant women can feel assured that the ingredients are safe in general.  </li>
            <li>On a positive note, I liked the oil for general moisturising after bath.</li>
            <li>Pregnant women have the greatest need and represent the largest market for this type of product, but it can be used by anyone who worries about stretch marks and, as mentioned above, by anyone who would like a little therapy for their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We started using it on her tummy right away.  </li>
            <li>Just a little spritz will cover a good portion of my belly even at 36 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil is light but highly moisturizing oil that claims to reduce the incidence of stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>It is safe, there are simple ingredients, and it leaves your skins very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>The smell is calming and relaxing, and I enjoy how soft it leaves my skin without feeling super greasy.</li>
            <li>It absorbed into my skin pretty well, but did leave that shiny look that made me worry about whether it would leave an oil-stain on my clothes.</li>
            <li>It has a great sent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li>This richness and the fragrance combined definitely build a nice, relaxing, intimate atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really appreciate her recommendation as I am 32 weeks pregnant and stretch mark free thus far!  </li>
            <li>I will definitely be using Belli Elasticity Belly Oil when it&#x27;s time for #2 :)</li>
            <li>and I have no stretch marks and no itchy belly that I read so much about!  </li>
            <li>You would have to be VERY close to see any!  </li>
            <li>No stretch marks yet and better yet, no itchiness that I had from my last pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Those seeking to minimize the effects of stretch marks might be able to get the same benefit by applying Vitamin E oil.  </li>
            <li>I feel peaceful.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Belli Elasticity oil since my first trimester</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying a body oil though and found I did not like it.  </li>
            <li>My first baby</li>
            <li>Thanks Belli!</li>
            <li>and this is my first pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>researched stretch mark prevention for days and days when I first started to \\&quot;show\\&quot; during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I had stretchmarks below my belly button with my first child 7 years ago.</li>
            <li>well the first time around.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of different products and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li>I used ths for the first 3 months of my pregnancy</li>
            <li>My first two I just used lotion and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks either.</li>
            <li>Think almond oil and other more natural products work better for moisture.</li>
            <li>I started using this almost right away, and at 8+ months pregnant, I do not have any stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li>I am pregnant and began using this oil to prevent new stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>It leaves the skin feeling soft, clean, and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit oily, which may be good for it working but makes it more difficult to want to put on.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great all-body oil and from the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, and from what I&#x27;ve seen first hand, this stuff is just terrific for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>She was so positive she was going to get them.</li>
            <li>It feels good to spoil myself with this everyday!</li>
            <li>I use this oil for obvious anti-stretch mark reasons, but the scent is what really gets me excited!</li>
            <li>But there is one fact that could cause many potential customers to change their minds: The high price.</li>
            <li>But there is one fact that could cause many potential customers to change their minds: The high price.</li>
            <li>Purchased for my pregnant wife, she&#x27;s been very pleased with the results, she&#x27;s had no stretch marks to date, she&#x27;s a very small woman, and it would appear we&#x27;re having large baby.</li>
            <li>I am not pregnant, but I did try it out and liked it.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I guess there is no way to know for certain as some women can use no product and have no stretch marks at all.</li>
            <li>I was afraid it would be too oily and will leave rounded oily blotches on my clothes, but I was delighted that, because it was absorbed easily into the skin, it didn&#x27;t leave any oily residue at all.  </li>
            <li>but if you are, I think it&#x27;s a pretty nice excuse to have your significant other spend some really quality attention time with you and bond with the baby even before you&#x27;re introduced face-to-face.</li>
            <li>It was actually a nice little bonding thing between the two of us,</li>
            <li>Growing at a rather fast pace, she used this oil her last three months and NOT ONE MARK to show for two beautiful little ones on this earth!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a whole lot you can do for stretchmarks if your predisposed (all women on my mom&#x27;s side have them)</li>
            <li>Also, stretch marks can&#x27;t really be prevented.  </li>
            <li>The lavender scent is very calming.  </li>
            <li>so this stuff really works.</li>
            <li>and I have had zero problems with itchiness, which is all thanks to my use of this product, I believe.  </li>
            <li>and I really like the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Then I thought, if they give you so much oil, then it must have some weird-do ingredients that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  </li>
            <li>This absolutely helped.  </li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li>The sent is very relaxing and very lavender.</li>
            <li>I really like this oil and keep in on my desk at work.  </li>
            <li>Well, let me start by talking about the \\&quot;Strech Mark\\&quot; and if it really does keep it away.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like this oil.  </li>
            <li>I much prefer the  cream from Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>I feel very disappointted about this</li>
            <li>I really wanted to like this product, but I think I am going to save it for after I give</li>
            <li>It is moist but not greasy,  lightly scented that is not overpowering, I think I will buy a second one.</li>
            <li>I really like i</li>
            <li>and I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li>I have gained more weight than expected (30 pounds) but still no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It goes kinda fast though.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really say if I attribute to this product or the Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li>is that it doesn&#x27;t stains or ruin my clothes even though it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li>oil itself actually did seem to reduce the appearance of stretch marks and left my skin feeling nice.  </li>
            <li>I am aware that stretch marks are more genetic than previously thought so</li>
            <li>This body oil super- moisturizes the skin and this fact alone could make it a worthwhile alternative to ordinary body oils.</li>
            <li>As a first time mom, I have tried many different belly oils, from all different range in prices.</li>
            <li>Love it, smell is strong but only lasts for a little while.</li>
            <li>I had a whole tummy full of stretch marks, my second baby I used this oil and got not one!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad to say that there are NO NEW STRETCH MARKS on my belly so far.</li>
            <li>In other words, it has a very tangy scent that begins to grate on the nerves after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Second, and more importantly, this product is treacherous for the clothes!</li>
            <li>The oil is extremely moisturizing and is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Someone recommended I use Almond oil to avoid stretchmarks and then I received this bottle as a gift, and discovered that Almond oil was one of the main ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently at 19 weeks and remain stretch mark free so far.  </li>
            <li>The main use for this oil is to prevent stretchmarks caused by pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I used this religiously twice a day when I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to scents, especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li>bottle breaks easy and shatters into a million sharp jagged pieces.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>and it certainly ranks as a highly useful oil treatment for anyone who anticipates excessive weight gain or other stretching of the skin in a short period of time.rize the skin very nicely and it does eliminate dryness, as well as preventing the formation of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>stickiness - it&#x27;s appropriately viscous without leaving that heavy cream after-feel  3.</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
            <li>It is normally $40</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give all the credit to the oil as I&#x27;ve only used it on babies 3 and 4 with success.</li>
            <li>It smells soft, natural and just plain nice.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I think for anyone who is pregnant who wants to try and prevent stretch marks or any other lines post pregnancy, this is def.</li>
            <li>It squirts out in a very strong way and is hard to rub in.</li>
            <li>spilled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice and subtle.  </li>
            <li>I am very conscious of what I put on my skin and how it could affect the baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li>product is pricey, but the ingredients are all natural and/or high quality.  </li>
            <li>It feels very soft and tender.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil got delivered very fast, I don&#x27;t think it even took 3 days with regular shipment method.</li>
            <li>and I only had temporary stretch marks with my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li>If you can get past the price, you could find many things to like about this product</li>
            <li>If you can get past the price, you could find many things to like about this product</li>
            <li>and so far no stretch marks, at 25 weeks and counting!  </li>
            <li>I also have stretch marks on my breasts from when I was young, so I thought I was doomed to get pregnancy stretch marks, but I haven&#x27;t gotten one, knock on wood!</li>
            <li>The only reason Belly&#x27;s brand of oil is more expensive is because it has a better fragrance</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say first bottle will last me 2 months.</li>
            <li>I used this product for my first pregnancy daily, and have no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>My husband actually found this belly oil for me as we embarked on our second pregnancy, as a special treat.  </li>
            <li>Much like every other item available which promises to prevent or decrease stretch marks, this product does not actually prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>for preventing stretch marks, so far I don&#x27;t have any new ones and I will update after delivery.</li>
            <li>First of all I was surprised by how big the bottle is.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use it all pretty soon since it will cover extensive areas, but I did not want to get an old item.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is not very thick as it dispenses in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li>I have been rubbing this (lavender &amp; sweet almond oil &amp; other plant extracts) on a scar from knee surgery</li>
            <li>I also am very conscientious about using green products while pregnant.</li>
            <li>(so far I still have more than half of the bottle left</li>
            <li>Obviously we all know other factors contribute like not gaining weight too quickly, but now that I&#x27;m pregnant with my second</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to other pregnant women.</li>
            <li>When I received the Belli Oil, I was surprised on how much Belli oil you actually get.  </li>
            <li>First time was just around the time I was starting to show, and the second time was when I accidentally broke the first bottle (can be slippery after a shower)and was left in tears.</li>
            <li>So far, fingers crossed, i don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I agree with some of the lower ratings as far as the cost of the oil.  </li>
            <li>My skin has not dried out in the slightest</li>
            <li>far I rate this item 4 stars...</li>
            <li>do wear it only at night, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting on my work clothing as much.</li>
            <li>It was developed by a dermatologist for his wife during</li>
            <li>Once they are there, they don&#x27;t go away - and while the appearance can be helped with Vitamin A or laser therapy, ladies know they don&#x27;t ever fade completely.  </li>
            <li>Not greasy, just soft to touch.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the oil moisturizing, but it also has the very calming scent of lavender.</li>
            <li>It comes in a spray bottle but it can be directed well-it doesn&#x27;t spray all wild.</li>
            <li>The oil itself feels soft and silky, which is always a plus for me...</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a very pleasing scent, with the obvious presence of lavender.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, the oil&#x27;s scent is not too overpowering to my sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li>The oil itself is smooth and does not leave a heavy or sticky residue on my hands.  </li>
            <li>I have gained about 10 pounds so far.  </li>
            <li>This one however is really soft and well formulated, providing the soothing effect that lavender should.</li>
            <li>I have no stretch marks so far and its been a treat using this product.</li>
            <li>Bought this because I wanted something to help minimize the stretch marks from the baby belly and was looking for something made with mostly natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>However, if I did that I would be surprised if this product lasted 1 month.</li>
            <li>I use after all showers, and so far no stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It has kept my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I was starting to feel really irritated and moody</li>
            <li>I only used it after 8 months, when the absolute largest, yet still got no stretch marks, and my baby boy was over nine pounds.</li>
            <li>(Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil).</li>
            <li>So far (9 months of pregnancy)</li>
            <li>There are alternative oils that are priced at half the cost, so one really has to consider whether or not Belli Elasticity Belly Oil has enough special qualities to justify a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There are alternative oils that are priced at half the cost, so one really has to consider whether or not Belli Elasticity Belly Oil has enough special qualities to justify a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>While I have to admit the smell of it is strong and definitely not my favorite, nor does it smell like lilacs, it works.</li>
            <li>I am not far enough along yet to have tested the upper limits of this product for stretch mark prevention, but so far its been a fantastic find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes its hard to find a pleasant lavender scent, some being too harsh or chemical smelling.</li>
            <li>Right after my baby was born I looked down on my tummy and was surprised that I had a bunch!</li>
            <li>/&gt;We tend to use several sprays from the bottle, and then go back for more as we go along; the oil is rich and while it IS oil, it doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;oily\\&quot; as other body creams we&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li>Now, 18 months after deliver, I can barely see the stretch mark and only if I&#x27;m really looking for it.  </li>
            <li>I do love the smell, and that says something since I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell of anything for my first trimester, but this is so expensive</li>
            <li>A benefit I hadn&#x27;t expected was that it kept my belly warm on windy days, which we have been having the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on using the Belli oil on my next pregnancy (Lord willing), and I will report back on the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I did break out in a small rash on the top of my belly.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my tummy since the first trimester, and I am now in my 9th month of pregnancy and see only a tiny stretch mark below my belly button.</li>
            <li>The oil left my skin very soft!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if this was because my skin has already been stretched or if the product is really working.</li>
            <li>it helped calm me down when I was rubbing it on my belly..</li>
            <li>- I&#x27;m actually curious to see if there are other fragrances out there for this product, but lavender is my wife&#x27;s favorite (and mine, too, actually)</li>
            <li>So the product probably will help to minimize new stretch marks some and will contribute to overall skin conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>However my skin was still very itchy and dry as my belly grew.</li>
            <li>the size of a dime was enough to cover the whole belly, which means it will last longer.  </li>
            <li>From my experience, I have found that Belli Elasticity Belly Oil works wonders on dry elbows, and it could be very useful for other patches of skin that are prone to dryness.</li>
            <li>I am currently 31 weeks and so far NO STRETCH MARKS!</li>
            <li>I seriously had my doubts about being able to prevent stretchmarks on my belly during my pregnancy because all of the women in my family have them, but this product actually works!</li>
            <li>and we found it great as a lavender-scented massage oil for rubbing mom&#x27;s tired muscles when she&#x27;s through with your pregnancy and have a little left over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ll have to see how far the bottle goes using it daily on my hips, breasts and stomach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used 2 bottles so far since 2nd trimester</li>
            <li>So even if you &#x27;go organic&#x27; and use strictly &#x27;all natural&#x27; products during your pregnancy, you&#x27;re still likely to pass on toxins to your baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It soaks in fairly fast but still need to be careful with clothes.  </li>
            <li>in all a nice product, albeit a bit expensive.</li>
            <li>Scent is not outstanding, but not bad either.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely use this product again, and plan on gifting it to any new moms I meet in the future.</li>
            <li>This oil is heavily marketed toward pregnant woman since they have an obvious need to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li>But there are other oils that work the exact same way.</li>
            <li>Not a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li>It has a subtle lavender scent that is not overpowering, especially since pregnancy puts my nose into hyperdrive and everything that smells too strongly makes me nauseous.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m almost 8 months pregnant now and only in the last few weeks have I noticed some stretch marks appear beneath my belly button.  </li>
            <li>Who knows if this product is why I don&#x27;t have more noticeable and dramatic stretch marks (so far mine are a clear color and limited to the hip area), but I have to believe it is helping keep my stretching skin moisturized, as it definitely feels like it.  </li>
            <li>and it certainly ranks as a highly useful oil treatment for anyone who anticipates excessive weight gain or other stretching of the skin in a short period of time.</li>
            <li>No parabens, no fragrance, no strange chemicals.</li>
            <li>She said it was smooth going on and made her stomach feel less \\&quot;stretchy\\&quot; and it seemed to itch less when she used it.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin, making it less greasy than other oils.  </li>
            <li>I typically apply the belly oil in our upstairs bathroom, both post-morning shower and pre-bedtime, but the gentle aroma seems to suspend reality and make me think of lavendar fields in southern France.  </li>
            <li>pretty well leaving very little oily residue, there is some</li>
            <li>So far, the only mark that can be seen is the incision for the C-Section she had to have, and honestly, I think even the incision scar is not as bad as I thought it was going to be at this point.  </li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> might be the best in the market.  </li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> So, best method is to spray in hand and then rub on belly and thighs in circular motions.     </li>
            <li> B000V1BDIG BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil, 4 oz]] was probably one of the best moisturizers/</li>
            <li> Great product!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful this BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil is!</li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> It is probably best during pregnancy and not after stretchmarks are already there.  </li>
            <li> It was soothing to my skin and smelled great too!</li>
            <li> A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> :D</li>
            <li> Stick to bio oil, it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> The Lavendar scent Smells great!</li>
            <li> I can not stand the smell of coco butter products, so this was the perfect solution for me.</li>
            <li> And it worked wonderfully.</li>
            <li> It is so relaxing and perfect for bedtime!</li>
            <li> I was not, however, impressed with the moisturizing.</li>
            <li> a side note, the blemish treatment by Belli was GREAT!</li>
            <li> And best of all, well, I don&#x27;t want to jinx myself...</li>
            <li> the smell is wonderful and it helped stop the itching on my belly.</li>
            <li> awesome  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Secondly, it moisturize the skin perfectly.</li>
            <li> I would also recommend the product to all my non-pregnant girls.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing that i like about the product</li>
            <li> Amazing!!</li>

            <li> I was very happy with the BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil because it is a great moisturizer for my skin.</li>
            <li> There is no fool-proof method of avoiding stretchmarks, but this belly oil smells wonderful and does a great job of moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Either i&#x27;ve got good genetics, or this product works, or maybe both!    </li>
            <li> I loved the smell and the way it made my skin feel!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s a great product</li>
            <li> All that being said, this oil has all kinds of great moisturizers for your skin.  </li>
            <li> Happy to say no stretchmarks after delivery.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any belly itching</li>
            <li> The price tag is steep and I&#x27;ve been happy with my burts bees</li>
            <li> the price on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> for the oil itself - I was happy to see it absorbs into the skin and does not leave you feeling greasy.  </li>
            <li> This seller&#x27;s S&amp;H was great.  </li>
            <li> The lavender and almond oil does truly have a great scent &amp; relaxing effect.</li>
            <li> but it seems to really be a great product.     </li>
            <li> great-</li>
            <li> This oil works great.</li>
            <li> Great results,</li>
            <li> The oil smells great and feels great on the skins</li>
            <li> this smells great and helped with my itchy belly.  </li>
            <li> It feels great however, on that itchy stretching skin.</li>
            <li> This oil worked great to prevent stretch marks and also kept my skin moisturized.  </li>
            <li> (if you like lavendar)  I love this stuff!!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!!</li>
            <li> My wife used it throughout the pragnancy and find it very effective.</li>
            <li> This oil has a very nice texture.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs very nicely but is still an oil</li>
            <li> It does moisturize the skin very nicely and it does eliminate dryness, as well as preventing the formation of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice skin product.  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> :^)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lavender soothes headaches, and it&#x27;s just a pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not greasy and it has a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> This body oil has a pleasant lavender scent that I find soothing and not at all offensive.</li>
            <li> I think the idea is great, and of course the ingredients used are wonderful for pampering the skin, but I have two complaints that detract from the success of this product.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually good to go!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I thought this was a good value for the money.  </li>
            <li> The lavender smell is just what the doctor ordered, but the relief I got isn&#x27;t as good</li>
            <li> bought a bottle of Belli Elasticity Belly Oil for my sister-in-law, who loved it, and used it throughout her pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, which did not have as good of a scent, nor did it feel as good on my skin as a sample of Belli.</li>
            <li> this smells really good.  </li>
            <li> It smells so good.</li>
            <li> She loved the smell as well.</li>
            <li> Good in a way that you don&#x27;t have to scramble for the cap  to close it every time (</li>
            <li> It is also a good oil for massages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Expensive, I consider a good price for a 4 oz for this type of oil to be under 15 bucks.</li>
            <li> The product smell so good, it is a relaxing moment.</li>
            <li> I have really liked using this oil- pleasant smell, makes my skin feel good, doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing or towels.  </li>
            <li> my best friend used it when she was pregnant with her baby.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Belli Elasticity Belly Oil does seem to have many great things to offer.</li>
            <li> Happy to say no stretch marks yet :-)</li>
            <li> Works great, smells fantastic!</li>
            <li> /&gt;First of all it feels and smells very healthy, so Im not worried about any impact on my baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, as you can see, I love the product!  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil!</li>
            <li> It smells amazing (like crack for pregnant women) and just feels incredible.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, this stuff smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> The scent of the oil is amazing, and it reminds me of a spa.</li>
            <li> It was nice.</li>
            <li> It would make a nice massage oil also.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks and the smell is nice.  </li>
            <li> She said it was kind of sticky, so she used it when she was staying home</li>
            <li> This is a nice oil.</li>
            <li> My husband liked the scent</li>
            <li> it wasn&#x27;t too greasy or anything, so I liked that.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It smells like lavender and it&#x27;s soooo nice.</li>
            <li> Puts me in a Good mood for rest of day :)</li>
            <li> , I decided to try this out when I saw that it has a nice lavender smell...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled I found this.</li>
            <li> It smells pleasantly like lavender and is nice to rub on my pregnant belly!</li>
            <li> Sweet almond oil is a really great product for the skin.  </li>
            <li> Has a great smell, and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and perfume-y</li>
            <li> but it was a very, very nice oil to put on my pregnant belly every evening.</li>
            <li> All in all, very impressed so far</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is now my favorite thing I own from Belli.</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We have also used the BELLI oil on shoulders for shoulder massages for stress, and the lavender is enjoyed by both of us.  </li>
            <li> Recommended, for sure.</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> I know I love the product pictured, because I have used it before.  </li>
            <li> I like that it has a spritzer top to efficiently apply the oil.</li>
            <li> As for the product, I love it...for the most part &#x3D;</li>
            <li> nothing will work - do your Kegels instead :)</li>
            <li> This product has none of those ingredients and the doctor who invented it seems to have gone out of his way to make sure everything in the bottle is safe to use.</li>
            <li> i love the scent of lavender that pervades the house when this is applied.    </li>
            <li> The scent of this may be my favorite thing...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy it - I probably will buy more even to use after pregnancy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love the smell.</li>
            <li> Love the quality.</li>
            <li> Love the packaging.</li>
            <li> Love not having one stretch marks after a 10-lb baby.</li>
            <li> What more is there to say about this product.</li>
            <li> but I do love this oil and it does seem to soak in faster.  </li>
            <li> Being that this is a very oily product, your great skin might come at the cost of ruined clothing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Belli Elasticity Belly Oil carries a price that will place it out of reach for many and even those who can afford it could find the cost unacceptable.</li>
            <li> Belli Elasticity Belly Oil carries a price that will place it out of reach for many and even those who can afford it could find the cost unacceptable.</li>
            <li> sure, ANOTHER beauty product that promises the world and will not come through\\&quot;...</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, a friend of mine just gave birth to twins and her OB/GYN</li>
            <li> More like vanilla almond to me.  </li>
            <li> Many of the ingredients are conducive to skin conditioning and repair.</li>
            <li> He gets bonus points for this; it has turned out to be a favorite ritual of mine.</li>
            <li> and I have gained more stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> This stuff worked better than lotion and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure how to rate this item.  </li>
            <li> I read where stretchmarks cannot be prevented and that most often it is heredity that will determine if you get them.</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Great moisture that lasts most of the day, although I apply this morning and night, because I love it so much.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells way better than coco butter oil</li>
            <li> However, I love to go to bed at night and massage my belly while I talk to my baby.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure the product itself is helpful in prevention of stretch marks</li>
            <li> I would love to use it for a baby lotion, too.</li>
            <li> love the smell</li>
            <li> and I have the feeling that I need put more quantity.</li>
            <li> and I used more bottles of Earth Mama Angel than Belli Oil ...</li>
            <li> Im enjoying the product so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this oil and the way it feels when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my skin feels after putting it on!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Honestly, for the price, you&#x27;d be wise to assume it&#x27;s just going to be a really nice, high quality body oil that smells great and really helps you to feel tranquil and at peace.</li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Every pregnant woman should get one of these, this smells so good, and feels so smooth.</li>
            <li> The product smells pretty good if you like lavender.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product as a freebie from when I created my registry--and loved it immediately.  </li>
            <li> I liked using this a lot when I was pregnant - it&#x27;s not too greasy, and seemed (I think) to help with the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> And while some complain about the spray, I happen to love it and thinks it makes it really easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of lavendar is quite lovely, though perhaps a bit strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great to put on a bedtime, the smell is very relaxing if you enjoy lavender.</li>
            <li> With greater elasticity in the skin, it is therefore able to stretch more easily, thereby reducing the instance of stretch marks in pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I will update this post after the baby is born to give a more accurate testimony to the product.</li>
            <li> Have used this product with both pregnancies and it works great with no stretch marks so far.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mind the stretchmarks, I&#x27;m just happy that my skin is soft and itch-free.</li>
            <li> the oils are nice and easily absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Not every pregnant woman ends up with stretch marks but any mother to be would feel very pampered and wonderful rubbing this oil onto her belly, and if it should prevent stretch marks too, so much the better.</li>
            <li> You can be sure it&#x27;ll be on my wish list because if someone else wanted to buy it for me, it would make a great present, just too steep for my budget!</li>
            <li> It is also comes in an easy to use squirt bottle.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it has a mild smell and is safe for baby.</li>
            <li> So, by writing this.. you should know how strongly I feel that this is a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a strong lavender scent.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice and feels good on the skin, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to every pregnant women, I got a sample of this product from my doctor in our welcome pack when we registered with a new doctor.</li>
            <li> Used this throughout my entire first pregnancy and it was great!</li>
            <li> had first tried out Belli&#x27;s skincare line, since it was the only one I could find that was deemed pregnancy-safe, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it, so I decided to try this belly oil</li>
            <li> so fellas, buy this for your pregnant wife!  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how quickly they became PROS!  </li>
            <li> that&#x27;s what it gives pregnant women&#x27;s trench marks, the weight!</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a lovely glass bottle with a useful spray top and absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> , i think it&#x27;s even more effective when you sart using it at the early stage of the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I was HUGE.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t want to waste a bit of this great stuff!</li>
            <li> so save your money and get some cheap baby oil if you must...</li>
            <li> The oil has a light lavender scent.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the scent and feel of the oil on my growing belly.  </li>
            <li> but it actually worked great.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li> helped Keep my wife&#x27;s belly stetchmark free throughout duration of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothing.</li>
            <li> I liked it even if is very \\&quot;oil\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The oil itself is very soothing to the skin and has a lovely smell that&#x27;s not too overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> i can&#x27;t say if it really works, as that will take many more months to see.  </li>
            <li> Smells good and my skin is soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awesome before a meditation or yoga session or after a long, hot soak in the tub.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but so far, so good (</li>
            <li> So far, so good at 15 weeks.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks to date is wonderful, and if her c-section scar is minimized by the treatments of this oil, then that is just plain awesome.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Belli does have a wonderful scent that plain Vitamin E does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> The oil is easy to apply and so far has been effective.</li>
            <li> First off i love the scent and feel of this oil.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve gotten nearer to the end of the pregnancy and getting to sleep at night has become more and more difficult, I find myself using this oil as almost like a Vicks Vapo Rub, except that smells excellent and is an aromatherapy thing.     </li>
            <li> Though some may think it&#x27;s pricey, I think it&#x27;s worth every penny!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure stretch marks are based on your genetics, so I don&#x27;t know if you can prevent them.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to write this review because I am so excited that I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> definitely worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this oil</li>
            <li> The scent is very soothing, and so far, my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s pleasant enough.</li>
            <li> But I really have enjoyed using this product and prefer using it over BioOil which I originally used.  </li>
            <li> This product is specially formulated to help the skin stretch more readily and thus prevent or reduce the formation of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> and I have used it on my belly and breasts to prevent stretch marks with great success with just a few more weeks to go.     </li>
            <li> is a product that you must rub in very well in order to safeguard clothing, and furthermore, be sure to wash your hands well immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;While</li>
            <li> I love it so much.</li>
            <li> Over all I liked the product, but as far as preventing stretch marks it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> so Its not too strong for baby and I. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> The spray bottle is kind of a waste, they should make it more of a pump bottle, because it splats everywhere!  </li>
            <li> It is not overpowering but pleasant and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Belli</li>
            <li> Not to mention that lavender naturally relaxes you and could get you ready for a better more comfortable night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To me it feels like something from a fine boutique - its really lovely and far nicer than something I&#x27;d expect to find on a drugstore</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also sent it as a gift to spoil my pregnant girlfriends.</li>
            <li> but you do NOT go through it quickly, even when using twice a day as recommended.  </li>
            <li> that I know some pregnant women complain of.  </li>
            <li> if it goes quick, I might not buy another bottle.</li>
            <li> It also absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure that this oil will definitely prevent stretchmarks, but if you&#x27;re looking for a lightly scented moisturizing oil, this is for you!</li>
            <li> Stretch marks are a problem for many different people and most people wait until they have stretch marks to do something about them.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have any immediate plans to get pregnant</li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this for 3 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and haven&#x27;t seen a stretch mark yet.</li>
            <li> I am now 5 months pregnant</li>
            <li> I was lucky and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks on my belly.</li>
            <li> I started using it from about 2 1/2 to 3 months pregnant</li>
            <li> Dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> smell - pregnant women often have a heightened sense of smell.</li>
            <li> I had a co-worker of mine who was pregnant use this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m now 38weeks pregnant...</li>
            <li> Started using it while pregnant from 5 months till delivery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m four months pregnant</li>
            <li> Im 21 weeks pregnant and have been using this on my tummy and hips day and night since 14 weeks.</li>
            <li> eventhough she is trim and gained 50 pounds while pregnant.  </li>
            <li> but for me have a mild fragrance.</li>
            <li> any product that makes you feel sexy or sensual after a long hot bath couldn&#x27;t be better!</li>
            <li> the pregnant woman who wants to pamper her Belly, Belli is an excellent, albeit expensive and not 100% effective, choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I went to my 30 week appt &amp; the first thing the doctor said when she saw my huge belly was - &amp;</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased and would purchase again</li>
            <li> I do believe, however, that &amp;#34;tending&amp;#34; to skin that is being manipulated and stretched could always use a good moisturizing treatment.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I will continue to use the BELLI Elasticity oil throughout the rest of my pregnancy to leave my skin feeling smooth, not itchy and hopefully free of new stretch marks!</li>
            <li> My first bottle was given to me by a friend, and I love it so much, I now buy it for any of my pregnant friends to try.</li>
            <li> Only word of note is that it can make your clothes smell funny if you put something on right after you applied it so best to put it on when you can let your bare belly sit for a bit.</li>
            <li> The spray bottle makes it easy to apply where needed without using too much.  </li>
            <li> but my husband commented that it was definitely making my existing stretch marks look better!</li>
            <li> I started to get stretch marks while using another product and this not only helped reduce the development of more stretchmarks, but reduced the redness of the ones I had!  </li>
            <li> So far I like it, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure that it rubs in as easily or as quickly as others have</li>
            <li> I found that it is best applied after taking a bath because it made the moisturizing effect last longer (as opposed to applying it on a dry belly).</li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and so far no strech marks :)</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil smells, and it makes skin feel super soft.</li>
            <li> This belly oil has been my morning and evening ritual of sensory escape to a calm and relaxing place.  </li>
            <li> If it does prevent stretchmarks, then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth every penny and</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t confirm that it&#x27;s reducing stretch marks as of yet, but I&#x27;m sure it is to a degree (being that it&#x27;s all natural).</li>
            <li> This was definitely worth the investment</li>
            <li> As a nursing mother, I was thrilled to try this product...because we all know the stomach is not the only place a mother gets stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Belli Elasticity Belly Oil won&#x27;t eliminate exisiting stretch marks, but it will control the ones that could appear in the future and it effectively moisturizes the skin to eliminate dryness.</li>
            <li> Belli Elasticity Belly Oil won&#x27;t eliminate exisiting stretch marks, but it will control the ones that could appear in the future and it effectively moisturizes the skin to eliminate dryness.</li>
            <li> One of my absolute favorites and a definite favorite of many of my friends and family members.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard a product called Mederma has some success on lessening the appearance of stretch marks (it&#x27;s made for reducing the appearance of scars) and I will try that next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Was it worth over $30?</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally worth it, and the smell is divine.</li>
            <li> Love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients,</li>
            <li> Smells good, but does not really do anything for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> so far (no stretch marks yet), but the smell is quite overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Toxins like pesticides and hormones from the food we eat, and chemicals absorbed through the skin from the products we use.  </li>
            <li> does adhere to teratology screening for their products, including this one, so pregnant women can feel assured that the ingredients are safe in general.  </li>
            <li> On a positive note, I liked the oil for general moisturising after bath.</li>
            <li> Pregnant women have the greatest need and represent the largest market for this type of product, but it can be used by anyone who worries about stretch marks and, as mentioned above, by anyone who would like a little therapy for their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We started using it on her tummy right away.  </li>
            <li> Just a little spritz will cover a good portion of my belly even at 36 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil is light but highly moisturizing oil that claims to reduce the incidence of stretch marks during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> It is safe, there are simple ingredients, and it leaves your skins very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> The smell is calming and relaxing, and I enjoy how soft it leaves my skin without feeling super greasy.</li>
            <li> It absorbed into my skin pretty well, but did leave that shiny look that made me worry about whether it would leave an oil-stain on my clothes.</li>
            <li> It has a great sent that is not overwhelming.  </li>
            <li> This richness and the fragrance combined definitely build a nice, relaxing, intimate atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really appreciate her recommendation as I am 32 weeks pregnant and stretch mark free thus far!  </li>
            <li> I will definitely be using Belli Elasticity Belly Oil when it&#x27;s time for #2 :)</li>
            <li> and I have no stretch marks and no itchy belly that I read so much about!  </li>
            <li> You would have to be VERY close to see any!  </li>
            <li> No stretch marks yet and better yet, no itchiness that I had from my last pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Those seeking to minimize the effects of stretch marks might be able to get the same benefit by applying Vitamin E oil.  </li>
            <li> I feel peaceful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Belli Elasticity oil since my first trimester</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying a body oil though and found I did not like it.  </li>
            <li> My first baby</li>
            <li> Thanks Belli!</li>
            <li> and this is my first pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> researched stretch mark prevention for days and days when I first started to \\&quot;show\\&quot; during pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I had stretchmarks below my belly button with my first child 7 years ago.</li>
            <li> well the first time around.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of different products and this was my favorite.</li>
            <li> I used ths for the first 3 months of my pregnancy</li>
            <li> My first two I just used lotion and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks either.</li>
            <li> Think almond oil and other more natural products work better for moisture.</li>
            <li> I started using this almost right away, and at 8+ months pregnant, I do not have any stretch marks so far.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and began using this oil to prevent new stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> It leaves the skin feeling soft, clean, and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit oily, which may be good for it working but makes it more difficult to want to put on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great all-body oil and from the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, and from what I&#x27;ve seen first hand, this stuff is just terrific for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She was so positive she was going to get them.</li>
            <li> It feels good to spoil myself with this everyday!</li>
            <li> I use this oil for obvious anti-stretch mark reasons, but the scent is what really gets me excited!</li>
            <li> But there is one fact that could cause many potential customers to change their minds: The high price.</li>
            <li> But there is one fact that could cause many potential customers to change their minds: The high price.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my pregnant wife, she&#x27;s been very pleased with the results, she&#x27;s had no stretch marks to date, she&#x27;s a very small woman, and it would appear we&#x27;re having large baby.</li>
            <li> I am not pregnant, but I did try it out and liked it.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I guess there is no way to know for certain as some women can use no product and have no stretch marks at all.</li>
            <li> I was afraid it would be too oily and will leave rounded oily blotches on my clothes, but I was delighted that, because it was absorbed easily into the skin, it didn&#x27;t leave any oily residue at all.  </li>
            <li> but if you are, I think it&#x27;s a pretty nice excuse to have your significant other spend some really quality attention time with you and bond with the baby even before you&#x27;re introduced face-to-face.</li>
            <li> It was actually a nice little bonding thing between the two of us,</li>
            <li> Growing at a rather fast pace, she used this oil her last three months and NOT ONE MARK to show for two beautiful little ones on this earth!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a whole lot you can do for stretchmarks if your predisposed (all women on my mom&#x27;s side have them)</li>
            <li> Also, stretch marks can&#x27;t really be prevented.  </li>
            <li> The lavender scent is very calming.  </li>
            <li> so this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> and I have had zero problems with itchiness, which is all thanks to my use of this product, I believe.  </li>
            <li> and I really like the way it feels on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Then I thought, if they give you so much oil, then it must have some weird-do ingredients that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  </li>
            <li> This absolutely helped.  </li>
            <li> It moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> The sent is very relaxing and very lavender.</li>
            <li> I really like this oil and keep in on my desk at work.  </li>
            <li> Well, let me start by talking about the \\&quot;Strech Mark\\&quot; and if it really does keep it away.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this oil.  </li>
            <li> I much prefer the  cream from Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> I feel very disappointted about this</li>
            <li> I really wanted to like this product, but I think I am going to save it for after I give</li>
            <li> It is moist but not greasy,  lightly scented that is not overpowering, I think I will buy a second one.</li>
            <li> I really like i</li>
            <li> and I am very dissapointed.</li>
            <li> I have gained more weight than expected (30 pounds) but still no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It goes kinda fast though.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really say if I attribute to this product or the Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
            <li> is that it doesn&#x27;t stains or ruin my clothes even though it&#x27;s very</li>
            <li> oil itself actually did seem to reduce the appearance of stretch marks and left my skin feeling nice.  </li>
            <li> I am aware that stretch marks are more genetic than previously thought so</li>
            <li> This body oil super- moisturizes the skin and this fact alone could make it a worthwhile alternative to ordinary body oils.</li>
            <li> As a first time mom, I have tried many different belly oils, from all different range in prices.</li>
            <li> Love it, smell is strong but only lasts for a little while.</li>
            <li> I had a whole tummy full of stretch marks, my second baby I used this oil and got not one!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad to say that there are NO NEW STRETCH MARKS on my belly so far.</li>
            <li> In other words, it has a very tangy scent that begins to grate on the nerves after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Second, and more importantly, this product is treacherous for the clothes!</li>
            <li> The oil is extremely moisturizing and is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Someone recommended I use Almond oil to avoid stretchmarks and then I received this bottle as a gift, and discovered that Almond oil was one of the main ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently at 19 weeks and remain stretch mark free so far.  </li>
            <li> The main use for this oil is to prevent stretchmarks caused by pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I used this religiously twice a day when I found out I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents, especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant.</li>
            <li> bottle breaks easy and shatters into a million sharp jagged pieces.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> and it certainly ranks as a highly useful oil treatment for anyone who anticipates excessive weight gain or other stretching of the skin in a short period of time.rize the skin very nicely and it does eliminate dryness, as well as preventing the formation of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> stickiness - it&#x27;s appropriately viscous without leaving that heavy cream after-feel  3.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews.</li>
            <li> It is normally $40</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give all the credit to the oil as I&#x27;ve only used it on babies 3 and 4 with success.</li>
            <li> It smells soft, natural and just plain nice.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I think for anyone who is pregnant who wants to try and prevent stretch marks or any other lines post pregnancy, this is def.</li>
            <li> It squirts out in a very strong way and is hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> spilled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice and subtle.  </li>
            <li> I am very conscious of what I put on my skin and how it could affect the baby.&lt;br</li>
            <li> product is pricey, but the ingredients are all natural and/or high quality.  </li>
            <li> It feels very soft and tender.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The oil got delivered very fast, I don&#x27;t think it even took 3 days with regular shipment method.</li>
            <li> and I only had temporary stretch marks with my first pregnancy.</li>
            <li> If you can get past the price, you could find many things to like about this product</li>
            <li> If you can get past the price, you could find many things to like about this product</li>
            <li> and so far no stretch marks, at 25 weeks and counting!  </li>
            <li> I also have stretch marks on my breasts from when I was young, so I thought I was doomed to get pregnancy stretch marks, but I haven&#x27;t gotten one, knock on wood!</li>
            <li> The only reason Belly&#x27;s brand of oil is more expensive is because it has a better fragrance</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say first bottle will last me 2 months.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my first pregnancy daily, and have no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My husband actually found this belly oil for me as we embarked on our second pregnancy, as a special treat.  </li>
            <li> Much like every other item available which promises to prevent or decrease stretch marks, this product does not actually prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> for preventing stretch marks, so far I don&#x27;t have any new ones and I will update after delivery.</li>
            <li> First of all I was surprised by how big the bottle is.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it all pretty soon since it will cover extensive areas, but I did not want to get an old item.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is not very thick as it dispenses in a spray bottle.  </li>
            <li> I have been rubbing this (lavender &amp; sweet almond oil &amp; other plant extracts) on a scar from knee surgery</li>
            <li> I also am very conscientious about using green products while pregnant.</li>
            <li> (so far I still have more than half of the bottle left</li>
            <li> Obviously we all know other factors contribute like not gaining weight too quickly, but now that I&#x27;m pregnant with my second</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to other pregnant women.</li>
            <li> When I received the Belli Oil, I was surprised on how much Belli oil you actually get.  </li>
            <li> First time was just around the time I was starting to show, and the second time was when I accidentally broke the first bottle (can be slippery after a shower)and was left in tears.</li>
            <li> So far, fingers crossed, i don&#x27;t have any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the lower ratings as far as the cost of the oil.  </li>
            <li> My skin has not dried out in the slightest</li>
            <li> far I rate this item 4 stars...</li>
            <li> do wear it only at night, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting on my work clothing as much.</li>
            <li> It was developed by a dermatologist for his wife during</li>
            <li> Once they are there, they don&#x27;t go away - and while the appearance can be helped with Vitamin A or laser therapy, ladies know they don&#x27;t ever fade completely.  </li>
            <li> Not greasy, just soft to touch.  </li>
            <li> Not only is the oil moisturizing, but it also has the very calming scent of lavender.</li>
            <li> It comes in a spray bottle but it can be directed well-it doesn&#x27;t spray all wild.</li>
            <li> The oil itself feels soft and silky, which is always a plus for me...</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a very pleasing scent, with the obvious presence of lavender.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, the oil&#x27;s scent is not too overpowering to my sensitive nose.  </li>
            <li> The oil itself is smooth and does not leave a heavy or sticky residue on my hands.  </li>
            <li> I have gained about 10 pounds so far.  </li>
            <li> This one however is really soft and well formulated, providing the soothing effect that lavender should.</li>
            <li> I have no stretch marks so far and its been a treat using this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this because I wanted something to help minimize the stretch marks from the baby belly and was looking for something made with mostly natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> However, if I did that I would be surprised if this product lasted 1 month.</li>
            <li> I use after all showers, and so far no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It has kept my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I was starting to feel really irritated and moody</li>
            <li> I only used it after 8 months, when the absolute largest, yet still got no stretch marks, and my baby boy was over nine pounds.</li>
            <li> (Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil).</li>
            <li> So far (9 months of pregnancy)</li>
            <li> There are alternative oils that are priced at half the cost, so one really has to consider whether or not Belli Elasticity Belly Oil has enough special qualities to justify a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are alternative oils that are priced at half the cost, so one really has to consider whether or not Belli Elasticity Belly Oil has enough special qualities to justify a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> While I have to admit the smell of it is strong and definitely not my favorite, nor does it smell like lilacs, it works.</li>
            <li> I am not far enough along yet to have tested the upper limits of this product for stretch mark prevention, but so far its been a fantastic find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes its hard to find a pleasant lavender scent, some being too harsh or chemical smelling.</li>
            <li> Right after my baby was born I looked down on my tummy and was surprised that I had a bunch!</li>
            <li> /&gt;We tend to use several sprays from the bottle, and then go back for more as we go along; the oil is rich and while it IS oil, it doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;oily\\&quot; as other body creams we&#x27;ve tried in the past.  </li>
            <li> Now, 18 months after deliver, I can barely see the stretch mark and only if I&#x27;m really looking for it.  </li>
            <li> I do love the smell, and that says something since I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell of anything for my first trimester, but this is so expensive</li>
            <li> A benefit I hadn&#x27;t expected was that it kept my belly warm on windy days, which we have been having the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on using the Belli oil on my next pregnancy (Lord willing), and I will report back on the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I did break out in a small rash on the top of my belly.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my tummy since the first trimester, and I am now in my 9th month of pregnancy and see only a tiny stretch mark below my belly button.</li>
            <li> The oil left my skin very soft!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was because my skin has already been stretched or if the product is really working.</li>
            <li> it helped calm me down when I was rubbing it on my belly..</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;m actually curious to see if there are other fragrances out there for this product, but lavender is my wife&#x27;s favorite (and mine, too, actually)</li>
            <li> So the product probably will help to minimize new stretch marks some and will contribute to overall skin conditioning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> However my skin was still very itchy and dry as my belly grew.</li>
            <li> the size of a dime was enough to cover the whole belly, which means it will last longer.  </li>
            <li> From my experience, I have found that Belli Elasticity Belly Oil works wonders on dry elbows, and it could be very useful for other patches of skin that are prone to dryness.</li>
            <li> I am currently 31 weeks and so far NO STRETCH MARKS!</li>
            <li> I seriously had my doubts about being able to prevent stretchmarks on my belly during my pregnancy because all of the women in my family have them, but this product actually works!</li>
            <li> and we found it great as a lavender-scented massage oil for rubbing mom&#x27;s tired muscles when she&#x27;s through with your pregnancy and have a little left over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ll have to see how far the bottle goes using it daily on my hips, breasts and stomach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used 2 bottles so far since 2nd trimester</li>
            <li> So even if you &#x27;go organic&#x27; and use strictly &#x27;all natural&#x27; products during your pregnancy, you&#x27;re still likely to pass on toxins to your baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It soaks in fairly fast but still need to be careful with clothes.  </li>
            <li> in all a nice product, albeit a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> Scent is not outstanding, but not bad either.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely use this product again, and plan on gifting it to any new moms I meet in the future.</li>
            <li> This oil is heavily marketed toward pregnant woman since they have an obvious need to prevent stretch marks.</li>
            <li> But there are other oils that work the exact same way.</li>
            <li> Not a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> It has a subtle lavender scent that is not overpowering, especially since pregnancy puts my nose into hyperdrive and everything that smells too strongly makes me nauseous.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m almost 8 months pregnant now and only in the last few weeks have I noticed some stretch marks appear beneath my belly button.  </li>
            <li> Who knows if this product is why I don&#x27;t have more noticeable and dramatic stretch marks (so far mine are a clear color and limited to the hip area), but I have to believe it is helping keep my stretching skin moisturized, as it definitely feels like it.  </li>
            <li> and it certainly ranks as a highly useful oil treatment for anyone who anticipates excessive weight gain or other stretching of the skin in a short period of time.</li>
            <li> No parabens, no fragrance, no strange chemicals.</li>
            <li> She said it was smooth going on and made her stomach feel less \\&quot;stretchy\\&quot; and it seemed to itch less when she used it.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly into the skin, making it less greasy than other oils.  </li>
            <li> I typically apply the belly oil in our upstairs bathroom, both post-morning shower and pre-bedtime, but the gentle aroma seems to suspend reality and make me think of lavendar fields in southern France.  </li>
            <li> pretty well leaving very little oily residue, there is some</li>
            <li> So far, the only mark that can be seen is the incision for the C-Section she had to have, and honestly, I think even the incision scar is not as bad as I thought it was going to be at this point.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Belli Elasticity Belly Oil is promoted as a product designed for the special needs of pregnant women, but it can actually help anyone who would like some added protection against ugly stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My dislike of body oils does not mean this is a bad product and those who like body oils will likely be satisfied.</li>
            <li> also like that this product is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain preservatives or other suspected carcinogens.  </li>
            <li> My main reason for thinking this is because when I started getting stretch marks before I started using this product, the color of the stretch marks were very dark purple.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if it really is preventing stretch marks since developing stretch marks can result from genetic predisposition, amount of weight gain, etc.  </li>
            <li> this product doesn&#x27;t last long, but since it works I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> This clearly is not a scientific study, as nobody knows what would have happened with no oil/lotion applied, but it is simply my experience.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil not for use on my belly, but for my hands which tend to get very dry in the winter and lotion seems to work for only a short time.  </li>
            <li> Since using this product my new stretch marks are very faint and light.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very generous with the oil and use it at least twice a day as recommended, sometimes three</li>
            <li> Considering they went from a AAA to A in 3 weeks, I&#x27;m not surprised.     </li>
            <li> any other skin product, I am not sure the product will do too much to get rid of existing stretch marks,</li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a solid product.</li>
            <li> It is kinda expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I used it once, due to it being glass the residue of oil stayed and the next time I went to use it</li>
            <li> (and that goes for any other brand), so you are paying for the extra oils they put in like lavender oil, almond oil, etc.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long.  </li>
            <li> It does take a minute or two to dry on the skin itself, so just give yourself a minute before you put on clothes that are tighter against the skin in applied areas.  </li>
            <li> Let it dry before putting shirts on.</li>
            <li> I have not gotten a single one yet and the ones I had before seem to be softer.</li>
            <li> then I finished my pregnancy using mimosa champagne from eminence, I did not have 1 single stretch mark on my body.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since early October I believe, usually twice a day, and I have no stretch marks at 5.5 months.  </li>
            <li> this product makes older stretch marks that are already there, lighter, no redness or pink, and hardly noticeable at all.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product to other people!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a tad bit expensive for as quickly as you&#x27;ll go through it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not suprised that I got stretch marks, I&#x27;m just looking for something to help me keep my stretch marks under control as my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> Anyway I bought only one bottle because is expensive and in my case was consumed very fast compared to other oils, perhaps because it is thicker</li>
            <li> I tried a few different stretch mark prevention products when I was pregnant with my son and sadly none of them work.</li>
            <li> This stuff was pretty expensive but it goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This minimizes waste and helps the bottle to last longer.  </li>
            <li> so you need to be careful with your nicer clothing.</li>
            <li> well spent ladies.</li>
            <li> However, after one bottle (used in my 6 months of pregnancy) I come back to the oil less expensive and that I really like too</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the belli oil since week 8 or so (now at week 21) on chest, belly, hips, back, and thighs, and have gained very little weight (5 lbs).</li>
            <li> #34;What are you putting on your belly?!&amp;#34; I was confused until she said that she was surprised I did not have a single stretch mark.</li>
            <li> However, it smells nicer than other products and soothes irritated skin.</li>
            <li> used it starting 3rd month of pregnancy everyday at least once on my belly.</li>
            <li> If you lift weights or have any other reason to worry about the formation of stretch marks, then Belli Elasticity Belly Oil can help.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with coconut oil (rotated every other night)</li>
            <li> and I used it maybe once every other day.</li>
            <li> but it is very minimal.  </li>
            <li> only complaint</li>
            <li> all means, try this oil, even if you&#x27;re not pregnant...</li>
            <li> But I ended my pregnancy with no stretch marks, spending quite a bit less than a Belli user.</li>
            <li> It has a slight perfume scent</li>
            <li> I like Weleda&#x27;s belly oil, too, and it costs about half the price.</li>
            <li> August,2013....have to use it in half a year...</li>
            <li> I spray it in the cup of my hand over the sink because it splatters a little</li>
            <li> I will update this review after my little one arrives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The spray avoids mess and waste.</li>
            <li> I did use it on my breast/chest area during the 1st trimester, but it made my whole chest area break out like crazy, so i stopped using it there.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and night</li>
            <li> She ended up with quite a few stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> I do believe that this oil has prevented my stretch marks from being worse than what they currently are.  </li>
            <li> Still, this is a messy</li>
            <li> - I am now seven months along and use this stuff everyday.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for a few weeks and gives it a two thumbs up:    1.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately my belly looks like it has been clawed by a wild animal.</li>
            <li> and i use it almost everyday once a day</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stretch marks are an ugly, itchy reality for those who are pregnant and for others who partake in any type of activity that could result in excessive stretching of the skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stretch marks are an ugly, itchy reality for those who are pregnant and for others who partake in any type of activity that could result in excessive stretching of the skin.</li>
            <li> , She had less itchy skin and very few stretch marks.</li>
            <li> some of that is just plain luck).     </li>
            <li> I am a small framed girl at 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and my little boy was 8 pounds 4 oz at birth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price tag of this product might make your eyes bulge, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for minimizing or avoiding stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> so I was not able to use the Belli Oil.  </li>
            <li> Only con is that it is expensive...</li>
            <li> The smell is not overwhelming, but also not relaxing as some reviewers have noted.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am not impressed.  </li>
            <li> She still got stretch marks, and is not sure whether this product helped her get fewer than she would have gotten otherwise.  </li>
            <li> While the majority of women in my family had at least a few stretchmarks from pregnancy; I didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a belly oil from another company at the beginning of my pregnancy, but was never able to stomach the smell of it, so I went in search of another one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m not sure if it was the oil that helped or was</li>
            <li> Not sure it did anything to prevent stretch marks since they&#x27;re hereditary</li>
            <li> I get stretch marks usually but not when I use this.</li>
            <li> but i am just too lazy to follow the instruction.</li>
            <li> I discontinued for a few days to clear it up, but as soon as I started using it again, the rash returned.  :(</li>
            <li> The spray nozel delivers a hard blast of product that bounces off the hands and onto clothes.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to spray this oil.</li>
            <li> Of course, by that point it is often too late.</li>
            <li> I purchased at least 4 bottles during my pregnancy and used it every morning before getting dressed, and every night before bed.</li>
            <li> You just have to wait at least 10 minutes to put any clothes on after putting the oil on your belly, otherwise the oil will get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> my only complaint is the spray bottle makes it impossible to not get oil on my counter or on the tile when I spray on my belly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;First, the smell is rather unpleasant; it is reminiscent of reconstituted lemon juice.</li>
            <li> My wife used this liberally throughout her pregnancy and only got one, very faint stretch mark toward the end of her pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> It has also taken care of the waistline itchiness and flakiness that I sometimes get when the weather is too dry or cold</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m willing to bet that you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> as you know oil is difficult and nasty to clean when</li>
            <li> The spray bottle could be worse but it could be A LOT</li>
            <li> I hated the spray feature - if you spray it directly on your skin - some of it bounces off on everything you have</li>
            <li> This time I didn&#x27;t want to make it worse</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely addicted to the scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything truly prevents stretch marks, but who knows maybe it would&#x27;ve been worse without this product.</li>
            <li> The ones that did appear aren&#x27;t as bad as ones I&#x27;ve seen pictures of other women on the Internet.  </li>
            <li> I like the spray pump but wish it was not in a glass bottle since glass is not ideal for travel.  </li>
            <li> It is expensive</li>
            <li> I was unable to use the spray function and instead, I had to unscrew the cap and pour it on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this oil didn&#x27;t prevent stretch marks on my tummy.</li>
            <li> It was expensive though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very annoyed.</li>
            <li> still itching like crazy from growing.  </li>
            <li> My Mom and sis have really bad stretchmarks post pregnancy using cocoa butter.</li>
            <li> I was disappointed at this lack of concern for customer questions.  </li>
            <li> I bought two of these expensive bottles and started using the oil in my 4th month of pregnancy but still got the worst stretch marks.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Hubby bought this item for me twice. First time was just around the time I was starting to show, and the second time was when I accidentally broke the first bottle (can be slippery after a shower)and was left in tears. I love this stuff. It smells amazing (like crack for pregnant women) and just feels incredible. That being said, I do have stretch marks. I&#x27;m very generous with the oil and use it at least twice a day as recommended, sometimes three if I feel I need it or it washed off from swimming and the like. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a whole lot you can do for stretchmarks if your predisposed (all women on my mom&#x27;s side have them) but it&#x27;s a great product and I do feel it has kept mine in check. I would definitely use this product again, and plan on gifting it to any new moms I meet in the future.</li>
            <li> We received our bottle of Belli when my wife was just entering her eighth month of pregnancy.  We started using it on her tummy right away.  It was actually a nice little bonding thing between the two of us, so fellas, buy this for your pregnant wife!  :^)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frangrance we got was lavender - I&#x27;m actually curious to see if there are other fragrances out there for this product, but lavender is my wife&#x27;s favorite (and mine, too, actually) because it&#x27;s relaxing and we both think that there is something to this aromatherapy thing.  Lavender soothes headaches, and it&#x27;s just a pleasant fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tend to use several sprays from the bottle, and then go back for more as we go along; the oil is rich and while it IS oil, it doesn&#x27;t feel as \\&quot;oily\\&quot; as other body creams we&#x27;ve tried in the past.  This richness and the fragrance combined definitely build a nice, relaxing, intimate atmosphere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, that said, our son is now coming up on six weeks of age, and my wife still uses the BELLI oil, on a daily basis, to my knowledge.  So far, the only mark that can be seen is the incision for the C-Section she had to have, and honestly, I think even the incision scar is not as bad as I thought it was going to be at this point.  No stretch marks to date is wonderful, and if her c-section scar is minimized by the treatments of this oil, then that is just plain awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have also used the BELLI oil on shoulders for shoulder massages for stress, and the lavender is enjoyed by both of us.  It&#x27;s a great all-body oil and from the other reviews I&#x27;ve read, and from what I&#x27;ve seen first hand, this stuff is just terrific for the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By all means, try this oil, even if you&#x27;re not pregnant... but if you are, I think it&#x27;s a pretty nice excuse to have your significant other spend some really quality attention time with you and bond with the baby even before you&#x27;re introduced face-to-face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Belli Oil since the start of my pregnancy once a day till now, and i&#x27;m currently at 34 weeks. So far, fingers crossed, i don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. Either i&#x27;ve got good genetics, or this product works, or maybe both!    I did use it on my breast/chest area during the 1st trimester, but it made my whole chest area break out like crazy, so i stopped using it there. Other than that, it&#x27;s a solid product.</li>
            <li> In my opinion it&#x27;s a very good product. might be the best in the market.  I recommend it to everyone, i think it&#x27;s even more effective when you sart using it at the early stage of the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the lower ratings as far as the cost of the oil.  It is a bit pricey.  Also, stretch marks can&#x27;t really be prevented.  All that being said, this oil has all kinds of great moisturizers for your skin.  It definitely helps soothe some of the itching when your belly gets larger.  I also adore the scent.  I use it as aromatherapy at bedtime to help me sleep.  The lavender scent is very calming.  Even at the price, I won&#x27;t go a day without it during my pregnancy as it has become an evening ritual with my hubby and I to catch up over baby talk while he rubs my belly.  It&#x27;s definitely a comfort item for me.  I&#x27;ve also sent it as a gift to spoil my pregnant girlfriends.</li>
            <li> I started using this on my 2nd trimester just to prep my skin. I used it as directed 2x a day. It&#x27;s not greasy and it has a pleasant smell. Happy to say no stretchmarks after delivery. My Mom and sis have really bad stretchmarks post pregnancy using cocoa butter. I even had a big belly so this stuff really works.</li>
            <li> Am in my 7th month of pregnancy and have been using this oil since about month 4 or 5.  As stated earlier, it&#x27;s pricey but you do NOT go through it quickly, even when using twice a day as recommended.  My skin has not dried out in the slightest and I have had zero problems with itchiness, which is all thanks to my use of this product, I believe.  It does have a stronger smell, but it&#x27;s not off-putting.  It is a bit oily, but it OIL after all.  And I have found that the oiliness on my hands goes away instantly if I just rub excess oil elsewhere on my body after applying to my belly, chest, hips, etc. where my focus is.  It does take a minute or two to dry on the skin itself, so just give yourself a minute before you put on clothes that are tighter against the skin in applied areas.  All in all, very impressed so far and I would recommend.  Who knows if this product is why I don&#x27;t have more noticeable and dramatic stretch marks (so far mine are a clear color and limited to the hip area), but I have to believe it is helping keep my stretching skin moisturized, as it definitely feels like it.  Recommended, for sure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using in the a.m. and p.m. for several months and I really like the way it feels on my skin.  It stays on well for long-last moisturizing, but doesn&#x27;t stick to clothing or discolor in any way.   I spray it in the cup of my hand over the sink because it splatters a little and I don&#x27;t want to waste a bit of this great stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using Belli Elasticity Belly Oil since I was about 16 weeks along.  I didn&#x27;t start getting a noticeable belly until around 22 weeks.  I am currently 31 weeks and so far NO STRETCH MARKS! :)  I haven&#x27;t experienced any belly itching that I know some pregnant women complain of.  I have religiously used it on my belly, breasts, and hips in the evening, and then again in the mornings on just my belly.  The oil itself is very soothing to the skin and has a lovely smell that&#x27;s not too overwhelming.  I do try to give it some time to soak in before I put my clothes on; I usually try to do it first in my routine and by the time I&#x27;m done brushing my teeth, washing my face, etc. I&#x27;m usually good to go!&lt;br /&gt;So far I rate this item 4 stars...if I can make it to delivery and have no stretch marks, it will definitely get a 5 star rating.  I will update this review after my little one arrives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED to a five star rating.  I had one stretch mark that appeared around 38 or 39 weeks.  Now, 18 months after deliver, I can barely see the stretch mark and only if I&#x27;m really looking for it.  Even my husband had forgotten about it until I told him I was updating this review.  I will definitely be using Belli Elasticity Belly Oil when it&#x27;s time for #2 :)</li>
            <li> I ordered this at the beginning of my pregnancy and used it fairly religiously at night. While I have to admit the smell of it is strong and definitely not my favorite, nor does it smell like lilacs, it works. I am entering my eighth month and have yet to get a stretch mark. Just wanted to share for anyone considering the purchase...it worked for me!</li>
            <li> I liked using this a lot when I was pregnant - it&#x27;s not too greasy, and seemed (I think) to help with the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> bottle breaks easy and shatters into a million sharp jagged pieces.</li>
            <li> I know I love the product pictured, because I have used it before.  However, the seller sent me a cheaper version of this product in different packaging and with slightly different ingredients...not even the same number of fluid ounces as advertised.  I&#x27;m very annoyed.</li>
            <li> Think almond oil and other more natural products work better for moisture.</li>
            <li> My wife just got through her third pregnancy where we used this oil occasionally. I like that it has a spritzer top to efficiently apply the oil. It seems to moisturize skin well, though we weren&#x27;t disciplined enough to use it regularly. As a result, we have a lot left over and we found it great as a lavender-scented massage oil for rubbing mom&#x27;s tired muscles when she&#x27;s through with your pregnancy and have a little left over!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended overall.</li>
            <li> I seriously had my doubts about being able to prevent stretchmarks on my belly during my pregnancy because all of the women in my family have them, but this product actually works! I use it everyday and night and whenever I feel itchy. I have not gotten a single one yet and the ones I had before seem to be softer. It is kinda expensive, but worth it!</li>
            <li> I do love the smell, and that says something since I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the smell of anything for my first trimester, but this is so expensive and I&#x27;m only 19 weeks so I will have to come back and update this review later to see how it works. Someone recommended I use Almond oil to avoid stretchmarks and then I received this bottle as a gift, and discovered that Almond oil was one of the main ingredients. So far I like it, but I&#x27;m not 100% sure that it rubs in as easily or as quickly as others have said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wear it only at night, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting on my work clothing as much. And while some complain about the spray, I happen to love it and thinks it makes it really easy to apply. I haven&#x27;t been using it for very long so I&#x27;ll have to see how far the bottle goes using it daily on my hips, breasts and stomach. The price tag is steep and I&#x27;ve been happy with my burts bees Mama bee balm which was only $9.99, so if it goes quick, I might not buy another bottle. You can be sure it&#x27;ll be on my wish list because if someone else wanted to buy it for me, it would make a great present, just too steep for my budget! If it does prevent stretchmarks, then I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth every penny and the price on Amazon is great.</li>
            <li> I am pregnant and began using this oil to prevent new stretch marks.  It had the unintended side effect to improve the appearance of the stretch marks that I already have!  I thought it was all in my head but my husband commented that it was definitely making my existing stretch marks look better! I believe it is the Vitamin A that helps improve the appearance of existing stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the oil itself - I was happy to see it absorbs into the skin and does not leave you feeling greasy.  The spray bottle makes it easy to apply where needed without using too much.  This minimizes waste and helps the bottle to last longer.  The oil has a lavender scent.  The ingredients are all not only all-natural, but all ingredients have been studied and will NOT go through the placenta to your baby.  It was developed by a dermatologist for his wife during pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price tag of this product might make your eyes bulge, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for minimizing or avoiding stretch marks.  Once they are there, they don&#x27;t go away - and while the appearance can be helped with Vitamin A or laser therapy, ladies know they don&#x27;t ever fade completely.  So prevention is the key!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use the BELLI Elasticity oil throughout the rest of my pregnancy to leave my skin feeling smooth, not itchy and hopefully free of new stretch marks!</li>
            <li> Much like every other item available which promises to prevent or decrease stretch marks, this product does not actually prevent stretch marks during pregnancy.  However, it smells nicer than other products and soothes irritated skin.</li>
            <li> When I received the Belli Oil, I was surprised on how much Belli oil you actually get.  I thought this was a good value for the money.  Then I thought, if they give you so much oil, then it must have some weird-do ingredients that I couldn&#x27;t pronounce.  To my surprise I could read and understand all the ingredients in this product.  I am very conscious of what I put on my skin and how it could affect the baby.&lt;br /&gt;The oil is light but highly moisturizing oil that claims to reduce the incidence of stretch marks during pregnancy. I&#x27;m currently at 19 weeks and remain stretch mark free so far.  I&#x27;ve only been using the Belli Oil for about 6 weeks and I have no stretch marks and no itchy belly that I read so much about!  During my 1st Trimester I could not stand the smell of anything so I was not able to use the Belli Oil.  The oil is easy to apply and so far has been effective. Scent is not outstanding, but not bad either.  I am NOT a fan of the spray bottle.  The spray bottle could be worse but it could be A LOT better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than the spray bottle, I have no complaints.  GREAT PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> This seller&#x27;s S&amp;H was great.  I give the company \\&quot;5 stars\\&quot; and would do business with them anytime!      As for the product, I love it...for the most part &#x3D;o)  It&#x27;s just a tad bit expensive for as quickly as you&#x27;ll go through it.  The lavender smell is just what the doctor ordered, but the relief I got isn&#x27;t as good as I would&#x27;ve like it to be--still itching like crazy from growing.  The spray bottle is kind of a waste, they should make it more of a pump bottle, because it splats everywhere!  So, best method is to spray in hand and then rub on belly and thighs in circular motions.     I can&#x27;t confirm that it&#x27;s reducing stretch marks as of yet, but I&#x27;m sure it is to a degree (being that it&#x27;s all natural). I&#x27;m going to try Emu Oil, since it worked miracles with my face, and see if it does the trick.</li>
            <li> First off i love the scent and feel of this oil. It also absorbs quickly. I hated the spray feature - if you spray it directly on your skin - some of it bounces off on everything you have around.&lt;br /&gt;I used it starting 3rd month of pregnancy everyday at least once on my belly. I had stretchmarks before on my thighs an breasts, so i knew i should try something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well i still got lots of stretchmarks. so save your money and get some cheap baby oil if you must... but if you are prone to stretchmarks - forget it! nothing will work - do your Kegels instead :)</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000V1BDIG BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil, 4 oz]] was probably one of the best moisturizers/oil I have tried for stretch marks.  It has a subtle lavender scent that is not overpowering, especially since pregnancy puts my nose into hyperdrive and everything that smells too strongly makes me nauseous.  I was afraid it would be too oily and will leave rounded oily blotches on my clothes, but I was delighted that, because it was absorbed easily into the skin, it didn&#x27;t leave any oily residue at all.  Just a drop the size of a dime was enough to cover the whole belly, which means it will last longer.  It has also taken care of the waistline itchiness and flakiness that I sometimes get when the weather is too dry or cold (as it has been the last 2 months).  I found that it is best applied after taking a bath because it made the moisturizing effect last longer (as opposed to applying it on a dry belly). A benefit I hadn&#x27;t expected was that it kept my belly warm on windy days, which we have been having the past couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> The fragrance of lavendar is quite lovely, though perhaps a bit strong.  The oil is...well, a bit oily.  It absorbed into my skin pretty well, but did leave that shiny look that made me worry about whether it would leave an oil-stain on my clothes.</li>
            <li> Every pregnant woman should get one of these, this smells so good, and feels so smooth. My wife used it throughout the pragnancy and find it very effective. She strictly followed the \\&quot;massage my belly\\&quot; regiman, She had less itchy skin and very few stretch marks. My wife loves this oil, even after 5 months post partum she is using it as body massage oil.</li>
            <li> First of all I was surprised by how big the bottle is. Sometimes with these types of specialty products you pay a lot and then get a teeny amount. Not so. This bottle should def. last thru the pregnancy and post-partum but I guess if you use it several times a day you may need a second one.  I also am very conscientious about using green products while pregnant. No parabens, no fragrance, no strange chemicals. This product has none of those ingredients and the doctor who invented it seems to have gone out of his way to make sure everything in the bottle is safe to use. The oil has a light lavender scent. It is also comes in an easy to use squirt bottle. The oil left my skin very soft! It was nice. Not greasy, just soft to touch.  I have to say that this is my second pregnancy and I only had temporary stretch marks with my first pregnancy. Right after my baby was born I looked down on my tummy and was surprised that I had a bunch! And on my breasts.  So I think maybe I should have used something like this and they would have gone away faster (I think genetics plays a lot in if they stay or go). So hopefully with this pregnancy I won&#x27;t get them at all. Anyway, I think for anyone who is pregnant who wants to try and prevent stretch marks or any other lines post pregnancy, this is def. a product to use. It is safe, there are simple ingredients, and it leaves your skins very smooth and soft. Yay!</li>
            <li> I love the way this oil smells, and it makes skin feel super soft. The lavender and almond oil does truly have a great scent &amp; relaxing effect. A little bit goes a long way. Two bottles will likely last for the pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought a bottle of Belli Elasticity Belly Oil for my sister-in-law, who loved it, and used it throughout her pregnancy. She ended up with quite a few stretchmarks. I used Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter, which did not have as good of a scent, nor did it feel as good on my skin as a sample of Belli. But I ended my pregnancy with no stretch marks, spending quite a bit less than a Belli user. This clearly is not a scientific study, as nobody knows what would have happened with no oil/lotion applied, but it is simply my experience. I&#x27;m planning on using the Belli oil on my next pregnancy (Lord willing), and I will report back on the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the pregnant woman who wants to pamper her Belly, Belli is an excellent, albeit expensive and not 100% effective, choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Guest review by Kiki Hantla)</li>
            <li> this smells really good.  i love the scent of lavender that pervades the house when this is applied.    i can&#x27;t say if it really works, as that will take many more months to see.  but for now, it&#x27;s a bit of piece of mind.</li>
            <li> This absolutely helped.  I started to get stretch marks while using another product and this not only helped reduce the development of more stretchmarks, but reduced the redness of the ones I had!  Great product!!</li>
            <li> This stuff was pretty expensive but it goes a long way. Just a little spritz will cover a good portion of my belly even at 36 weeks pregnant. The smell is very strong and perfume-y but I didn&#x27;t mind it. It moisturizes very well.</li>
            <li> The scent of this may be my favorite thing...but it seems to really be a great product.     I have used this oil since midway through my pregnancy and now am just about three weeks from delivery and have yet to see a stretch mark (some of that is genetics, of course, and some of that is just plain luck).     As I&#x27;ve gotten nearer to the end of the pregnancy and getting to sleep at night has become more and more difficult, I find myself using this oil as almost like a Vicks Vapo Rub, except that smells excellent and is an aromatherapy thing.     This was definitely worth the investment and I have used it on my belly and breasts to prevent stretch marks with great success with just a few more weeks to go.     I&#x27;d buy it - I probably will buy more even to use after pregnancy. I&#x27;d rather use this than that Bio-Oil I see commercials for these days.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Love the smell. Love the quality. Love the packaging. Love not having one stretch marks after a 10-lb baby. What more is there to say about this product. Does the job!</li>
            <li> I was very happy with the BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil because it is a great moisturizer for my skin. The main use for this oil is to prevent stretchmarks caused by pregnancy. I am not pregnant, but I did try it out and liked it. The oil is extremely moisturizing and is absorbed fairly quickly into the skin. Not only is the oil moisturizing, but it also has the very calming scent of lavender. I can&#x27;t say for sure that this oil will definitely prevent stretchmarks, but if you&#x27;re looking for a lightly scented moisturizing oil, this is for you!</li>
            <li> This oil has a very nice texture.  It absorbs very nicely but is still an oil so you need to be careful with your nicer clothing. It comes in a spray bottle but it can be directed well-it doesn&#x27;t spray all wild. The sent is very relaxing and very lavender. Probably the nicest oil i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil not for use on my belly, but for my hands which tend to get very dry in the winter and lotion seems to work for only a short time.  I put one pump of the oil in my palm and massage it into my hands.  Considering it is an oil, it absrobs pretty well leaving very little oily residue, there is some but it is very minimal.  It smells amazing and I even massage it into my cuticles and they have become supple again.  I really like this oil and keep in on my desk at work.  It would make a nice massage oil also.</li>
            <li> I do enjoy the scent and feel of the oil on my growing belly.  I am aware that stretch marks are more genetic than previously thought so you either are going to have them or not.  I do believe, however, that &amp;#34;tending&amp;#34; to skin that is being manipulated and stretched could always use a good moisturizing treatment.  I use lotion as well but I do love this oil and it does seem to soak in faster.  Smells good and my skin is soft.  I would recommend  this product.</li>
            <li> As a nursing mother, I was thrilled to try this product...because we all know the stomach is not the only place a mother gets stretch marks. I think the idea is great, and of course the ingredients used are wonderful for pampering the skin, but I have two complaints that detract from the success of this product.&lt;br /&gt;First, the smell is rather unpleasant; it is reminiscent of reconstituted lemon juice. In other words, it has a very tangy scent that begins to grate on the nerves after a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Second, and more importantly, this product is treacherous for the clothes! The spray nozel delivers a hard blast of product that bounces off the hands and onto clothes. Being that this is a very oily product, your great skin might come at the cost of ruined clothing.&lt;br /&gt;This is a product that you must rub in very well in order to safeguard clothing, and furthermore, be sure to wash your hands well immediately after.&lt;br /&gt;While I think extended use of this product would likely deliver on its promise to prevent/reduce stretch marks, I think the scent and overly oily nature of it are unattractive \\&quot;side effects.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Stretch marks are a problem for many different people and most people wait until they have stretch marks to do something about them. Of course, by that point it is often too late. The stretch marks may itch and they may leave a permanent mark on the skin that no over- the- counter treatment can ever correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prevention is the key with stretch marks and one product designed to stop stretch marks before they start is Belli Elasticity Belly Oil. This product is specially formulated to help the skin stretch more readily and thus prevent or reduce the formation of stretch marks. This oil is heavily marketed toward pregnant woman since they have an obvious need to prevent stretch marks. With greater elasticity in the skin, it is therefore able to stretch more easily, thereby reducing the instance of stretch marks in pregnant women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have any immediate plans to get pregnant but I have found there are still uses for this oil. This body oil super- moisturizes the skin and this fact alone could make it a worthwhile alternative to ordinary body oils. From my experience, I have found that Belli Elasticity Belly Oil works wonders on dry elbows, and it could be very useful for other patches of skin that are prone to dryness. It leaves the skin feeling soft, clean, and moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belli Elasticity Belly Oil is promoted as a product designed for the special needs of pregnant women, but it can actually help anyone who would like some added protection against ugly stretch marks. If you lift weights or have any other reason to worry about the formation of stretch marks, then Belli Elasticity Belly Oil can help. Pregnant women have the greatest need and represent the largest market for this type of product, but it can be used by anyone who worries about stretch marks and, as mentioned above, by anyone who would like a little therapy for their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Belli Elasticity Belly Oil does seem to have many great things to offer. It does moisturize the skin very nicely and it does eliminate dryness, as well as preventing the formation of stretch marks. But there is one fact that could cause many potential customers to change their minds: The high price. Belli Elasticity Belly Oil carries a price that will place it out of reach for many and even those who can afford it could find the cost unacceptable. There are alternative oils that are priced at half the cost, so one really has to consider whether or not Belli Elasticity Belly Oil has enough special qualities to justify a purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stretch marks are an ugly, itchy reality for those who are pregnant and for others who partake in any type of activity that could result in excessive stretching of the skin. Belli Elasticity Belly Oil won&#x27;t eliminate exisiting stretch marks, but it will control the ones that could appear in the future and it effectively moisturizes the skin to eliminate dryness. If you can get past the price, you could find many things to like about this product and it certainly ranks as a highly useful oil treatment for anyone who anticipates excessive weight gain or other stretching of the skin in a short period of time.rize the skin very nicely and it does eliminate dryness, as well as preventing the formation of stretch marks.

            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how wonderful this BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil is! Before I got to try this product, I thought, \\&quot;Oh sure, ANOTHER beauty product that promises the world and will not come through\\&quot;...and then I saw the price. So I started with two cons.  I can&#x27;t tell you how quickly they became PROS!  I LOVE this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, the scent. Lavender! One of my absolute favorites and a definite favorite of many of my friends and family members.  Well, let me start by talking about the \\&quot;Strech Mark\\&quot; and if it really does keep it away.  OK, a friend of mine just gave birth to twins and her OB/GYN told her to try a cream/oil whatever her choice was to keep the elasticity in her skin.  Growing at a rather fast pace, she used this oil her last three months and NOT ONE MARK to show for two beautiful little ones on this earth!  Amazing! Well, to me anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the surprise...this product makes older stretch marks that are already there, lighter, no redness or pink, and hardly noticeable at all. You would have to be VERY close to see any!  The oil itself feels soft and silky, which is always a plus for me...any product that makes you feel sexy or sensual after a long hot bath couldn&#x27;t be better! Not to mention that lavender naturally relaxes you and could get you ready for a better more comfortable night&#x27;s sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, as you can see, I love the product!  Though some may think it&#x27;s pricey, I think it&#x27;s worth every penny!  Try it for yourself.  I&#x27;m willing to bet that you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I am 6 months pregnant and have been using this for 3 months.  No stretch marks yet and better yet, no itchiness that I had from my last pregnancy.  It smells so good. More like vanilla almond to me.  I use it on my boob, butt and saddlebags.  Keeps them nourished without feeling greasy.  I plan on using this after my pregnancy as well.  It is expensive but I have been using it for 3 months and have only used about 1/4 of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I tried a few different stretch mark prevention products when I was pregnant with my son and sadly none of them work. I ended up with lots of stretch marks anyway! I had heard that continuing to use the products after delivery would help to lessen the appearance of the stretch marks but this wasn&#x27;t so for me. I decided to pick this up in hopes it may help, but again, it did not. I&#x27;ve heard a product called Mederma has some success on lessening the appearance of stretch marks (it&#x27;s made for reducing the appearance of scars) and I will try that next.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for preventing stretch marks, so far I don&#x27;t have any new ones and I will update after delivery. I don&#x27;t know if this was because my skin has already been stretched or if the product is really working. I guess there is no way to know for certain as some women can use no product and have no stretch marks at all. It&#x27;s all in the genes, baby!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, for the price, you&#x27;d be wise to assume it&#x27;s just going to be a really nice, high quality body oil that smells great and really helps you to feel tranquil and at peace. It&#x27;s awesome before a meditation or yoga session or after a long, hot soak in the tub. If it works on stretch marks also, it&#x27;s just a bonus. ;)</li>
            <li> My wife used this liberally throughout her pregnancy and only got one, very faint stretch mark toward the end of her pregnancy.  Great product! For reference, her entire family of women have all had stretch marks on their stomachs from pregnancy. She was so positive she was going to get them. She only applied the oil to her stomach and hip area, and it is the only area she didn&#x27;t get stretch marks. Also, she did say she appl I ed this several times a day, not just as directed. She loved the smell as well.</li>
            <li> I have been rubbing this (lavender &amp; sweet almond oil &amp; other plant extracts) on a scar from knee surgery and although it&#x27;s too soon to tell whether it will have an effect, I had to write now just to say how divinely it smells and how luxurious it feels to rub it onto my scar.  It&#x27;s a sensually pleasurable experience.  Not every pregnant woman ends up with stretch marks but any mother to be would feel very pampered and wonderful rubbing this oil onto her belly, and if it should prevent stretch marks too, so much the better.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice skin product.  Many of the ingredients are conducive to skin conditioning and repair. Belli contains several kinds of oils: Vitamin E, Almond oil, Grape Seed oil, and Safflower Seed oil.  It also contains Lavender, Cocoa Seed Butter and Collagen Hydrolysates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a very pleasing scent, with the obvious presence of lavender.  It is not overpowering but pleasant and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;Belli does adhere to teratology screening for their products, including this one, so pregnant women can feel assured that the ingredients are safe in general.  There are also no man-made dyes in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any other skin product, I am not sure the product will do too much to get rid of existing stretch marks, however the Vitamin E  and Collagen Hydrolysates are known to help skin elasticity and firmness.  So the product probably will help to minimize new stretch marks some and will contribute to overall skin conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is pricey, but the ingredients are all natural and/or high quality.  Those seeking to minimize the effects of stretch marks might be able to get the same benefit by applying Vitamin E oil.  Belli does have a wonderful scent that plain Vitamin E does not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all a nice product, albeit a bit expensive.</li>
            <li> This belly oil has been my morning and evening ritual of sensory escape to a calm and relaxing place.  I typically apply the belly oil in our upstairs bathroom, both post-morning shower and pre-bedtime, but the gentle aroma seems to suspend reality and make me think of lavendar fields in southern France.  I feel peaceful.  Thankfully, the oil&#x27;s scent is not too overpowering to my sensitive nose.  The oil itself is smooth and does not leave a heavy or sticky residue on my hands.  My husband actually found this belly oil for me as we embarked on our second pregnancy, as a special treat.  He gets bonus points for this; it has turned out to be a favorite ritual of mine.</li>
            <li> Bought this for the smell but it actually worked great. I used this in conjunction with coconut oil (rotated every other night) and I didn&#x27;t get any marks on my belly. It&#x27;s great to put on a bedtime, the smell is very relaxing if you enjoy lavender.</li>
            <li> Not too greasy feel when you apply it to the body.  It is not very thick as it dispenses in a spray bottle.  Good in a way that you don&#x27;t have to scramble for the cap  to close it every time (as you know oil is difficult and nasty to clean when spilled).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice and subtle.  Wife&#x27;s stretch marks had improvements but did not disappear.  It is probably best during pregnancy and not after stretchmarks are already there.  It is also a good oil for massages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Expensive, I consider a good price for a 4 oz for this type of oil to be under 15 bucks.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and haven&#x27;t seen a stretch mark yet. It smells really good and a little goes a long way. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that I did break out in a small rash on the top of my belly. I have super sensitive skin and I think the oiliness was making me break out, but after using it for about a month, the rash did go away. I will update this post after the baby is born to give a more accurate testimony to the product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product at one month of pregnancy because I was already developing stretch marks.  I am now 5 months pregnant and I have gained more stretch marks.  I have gained about 10 pounds so far.  I do believe that this oil has prevented my stretch marks from being worse than what they currently are.  My main reason for thinking this is because when I started getting stretch marks before I started using this product, the color of the stretch marks were very dark purple.  Since using this product my new stretch marks are very faint and light.  I&#x27;m not suprised that I got stretch marks, I&#x27;m just looking for something to help me keep my stretch marks under control as my skin is very dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Belli Elasticity oil since my first trimester and so far no stretch marks, at 25 weeks and counting!  It smells great- just let it soak in before getting dressed!</li>
            <li> Have used this product with both pregnancies and it works great with no stretch marks so far.  Most importantly it has a mild smell and is safe for baby. Only con is that it is expensive...</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like this oil.  The smell is not overwhelming, but also not relaxing as some reviewers have noted.  I ordered this oil in June and it&#x27;s experation date was in August.  Even though I can still use the product, I don&#x27;t like buying something that has such a short expiration date.  Overall, I am not impressed.  I much prefer the  cream from Palmer&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure stretch marks are based on your genetics, so I don&#x27;t know if you can prevent them. I was lucky and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks on my belly. However my skin was still very itchy and dry as my belly grew. This stuff worked better than lotion and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy. It was soothing to my skin and smelled great too!</li>
            <li> Smear yourself with this lotion and feel like a salad!  BELLI Elasticity Belly Oil looks like a bottle of a olive oil.  The bottle is designed so you can spray the oil on, but my bottle was defective.  I was unable to use the spray function and instead, I had to unscrew the cap and pour it on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually recommend applying it by hand since this oil permanently stains cotton clothing.  I accidentally got some of this oil on my shirt and it stained my shirt.  I tried getting the stain out, but I had no luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil itself actually did seem to reduce the appearance of stretch marks and left my skin feeling nice.  Still, this is a messy product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I wrote to BELLI to enquire as to whether this product was tested on animals and never received a response.  I was disappointed at this lack of concern for customer questions.  I researched this topic on the internet and it appears that BELLI products are NOT tested on animals.  However, the label of the belly oil does not indicate whether it has been tested on animals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not quite sure how to rate this item.  It is what it claims to be - a stretch mark reducing oil.  This was my first time trying a body oil though and found I did not like it.  My dislike of body oils does not mean this is a bad product and those who like body oils will likely be satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am going to come back and update this review after I give birth to my second daughter, so I can tell you how well it worked. It&#x27;s a bit oily, which may be good for it working but makes it more difficult to want to put on. It has a slight perfume scent and I wish it did not but it&#x27;s pleasant enough. The question is, does it work? Will update in a month months!</li>
            <li> I am not far enough along yet to have tested the upper limits of this product for stretch mark prevention, but so far its been a fantastic find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes its hard to find a pleasant lavender scent, some being too harsh or chemical smelling. This one however is really soft and well formulated, providing the soothing effect that lavender should. The oil comes in a lovely glass bottle with a useful spray top and absorbs quickly. To me it feels like something from a fine boutique - its really lovely and far nicer than something I&#x27;d expect to find on a drugstore shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - I am now seven months along and use this stuff everyday. I love it so much. It smells soft, natural and just plain nice. The oil absorbs after about 10 minutes or so. I have no stretch marks so far and its been a treat using this product. I find that it also mixes well with regular lotion if you feel like using both for extra protection.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks during my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> This is a must if you are expecting.  My first baby I had a whole tummy full of stretch marks, my second baby I used this oil and got not one!</li>
            <li> Bought this because I wanted something to help minimize the stretch marks from the baby belly and was looking for something made with mostly natural ingredients.  I started using it from about 2 1/2 to 3 months pregnant and it&#x27;s helped with keeping the stretch marks away.  I&#x27;m almost 8 months pregnant now and only in the last few weeks have I noticed some stretch marks appear beneath my belly button.  The ones that did appear aren&#x27;t as bad as ones I&#x27;ve seen pictures of other women on the Internet.  I would recommend it to other pregnant women.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks and the smell is nice.  Dries quickly so it doesn&#x27;t get on my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all my friends.</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this product for a few weeks and gives it a two thumbs up:    1. smell - pregnant women often have a heightened sense of smell. this product&#x27;s fragrance hasn&#x27;t turned my wife off  2. stickiness - it&#x27;s appropriately viscous without leaving that heavy cream after-feel  3. consistency - it&#x27;s smooth</li>
            <li> Not a single stretch mark. I started using it around my 4th month of pregnancy up to my delivery. A wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I had a co-worker of mine who was pregnant use this product.  She said it was smooth going on and made her stomach feel less \\&quot;stretchy\\&quot; and it seemed to itch less when she used it.  She still got stretch marks, and is not sure whether this product helped her get fewer than she would have gotten otherwise.  She said it was kind of sticky, so she used it when she was staying home so it wouldn&#x27;t stick to her clothes.  Based on her recommendations, I gave it three stars.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t wait to write this review because I am so excited that I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks. I&#x27;ve gained 40 pounds, I was 110 prepregnancy and my mom has tons of stretch marks. I also have stretch marks on my breasts from when I was young, so I thought I was doomed to get pregnancy stretch marks, but I haven&#x27;t gotten one, knock on wood! I will update if I get stretch marks, but I am scheduled to be induced in 4 days! Anyway I credit Belli for my lack of stretch marks!!!!! :D I am so grateful and blessed! Thanks Belli!</li>
            <li> I used it once, due to it being glass the residue of oil stayed and the next time I went to use it it slipped out of my hand and broke. Do not recommend. Stick to bio oil, it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> I used it for 7 months and It helped with the dryness, but didn&#x27;t prevent the stretch marks!</li>
            <li> This is a nice oil. Was it worth over $30? In my opinion, no. It smells pleasantly like lavender and is nice to rub on my pregnant belly! I would probably not make this purchase again, however, because it was no different than diluted lavender essential oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32 weeks pregnant. I&#x27;ve been using this product since I was about 10 weeks. In the beginning I only used it once a day. Now I use it twice a day. Happy to say no stretch marks yet :-)</li>
            <li> Love, love, love this! I started using this almost right away, and at 8+ months pregnant, I do not have any stretch marks so far. I use it on my hips, booty and bump. It&#x27;s a bit expensive, but a little goes a long way and it&#x27;s totally worth it, and the smell is divine. It feels good to spoil myself with this everyday!</li>
            <li> I have really liked using this oil- pleasant smell, makes my skin feel good, doesn&#x27;t seem to stain clothing or towels.  I started using it daily at about 14weeks, I&#x27;m now 26weeks, no stretch marks (yet?) and this is my first pregnancy.  Not sure if it really is preventing stretch marks since developing stretch marks can result from genetic predisposition, amount of weight gain, etc.  But I really have enjoyed using this product and prefer using it over BioOil which I originally used.  I like the spray pump but wish it was not in a glass bottle since glass is not ideal for travel.  I gave it four stars because I feel the price could be lower.  Overall, very pleased and would purchase again (so far I still have more than half of the bottle left and I use a generous amount daily- 10-15pumps/sprays).</li>
            <li> The Lavendar scent Smells great! Love that it&#x27;s all natural ingredients, definitely worth giving it a try! I recommend it</li>
            <li> helped Keep my wife&#x27;s belly stetchmark free throughout duration of pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t write reviews. So, by writing this.. you should know how strongly I feel that this is a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;I researched stretch mark prevention for days and days when I first started to \\&quot;show\\&quot; during pregnancy. I read where stretchmarks cannot be prevented and that most often it is heredity that will determine if you get them. I disagree. While the majority of women in my family had at least a few stretchmarks from pregnancy; I didn&#x27;t. And, trust me.. I was HUGE. I am a small framed girl at 5&#x27;2\\&quot; and my little boy was 8 pounds 4 oz at birth. I purchased at least 4 bottles during my pregnancy and used it every morning before getting dressed, and every night before bed. Yes, it is a strong lavender scent. But, not offensive. My only recommendation is to buy locally rather than spend the money on shipping. I have recently learned that ULTA carries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend the money to prevent them, then you&#x27;ll spend the money after trying to correct the ones you got. It&#x27;s money well spent ladies. -V</li>
            <li> I had stretchmarks below my belly button with my first child 7 years ago. Back then I only used palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter and stretch marks run in my family. This time I didn&#x27;t want to make it worse so I did some research and came up with Belli Oil. I&#x27;ve used 2 bottles so far since 2nd trimester and I&#x27;m now 38weeks pregnant... and I&#x27;m so glad to say that there are NO NEW STRETCH MARKS on my belly so far. But then I noticed some red marks on my thighs now but I only used it on my belly so it&#x27;s my fault. Now I know it works and I would recommend it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> The product smells pretty good if you like lavender. My husband liked the scent anyway.&lt;br /&gt;And it wasn&#x27;t too greasy or anything, so I liked that.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about this delivery was that Amazon sent me one that expires June 2012. I hope they check expiration dates before they send items.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it all pretty soon since it will cover extensive areas, but I did not want to get an old item.&lt;br /&gt;Please check expiration dates. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I can not stand the smell of coco butter products, so this was the perfect solution for me. It has a great sent that is not overwhelming.  It is an oil, but did not leave me feeling greasy. I am 6 months pregnant and so far no strech marks :)</li>
            <li> Smells good, but does not really do anything for stretch marks. Can use as a greasy moisturizer on elbows and feet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the belli oil since week 8 or so (now at week 21) on chest, belly, hips, back, and thighs, and have gained very little weight (5 lbs). 2 weeks ago I noticed stretchmarks forming on my chest. Considering they went from a AAA to A in 3 weeks, I&#x27;m not surprised.     There is no fool-proof method of avoiding stretchmarks, but this belly oil smells wonderful and does a great job of moisturizing. I don&#x27;t mind the stretchmarks, I&#x27;m just happy that my skin is soft and itch-free. I like Weleda&#x27;s belly oil, too, and it costs about half the price.</li>
            <li> I like the idea of this product, and it was recommended by a friend.  I tried it and within 2 days I had a rash everywhere it was rubbed.  I discontinued for a few days to clear it up, but as soon as I started using it again, the rash returned.  :(</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to scents, especially now that I&#x27;m pregnant. This body oil has a pleasant lavender scent that I find soothing and not at all offensive. The oil absorbs well and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue.</li>
            <li> This oil works great. I have been using it on my tummy since the first trimester, and I am now in my 9th month of pregnancy and see only a tiny stretch mark below my belly button. (and I think that is because I ran out of this stuff anyway so I wasn&#x27;t using it as often as I should). They recommend that you use this on a lot of places on your body and twice daily. However, if I did that I would be surprised if this product lasted 1 month. And paying for this every month was not something I wanted to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So in my case I only used it on my belly and I used it maybe once every other day. And it worked wonderfully. Now that I have run out of Belly&#x27;s oil, I have bought Bio Oil instead (which works the same, only difference is the smell, its cheaper, and also reduces the appearance of stretch marks). The reason Belly&#x27;s oil works so well because of the oils it has that helps the skin to expand and stretch without putting stress on your body and thereby causing stretch marks. But there are other oils that work the exact same way. For example Bio Oil, and Vitamin E Oil. The only reason Belly&#x27;s brand of oil is more expensive is because it has a better fragrance (and that goes for any other brand), so you are paying for the extra oils they put in like lavender oil, almond oil, etc.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using this product very long.  It seems to be working okay so far (no stretch marks yet), but the smell is quite overwhelming.  You should definitely like Lavender if you are going to order this product.</li>
            <li> As a first time mom, I have tried many different belly oils, from all different range in prices. This is by far my favorite. Has a great smell, and absorbs quickly. Great moisture that lasts most of the day, although I apply this morning and night, because I love it so much. One bottle lasted me about 3 months, even with using it multiple times a day. I used this on ALL growing parts of my body! Boobs, belly, hips all reaped the benefits of this product! Highly recommend. My first bottle was given to me by a friend, and I love it so much, I now buy it for any of my pregnant friends to try.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells way better than coco butter oil (if you like lavendar)  I love this stuff!!  It is normally $40</li>
            <li> Started using it while pregnant from 5 months till delivery.  Great results, no stretch marks at all!  Will definitely use again, and recommend to people.  And by the way, the entire bottle lasted me for 5 months and I still have some left.  So, one bottle per pregnancy is enough in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Used this throughout my entire first pregnancy and it was great! I started using it before I was ever showing at bedtime and never wound up with stretch marks. Obviously we all know other factors contribute like not gaining weight too quickly, but now that I&#x27;m pregnant with my second I&#x27;m going to be using it again since it all worked out well the first time around. I even wound up using it on my chest when my skin started itching from stretching and once I started using it there I never had itching again.</li>
            <li> It is a known fact, and every doctor and mother will tell you that you cannot do anything to prevent stretch marks if your body and skin type are prone to them, but we still fall for all the advertised products in the hope of preventing them! I bought two of these expensive bottles and started using the oil in my 4th month of pregnancy but still got the worst stretch marks.  On a positive note, I liked the oil for general moisturising after bath. It smells really nice and feels good on the skin, especially in the winter months.</li>
            <li> I had ordered a belly oil from another company at the beginning of my pregnancy, but was never able to stomach the smell of it, so I went in search of another one.&lt;br /&gt;I had first tried out Belli&#x27;s skincare line, since it was the only one I could find that was deemed pregnancy-safe, and I&#x27;ve been very happy with it, so I decided to try this belly oil next.&lt;br /&gt;It is now my favorite thing I own from Belli. I&#x27;m completely addicted to the scent. It is so relaxing and perfect for bedtime! Time will tell if it helps with the stretch marks but so far so good!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s Feburary and this product expires in August,2013....have to use it in half a year...I feel very disappointted about this</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil since week 12 bc my best friend used it when she was pregnant with her baby. I&#x27;m now 23 weeks and NO stretch marks!!! It smells like lavender and it&#x27;s soooo nice. I rub t on my bump and thighs in the mornings and it feels / smells so spa- like. Puts me in a Good mood for rest of day :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is worth the money. I tried a lot of different products and this was my favorite. The oil smells great and feels great on the skins my only complaint is the spray bottle makes it impossible to not get oil on my counter or on the tile when I spray on my belly.  After delivering my son I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks so it worked!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying, this stuff smells AMAZING. I was not, however, impressed with the moisturizing. I still felt itchy after using it, which my Palmer&#x27;s oil did not do. I really wanted to like this product, but I think I am going to save it for after I give birth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a side note, the blemish treatment by Belli was GREAT!</li>
            <li> I love it!  this smells great and helped with my itchy belly.  i would recommend to all mommies to be.</li>
            <li> It is moist but not greasy,  lightly scented that is not overpowering, I think I will buy a second one.</li>
            <li> I used ths for the first 3 months of my pregnancy then I switched to Jojoba oil then I finished my pregnancy using mimosa champagne from eminence, I did not have 1 single stretch mark on my body. But I just gained 35 lbs anyway. So I&#x27;m not sure if it was the oil that helped or was just because I didn&#x27;t exceed the weight gain cuz that&#x27;s what it gives pregnant women&#x27;s trench marks, the weight!</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;m four months pregnant and I still can&#x27;t say if it works for stretch marks because my belly is not that big yet. However, I love to go to bed at night and massage my belly while I talk to my baby. The product smell so good, it is a relaxing moment.</li>
            <li> Im 21 weeks pregnant and have been using this on my tummy and hips day and night since 14 weeks. The lavender scent is not overpowering. The spray avoids mess and waste. And best of all, well, I don&#x27;t want to jinx myself...but so far, so good (and I have popped!). Have a backup bottle wating. I&#x27;d say first bottle will last me 2 months. Using a cheaper oil for rest of my body.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this product, she didn&#x27;t develop any stretch marks eventhough she is trim and gained 50 pounds while pregnant.  I really appreciate her recommendation as I am 32 weeks pregnant and stretch mark free thus far!  I would definitely recommend this product to other people!</li>
            <li> I used this religiously during my pregnancy. In the mornings and at bed time every night. I loved the smell and the way it made my skin feel! Unfortunately my belly looks like it has been clawed by a wild animal. I don&#x27;t think anything truly prevents stretch marks, but who knows maybe it would&#x27;ve been worse without this product. Over all I liked the product, but as far as preventing stretch marks it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Works great, smells fantastic! I use this oil for obvious anti-stretch mark reasons, but the scent is what really gets me excited! I use after all showers, and so far no stretch marks. I can&#x27;t give all the credit to the oil as I&#x27;ve only used it on babies 3 and 4 with success. My first two I just used lotion and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks either. It feels great however, on that itchy stretching skin. It&#x27;s light and doesn&#x27;t come off on my clothing. Love it!</li>
            <li> Sweet almond oil is a really great product for the skin.  It absorbs quickly into the skin, making it less greasy than other oils.  Almond oil can be used for just about any skin concern, not just stretch marks, because it also promotes youthful skin, and since it doesn&#x27;t clog pores, can even be used on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that this product is natural and doesn&#x27;t contain preservatives or other suspected carcinogens.  Research has shown that mothers do pass on well over 100 different toxins through their breast milk to their baby.  Toxins like pesticides and hormones from the food we eat, and chemicals absorbed through the skin from the products we use.  However, these toxins remain in your body for years, perhaps even a lifetime.  So even if you &#x27;go organic&#x27; and use strictly &#x27;all natural&#x27; products during your pregnancy, you&#x27;re still likely to pass on toxins to your baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I used this religiously twice a day when I found out I was pregnant. Unfortunately, this oil didn&#x27;t prevent stretch marks on my tummy.</li>
            <li> The scent is very soothing, and so far, my skin looks great.  I have been using this since early October I believe, usually twice a day, and I have no stretch marks at 5.5 months.  Granted, my mother did not get them, so it may just be genetics, but I wanted to try to prevent any if I could.  I plan to get another bottle to get me through my third trimester and recovery.</li>
            <li> I began using this when i was around 12 weeks and I&#x27;ve used this for about a month now.  I really like i and I&#x27;m using it once a day but twice a day if i can.  the oils are nice and easily absorbed.  It has kept my skin soft.  I will continue to use it for the duration of the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I first tried this product as a freebie from when I created my registry--and loved it immediately.  The smell is calming and relaxing, and I enjoy how soft it leaves my skin without feeling super greasy.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this oil but I am not a fan of this spicy lavender fragrance. It was expensive though and I&#x27;m sure the product itself is helpful in prevention of stretch marks so I&#x27;m using it anyway and layering another oil over it to cover the smell (Earth Mama Angel Baby).</li>
            <li> Not sure it did anything to prevent stretch marks since they&#x27;re hereditary but it was a very, very nice oil to put on my pregnant belly every evening. The lavender smell was divine. Only word of note is that it can make your clothes smell funny if you put something on right after you applied it so best to put it on when you can let your bare belly sit for a bit. I would definitely buy it and use it again, the one star is deducted for the smell on clothing only!</li>
            <li> I bought this oil and the cream to be used during my pregnancy and I am very dissapointed. This products does not work!</li>
            <li> I recommend this to every pregnant women, I got a sample of this product from my doctor in our welcome pack when we registered with a new doctor. I finally used it in my last trimester and wished I used it earlier. I was starting to feel really irritated and moody, I decided to try this out when I saw that it has a nice lavender smell...oh my god!! it helped calm me down when I was rubbing it on my belly..the smell is wonderful and it helped stop the itching on my belly. I love this product!!</li>
            <li> Purchased for my pregnant wife, she&#x27;s been very pleased with the results, she&#x27;s had no stretch marks to date, she&#x27;s a very small woman, and it would appear we&#x27;re having large baby.</li>
            <li> So thankful for this bottle of oil! I went to my 30 week appt &amp; the first thing the doctor said when she saw my huge belly was - &amp;#34;What are you putting on your belly?!&amp;#34; I was confused until she said that she was surprised I did not have a single stretch mark. I owe it all to Belli Elasticity Belly Oil! I have gained more weight than expected (30 pounds) but still no stretch marks.</li>
            <li> awesome  help  a lot keeping my skin moist.</li>
            <li> I get stretch marks usually but not when I use this. Amazing!! I&#x27;m so thrilled I found this. I use it twice a day. It goes kinda fast though.</li>
            <li> This oil worked great to prevent stretch marks and also kept my skin moisturized.  I will definitely use this during my next pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I started using this product mid way through my pregnancy after I ran out of the Burt&#x27;s Bees Belly Butter. I wish I would&#x27;ve used this product sooner! I didn&#x27;t get any noticeable stretch marks during my pregnancy and I can&#x27;t really say if I attribute to this product or the Burt&#x27;s Bees. The scent of the oil is amazing, and it reminds me of a spa. You just have to wait at least 10 minutes to put any clothes on after putting the oil on your belly, otherwise the oil will get on your clothes.</li>
            <li> I only used it after 8 months, when the absolute largest, yet still got no stretch marks, and my baby boy was over nine pounds. The scent is euphoric. I would love to use it for a baby lotion, too.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my first pregnancy daily, and have no stretch marks. I&#x27;m hoping with my second I have the same results. So far, so good at 15 weeks.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of this oil! It is oil so it&#x27;s obviously a bit oily but it seems like it soaked in by the time I needed to get dressed and leave for the day. I&#x27;d recommend it!</li>
            <li> love the smell and i use it almost everyday once a day, I know the product say should use it twice a day but i am just too lazy to follow the instruction. I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. only complaint I have it this product doesn&#x27;t last long, but since it works I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> No stretch marks yet! Love it, smell is strong but only lasts for a little while. Careful not to spray directly on clothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to spray this oil. It squirts out in a very strong way and is hard to rub in.</li>
            <li> This was the only thing that helped with the itchiness. It soaks in fairly fast but still need to be careful with clothes.  Let it dry before putting shirts on.</li>
            <li> I tried several different stretch mark oil and cream and this is one of them. I liked it even if is very \\&quot;oil\\&quot; but for me have a mild fragrance. Anyway I bought only one bottle because is expensive and in my case was consumed very fast compared to other oils, perhaps because it is thicker and I have the feeling that I need put more quantity. However, after one bottle (used in my 6 months of pregnancy) I come back to the oil less expensive and that I really like too (Earth Mama Angel Baby Natural Stretch Oil). So far (9 months of pregnancy) I don&#x27;t have stretch marks and I used more bottles of Earth Mama Angel than Belli Oil ... I read that the stretch mark are genetic then I don&#x27;t know if these oils works or not, or is a combination of factors ... Anyway, these oils help with the itching you feel when your belly grows.</li>
            <li> I like the oil a lot !  Im on my 16 week and I just started using it! Hopefully it&#x27;ll make it work!  Im enjoying the product so far.&lt;br /&gt;First of all it feels and smells very healthy, so Im not worried about any impact on my baby.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it moisturize the skin perfectly. It feels very soft and tender. I would also recommend the product to all my non-pregnant girls.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing that i like about the product is that it doesn&#x27;t stains or ruin my clothes even though it&#x27;s very concentrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil got delivered very fast, I don&#x27;t think it even took 3 days with regular shipment method.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this oil and the way it feels when I put it on. The only problem I have with it, is that you cant use it in the morning, because it gets oily residue on your clothing. So if you only use it at night it can work, but you are left with oily hands or pjs.</li>
            <li> I love how smooth my skin feels after putting it on! Its comfrotable and I rub it on my belly everynight before bed! It also has a pleasent smell so Its not too strong for baby and I. Thank you so much!</li>
