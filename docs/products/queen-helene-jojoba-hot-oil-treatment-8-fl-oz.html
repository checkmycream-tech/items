            <li>Product was great.</li>
            <li>It coats your hair, but in a good way, making it feel sleek and shiny and silky but NOT greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It smells so good smells like baby oil  to  me.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This hot oil works great on my hair.</li>
            <li>I like it, I love it</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than a year now and have ran out.  </li>
            <li>I just bought 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li>otherwise, it works better heated up a bit</li>
            <li>wish everyone would post their hair texture when reviewing hair products  :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t owe all of my hairs healthy turnaround to this, but it&#x27;s held</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s growing like a weed and looks as healthy as it did when I was a kid</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Too many chemicals.....</li>
            <li>Very mild and easy to rinse.</li>
            <li>They are silky and don&#x27;t get frizzy easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this before my wedding to make sure my hair would look great for the big day!</li>
            <li>You soak the bottle in a mug or sink of hot water until the oil is warm.</li>
            <li>I have fine, not-too-thick hair, and it tends to get oily after 3-4 days.  </li>
            <li>Dirt cheap and lightly scented.</li>
            <li>This really helps restore moisture to my hair, I love it.</li>
            <li>and my hair has improved tremendously.</li>
            <li>I shampoo and condition and then apply this and leave in my hair for about 5 min and a quick rinse</li>
            <li>It is not greasy and quickly absorbs.</li>
            <li>This oil is not greasy and will be absorbed well into keratin treated (Brazilian Blowout) hair...</li>
            <li>I do detangle with conditioner before using (directions say to use right after shampoo).</li>
            <li>I always liked hot oil treatments as they stop itchy scalp and help hair in very low humidity.</li>
            <li>literally see my how my hair is healthier and starting to look more fuller.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;jojoba hot oil treatment&amp;#34</li>
            <li>i have used this oil before and it does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Be careful when you warm this up</li>
            <li>it will burn your scalp so let it cool off very well before using, I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference after using it.</li>
            <li>You have to replenish the water a few times to make sure it&#x27;s hot enough to warm the oil.</li>
            <li>I really like this hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own against all my other products!</li>
            <li>I like it and it makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li>This is labeled as pure jojoba oil and it is not.  </li>
            <li>Both my mom and I used it a few times and we love it!</li>
            <li>the fast shipping was a plus.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very unmanageable but when I use this it makes my hair so much softer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very inexpensive and lasts a while.</li>
            <li>I now go as long as possible without washing my hair and love the results of all my hair treatments!</li>
            <li>I have tried many hot oil treatments, however I must say Queen Helene is by far the best and the least expensive.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s nice to have a beauty regimen that can go for a few weeks without notice!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I have fairly thick hair and it work amazing for me</li>
            <li>I have baby fine, oily hair and this does not weigh it down.</li>
            <li>I read that jojoba oil is supposed to mimic the scalp&#x27;s natural oil and thus would keep your scalp from producing excess oil.  </li>
            <li>I will continue to use it frequently.</li>
            <li>The one thing that surprised me at first is that after using the oil in the shower, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as silky as it does with regular conditioner; i.e. it felt like I needed a detangling spray to comb out my hair, but this hasn&#x27;t been a big deal.  </li>
            <li>It is never irritating, in fact I think it helps soothe a dry itchy scalp too.</li>
            <li>This product left my hair very soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li>; I expected pure jojoba oil...</li>
            <li>I bought this Jojoba Hot Oil because I&#x27;m trying to cut down gradually on washing my hair to once a week.  </li>
            <li>(before the use of hair dye, hot tools, and hairspray) I bought mine at sallys for a little over five dollars.</li>

            <li> (before the use of hair dye, hot tools, and hairspray) I bought mine at sallys for a little over five dollars.</li>
            <li> The first two uses made my hair dry and brittle in fact, also hard to manage, or brush, use number three had it soft and silky and manageable.</li>
            <li> per use, but I&#x27;ve found that I use far less than that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, non drip, smells faintly of</li>
            <li> It left my very dry hair quenched with mositure.</li>
            <li> Very strong fake scent, and for some reason made my hair stiff as a board.  </li>
            <li> My hair has hi-lights and has suffered minor damage due to blow drying and such.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for ages and it conditions dry, brittle hair like nothing else.</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair extremely dry.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like it, I love it, I&#x27;d use it again.  I have fairly thick hair and it work amazing for me and you can&#x27;t beat the price per ounce.</li>
            <li> I have tried many hot oil treatments, however I must say Queen Helene is by far the best and the least expensive.  It left my very dry hair quenched with mositure. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than a year now and have ran out.  It gives my hair that shine and fullness that it lacks.  My hair has hi-lights and has suffered minor damage due to blow drying and such.  I have no time to get this item in a store myself and the fast shipping was a plus. The product actually arrived earlier than the said date.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve added essential oils to this and my hair has improved tremendously. It&#x27;s still a little on the dry side, but it&#x27;s definitely improving. I just bought 2 more bottles.</li>
            <li> Made my face breakout from just a little bit of the oil getting on it after rinsing.. Also contains parabens.</li>
            <li> I bought this Jojoba Hot Oil because I&#x27;m trying to cut down gradually on washing my hair to once a week.  I have fine, not-too-thick hair, and it tends to get oily after 3-4 days.  I read that jojoba oil is supposed to mimic the scalp&#x27;s natural oil and thus would keep your scalp from producing excess oil.  I have used it several times now, and I have noticed a difference.  I can go longer in between washings now.  I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  The one thing that surprised me at first is that after using the oil in the shower, my hair didn&#x27;t feel as silky as it does with regular conditioner; i.e. it felt like I needed a detangling spray to comb out my hair, but this hasn&#x27;t been a big deal.  The bottle recommends using 1 oz. per use, but I&#x27;ve found that I use far less than that.  All in all, I will buy again when I&#x27;ve used this bottle up.</li>
            <li> This oil is not greasy and will be absorbed well into keratin treated (Brazilian Blowout) hair... otherwise, it works better heated up a bit (soak a small amount in a bowl of hot water).</li>
            <li> does what it says it should...  I didn&#x27;t notice any outrageous difference in my hair but it was a little softer..(African American Permed Hair)  wish everyone would post their hair texture when reviewing hair products  :)</li>
            <li> I really like this hot oil treatment. It coats your hair, but in a good way, making it feel sleek and shiny and silky but NOT greasy at all. I have baby fine, oily hair and this does not weigh it down. I do detangle with conditioner before using (directions say to use right after shampoo). Dirt cheap and lightly scented.</li>
            <li> This really helps restore moisture to my hair, I love it.</li>
            <li> I have curly and frizzy hair. It&#x27;s very unmanageable but when I use this it makes my hair so much softer. I shampoo and condition and then apply this and leave in my hair for about 5 min and a quick rinse and I can already tell it&#x27;s a lot softer than after the conditioner step.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even use it because the bottle broke and leaked contents all over the box ad the rest of the items in the box. How do I return a broken bottle to get a refund!!! :/</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t owe all of my hairs healthy turnaround to this, but it&#x27;s held it&#x27;s own against all my other products! The first two uses made my hair dry and brittle in fact, also hard to manage, or brush, use number three had it soft and silky and manageable. I now put it in my hair as a leave in conditioner for days at a time, along with some other stuff and it&#x27;s growing like a weed and looks as healthy as it did when I was a kid (before the use of hair dye, hot tools, and hairspray) I bought mine at sallys for a little over five dollars. I now go as long as possible without washing my hair and love the results of all my hair treatments!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 weeks literally see my how my hair is healthier and starting to look more fuller.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for ages and it conditions dry, brittle hair like nothing else. It is never irritating, in fact I think it helps soothe a dry itchy scalp too. Very mild and easy to rinse. I especially love this stuff after camping or being out in the weather. Can be used as needed or everyday if you are out in the elements a lot.</li>
            <li> I like it and it makes my hair super soft</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair extremely dry. Also it only CONTAINS jojoba though I am not convinced about it. The label is kinda misleading...&amp;#34;jojoba hot oil treatment&amp;#34; I expected pure jojoba oil...This is not a good product. If you have dry hair avoid this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Crappy packaging. Half The bottle spilled inside the package</li>
            <li> i have used this oil before and it does exactly what I wanted. I will continue to use it frequently.</li>
            <li> Be careful when you warm this up it will burn your scalp so let it cool off very well before using, I really couldn&#x27;t tell a difference after using it.</li>
            <li> This hot oil works great on my hair. They are silky and don&#x27;t get frizzy easily. It&#x27;s also very inexpensive and lasts a while.</li>
            <li> I always liked hot oil treatments as they stop itchy scalp and help hair in very low humidity.</li>
            <li> This product took about two weeks to arrive. Product was great. It comes actually the way it is displayed on the site. I was very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It is not greasy and quickly absorbs. It smells so good smells like baby oil  to  me. This product left my hair very soft and moisturized. I will be buying again!</li>
            <li> I bought this before my wedding to make sure my hair would look great for the big day! Both my mom and I used it a few times and we love it! You soak the bottle in a mug or sink of hot water until the oil is warm. This is kind of inconvenient. You have to replenish the water a few times to make sure it&#x27;s hot enough to warm the oil. It definitely makes you have to think in advance of when you&#x27;re going to do this.&lt;br /&gt;Then you rub the set amount (signaled by the lines on the side of the bottle) in your hair, wrap in a towel, and let it sit. It&#x27;s easy, non drip, smells faintly of something- but not a harsh smell and nothing fake or flowery. When you rinse it out you can immediately tell that it&#x27;s worked magic.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the results last awhile too. I hate upkeep, I always forget about it. So it&#x27;s nice to have a beauty regimen that can go for a few weeks without notice!</li>
            <li> This is labeled as pure jojoba oil and it is not.  Jojoba is way down on the list of ingredients and this product also contains a number of known carcinogens.</li>
            <li> Very strong fake scent, and for some reason made my hair stiff as a board.  Too many chemicals.....back to plain coconut oil for me.</li>
