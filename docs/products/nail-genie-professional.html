            <li>This a wonderful machine.</li>
            <li>I FIND THAT THE DISC DOES THE BEST AND SMOOTHEST JOB.</li>
            <li>This is also the best GEnie I have owned.</li>
            <li>Product is great!</li>
            <li>I loved the convenience of having it at home to use, I even used it on my toe nails!</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for nails and feet and does wonders on calluses on your feet and heels.</li>
            <li>Arrived on schedule.. Works great.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>I had one of these machines that I loved and lasted years.</li>
            <li>I will say the power is good on it, but I think I&#x27;m going to look to see if there are good reviews on a cheaper unit, and cut my losses with this one.</li>
            <li>I loved it, as I do my own acrylic nails at home.  </li>
            <li>Price was great shipping very quick</li>
            <li>I purchased this and wanted to do my own acrylic nails..  </li>
            <li>FYI, I do my own acrylics and use this for pedicures as well.  </li>
            <li>The new one is awesome.</li>
            <li>Yes, I know that this is best left to the professionals</li>
            <li>I will keep on practicing and will hopefully get better at acrylic nail application.</li>
            <li>I love this machine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have since upgraded to better machines that are comparable in cost.  </li>
            <li>The one pictured here is not the latest model.  </li>
            <li>I have more than one home</li>
            <li>It sure helps you do your own&lt;br /&gt;nails</li>
            <li>/&gt;It helps me to take good care of my husband&#x27;s fingers and toes.&lt;br /&gt;And very easy to use, and save much time.</li>
            <li>I have had to have it re-wired 3 times,  Nothing more than a cheap plastic toy.</li>
            <li>I am just now hearing a clicking sound in the handle portion and will contact the mfg.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to as it is much more powerful than my battery hand held model, but once I got the hang of it, I like it a lot.  </li>
            <li>good enough for me</li>
            <li>I love the new and improved look and feel.</li>
            <li>I find this to be more of a hassel than it&#x27;s worth for a machine that wasn&#x27;t that cheap and lasted so short of a time.</li>
            <li>This machine enables me to do my own nails without hurting my hands further.  </li>
            <li>The other review said that a replacement is $56.oo, which is a great price rather than buying the whole machine again.  </li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times but am very happy with the product.  </li>
            <li>not being able to buy the original(discontinued) battery operated (AA type) nail genie, I finally bit the bullet and bought this product.  </li>
            <li>I think for a machine like this to last for 10 years and do the fantastic job it does, is well worth anyone&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li>I replaced it recently, and though I&#x27;ve had it a while now, it really hasn&#x27;t been used that many times, and has already broke.</li>
            <li>IT IS MUCH BETER THAN MY FIRST NAIL GENIE</li>
            <li>I bought the Nail Genie Professional years ago when I was pregnant for my son.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product.  </li>
            <li>IT WORKS VERY WELL</li>
            <li>I placed my order and received my video a couple days after they were fast and plastic was still on the product.</li>
            <li>works ok but not as well as a bigger professional drill....</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without my Nail Genie!</li>
            <li>Works well on your feet for dry heals, also enjoy the nail end.  </li>
            <li>This is a product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This one is much quieter than my old drill.</li>
            <li>just normal routine use on myself.</li>
            <li>OR I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITH MYSELF.</li>
            <li>Now, they make you buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, my son is now 14 years old and it just now stopped working.</li>
            <li>I owned a Nail Genie Professional for 20 years.</li>
            <li>I purchased the Nail Genie Professional a couple years ago.  </li>
            <li>I have arthritus in my hands and have had 3 hand surgeries so far.  </li>
            <li>It helps you have that professional look</li>
            <li>I can still use my old attachments, this is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>The only negative remark I have is that this is my second machine &amp; it is made much cheaper (plastic vs. metal) than my first machine!</li>

            <li> I bought the Nail Genie Professional years ago when I was pregnant for my son. I loved the convenience of having it at home to use, I even used it on my toe nails! lol Anyway, my son is now 14 years old and it just now stopped working. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m on here looking to buy another. I feel you can&#x27;t go wrong, it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> I owned a Nail Genie Professional for 20 years. Mine finally wore out. This a wonderful machine. I cannot do without it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nail Genie Professional a couple years ago.  I loved it, as I do my own acrylic nails at home.  After a couple of years use, it stopped spinning.  My husband took it apart and a very small plastic gear part (maybe 1/4\\&quot; diameter) broke in half.  I contacted the mfr. Sunjeen, Inc. to inquire on getting the replacement part.  They do not sell internal parts and told me I would have to buy the entire handle for $56!  Not no, but hell no!  I&#x27;ve researched online and there are Dremel&#x27;s that have the same capability as the Nail Genie.  The Dremel I purchased cost me less than the $56 for their damn handle!</li>
            <li> I purchased this and wanted to do my own acrylic nails..  Yes, I know that this is best left to the professionals but I thought maybe I could save some money since one can spend over a 1000 bucks a year in the nail salon.   &lt;br /&gt;The Nail Genie seems to work well and I think that I just need to get used to using it. I did get a little close to my cuticles a couple of times and have a few battle scars but I think that was just due to my lack of experience.  I will keep on practicing and will hopefully get better at acrylic nail application.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but am very happy with the product.  Works well on your feet for dry heals, also enjoy the nail end.  Thanks for the product.  I would like to ask you how you can buy the sand paper refills.  This is a product that I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this machine.&lt;br /&gt;It helps me to take good care of my husband&#x27;s fingers and toes.&lt;br /&gt;And very easy to use, and save much time.</li>
            <li> I purchased the professional model about 10 years ago and have used it without any of the problems I read in the other 2 reviews.  I have arthritus in my hands and have had 3 hand surgeries so far.  This machine enables me to do my own nails without hurting my hands further.  I am just now hearing a clicking sound in the handle portion and will contact the mfg. for a replacement.  The other review said that a replacement is $56.oo, which is a great price rather than buying the whole machine again.  I think for a machine like this to last for 10 years and do the fantastic job it does, is well worth anyone&#x27;s money.</li>
            <li> The bits don;t fit and are very expensive to replace.  I have had to have it re-wired 3 times,  Nothing more than a cheap plastic toy.</li>
            <li> not being able to buy the original(discontinued) battery operated (AA type) nail genie, I finally bit the bullet and bought this product.  It took some getting used to as it is much more powerful than my battery hand held model, but once I got the hang of it, I like it a lot.  It&#x27;s great for nails and feet and does wonders on calluses on your feet and heels.</li>
            <li> Meets all my expectations.</li>
            <li> ILOVE THE NAIL GENIE IT WORKS VERY WELL FOR FOOT CARE  I HAVE ALWAYS USED NAIL GENIE IT IS MUCH BETER THAN MY FIRST NAIL GENIE IT LASTED MRE THAN YEARS</li>
            <li> works ok but not as well as a bigger professional drill....good enough for me and I was a licensed manicurist for years...retired now</li>
            <li> I had one of these machines that I loved and lasted years. I replaced it recently, and though I&#x27;ve had it a while now, it really hasn&#x27;t been used that many times, and has already broke. The plastic collar that holds the drill bits is practically crumbling apart. In looking up if there is a way to replace that part, I came across these reviews, and it makes me wonder if the quality of this product is slipping. Anyway, apparently, the only way to replace this little nothing part is to send the entire unit back to the company, and let them determine what is wrong with the machine. It does not appear that I can just purchase the part I need. I find this to be more of a hassel than it&#x27;s worth for a machine that wasn&#x27;t that cheap and lasted so short of a time. I will say the power is good on it, but I think I&#x27;m going to look to see if there are good reviews on a cheaper unit, and cut my losses with this one.</li>
            <li> THIS  IS MY 3RD OR 4TH ONE NOW.  I MUST USE IT ONCE A WEEK  ON MY FEET OR I CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITH MYSELF. I FIND THAT THE DISC DOES THE BEST AND SMOOTHEST JOB. NOTHING I HAVE TRIED DOES AS WELL AS MY GENIE.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these over the course of 23 years.  In the past, when the hand piece died, as it inevitably does, it use to be a nominal fee to have it repaired.  Now, they make you buy a new one.  The hand piece either has an internal malfunction or the cord shorts out.  I find this irritating because it happens within a year or two of use.  I have since upgraded to better machines that are comparable in cost.  But before buying the newer/better machines, I did purchase another one of these.  They have upgraded it...they say.  So we&#x27;ll see how this one goes.  The one pictured here is not the latest model.  FYI, I do my own acrylics and use this for pedicures as well.  I have more than one home so I like to have one at each residence.  I do not abuse it...just normal routine use on myself.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without my Nail Genie! Saves me hundreds in pedicures. Professionals never file off my ugly calluses so I just do it myself! The only negative remark I have is that this is my second machine &amp; it is made much cheaper (plastic vs. metal) than my first machine!</li>
            <li> I placed my order and received my video a couple days after they were fast and plastic was still on the product.</li>
            <li> Arrived on schedule.. Works great.  This is the second one we have purchased - - one for each home.  that&#x27;s testimony enough.</li>
            <li> This is my forth machine in about 15 years. The new one is awesome. It is quite, I can now watch TV while grooming. This is also the best GEnie I have owned.</li>
            <li> Product is great! Price was great shipping very quick</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It sure helps you do your own&lt;br /&gt;nails at home.  It helps you have that professional look&lt;br /&gt;to your nails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this drill over twenty years ago and it finally started to act up so I had to purchase it again. I love the new and improved look and feel. This one is much quieter than my old drill. I can still use my old attachments, this is an added bonus. I highly recommend this product.</li>
