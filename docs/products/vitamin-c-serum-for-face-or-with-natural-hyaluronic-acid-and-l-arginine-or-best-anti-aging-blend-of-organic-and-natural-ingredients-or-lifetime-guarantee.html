    <ol>
            <li>Earth&#x27;s Glow discount makes it great value!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way to start the the day and also knowing it has organic ingredients is great!</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>This stuff is great, it feels like silk going on your skin.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t tell that it was working ,but people kept telling me how great my face looked (and no one knew I was using this.)  </li>
            <li>The serum feels very nice on the skin.  </li>
            <li>This is really good stuff.</li>
            <li>It is a good skin brightener.</li>
            <li>Thank you and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li>I love it, use it every day!</li>
            <li>Your skin is your largest organism and it is very important to take good care of it.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product</li>
            <li>Earth&#x27;s Glow has come out with ANOTHER really nice</li>
            <li>I received a bottle of this for review and it works (and this is my honest opinion).</li>
            <li>I have been using a serum C product for many years that worked and I liked</li>
            <li>one is by far the best one I have tried and will keep using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s very light and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>I am quite pleased with the Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>There are many more costly products out there, but why spend more?  </li>
            <li>I had been using this for about three weeks, and enjoyed the product.</li>
            <li>I lost most of the serum this way.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>but I knew that it had many chemicals in it.  </li>
            <li>Forget about the fact that my skin has a healthy glow...</li>
            <li>and if you have any questions I am pleased to answer them.</li>
            <li>I love it and would recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I also realize many studies suggest it can take 1-6 months to see the maximum benefits from using Vitamin C on your face and skin.</li>
            <li>What I can say is that the serum is very light, not oily, and glides easily on skin.</li>
            <li>benefit for me is when I am done with my morning face cleansing I have to admit I really feel good inside and out and in a very special way.</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product to both women and men.  </li>
            <li>It smooths out the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>the item that was delivered was a LIGHT tightening serum.</li>
            <li>way I use the C serum is after I have lightly exfoliated my face, which I do every morning</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m not going to talk about the wonders I&#x27;ve experienced in the last week from using the product.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>BTW, the price is right, too!</li>
            <li>I agree that this is not enough time to make a fair evaluation/rating.</li>
            <li>This vitamin C serum has really improved the clarity and tone of my skin, giving it a more uniform appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I am picky about what I put on my skin as most &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; products have too many chemicals and actually age your skin.</li>
            <li>I have read that you have to use a skin product for at least three months to be able to fairly evaluate.  </li>
            <li>This serum leaves my face feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of sun damage from living in California and years of fun in the sun, and it is nice to find a product that can help reverse some of the damage I did as a teen.</li>
            <li>The price is right too</li>
            <li>Although I did receive this product for free, that does not mean that my review is biased.</li>
            <li>a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice liquid sinks quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Will order oil/cream to put on top next time.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard about the many benefits of Vitamin C for facial skin: counteract wrinkle formation, reduce age spots, and protection from sun damage.</li>
            <li>It is a fact that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right diet along with natural (and healthy) ingredients on your skin (mainly Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid) stimulates your body to make its own collagen.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat oily skin, so I am very concerned about adding anything to my face without testing for oil content first.</li>
            <li>Dries fairly quickly, leaving the skin soft with no unwanted residue.  </li>
            <li>I  like this product vey much.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in my skin</li>
            <li>and I really like it.  </li>
            <li>My face has really cleared up since I started using this product.</li>
            <li>I get too much sun and really need the Vit. C.</li>
            <li>All natural and pure!</li>
            <li>I would recommend it (especially above others with many unrecognizable ingredients) as part of a daily anti-aging regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Fast</li>
            <li>So when I learned that Earth&#x27;s Glow new serum C was coming out</li>
            <li>I will update after some time passes with my new skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>It seems to me the fine lines on my face have also been toned down through use of this product.  </li>
            <li>but I like Earth&#x27;s Glow&#x27;s approach to natural and holistic products so as you can imagine I had to try the new vitamin C</li>
            <li>made my skin feel very soft but so far no difference in appearance, will continue to use as I like the feel</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product is it, It&#x27;s all natural too.</li>
            <li>As we age things happen to our bodies that we naturally want to fight and/or fix.</li>
            <li>have exchanged a few emails with the owner of Earth&#x27;s Glow, after I purchased their Argan Oil, and I really admire the fact that they genuinely are passionate about their product line and what goes in their products like the Argan Oil and Vitamin C Serum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d advise buying a similar serum with a better bottle--don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li>When I did a&lt;br /&gt;reorder of the exact same product, what came was COMPLETELY different-</li>
            <li>If I put that goo on my face I would have had a major break out.</li>
            <li>Easily absorbed but noticed little difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Further, if found the 10% Serum to be thick and quite sticky when applied, whereas this product is extremely light when applied to my face.</li>

            <li> I ordered the Vitamin C Serum to apply on my face to help brighten my skin and hopefully cut down on some early wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I have been using a small amount twice daily for nearly a month now.  </li>
            <li> Not sure whats going on that the same product could be so COMPLETELY different-&lt;br</li>
            <li> have not used it that long</li>
            <li> this is a cheaper alternative this product works as long as you use it 2 times a day and never miss it</li>
            <li> Kept reading how certain products could take a few years off my face but didn&#x27;t want to get trapped into buying a product every month for the rest of my life</li>
            <li> I have had no skin irritation or other reactions.  </li>
            <li> I only used the serum for 1 1/2 to 2 months with no notable, long-term changes to my skin.</li>
            <li> it was a yellow, greasy, thick mess.</li>
            <li> meaning not filled with other</li>

            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago-</li>
            <li> , a few drops goes into the palm of my hand then with two fingers</li>
            <li> Even when the lid is screwed on tight, this leaks!</li>
            <li> So, instead of being so hard on myself, I&#x27;m going to keep usinf it.  </li>
            <li> so I did some research into the ingredients of these miracles and found they all had two ingredients in common, vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid.</li>
            <li> not good for my skine</li>
            <li> Not happy and would not purchase this product again.</li>
            <li> Very poor packaging, however.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is 18% Vitamin C serum.  I have been using a small amount twice daily for nearly a month now.  I have noticed my skin is softer, smoother, and with diminished pore size.  It seems to me the fine lines on my face have also been toned down through use of this product.  I have sensitive skin so I approached using the Serum with caution.  I have had no skin irritation or other reactions.  I am quite pleased with the Vitamin C Serum.  I have also been using Earth&#x27;s Glow Argan oil for almost 18 months-- I use the two products together.  There are many more costly products out there, but why spend more?  This works!</li>
            <li> This is really good stuff. I do like the way it feels and believe it has helped my skin.</li>
            <li> I  like this product vey much. It is a good skin brightener.</li>
            <li> I love it, use it every day! It is oderless and colorless, so it does not stain your skin.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Although I did receive this product for free, that does not mean that my review is biased. I have just recently started on this product but i am noticing results.</li>
            <li> I chose this 5 star rating because I have compared this Vitamin C Serum with another Serum that only boasts of 10%  Vitamin C compared to Earth&#x27;s Glow 18% of Vitamin C.  Further, if found the 10% Serum to be thick and quite sticky when applied, whereas this product is extremely light when applied to my face. I can visually see the change in skin tone, texture, and brightness. I strongly recommend this product to both women and men.  And whenever opportunity presents itself, I will personally recommend this Serum to my close-knit friends.  BTW, the price is right, too!</li>
            <li> The serum feels very nice on the skin.  Dries fairly quickly, leaving the skin soft with no unwanted residue.  I have read that you have to use a skin product for at least three months to be able to fairly evaluate.  I only used the serum for 1 1/2 to 2 months with no notable, long-term changes to my skin. I agree that this is not enough time to make a fair evaluation/rating.</li>
            <li> have not used it that long but it seems to be working</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t really noticed much difference in my skin</li>
            <li> I had been using this for about three weeks, and enjoyed the product. Very poor packaging, however. Even when the lid is screwed on tight, this leaks! I lost most of the serum this way. Not happy and would not purchase this product again. I&#x27;d advise buying a similar serum with a better bottle--don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Helps with age spots and wrinkles. Will order oil/cream to put on top next time. But will order it again!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago- the item that was delivered was a LIGHT tightening serum. I loved it! When I did a&lt;br /&gt;reorder of the exact same product, what came was COMPLETELY different- it was a yellow, greasy, thick mess. If I put that goo on my face I would have had a major break out. Not sure whats going on that the same product could be so COMPLETELY different-&lt;br /&gt;possibly a counterfeit product. Buyer beware!</li>
            <li> Kept reading how certain products could take a few years off my face but didn&#x27;t want to get trapped into buying a product every month for the rest of my life so I did some research into the ingredients of these miracles and found they all had two ingredients in common, vitamin C and Hyaluronic acid. This product is it, It&#x27;s all natural too. I have had three people comment that I look 15 years younger than I am and I&#x27;ll take whatever I can get. The price is right too and you are not locked in.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay. No significant change or glow added.</li>
            <li> This serum leaves my face feeling fresh. It&#x27;s a great way to start the the day and also knowing it has organic ingredients is great!</li>
            <li> This is a nice product and I do see a difference in some of my brown freckles on my face and hands.  I will purchase this product again.  I use five drops to do my entire face and back of my hands.  I have a lot of sun damage from living in California and years of fun in the sun, and it is nice to find a product that can help reverse some of the damage I did as a teen.</li>
            <li> Easily absorbed but noticed little difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Earth&#x27;s Glow has come out with ANOTHER really nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have exchanged a few emails with the owner of Earth&#x27;s Glow, after I purchased their Argan Oil, and I really admire the fact that they genuinely are passionate about their product line and what goes in their products like the Argan Oil and Vitamin C Serum.  All natural and pure! meaning not filled with other fillers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK...if I must I&#x27;ll start with my age...I am 51 but my skin looks like it is in it&#x27;s thirty&#x27;s. This is because I take care of myself internally and externally.  As we age things happen to our bodies that we naturally want to fight and/or fix. Your skin is your largest organism and it is very important to take good care of it.  This is why I have been using Earth&#x27;s Glow Vitamin C Serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this vitamin C serum for about two weeks now and I really like it.  I have been using a serum C product for many years that worked and I liked but I knew that it had many chemicals in it.  So when I learned that Earth&#x27;s Glow new serum C was coming out I had to try it!  I am not one to change my products especially when I find one that works for me but I like Earth&#x27;s Glow&#x27;s approach to natural and holistic products so as you can imagine I had to try the new vitamin C serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The way I use the C serum is after I have lightly exfoliated my face, which I do every morning, a few drops goes into the palm of my hand then with two fingers I pat it on all over my face, neck and d&amp;eacute;collet&amp;eacute;.  Then I use a B12 serum, sunscreen followed by a moisture tint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The benefit for me is when I am done with my morning face cleansing I have to admit I really feel good inside and out and in a very special way. Forget about the fact that my skin has a healthy glow...that &#x27;s just an added benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you try it and if you have any questions I am pleased to answer them.</li>
            <li> not good for my skine</li>
            <li> This vitamin C serum has really improved the clarity and tone of my skin, giving it a more uniform appearance.&lt;br /&gt;I also take antioxidants internally and have done for a long time, but even so, this topical serum has made a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice liquid sinks quickly into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;This one is by far the best one I have tried and will keep using.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s very light and amazing.&lt;br /&gt;And Earth&#x27;s Glow discount makes it great value!</li>
            <li> I used the product about a months without any results</li>
            <li> I received a bottle of this for review and it works (and this is my honest opinion). I am picky about what I put on my skin as most &#x27;anti-aging&#x27; products have too many chemicals and actually age your skin. It is a fact that your body makes collagen to keep skin tight, so using the right diet along with natural (and healthy) ingredients on your skin (mainly Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid) stimulates your body to make its own collagen. This is the product to help your body do that. I would recommend it (especially above others with many unrecognizable ingredients) as part of a daily anti-aging regimen.&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery!! Thank you again!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great, it feels like silk going on your skin. It smooths out the fine lines around my eyes. I love it and would recommend it to my friends and family. Thank you and keep up the good work.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Vitamin C Serum to apply on my face to help brighten my skin and hopefully cut down on some early wrinkles. I&#x27;ve heard about the many benefits of Vitamin C for facial skin: counteract wrinkle formation, reduce age spots, and protection from sun damage. I also realize many studies suggest it can take 1-6 months to see the maximum benefits from using Vitamin C on your face and skin. So I&#x27;m not going to talk about the wonders I&#x27;ve experienced in the last week from using the product. What I can say is that the serum is very light, not oily, and glides easily on skin. I have somewhat oily skin, so I am very concerned about adding anything to my face without testing for oil content first. I applied this serum to the back of my hands before bed. There was no visible oil sheen at all, not when applied, not the next morning. I recognized the same effect when applied on my face. So far, so good. I will update after some time passes with my new skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Have not noticed any improvement in the condition of my skin or wrinkles also using product with a moisture and no improviment !!</li>
            <li> made my skin feel very soft but so far no difference in appearance, will continue to use as I like the feel</li>
            <li> this is a cheaper alternative this product works as long as you use it 2 times a day and never miss it</li>
            <li> My face has really cleared up since I started using this product. I use it twice a day under my regular moisturizer. I have oily skin and it&#x27;s not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t tell that it was working ,but people kept telling me how great my face looked (and no one knew I was using this.)  So, instead of being so hard on myself, I&#x27;m going to keep usinf it.  I get too much sun and really need the Vit. C.</li>
