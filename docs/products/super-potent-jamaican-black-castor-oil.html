            <li>yeah, so far, I&#x27;m happy with my Potent JBCO and as long as it works for me, I will continue to order.</li>
            <li>I had my own hair in braids (no extensions) and told myself I would keep it in a protective style for the next month.</li>
            <li>I feel purchase was worth it</li>
            <li>Its worth a try but its not going to work over night so be patient.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for 3months, I am on the break period right now.</li>
            <li>Well, to my surprise I was able to go that entire month without washing it.</li>
            <li>I eventually ended up buying a second bottle &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s doing exactly what it said it would.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased with this product my hair has grown so much within the last 45 days</li>
            <li>Not working for me,after seeing all the positive reviews I thought it would done some miracle to me too</li>
            <li>I just purchased the Super Potent Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is strong but it does not last</li>
            <li>I really like how it smells and the consistency.  </li>
            <li>but I really could use it because of the smell.  </li>
            <li>Thanks I use it all the time</li>
            <li>can be a very oily</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say I so an abnormal amount of growth within the month but on the day that I toke my braids out my hair was very moisturized.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t need much at all just 4-6 drops in your hand and rub it in the problem areas of your head.</li>
            <li>she&#x27;s really like and does the work</li>
            <li>This product arrived fast</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen much growth yet....</li>
            <li>Patience is important because the problems weren created suddenly .</li>
            <li>and I cant really tell at this point.</li>
            <li>Yes....I been using it for about 3 weeks now can&#x27;t wait to see if it really thickens my hair.</li>
            <li>I use this oil to seal my hair just before I braid it so that when I take it down it&#x27;s nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Good stuff, it revitalizes dull hair, the scent is pretty strong but adding a little essence of lavender does the trick.</li>
            <li>4a/b hair with a tiny 3c patch &amp; the nape hair is the most fragile,plus I sleep on my back.</li>
            <li>Well i just got it a month ago to soon to tell if i got any new growth</li>
            <li>I only used one bottle which lasted 2 weeks more or less.</li>
            <li>This product adds moisture to the air and keeps it feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I do not have any issues with this product and so far it has meet my expectations.</li>
            <li>I gave it 4 stars because its too early to tell about the thickening for thinning areas claim.</li>
            <li>I used it alone with sprayed a bit of water on my hair every so often (I have natural hair and know I needed to water as well).</li>
            <li>I never knew castor oil could make your hair this soft.</li>
            <li>i will be reodering for ME and my friend that is JUST about to finish chemo and is completely bald</li>
            <li>I am heard about this product from a natural hair care website and I am using it for hair loss treatment.</li>
            <li>So far its working</li>
            <li>After my first bottle I noticed a bit of regrowth &amp; by second bottle there was a lot of improvement, with some hair growing where there hadn&#x27;t been any for a long time.</li>
            <li>This made my hair grow so much I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and a half and seeing a lot if new growth.</li>
            <li>My hair feels so soft and silky even after I left it unbraided  </li>
            <li>I am planning on getting my hair cut short next week and am looking forward to using this oil to see how fast I can grow it back.</li>
            <li>Ive been using it faithful for 2 weeks and my hair shedding has decreased significantly!</li>
            <li>I have used Black Jamican castor oil in the same way and use as a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take long for the hair in that area to thicken up so much so that other areas of my head were feeling &amp;#34;not as thick&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I now have fine hair growing in the thin area.</li>
            <li>I love this product because recently I suffered from Traction Alopecia around my edges, due to tight ponytails and weaving and tight braiding.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle now &amp; will continue to use it as long as I get results.</li>
            <li> My hair comes down to my shoulders but this patch of hair is probably only 5 inches long and is in the area of my soft spot.</li>
            <li> This oil eliminated dry itchy scalp...thicken my shredded areas in only 30 days.</li>
            <li> This area of hair is quite damaged dry and brittle and does not lay flat when I do my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble growing my nape &amp; temple areas since going natural 4 years ago.</li>
            <li> I am following the instructions and have been applying the oil along my edges on w every other day.</li>
            <li> I expected hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> One thing that it definitely did was alleviate the amount of shedding that I usually get.</li>
            <li> and I put this on my hair, every other night.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that I have an itchy dry scalp with a bit of eczema and usually need to wash my hair on a weekly bases.</li>
            <li> I have been diagnosed with frontal alopecia which is found to be prevalent in mostly black women.</li>
            <li> I am using this oil in combination with the rejuvenating black castor oil.</li>
            <li> This stuff is thick so a little goes a long way - I would use caution when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You do not have to use this product everyday.</li>
            <li> I know this product will coat my scalp and protect it from any harsh weather.</li>
            <li> My hair shed 80% less than is usually does.</li>
            <li> It gradually started growing in but this past winter I was under a lot of stress, &amp; that plus a dry cold spell in January caused the new hair to thin &amp; break.</li>
            <li> I see a small degree of growth around the edges fuss is growing in however it has not been 30 days</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure yet</li>
            <li> My hair grows and thicken some, but I am not sure if is the oil or the laser I am using .  </li>
            <li> But that&#x27;s the least of my worries.</li>
            <li> It is thick but not overly so.  </li>
            <li> The next morning the itching was not so bad.</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> Being sick for over ^ years, my hair had thin in the middle of my head, being a woman, I truly was up set....</li>
            <li> just sorry</li>
            <li> But ill post pic soon so you guys could see my before and after.</li>
            <li> I should have known because some of the pictures on the bottles look so fake~</li>
            <li> but I guess I was wrong :-(</li>
            <li> However, icancpmment on the unpleasant scent.</li>

            <li> I did not care for the way it smelled.  It does stimulate the scalp.  It did add thickness to my hair.</li>
            <li> This product adds moisture to the air and keeps it feeling soft and moisturized.  After two weeks, it seems to reduce itching of the scalp.</li>
            <li> Nice quality of oil. It is thick but not overly so.  If you youtube it you will fine many recipes to assist with hair groth</li>
            <li> I have to use it over a period of time to make an observation. I don&#x27;t know if it will work for my type of alopecia. I have been diagnosed with frontal alopecia which is found to be prevalent in mostly black women. They say there is no cure. But we will see.</li>
            <li> My hair has grown about 3 inches in about 6 months. Works great</li>
            <li> I use this oil every three days to oil my scal and to seal my ends. I have used Black Jamican castor oil in the same way and use as a hot oil treatment. The smell is strong but it does not last and I like how it keeps my hair moisturized. You do not have to use this product everyday. I like the thickness of it especially since the winter months are coming I know this product will coat my scalp and protect it from any harsh weather. I do not have any issues with this product and so far it has meet my expectations. I have recommened this product to several friends and family members.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t wait to get my braids done so I can massage this onto my scalp</li>
            <li> Ive finally found something that works! Ive been using it faithful for 2 weeks and my hair shedding has decreased significantly! Im confident that my thinning areas will fill in after awhile. I gave it 4 stars because its too early to tell about the thickening for thinning areas claim. Anyway, I&#x27;m just happy to have more hairs on my head and less in the sink!</li>
            <li> I really like how it smells and the consistency.  I have not noted any changes yet...too soon to tell. Shipped quickly and no opened leaking bottle, which is a plus!</li>
            <li> This may be good but I really could use it because of the smell.  However it was recommended by people who say it worked.  I just couldn&#x27;t get with the smell. I would rather have unscented that that scent.</li>
            <li> Being sick for over ^ years, my hair had thin in the middle of my head, being a woman, I truly was up set....had all types of test done, NO ANSWER.  I tried this, just by the Grace of God, discovered it, and after about a month of using this....I now have fine hair growing in the thin area. Thank You  Its has a pleasant smell, and I can take the oil..... I have HAIR.</li>
            <li> I just got this product last week so I&#x27;m not sure yet if it does what it claims to do - regrow hair and stop hair loss.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! I have an area of hair that is significantly shorter then all the rest of my hair. My hair comes down to my shoulders but this patch of hair is probably only 5 inches long and is in the area of my soft spot. This area of hair is quite damaged dry and brittle and does not lay flat when I do my hair. Now I use this product just as they recommend in addition I take biotin, drink a gallon of water a day plus I excersise and eat healthy and my hair has grow in the area a lot. It didn&#x27;t take long for the hair in that area to thicken up so much so that other areas of my head were feeling &amp;#34;not as thick&amp;#34;. I am so glad to have found this and I really like how they put their love into this formula.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t meet my expectations. I expected hair regrowth. I don&#x27;t see any results after 3 months. It smells goodThanks.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes my permed hair shiny:)</li>
            <li> I just purchased the Super Potent Jamaican Black Castor Oil. Obviously it&#x27;s too soon for growth results. However, icancpmment on the unpleasant scent. But that&#x27;s the least of my worries. I am following the instructions and have been applying the oil along my edges on w every other day. I hope this stuff works!!!!</li>
            <li> Thanks I use it all the time and I see a difference already</li>
            <li> can be a very oily so don&#x27;t use a lot. this should last quite a while. need to only once a week.</li>
            <li> This product works fantastic.</li>
            <li> I had my own hair in braids (no extensions) and told myself I would keep it in a protective style for the next month. On night one that I used it I I was okay. The next morning I woke up with my scalp ITCHING. On night two of using it I was okay. The next morning the itching was not so bad. After day three I experience no itching what so ever. I continued to use it for a month with no issues. Keep in mind that I have an itchy dry scalp with a bit of eczema and usually need to wash my hair on a weekly bases. Well, to my surprise I was able to go that entire month without washing it. I&#x27;m not going to say I so an abnormal amount of growth within the month but on the day that I toke my braids out my hair was very moisturized. I used it alone with sprayed a bit of water on my hair every so often (I have natural hair and know I needed to water as well). One thing that it definitely did was alleviate the amount of shedding that I usually get. My hair shed 80% less than is usually does. I eventually ended up buying a second bottle &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t seen anything significant yet. I&#x27;ve only used it under a sew in. Will be able to see when sew in is removed.</li>
            <li> I love this product because recently I suffered from Traction Alopecia around my edges, due to tight ponytails and weaving and tight braiding.  I have been using this product over 1 month now and it works. My edges is starting to show peach fuss. The smell is like a strong onion smell, so I prefer to use it over night,  I mix this with Emu oil, olive oil, tea tree oil and I put this on my hair, every other night. you don&#x27;t need much at all just 4-6 drops in your hand and rub it in the problem areas of your head. My problem area&#x27;s is my hair line, front and back.  I&#x27;ve noticed hair growth with in 1 month, But you also have to keep up with you daily, weekly ,monthly hair regimen. Try it what do you have to lose.  Thank you, Iyauna S Dearing</li>
            <li> great product.  I will help with breakage.</li>
            <li> I have used this according to instructions I have not seen the results I had hope for. I purchased 3 bottles 1.) 2 Potent and 2)&lt;br /&gt;. 1 Super Potent.  I have not finish using the Super Potent as of yet.  I have used this product for 3months, I am on the break period right now. (1 week)</li>
            <li> I never knew castor oil could make your hair this soft. I&#x27;ve used cadtor oil before, it thickened my hair but my hair was feeling very coarse. This product is awesome. My hair feels so soft and silky even after I left it unbraided  overnight. Thanks for this will buy more.</li>
            <li> I love the results but the smell is a a bit off putting</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good oil I bought it for my mom she&#x27;s really like and does the work</li>
            <li> it brought my hair out in spot. no good</li>
            <li> Product is excellent source for regrowing and nourishing your hair. I love it and recommend it to anyway who is in need of regrowing hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is GREAT i will be reodering for ME and my friend that is JUST about to finish chemo and is completely bald she says - i have been using this oil for about 3 wks now and its GROWING nicely - i am VERY happy just sorry i didnt find this product a year ago!!!!  it will become a STAPLE...</li>
            <li> Use like hair medicine. Smell Mediciny, but will help tremendously, good hot oil treatment but wash out afterwards</li>
            <li> I love it I like the way it makes my hair feel. Don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> This product arrived fast I am heard about this product from a natural hair care website and I am using it for hair loss treatment. So far its working</li>
            <li> This made my hair grow so much I&#x27;ve been using it for a month and a half and seeing a lot if new growth. The only thing is the smell it it warns you about that. But ill post pic soon so you guys could see my before and after.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much growth yet....but we&#x27;ll see what happens</li>
            <li> this is a very good product i told friend i love it it does what it says thank you will buy again</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because of a thinning crown. I&#x27;ve been using it for a week (7 of my 90 day challenge) along with my trusty steamer, and there is definitely an improvement in fullness and porosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My goal is fuller, longer, healthy hair, so I&#x27;ll continue to use this every night with my steamer and 10 min massages for the next 83 days and see where I land :D So, here&#x27;s my Warning - This stuff is thick so a little goes a long way - I would use caution when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But yeah, so far, I&#x27;m happy with my Potent JBCO and as long as it works for me, I will continue to order. I&#x27;ll come back with updates after my 90 day mark...</li>
            <li> I dont see what was so potent about this product.....I used it for a month. I should have known because some of the pictures on the bottles look so fake~</li>
            <li> It actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> I just began my second 90 day run. I&#x27;m looking forward to greater improvements this year. Patience is important because the problems weren created suddenly . I feel purchase was worth it</li>
            <li> Not working for me,after seeing all the positive reviews I thought it would done some miracle to me too but I guess I was wrong :-(</li>
            <li> I love this product and it made my hair grow it also thicken my hair. Its a really good product to buy mainly for your edges if you like wearing braided styles.</li>
            <li> This is a work in progress.  I appreciate this product and hope it helps my hair.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, it revitalizes dull hair, the scent is pretty strong but adding a little essence of lavender does the trick.</li>
            <li> This oil eliminated dry itchy scalp...thicken my shredded areas in only 30 days.I  Will be a forever customer of this product.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this product for about 6 weeks now and i must say i was pratically bald in my crown area and my hair is growing in nicely i am totally excited about that. Its taking time but i see results so i guess i cant ask for much more than that. Its worth a try but its not going to work over night so be patient. UPDATE: I no longer use this product i used it three months faithfully and did not see the results i thought i would see. I will just stick to jbco</li>
            <li> Does just what it says it does.</li>
            <li> I started using this product three weeks ago, so far so good.  My hair grows and thicken some, but I am not sure if is the oil or the laser I am using .  I use both together and so far so good.  I will continue to use up to the three months.  Karine Martin, Modena, NY</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my husband</li>
            <li> I did not see any results. I followed the directions 100%. I only used one bottle which lasted 2 weeks more or less.</li>
            <li> Iv been using about 3 weeks and I cant really tell at this point.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing exactly what it said it would. Will for sure purchase this product again, matter of fact going to do it right now.</li>
            <li> Yes I love this stuff it a good oil I will be ordering it again</li>
            <li> Yes....I been using it for about 3 weeks now can&#x27;t wait to see if it really thickens my hair. I plan on using it for about 3 months to notice results.</li>
            <li> I like this oil...a lot! I wear my hair in braids and I&#x27;ve noticed my roots getting puffier a lot sooner. I am planning on getting my hair cut short next week and am looking forward to using this oil to see how fast I can grow it back. I am using this oil in combination with the rejuvenating black castor oil. I use this oil to seal my hair just before I braid it so that when I take it down it&#x27;s nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Made my edges grow, in conjunction with taking vitamins and good hair care!</li>
            <li> Well i just got it a month ago to soon to tell if i got any new growth it says it may take 90days or more to see growth. iam still using it. i may have to do another review</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble growing my nape &amp; temple areas since going natural 4 years ago.It had thinned &amp; the hair kept breaking. I have fine 4a/b hair with a tiny 3c patch &amp; the nape hair is the most fragile,plus I sleep on my back. Last year I saw a dermatologist &amp; used a steroid cream &amp; got steroid shots. It gradually started growing in but this past winter I was under a lot of stress, &amp; that plus a dry cold spell in January caused the new hair to thin &amp; break.After trying extra moisturizers without results I discovered this product by accident. After my first bottle I noticed a bit of regrowth &amp; by second bottle there was a lot of improvement, with some hair growing where there hadn&#x27;t been any for a long time.It continues to grow &amp; fill in the thinner areas. I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle now &amp; will continue to use it as long as I get results.One bit of caution: it has a strong onion/garlic smell but it vanishes after awhile. I apply it twice daily &amp; sleep in a Silky Wrap or satin cap.</li>
            <li> I have box braids but I see results in my edges so I think it worked on my entire head</li>
