            <li>Probably 20% of the people are losing their eyesight or just being kind.  </li>

            <li>She asked me what I was using from the line and after mentioning the mineral veil, warmth, medium beige (I purchased more than this)</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Great product, highly recommend for people with oily skin prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li>good price, fast service &#x3D; \\&quot;carefree shopping\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>I use it under Aveeno Positively Radiant SPF 15 moisturizer and they make a good duo.  </li>
            <li>I still wake up with the same beautiful woman I went to sleep with the night before.</li>
            <li>am currently 58, spend a lot of time in the sun and sadly, do not have the best face care routine.  </li>
            <li>My skin is silky and smooth all day.</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so smooth.</li>
            <li>I even wear it with no makeup, makes my skin look so smooth</li>
            <li>It will take away the spots on your face and make your face really smooth.  </li>
            <li>It goes on easily, dries quickly, and is never sticky.  </li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it might work more effectively for others.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this feels amazing.</li>
            <li>Often times the website only publishes good reviews...</li>
            <li>wasnt sure if this product was the real deal or not.</li>
            <li>What this lotion helps with is keeping skin soft and pliable so that it washes off more easily when it dies.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know what it does for me in particular, but I like the concept of face vitamins, I guess, and the fragrance is very light.  </li>
            <li>Love this product also, as I said, I am older</li>
            <li>You may not need it everyday but it works great befor moisturizing.</li>
            <li>This is the same product at a better price, with no traffic congestion, no parking problems, and my shipping was free.  </li>
            <li>and I use it before bed, by morning my skin looks better and it helps clear up my breakouts.</li>
            <li>The foundation primer is worth every dime you&#x27;ll pay for it.  </li>
            <li>It completely changes my complexion, makes my skin softer, smoother, and much more even looking.</li>
            <li>Not only was it delivered more quickly than promised, but it was packaged just as you would want it as well.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have to apply any primer after this product because it makes my skin smooth enough to apply the powder on top.  </li>
            <li>Bare Minerals is the brand of cleansing products I use and love.</li>
            <li>I love Bare Escentuals.</li>
            <li>Very mild and leaves your skin really soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>perhaps - I do not have extremely pretty skin,  </li>
            <li>I am interested in your reactions and the observations of your friends.</li>
            <li>but in my opinion, I would not have purchased this product from Ulta if I was aware of this.</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin smooth and clear.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like most products that are supposed to help with breakouts.</li>
            <li>I am told I have a certain smoothness and \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my complexion.  </li>
            <li>I apply this to clean skin under my Bare Minerals makeup powder.  </li>
            <li>This helps my skin so much.</li>
            <li>I really like this line of face products.</li>
            <li>Moisturises very well</li>
            <li>Really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This stuff really works.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Basically keeps blemishes from happening (because when I run out of the product, the blemishes come!), and keeps my face from becoming dry and flaky, when nothing else would.  </li>
            <li>I also just started using Bare Minerals, and this product actually helps it to look better.</li>
            <li>I already use Bare and rare mineral products but had never tried this one.</li>
            <li>I am a really older woman and if it works for me, it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li>If your skin gets that \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling after washing and you don&#x27;t have a better moisturizer on-hand this will help get rid of the tight feeling without leaving your skin oily.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone of any age.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve even noticed when I am breaking out a little more</li>
            <li>I never thought this stuff in the little bottle would keep my face so smooth and flawless-no acne!  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much I like this product.</li>
            <li>LOVE this product, I wear it under sunscreen everyday.</li>
            <li>I use this first, then the PrimeTime foundation primer, then Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li>Check with a Bare Escentuals employee to see if they can confirm the recall if you still interested in it</li>
            <li>Works great and only need a little bit to go a long way.  </li>
            <li>This extra step makes the makeup look smooth and my pours look smaller.</li>
            <li>Be careful when reading the reviews on this site if you look carefully most are pulled straight from the bare essential site...</li>
            <li>It comes in a smaller bottle than I&#x27;d prefer, but you don&#x27;t need very much.</li>
            <li>Stay pretty regular, but sometimes it&#x27;s hit or miss on those really busy days.  </li>
            <li>This product for me so far has done nonething for me...</li>
            <li>What I like about the product is that it enhances her natural beauty without making her look like a \\&quot;painted lady\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>makes me wonder if this is old or something is a bit off?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly eight years</li>
            <li>I guess this was old since the company doesn&#x27;t make it anymore?</li>
            <li>but when I looked closer I noticed they were from the bare essential website which means they pulled all the positive ones...</li>
            <li>I ordered a Bare Essentials product kit for my wife who has very sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>While I often credit bare minerals as a whole for clearing up my face, I should really give credit where credit is due.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very light, but makes my skin feel less dry prior to applying my makeup.  </li>
            <li>I generally cleanse my face with a Bare Escentual face wash.  </li>
            <li>Bare Essentials feels itchy without it.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Bare Escentuals i.d.</li>
            <li>I think that it helps to make for a smoother application, and for a longer duration, of the Bare Minerals make-up.  </li>
            <li>Lost count of the number of years I have used the bare Escentuals Skin Rev-Er-Upper.  </li>
            <li>Bare Escentuals.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I stopped at the Bare Escentuals store tonight on my way home from work and asked one of the employees what the cause may be.</li>
            <li>Apparently, this product was recalled because of the ingredients and she told me to throw it out.</li>
            <li>but she said Bare Escentuals no longer carries it.</li>
            <li>Bare Essentuals bareMinerals</li>
            <li>This helps my Bare Escentuals go on smoother.</li>
            <li>I have used Bare Escentuals for 11years now..</li>
            <li>I have purchased these Bare Minerals products at a local store</li>
            <li>She LOVES the products - all of the Bare Essential products she has tried to date</li>
            <li>skin rev-re upper that I purchased from Bare Escentuals (which looks like what is pictured for this product).....</li>
            <li>I have had acne since I turned 15 and as of 5 years ago when I switched to bare minerals, my skin finally, at the age of 30, cleared up totally.</li>
            <li>Having purchased this product in the past at the Bare Escentuals Store, or similar beauty product establishment, I had hoped to receive exactly what was specified in my order, and as prmoptly as possible.  </li>

            <li> I was so excited that this product only took 2 days to come in; only to find that they sent me the wrong size.  </li>
            <li> However, if you are using this brand and have tried this product or are currently using it, be careful.</li>
            <li> Even products that previously were advertised by other companies for sensitive skin cause her to break out.  </li>
            <li> I use this every single morning, with or without makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s not available in the Bare Escentuals stores anymore</li>

            <li> It has a slight scent but nothing unbearable as others have stated.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I apply this to clean skin under my Bare Minerals makeup powder.  I bought it to give a healthier look and feel to my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is wonderful to put on before your moisturizer. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few years and I get less pimples and tighter skin, Its not a miracle cream but it gives your moisturizer and skin care regime that extra kick ! Highly recommend and this price is almost half as in Sephora ! Will be buying Again &amp; again !</li>
            <li> Love this product also, as I said, I am older so I need the extra moisture around my eyes.  I have used this product for approximately 5 years. Love it.</li>
            <li> I give it a five-star, as the product is just as I remember when I bought it.</li>
            <li> I like to use this as a primer. Bare Essentials feels itchy without it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased these Bare Minerals products at a local store but I won&#x27;t be doing that again.  This is the same product at a better price, with no traffic congestion, no parking problems, and my shipping was free.  What more could I ask for??</li>
            <li> I like how this feels and makes my skin look, but I am disgusted by the smell.  I cannot seem to figure out what it smells like either...almost like stale beer.  I will keep using it though because I like the results and I&#x27;ve certainly smelled a lot worst things in my life and haven&#x27;t gotten rid of them.  :-)</li>
            <li> I am 60 years old and was seriously thinking of having a surgical eye lift due to a lot of lines under my eyes. I tried this product and use it twice a day (morning and evening). I immediately noticed a difference so I know that the product works. In addition, my friends noticed the difference and asked me what I was using. Great product at a great price!</li>
            <li> Be careful when reading the reviews on this site if you look carefully most are pulled straight from the bare essential site...I often read the reviews from amazon before purchasing any type of item because they are objective...Reviews from the actual website are not very objective..Often times the website only publishes good reviews...Reviews from amazon are objective if they have not been pulled from the actual site...I bought this product because of all the good reviews but when I looked closer I noticed they were from the bare essential website which means they pulled all the positive ones...well I bought this product and I didnt see any difference in my skin..This product for me so far has done nonething for me...I will comment again if I notice any difference as time goes on</li>
            <li> I used this for several years. If you have you have combination skin or are using drying products like retinal this will actually exfoliate those areas. You may not need it everyday but it works great befor moisturizing.</li>
            <li> This arrived promptly and was what I wanted. Makes my skin feel really good and refreshed.</li>
            <li> I was happy to find it. The stores are no longer carrying it.</li>
            <li> This helps my skin so much. I only use it every once in a while and I&#x27;ve even noticed when I am breaking out a little more and I use it before bed, by morning my skin looks better and it helps clear up my breakouts. It comes in a smaller bottle than I&#x27;d prefer, but you don&#x27;t need very much. I highly recommend this product to anyone of any age. Makes my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My sister bought this lightweight lotion and didn&#x27;t like it, so she gave it to me, and I liked it fine.  Don&#x27;t know what it does for me in particular, but I like the concept of face vitamins, I guess, and the fragrance is very light.  I use it under Aveeno Positively Radiant SPF 15 moisturizer and they make a good duo.  But at this price point, I don&#x27;t expect to buy any more after it is used up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;review of \\&quot;Bare Escentuals i.d. BareVitamins Skin Rev-er Upper\\&quot;</li>
            <li> wasnt sure if this product was the real deal or not. the bottles I got didnt have the logo I.d . im very skeptical about this product.  not sure I want  to use this product on my face .</li>
            <li> I like to use this under the Foundation Primer.  It goes on easily, dries quickly, and is never sticky.  I think that it helps to make for a smoother application, and for a longer duration, of the Bare Minerals make-up.  I tend to be oily in some places and I think this helps.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Bare Essentials product kit for my wife who has very sensitive skin.  Even products that previously were advertised by other companies for sensitive skin cause her to break out.  My wife doesn&#x27;t NEED makeup but part of feeling feminine I suppose is using it.  She LOVES the products - all of the Bare Essential products she has tried to date and she has never had a breakout as a result.  What I like about the product is that it enhances her natural beauty without making her look like a \\&quot;painted lady\\&quot;.  I still wake up with the same beautiful woman I went to sleep with the night before.</li>
            <li> I have never used a primer before but thought I would try this.  It looks like baby oil and  smooths on like satin. My skin is silky and smooth all day. A little goes a long way. I am impressed.</li>
            <li> Basically keeps blemishes from happening (because when I run out of the product, the blemishes come!), and keeps my face from becoming dry and flaky, when nothing else would.  Can&#x27;t be without it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product daily for years. Unbeatable price through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Lost count of the number of years I have used the bare Escentuals Skin Rev-Er-Upper.  I generally cleanse my face with a Bare Escentual face wash.  Use my regular BE moisturizer, allow to absorb, then use the vitamin Rev-Er-Upper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently 58, spend a lot of time in the sun and sadly, do not have the best face care routine.  Stay pretty regular, but sometimes it&#x27;s hit or miss on those really busy days.  I&#x27;ll just cleanse and use the vitamin product, the foundation primer, spend about 10 minutes with minimal make-up products (all BE) and I&#x27;m good for the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon does have some of the best pricing around on BE products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little side note of interest...perhaps - I do not have extremely pretty skin,  I&#x27;m a sun lover and not a slave to a \\&quot;Beauty Routine\\&quot; for my face.  Since I have been using BE products,(approximately 15 years, I have  received numerous compliments on my facial skin and my neck.  As stated I DO NOT have really nice skin.  I use really good products and all of them Bare Escentuals.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to share this - often we hear \\&quot;OH, your make up looks so good!\\&quot;  Is it your make up you want complimented or your skin?  I prefer the skin compliment (although I&#x27;ll take whatever I can get).&lt;br /&gt;At 3 months shy of 59 I like to hear my skin looks nice.  I firmly believe 80% of it is the continual use of BE products and THIS vitamin product! Probably 20% of the people are losing their eyesight or just being kind.  I am told I have a certain smoothness and \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to my complexion.  I also have age spots and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt; Indulge yourself in several of the usual skincare products, the vitamin product should be a regular as well as whatever moisturizer your skin type requires.  I use the facial scrub daily (a wonderful product also).  The foundation primer is worth every dime you&#x27;ll pay for it.  Put it on before applying makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Please let me know if you try and use these products.  I am interested in your reactions and the observations of your friends. I think you will be amazed in a very short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;BE should pay me commission don&#x27;t you think.  I&#x27;ve sold lots of folks on these products.  They simply work.nd the observations of your friends. I think you will be amazed in a very short period of time.&lt;br /&gt;BE should pay me commission don&#x27;t you think.  I&#x27;ve sold lots of folks on these products.  They simply work.</li>
            <li> I was so excited that this product only took 2 days to come in; only to find that they sent me the wrong size.  I knew it was the wrong size right away.  The 1 ounce print on the bottle itself was covered with a sticky label that said 2.3 ounces.  I&#x27;m sad.....$31.99&lt;br /&gt;Sending back and maybe re-order?????</li>
            <li> I really like this line of face products. Use this after cleansing  followed by a moisturizer . Also before putting on makeup. Have not seen dramatic results yet, but feel it is calming to my skin. That&#x27;s a plus. I like it.</li>
            <li> Bottle is not as pictured and not exactly like the i.d. bareVitamins skin rev-re upper that I purchased from Bare Escentuals (which looks like what is pictured for this product).....makes me wonder if this is old or something is a bit off?</li>
            <li> Like this product; I feel it&#x27;s good for my complexion.  Also, it&#x27;s not available in the Bare Escentuals stores anymore and I probably will stock up via Amazon.</li>
            <li> this is a really good exfoliator for your face. I rub it in and wait a few seconds and start massaging my face and the dead skin just rolls off. Very mild and leaves your skin really soft.</li>
            <li> LOVE this product, I wear it under sunscreen everyday. Moisturises very well and I got compliments that my skin was glowing. Try this product!</li>
            <li> I was surprised how much I like this product. I was using Olay daily regenerating serum but I like this product better. I also just started using Bare Minerals, and this product actually helps it to look better. The product arrived quickly and the price is good.</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product via one of their starter kits last year.  WOWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!  I never thought this stuff in the little bottle would keep my face so smooth and flawless-no acne!  I really don&#x27;t have to apply any primer after this product because it makes my skin smooth enough to apply the powder on top.  It gave the appearance that my pores were actually smaller.  This stuff is great.  It has a slight scent but nothing unbearable as others have stated.  My skin loves it as I never got any rash or had any problems with this product.  THIS IS GOOD STUFF!</li>
            <li> Great product! I love the way my skin looks every morning when I use this!</li>
            <li> I have used this for two weeks now. My skin has never looked so smooth. Within a week I had people commenting on my skin and how great it looked. I already use Bare and rare mineral products but had never tried this one. I have had acne since I turned 15 and as of 5 years ago when I switched to bare minerals, my skin finally, at the age of 30, cleared up totally. This extra step makes the makeup look smooth and my pours look smaller. I even wear it with no makeup, makes my skin look so smooth it looks like I am!!!! Love it love it love it!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product on and off for years, and every time I stop using it I notice a difference. I use it in the mornings a little after washing and moisturizing but before I put on my foundation primer. The big benefit is its skin resurfacing qualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry skin, so dead skin is constantly clogging up my pores and causing breakouts. What this lotion helps with is keeping skin soft and pliable so that it washes off more easily when it dies. The active ingredient, salicylic acid is well known for its acne treating qualities. Sometimes products with salicylic acid end up being too harsh, but this lotion is gentle despite that, and still manages to help prevent future breakouts. It also doubles as a lightweight moisturizer. If your skin gets that \\&quot;tight\\&quot; feeling after washing and you don&#x27;t have a better moisturizer on-hand this will help get rid of the tight feeling without leaving your skin oily.</li>
            <li> Works great and only need a little bit to go a long way.  Keeps skin blemishes at bay.  Good price too!</li>
            <li> Really like this product.  I&#x27;ve used it for years.</li>
            <li> I use this every single morning, with or without makeup. It completely changes my complexion, makes my skin softer, smoother, and much more even looking. I have very sensitive skin, and this feels amazing. A little goes a long way too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years instead of regular moisturizer.  It&#x27;s very light, but makes my skin feel less dry prior to applying my makeup.  I use this first, then the PrimeTime foundation primer, then Bare Minerals foundation.</li>
            <li> LOVE this! Non greasy feeling and seems to make my makeup last all day!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Bare Escentuals brand for almost two months and noticed my skin was breaking out the past few weeks. I stopped at the Bare Escentuals store tonight on my way home from work and asked one of the employees what the cause may be. She asked me what I was using from the line and after mentioning the mineral veil, warmth, medium beige (I purchased more than this) The second I said the skin rev-er upper, her mouth dropped. Apparently, this product was recalled because of the ingredients and she told me to throw it out. I bought this from Ulta about 4 weeks ago but she said Bare Escentuals no longer carries it. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different so it might work more effectively for others. However, if you are using this brand and have tried this product or are currently using it, be careful. My breakouts are worse at 25 than when I was teenager and I am no longer going to use it. Check with a Bare Escentuals employee to see if they can confirm the recall if you still interested in it but in my opinion, I would not have purchased this product from Ulta if I was aware of this. Hope this might help!</li>
            <li> Bare Essentuals bareMinerals Skin Rev-Er Upper is a part of my daily cleansing routine.  Bare Minerals is the brand of cleansing products I use and love.</li>
            <li> What a great product! While I often credit bare minerals as a whole for clearing up my face, I should really give credit where credit is due. And this packs an awesome punch.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works. It totally helps with my oily skin and even reduced my breakouts. It doesn&#x27;t dry out skin like most products that are supposed to help with breakouts. Great product, highly recommend for people with oily skin prone to breakouts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for nearly eight years and I can&#x27;t recommend it enough! If I forget to apply it in the morning, my face will tell me by the evening. This keeps my skin smooth and clear. Also, this is the best price I&#x27;ve found in all my years of buying this produce. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is a very nice skin cream to have.  It helps to brighten and minimize lines as well.  You will like this cream.  However, you will see the results as soon as 2 continuous nights of use.</li>
            <li> This stuff has been a staple in my regime for over 10 years.</li>
            <li> Having purchased this product in the past at the Bare Escentuals Store, or similar beauty product establishment, I had hoped to receive exactly what was specified in my order, and as prmoptly as possible.  Not only was it delivered more quickly than promised, but it was packaged just as you would want it as well.  Very satisfied---good price, fast service &#x3D; \\&quot;carefree shopping\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> This is the best face lotion I have ever used. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I&#x27;m so happy I can buy it on Amazon now! It moisturizes your face without being greasy</li>
            <li> I guess this was old since the company doesn&#x27;t make it anymore? It smelled terrible so I threw it out</li>
            <li> I love Bare Escentuals. This helps my Bare Escentuals go on smoother. I have used Bare Escentuals for 11years now..</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I am on my second bottle.  It will take away the spots on your face and make your face really smooth.  I am a really older woman and if it works for me, it will work for anyone.</li>
            <li> Great way to prep your face for makeup.</li>
            <li> This is not the same cream, I would not recommend this product!!</li>
