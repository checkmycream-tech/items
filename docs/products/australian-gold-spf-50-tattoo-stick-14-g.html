            <li>LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell and consistancy</li>
            <li>Guess I should have payed more attention to the description.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>have used  before and love it</li>
            <li>though it would be the size of deodorant, more like a sample size</li>
            <li>So far so good!</li>
            <li>Awesome other</li>
            <li>It blocks all the uv light, no matter what it&#x27;s a tanbed or outdoor sunlight.</li>
            <li>Great sunscreen in a tiny package.  </li>
            <li>I was sunkissed all over, save for my beautiful black tattoo, which still looks fresh!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too small to cover a full sleeve but the smell is awesome and worth it just for that.</li>
            <li>I have a full sleeve and was thinking this would be the size of a stick of deodorant.</li>
            <li>it were bigger (like in a pot-style)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply and a good value&lt;</li>
            <li>You are better off buying any 50 proof sunscreen for a better price and larger size.</li>
            <li>Might change the stars as I use it depending on how quickly it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li>and it did exactly what I was hoping!  </li>
            <li>(It was my first time tanning this season) and there was a DISTINCT line of where I applied the tattoo stick to the rest of my stomach.</li>
            <li>They are small but easy to use and apply a nice layer of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It melts if it gets hot, as in a boat.  </li>
            <li>When you first look at the picture</li>
            <li>It thoroughly protected my tattoo and my tattoo is still extremely vibrant.</li>
            <li>I just got a new tattoo and was worried about protecting it from fading in the tanning bed.  </li>
            <li>The small size allow for better application control.  </li>
            <li>and they took it down because it didn&#x27;t fit the guidelines.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure suntanning lotion would have done the same job - price a little high</li>
            <li>Easy to apply without any wasted product</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband who has 2 sleeves and 2 large tats on his back.</li>
            <li>Goes on clear</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t make it through the whole Key West trip</li>
            <li>Does not leave funny tanlines like some of the other tattoo savers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>not sure it&#x27;s worth $8-10</li>

            <li> When I got the stick there was a large white label on the black cover down to the roller on the bottom.</li>

            <li> No biggie, just peel it off right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing the sticker, the black cap would not seat back onto the bottom.</li>
            <li> I have a few other brands and they are all the same way - I get it.</li>
            <li> And its so little you can put it in your purse or even a pocket and not have to worry about it.  </li>
            <li> then it being really small.</li>
            <li> but I knew it would be small!</li>
            <li> Beware this stick is very small</li>
            <li> Seriously tell them it was messed up and they yank the feedback.</li>
            <li> For the price the amount you get is ridiculous.  </li>
            <li> This thing is SMALL!!!</li>
            <li> I used it on an 11&amp;#34; tattoo I have  on my lower stomach ended up getting burnt in the tanning somewhat badly</li>
            <li> It looks bad on the tattoo- gray and filmy.  </li>

            <li> This stuff is NO joke! I used it on an 11&amp;#34; tattoo I have  on my lower stomach ended up getting burnt in the tanning somewhat badly (It was my first time tanning this season) and there was a DISTINCT line of where I applied the tattoo stick to the rest of my stomach. It thoroughly protected my tattoo and my tattoo is still extremely vibrant. Beware this stick is very small not sure it&#x27;s worth $8-10 but I&#x27;d rather protect my lifelong investments of my tattoo and spend the extra cash.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had on of these before but not from this company. They are small but easy to use and apply a nice layer of protection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently purchased one to take to Sri Lanka with me. When I got the stick there was a large white label on the black cover down to the roller on the bottom. No biggie, just peel it off right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After removing the sticker, the black cap would not seat back onto the bottom. It&#x27;s a pain in the butt to use something that gets sand in it constantly because it wont seal shut. I think someone knew this when they packaged it and use a sticker to hold the cap on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the email to leave feedback and they took it down because it didn&#x27;t fit the guidelines. What? Seriously tell them it was messed up and they yank the feedback.</li>
            <li> I just got a new tattoo and was worried about protecting it from fading in the tanning bed.  This stick was recommended to me and I have to say I&#x27;m impressed!  Easy to apply without any wasted product and it did exactly what I was hoping!  I was sunkissed all over, save for my beautiful black tattoo, which still looks fresh!</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE the smell and consistancy</li>
            <li> This thing is SMALL!!! I have a full sleeve and was thinking this would be the size of a stick of deodorant. It&#x27;s actually closer to a stick of Chapstick. Guess I should have payed more attention to the description.</li>
            <li> good product but I&#x27;m sure suntanning lotion would have done the same job - price a little high</li>
            <li> So far so good! Smells wonderful. Tiny though but I knew it would be small!</li>
            <li> It melts if it gets hot, as in a boat.  It looks bad on the tattoo- gray and filmy.  It smells good.  I would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Recommended by both my tattoo artist and my tanning salon. Goes on clear so you can go about your day after tanning. Does not leave funny tanlines like some of the other tattoo savers I&#x27;ve tried. And its so little you can put it in your purse or even a pocket and not have to worry about it.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price. It cost 3x more at the salon!</li>
            <li> just what I ordered. works.</li>
            <li> Awesome other then it being really small. Didn&#x27;t make it through the whole Key West trip</li>
            <li> Worked as hoped, it&#x27;s our go to brand!</li>
            <li> pay attention to the size, the tattoo stick is no bigger than my pinky finger in length. You are better off buying any 50 proof sunscreen for a better price and larger size.</li>
            <li> Love this product! It blocks all the uv light, no matter what it&#x27;s a tanbed or outdoor sunlight. Smells great!!</li>
            <li> It is a lot smaller than i expected for the price.  Might change the stars as I use it depending on how quickly it&#x27;s gone.</li>
            <li> These are great - the color on my tattoos have not faded at all.</li>
            <li> have used  before and love it</li>
            <li> Great sunscreen in a tiny package.  When you first look at the picture I though it would be the size of deodorant, more like a sample size but it does do what it claims.  The blues and aquas haven&#x27;t faded one bit after being out in the sun all day.  Remember to reapply like with any sunscreen.  Would buy again.  The small size allow for better application control.  I have a few other brands and they are all the same way - I get it.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it really works to protect a tattoo. It&#x27;s too small to cover a full sleeve but the smell is awesome and worth it just for that. I&#x27;ll keep it around just for a backup</li>
            <li> like the smell a lot but i do with it were bigger (like in a pot-style)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;easy to apply and a good value&lt;br /&gt;i use this when tanning</li>
            <li> Perhaps I should have read the ounces indicated on the label but I didn&#x27;t so my fault. For the price the amount you get is ridiculous.  It&#x27;s so tiny! Like something you&#x27;d find in the travel size section.  I got this for my husband who has 2 sleeves and 2 large tats on his back. It definitely won&#x27;t last long.</li>
