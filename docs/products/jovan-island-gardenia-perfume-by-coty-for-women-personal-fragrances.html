            <li>I was glad to see I could find it through Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s still a nice sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a fragrance that is light but has staying power which is why I love it.</li>
            <li>This fragrance smells very much like gardenia flowers I love it!</li>
            <li>Shipment was very quick.</li>
            <li>One day I sprayed the Cologne on me and the smell was beautiful, so now I buy it for me and as a quiet memory of my mother that it ever so close to me.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, and not a bad price either.</li>
            <li>Now I have to fine something else</li>
            <li>My boxes were damaged upon arrival but the product was just fine.</li>
            <li>Quick delivery!</li>
            <li>Refreshingly light scented.</li>
            <li>use it every spring and summer because of the light scent of gardenia-</li>
            <li>So pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine: &amp;#34;Ships From &amp; Sold By Amazon&amp;#34; - it was the genuine cologne.</li>
            <li>It does not look cheap.</li>
            <li>This has been my favorite summer perfume since it was first put on the market</li>
            <li>I was drawn to the light airy smell, the sweet aroma, not too flowery, and the fact that the fragrance lasts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light floral fragrance that stays with you, not heavy or overwhelming, perfect for daytime use or subtle evening.</li>
            <li>the product arrived quick and it was the original perfume</li>
            <li>Light, fresh scent.</li>
            <li>so close and such a good price, i will purchase it again.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad perfume.</li>
            <li>Love the soft scent not to strong.</li>
            <li>I think I just said it all----------I have loved this perfume for a long time--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence arrived first, and my husband, who LOVES gardenias, raved about it and said it was almost as good as smelling the actual flower.  </li>
            <li>This was a very satisfactory purchase!!</li>
            <li>It has soft sweet scent and that perfume is just like my mom.....very sweet!</li>
            <li>I love the scent but a light touch/spray goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like but about 6 perfumes, and most of them are higher end, but this sweet little perfume is just really appealing.</li>
            <li>The Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence has a very pure gardenia fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Being old enough to remember the true &amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34; I say this falls short, but if I didn&#x27;t remember, I would think this very good indeed.  </li>
            <li>Fresh young smells that reminds me of the garden I had as a child filled with gardenias.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this when I lived in New York State but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores where I live now.</li>
            <li>I got a better deal online than I could&#x27;ve gotten locally.</li>
            <li>Other frangrances, much more costly, have come out, but none like this, for all occassion use, 24/7!</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not a really complicated scent.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I ordered.</li>
            <li>After the passing of my mother I kept her Jovan Island of Gardenia Cologne Spray, first just as something to remind me of her.  </li>
            <li>Exactly want I wanted.</li>
            <li>This lasts all day &amp; to the next on my skin - go easy with the spray</li>
            <li>The scent is wonderful, but you only need one small spray at a time, or it can be a little overwhelming to others around you.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I would really like something that smells like this but has staying power.</li>
            <li>I can use it a couple of times a day and not worry about how much each spritz is costing me.</li>
            <li>but my husband couldn&#x27;t smell it either unless he got really</li>
            <li>it is very close to Jungle Gardena.  </li>
            <li>Maybe I put too much on, but my husband gagged and said it didn&#x27;t smell like gardenias.  </li>
            <li>Smells just like the real flowers.</li>
            <li>Lasts all day and subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Of the four gardenia&#x3D;type fragrances I have recently purchased from Amazon this is the one that most highly met my expectations, by far!  </li>
            <li>This is my wife&#x27;s very favorite perfume, and it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li>It is a soft and feminine scent that is recognizably gardenia.  </li>
            <li>I am much older now</li>
            <li>I highly recommend that one.</li>
            <li>wore Jungle Gardenia in high school.</li>
            <li>and actually I now am pretty much known to family and friends as Jovan Island</li>
            <li>Jovan always makes pleasing fragrances that are fresh and lasting.  </li>
            <li>This was the first perfume I ever owned, my mom got it for me when I was much younger</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried more expensive gardenia colognes and none are as true to the gardenia smell as this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s gardenia with a little extra \\&quot;summery\\&quot; kinds of scents but mostly gardenia.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It comes very close to an actual gardenia smell.</li>
            <li>I think for  a product with gardenia in the name, its scent should last the whole wear.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a simple gardenia fragrance with a hint of coconut -- a fun summer scent with lasting power.</li>
            <li>I hunted this perfume down for sentimental purposes, but I find myself wearing it more than other more expensive perfumes I own because I still feel refined wearing it.  </li>
            <li>This is  my wife&#x27;s favorite scent, and it is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the floral, gardenia smell lasts for only a few minutes, leaving behind a nice warm scent.</li>
            <li>Within a half hour of applying it, I can only smell it if I put my wrist right up to my nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to purchase scents over the internet; I got lucky</li>
            <li>After researching and reading Amazon reviews and other Internet reviews about gardenia perfumes, I bought Jovan Island Gardenia and Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence because they were both highly rated.  </li>

            <li> it is very close to Jungle Gardena.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I put too much on, but my husband gagged and said it didn&#x27;t smell like gardenias.  </li>
            <li> Smells just like the real flowers.</li>
            <li> Lasts all day and subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Of the four gardenia&#x3D;type fragrances I have recently purchased from Amazon this is the one that most highly met my expectations, by far!  </li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s very favorite perfume, and it&#x27;s hard to find.  </li>
            <li> It is a soft and feminine scent that is recognizably gardenia.  </li>
            <li> I am much older now</li>
            <li> I highly recommend that one.</li>
            <li> wore Jungle Gardenia in high school.</li>
            <li> and actually I now am pretty much known to family and friends as Jovan Island</li>
            <li> Jovan always makes pleasing fragrances that are fresh and lasting.  </li>
            <li> This was the first perfume I ever owned, my mom got it for me when I was much younger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried more expensive gardenia colognes and none are as true to the gardenia smell as this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s gardenia with a little extra \\&quot;summery\\&quot; kinds of scents but mostly gardenia.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It comes very close to an actual gardenia smell.</li>
            <li> I think for  a product with gardenia in the name, its scent should last the whole wear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple gardenia fragrance with a hint of coconut -- a fun summer scent with lasting power.</li>
            <li> I hunted this perfume down for sentimental purposes, but I find myself wearing it more than other more expensive perfumes I own because I still feel refined wearing it.  </li>
            <li> This is  my wife&#x27;s favorite scent, and it is hard to find locally.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the floral, gardenia smell lasts for only a few minutes, leaving behind a nice warm scent.</li>
            <li> Within a half hour of applying it, I can only smell it if I put my wrist right up to my nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to purchase scents over the internet; I got lucky</li>
            <li> After researching and reading Amazon reviews and other Internet reviews about gardenia perfumes, I bought Jovan Island Gardenia and Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence because they were both highly rated.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that it doesn’t last very long</li>
            <li> There is pretty coconut - NOT the heavy, sweet, fake, suntan lotion smell.  </li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s not easy where I live and can&#x27;t  travel or have smell-a-vision yet.</li>
            <li> It is not a loud fragrance</li>
            <li> I just love this fragrance, and it&#x27;s impossible to find locally anymore.</li>
            <li> I always go back to Island Gardenia when I am tempted to try other fragrances.  </li>
            <li> Lasts a long time!</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to empty the bottle.  </li>
            <li> Minus one star for this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not strong, but you can definitely appreciate the floral notes as well as the overlying scent of gardenia.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s drowned out by other scents, and I can&#x27;t tell what those are.  </li>
            <li> It lasts fairly long, if it had lasted a little longer</li>
            <li> There seem to be other tropical flowers along with the gardenia &amp; coconut</li>
            <li> Little by little local retailers quit carrying it.</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing that the scent isn&#x27;t there any more.  </li>
            <li> vendor is great-quick shipping and including little samples and gifts with merchandise.</li>
            <li> I will say that it doesn&#x27;t appear to last which is disappointing but the initial spritz smells heavenly.</li>
            <li> I have gotten a few compliments on it at work from the guys</li>
            <li> I will purchase this scent again (in fact I intend to stock up a few bottles).  </li>
            <li> Too heavy and musky.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and always have people compliment me on the fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Guys disliked.  </li>
            <li> It was too strong and too awful to even use as an air freshener.</li>
            <li> I cant smell any alcohol as with some other perfumes, even some expensive ones.  </li>
            <li> I think it has a faint smell of gardenias</li>
            <li> It does stay through the day but very faint, which is just what I like.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I got a bad bottle or something</li>
            <li> The problem I can smell musk ...which smells bad with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> If you like the scent of Gardenias you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in this cologne.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The Jovan Island Gardenia is just OK.  Initially the gardenia sent appears and then there is an after fragrance that interferes.  I decided to keep it and perhaps blend it with another fragrance.</li>
            <li> I really loved the smell of this cologne. It comes very close to an actual gardenia smell. The only problem is that it doesn’t last very long so I have to search for another.</li>
            <li> My favorite Gardenia cologne.  I&#x27;ve tried more expensive gardenia colognes and none are as true to the gardenia smell as this one.</li>
            <li> This has been my favorite summer perfume since it was first put on the market and so glad I was still able to get it online.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance.  Those who compliment me say this is a light, pleasant, sensual aroma and want to know what it is and where they can buy it.  Of course, I say Amazon.</li>
            <li> This is  my wife&#x27;s favorite scent, and it is hard to find locally. We are happy that you are a good source for it.</li>
            <li> I got a better deal online than I could&#x27;ve gotten locally. Great deal good price. I recommend product and seller.</li>
            <li> This is all my Grandmother will use. Love it. Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Nothing like gardenia!</li>
            <li> Refreshingly light scented.</li>
            <li> This fragrance has to be one of my all-time favorites!!  The aroma places you somewhere in the islands of your choice with the person of your choice.  Now, how can you beat that?  Every day should be a \\&quot;gardenia day\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I purchased Jovan Island Gardenia by Jovan for Women cologne spray from Amazon. I read the reviews and decided to try it. I am very pleased with the fragrance. It is in an easy-to-use spray bottle and smells lovely. I will say that it doesn&#x27;t appear to last which is disappointing but the initial spritz smells heavenly. I would really like something that smells like this but has staying power. Minus one star for this.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for decades!  Other frangrances, much more costly, have come out, but none like this, for all occassion use, 24/7!</li>
            <li> I have been using this particular product for many years - the fragrance has always seemed perfect for me -&lt;br /&gt;pleasing to anyone around me and actually I now am pretty much known to family and friends as Jovan Island&lt;br /&gt;Gardenia mom and grandma and friend.</li>
            <li> this fragance is the same one you remember from some years ago. Nice, not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This was the first perfume I ever owned, my mom got it for me when I was much younger, I loved how refined I felt wearing it and it didn&#x27;t take long for me to empty the bottle.  I am much older now and I recently started collecting perfumes as my mother did.  I hunted this perfume down for sentimental purposes, but I find myself wearing it more than other more expensive perfumes I own because I still feel refined wearing it.  I cant smell any alcohol as with some other perfumes, even some expensive ones.  I think its an excellent winter perfume, very earthy and warm.  Its an excellent perfume for any age too, I spray my own daughter in the mornings with it.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, and not a bad price either.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume i have been using it for over 30 years now!</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s a bargain.  It&#x27;s a simple gardenia fragrance with a hint of coconut -- a fun summer scent with lasting power.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift for my mother who loves gardenias. It was too strong and too awful to even use as an air freshener. She had to throw it away because it is not returnable since it is considered a hazardous material to ship.</li>
            <li> This is my wife&#x27;s very favorite perfume, and it&#x27;s hard to find.  She is always overjoyed whenever she gets a bottle.</li>
            <li> The scent is wonderful, but you only need one small spray at a time, or it can be a little overwhelming to others around you.</li>
            <li> It is very disappointing that the scent isn&#x27;t there any more.  Now I have to fine something else and that&#x27;s not easy where I live and can&#x27;t  travel or have smell-a-vision yet.</li>
            <li> I love this, as I really love the scent of gardenias.  It&#x27;s not strong, but you can definitely appreciate the floral notes as well as the overlying scent of gardenia.  Lovely!</li>
            <li> I think I just said it all----------I have loved this perfume for a long time--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every spring and summer because of the light scent of gardenia-</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold the scent. I was hoping it would would be like I bought years ago. Very disappointed in this cologne.</li>
            <li> This product i bought for my mother, who loves this perfume. When my mom wears it, it smells good on her and therefor this perfume will always remind of her. It has soft sweet scent and that perfume is just like my mom.....very sweet!</li>
            <li> This fragrance smells very much like gardenia flowers I love it! It is so feminine and buttery smelling I have gotten a few compliments on it at work from the guys, also you cant beat the price! I will be buying more of this in the future.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the floral, gardenia smell lasts for only a few minutes, leaving behind a nice warm scent. I think for  a product with gardenia in the name, its scent should last the whole wear.</li>
            <li> I always go back to Island Gardenia when I am tempted to try other fragrances.  Great for summer!</li>
            <li> Nice. Light, fresh scent. I&#x27;d buy it again for summer. It&#x27;s hard to purchase scents over the internet; I got lucky</li>
            <li> A friend wanted me to try Jovan Island Gardenia, which I found out that the Jovan Island Gardenia is just what it is an Island flower that was put in to cologne that smell awesome on the body.</li>
            <li> Love it! Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> Jovan always makes pleasing fragrances that are fresh and lasting.  I wanted a gardenia scent for daily use, but couldn&#x27;t justify spending $60+ for it.  This is affordable, and I love the scent on my skin.  I can use it a couple of times a day and not worry about how much each spritz is costing me.</li>
            <li> To be honest this scent is a bit too warm to resemble true gardenia smell. But it&#x27;s still a nice sweet scent.&lt;br /&gt;The vendor is great-quick shipping and including little samples and gifts with merchandise.</li>
            <li> not as strong as I would have liked it to be. thank you!</li>
            <li> I wear Island Gardenia a lot and every time I do wear it,&lt;br /&gt;I always get complimented on how good I smell!</li>
            <li> Perfect Experience! I will recommend this product and awesome experience with friends and family... I had no luck locating this product in stores within the Bay Area...</li>
            <li> Lovely, long-lasting fragrance</li>
            <li> So grateful to find this on AmzAzon. Have worn it for years, my favorite, and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores.  Lasts all day and subtle and pleasant.</li>
            <li> This is a lovely &amp; well-made gardenia scent.  There is pretty coconut - NOT the heavy, sweet, fake, suntan lotion smell.  There seem to be other tropical flowers along with the gardenia &amp; coconut but it&#x27;s not a really complicated scent.  If you don&#x27;t like gardenia, you will probably not like this.  This lasts all day &amp; to the next on my skin - go easy with the spray so you don&#x27;t offend people around you.  So pretty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought mine: &amp;#34;Ships From &amp; Sold By Amazon&amp;#34; - it was the genuine cologne.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I ordered. Shipment was very quick. Quality was excellent!</li>
            <li> I just love this fragrance, and it&#x27;s impossible to find locally anymore. It&#x27;s a very light floral fragrance that stays with you, not heavy or overwhelming, perfect for daytime use or subtle evening. I don&#x27;t like but about 6 perfumes, and most of them are higher end, but this sweet little perfume is just really appealing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with the smell of this cologne. It&#x27;s gardenia with a little extra \\&quot;summery\\&quot; kinds of scents but mostly gardenia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I got a bad bottle or something but I find the scent of this doesn&#x27;t last at all. Within a half hour of applying it, I can only smell it if I put my wrist right up to my nose. I thought maybe it was just my sense of smell or my allergies were kicking in or something but my husband couldn&#x27;t smell it either unless he got really close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear Elizabeth Arden \\&quot;Red Door\\&quot;, Diane Von Furstenberg \\&quot;Tatiana\\&quot;, Estee Lauder \\&quot;Beautiful\\&quot;, Elizabeth Taylor \\&quot;Passion\\&quot; on a fairly regular basis and also different bath and body works sprays and have never had a scent fade on me so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want it to reek or anything but I need for it to be longer lasting. I can&#x27;t be applying it every hour and for that reason, I don&#x27;t think I would buy it again but will look for another gardenia perfume.</li>
            <li> Of the four gardenia&#x3D;type fragrances I have recently purchased from Amazon this is the one that most highly met my expectations, by far!  It is a soft and feminine scent that is recognizably gardenia.  It lasts fairly long, if it had lasted a little longer I would have given it five stars.  I will purchase this scent again (in fact I intend to stock up a few bottles).  It is not a loud fragrance and I find myself drawing my wrists up to my nose sometimes just because it is so inviting to smell.  I&#x27;ve had several compliments on it already and plan to keep some on hand for gift giving too.  This was a very satisfactory purchase!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad perfume. It does not look cheap. It&#x27;s just not what I like. Too heavy and musky.</li>
            <li> My boxes were damaged upon arrival but the product was just fine. I love this fragrance always have and always  will!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This perfume arrived on time and in perfect condition.  Was delighted to be able to find as I have been looking for it to no avail.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of Gardenias, I wanted to find a cologne that had that smell. Jovan Island Gardenia is the one that smells most like the flower. I like it.</li>
            <li> This does not smell like gardenia to me.  The problem I can smell musk ...which smells bad with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> I get lots of complements on this have used for yrs and will use for many more has a lite fragence and the best cologene I have found</li>
            <li> My granddaughter loves Gardenia cologne and so I buy this on Amazon for her.  It is a beautiful fragrance and a very good value.</li>
            <li> Was glad to be able to get this scent. It has been a favorite of mine for many years. Little by little local retailers quit carrying it. So you can imagine my delight at finding this available still! It&#x27;s a fragrance that is light but has staying power which is why I love it.</li>
            <li> My favorite --- have been using it exclusively for about 40 years.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had better distribution.  It&#x27;s nowhere --- have to buy online.</li>
            <li> This fragrance is difficult to find so I buy many when I am getting low.  I use it everyday and always have people compliment me on the fragrance.  Thank you</li>
            <li> Wonderful gardenia smell - really just like the flower was poured in the bottle. I&#x27;m getting more.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with my purchase of Jovan Island of Gardenia Cologne Spray.  I fell in love with the fragrance on my mother.  I was drawn to the light airy smell, the sweet aroma, not too flowery, and the fact that the fragrance lasts. After the passing of my mother I kept her Jovan Island of Gardenia Cologne Spray, first just as something to remind me of her.  One day I sprayed the Cologne on me and the smell was beautiful, so now I buy it for me and as a quiet memory of my mother that it ever so close to me.</li>
            <li> it is very close to Jungle Gardena.  so close and such a good price, i will purchase it again.  it fits nicely in my purse.</li>
            <li> I love the scent but a light touch/spray goes a long way. It does stay through the day but very faint, which is just what I like.</li>
            <li> Exactly want I wanted.</li>
            <li> Being old enough to remember the true &amp;#34;Jungle Gardenia&amp;#34; I say this falls short, but if I didn&#x27;t remember, I would think this very good indeed.  The scent lingers well.</li>
            <li> Jovan Island Gardenia is wonderful. Fresh young smells that reminds me of the garden I had as a child filled with gardenias. Lasts a long time! I will order it again!</li>
            <li> This was for a friend.  This is the only perfume that she can wear.  She has been looking for it for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was sooooo glad to find it for her!</li>
            <li> Love the soft scent not to strong. Perfect for me.</li>
            <li> wowww sexy heady fragrance the perfect blend of floral and a hint of creamy musk its exotic to me the product arrived quick and it was the original perfume veryyyyy pleased</li>
            <li> After researching and reading Amazon reviews and other Internet reviews about gardenia perfumes, I bought Jovan Island Gardenia and Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence because they were both highly rated.  The Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence arrived first, and my husband, who LOVES gardenias, raved about it and said it was almost as good as smelling the actual flower.  Then, the Jovan Island Gardenia arrived.  Maybe I put too much on, but my husband gagged and said it didn&#x27;t smell like gardenias.  I think it has a faint smell of gardenias but it&#x27;s drowned out by other scents, and I can&#x27;t tell what those are.  The Terranova Gardenia Perfume Essence has a very pure gardenia fragrance.  It&#x27;s just wonderful!!  I highly recommend that one. As for the Jovan, oh well, I can always use the Jovan as an air freshener in the bathroom!</li>
            <li> wore Jungle Gardenia in high school. Guys disliked.  Started wearing Shalimar.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this when I lived in New York State but haven&#x27;t been able to find it in stores where I live now. I was glad to see I could find it through Amazon. I bought this on TH and it arrived on M. The scent is divine. Smells just like the real flowers. I love it. Try it. If you like the scent of Gardenias you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
