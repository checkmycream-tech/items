            <li> very moisturizing oil.</li>
            <li> works great! fast delivery of product</li>
            <li> I have bought the 12oz bottle. This is NOT EMU OIL!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is some oily oil n it is clear as coconut oil when melted!&lt;br /&gt;EMU oil is not this clear n NOT OILY.&lt;br /&gt;Why is iT that there is NO address of where this product is being made?&lt;br /&gt;I have emailed Dr Adorable numerous times about what is contained in the bottle and I have NEVER received a response.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this review will allow others to do research before purchasing.&lt;br /&gt;I spent £60. For the bottle as I was in the UK.&lt;br /&gt;I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED</li>
            <li> This liquid is a thick cloudy oil that glides on skin very easily.  A little drop goes a long way. I like this item very much.</li>
            <li> False Advertising!!!  Don&#x27;t be fooled. This is not an organic product. This product has no organic certification. This product has no certification of any kind. It could be anything. Does not appear to be emu oil</li>
            <li> I use emu oil as my nighttime moisturizer fresh out of the shower. I put a dime size drop in my hands with a drop of water and press it into my skin. It goes on quite oily, but afterwhile my skin just absorbs it and I&#x27;m left with an pretty glow. Since I&#x27;ve started using it again, I&#x27;ve noticed a marked difference in how radiant my skin looks -and even noticed that I now tend to break out less.</li>
            <li> THIS STUFF IS GOOD FOR YOU AND GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN</li>
            <li> I am a massage therapist and use emu oil every day .. I like this product .. Sometime glass bottle and dropper can be messy and slippery .. But after ordering several brands this is where i&#x27;ve landed.</li>
            <li> This works wonders for pain of sore muscles and skin if you suffer from diabetes or arthritis this is for you helps blood circulation.and great for hair and skin as well .</li>
            <li> Very pure. Very wonderful Emu oil.</li>
            <li> The product does not work. I have used on my skin and hair along with my daughter&#x27;s hair with no changes.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It absorbs well and is very light.  I would order it again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Just as described. Worked well for me!</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC,  THIS OIL RELIEVED THE SWELL ING IN MY KNEE OVERNIGHT!!!  TELL EVERYONE I KNOW ABOUT THIS OIL.  SELLER WILL PURCHASE FROM AGAIN</li>
            <li> Love the silky feel. My face has been clear and smoother since I started using it.</li>
            <li> make my hair very soft have not use on my skin yet would recommed to friend any family.</li>
            <li> So far only using on my face and hair as a moisturizer my skin looks great though, I really want to put it to use because I&#x27;ve heard it has tons of uses, either way my face is glowing so I&#x27;ll take that</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  The advertisement says that it is organic 100% Emu Oil.  However, the bottle you actually get has no labeling that states what the ingredients are and there are no certifications as to organic or what is in this product.  I have been buying products on Amazon for years and have never written a review before but felt I needed to do so for this product since the advertisement is so misleading.  If this product was actually what they claim, then there would be a label stating the ingredients and a certification stating it is organic.  There is no way to ascertain what ingredients are actually contained in this product.  BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK.</li>
            <li> Great wonderful well packaged will re order more</li>
            <li> This is my first time using Emu oil.  It&#x27;s doing a great job of helping with my super dry winter skin, even on my hands which get rough from frequent washing.  I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products and avoid the petroleum and paraffin products. It absorbs quickly and does not simply sit on top of skin. I did not notice a scent which is a plus.  I was worried I might smell like big bird..JK.  I&#x27;ve purchased other products from Dr Adorable before, like hazelnut oil and shea butter, seems to be a great source, reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is great; it comes in a bottle with a dropper, but is still petty messy. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it came in a bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> Best emu oil I have tried. Will order again. I like that it comes in a glass bottle with a glass dropper.</li>
