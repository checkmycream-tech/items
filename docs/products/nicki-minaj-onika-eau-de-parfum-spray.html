            <li>A YES MUST BYE MORE FOR SURE.</li>
            <li>I also have Pink Friday Deluxe Edition on the way too lol.</li>
            <li>Bottle is the best by far, more mature looking.</li>
            <li>^_^ I really love the bottle design reminds me of Jean Pauls fragrances, but hers looks unique in her own kind of way and to others strange.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to strong of a mix of sweet and musk.</li>
            <li>And Her My New Favorite Perfume</li>
            <li>Very light and non existant if you aren&#x27;t directly smelling your skin.</li>
            <li>I feel Onika is a more mature smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice but not WOW!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>For me it feels more like a body spray not parfum, but everyones different.</li>
            <li>a good perfume, that is not to strong and has a sweet faint scent.</li>
            <li>Smells very soft and sweet</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>It came fast too</li>
            <li>i looked everywhere to complete my perfume collection!</li>
            <li>I personally did not care for the smell is too flowery nothing like her first two scents</li>
            <li>The exact smell of the red flavor.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this seller and definitely the perfume itself.</li>

            <li> I have the Pink Friday and the Minajesty already</li>
            <li> and I must say that I favor the Onika and Pink Friday over Minajesty.</li>
            <li> This product must have been tampered with because IT&#x27;S WATERED DOWN AND SMELLS LIKE ALCOHOL SOLUTION!!!</li>
            <li> Anyways horrible scent that is not the case with this perfume if your into fresh or fruity scents after you just take a shower then this is for you.</li>
            <li> I am a fan of Nicki Minaj so lets just put it this way even if the scent would be horrible</li>
            <li> Absolutely disgusted with this!!</li>
            <li> I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO MY WORST ENEMY!</li>

            <li> I am a fan of Nicki Minaj so lets just put it this way even if the scent would be horrible I wouldn&#x27;t complain, but I would let you know. Either way I wanted to collect all of her fragrances. ^_^ I really love the bottle design reminds me of Jean Pauls fragrances, but hers looks unique in her own kind of way and to others strange. Anyways horrible scent that is not the case with this perfume if your into fresh or fruity scents after you just take a shower then this is for you. For me it feels more like a body spray not parfum, but everyones different.</li>

            <li> Bottle is the best by far, more mature looking. My sprayer was defective but the fragrance reminds me of chewing starbusts. The exact smell of the red flavor. It&#x27;s a nice but not WOW! fragrance. Very light and non existant if you aren&#x27;t directly smelling your skin. No lasting power what so ever. Not what I was expecting after purchasing minajesty. I wouldn&#x27;t recomend unless you collect the bottles.</li>
            <li> Smells very soft and sweet</li>
            <li> last all day. I have gotten so many compliments on this perfume.. love it</li>
            <li> Smells Sooooooo Good I Love It And Her My New Favorite Perfume By Her. You Can Wear It For Any Event And The Smell Lasts All Day.</li>
            <li> It smell Good and I like how big the size was.It came fast too</li>
            <li> All her stuff smells amazing</li>
            <li> It smells really nice. It doesn&#x27;t stay around long or it&#x27;s just so soothing, I get used to the smell. I&#x27;m happy. I think I like the pink ones a little more, but this definitely wasn&#x27;t a bad purchase.</li>
            <li> I brought it for my niece as a Christmas present and she loves it!</li>
            <li> A YES MUST BYE MORE FOR SURE. IT&#x27;S. SMELL SO GOOD</li>
            <li> Bought this for my mother and she loves the look and smell ! Queen Nicki does not disappoint .</li>
            <li> I love sweet and florals so this smells  awesome!</li>
