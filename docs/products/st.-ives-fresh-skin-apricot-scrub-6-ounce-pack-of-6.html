            <li>She&#x27;s glad I stopped her before she gave them all away.  </li>
            <li>Feels Great, smells good enough, and works.</li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using the St IVes scrub for a couple of months and am really pleased with it.</li>
            <li>This scrub has a more abrasive character.</li>
            <li>I love it but for some it may be too abrasive which is the reason I am amending my review.</li>
            <li>I love St. Ives Apricot Scrub.</li>

            <li>does actually keep my acne at bay, which, for the great price, is just astounding to me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My face does not feel clean if I&#x27;m without my Apricot scrub!</li>
            <li>At such a great price, I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t use this stuff.</li>
            <li>Use all the time and keeps my body smooth</li>
            <li>wanted to add to my review for people wanting to compare this scrub with others on the market, say Ance Free or the ones advertised on the TV.</li>
            <li>have acne, now u dont...keeping it clean, scrubbed morning and night before bed</li>
            <li>Really seen great results so far and intend to continue buying the product.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin so soft and smooth!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more coarse than most face scrubs I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>so one bottle lasts for a long time and is a good value.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and abrasive but does not dry out my face.</li>
            <li>I combine it with using my cheap $20 version of the clairsonic scrub brush, which together really smoothes my skin.</li>
            <li>and it keeps my face fresh.  </li>
            <li>Came quick and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This works well to exfoliate and leaves my skin feeling soft and very clean.  </li>
            <li>This facial scrub is not too harsh and I love that it smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this scrub for several years and haven&#x27;t found any better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly on my face but will sometime use on my back, shoulders and arms.</li>
            <li>The only scrub I use, even compared to other St Ives scrubs - this one really works for my oily skin that gets sebum build up and needs a good scrub to clean the pores.</li>
            <li>We love this product because the highly concentrated exfoliants are second to none in all the brands we&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>I tend to have large pores that want to develop blackheads on my chin.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans up your face..</li>
            <li>This stuff really seems to work.  </li>
            <li>My daughter thought that 6 containers was too much and started giving them away.  </li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>despite what some tell you, acne can be very linked to food and allergens.</li>
            <li>If I forget it at home during vacation, I really miss it.</li>
            <li>Very affordable face scrub.</li>
            <li>Using this product daily removes both the oily grease from my forehead and nose and significantly reduces the issues with my chin.  </li>
            <li>and I love the little scrubbies in it.  </li>
            <li>I am nearly 40, so I would have been helpful to know about this stuff in high school.</li>
            <li>Love St. Ives apricot scrub, i saw this deal on slick deals and had to pounce.</li>
            <li>In my case &amp;#34;foliculitus&amp;#34; i believe was the diagnosis, turns out the majority of the world actually has small pores, and all u need is to keep it clean (scrub away dead cells) and this scrub is magic.</li>
            <li>My teenage daughter has become a fan and only wants the &amp;#34;Blemish&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>its the right consistency, not too soft not too harsh</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone, it&#x27;s priced well and does not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like most other scrubs do, but adding a little moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very natural and last a long time.</li>
            <li>I also like that the scrubbing action comes from natural walnut shells rather than plastic beads found in other</li>
            <li>We love that the scrubbing ingredient is all natural (crushed apricot pit) compared to small plastic beads in other products.  </li>

            <li> Not overwhelming perfumed like some of the others.</li>

            <li> I get this all the time for my daughter.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for years... I mean like 20 and it keeps my face fresh.  My teenage daughter has become a fan and only wants the &amp;#34;Blemish&amp;#34; control type now.  Really cleans up your face.. you can feel the apricot scrub working.  Very natural and last a long time.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this if you love popping zits!!!</li>
            <li> Came quick and it&#x27;s exactly what I wanted. Will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> We love this product because the highly concentrated exfoliants are second to none in all the brands we&#x27;ve ever tried.

            <li> Great deal and great product.  Will buy again.</li>
            <li> A great product that the whole family uses. I like the exfoliating nature and of course the blemish fighting properties.</li>
            <li> Love St. Ives apricot scrub, i saw this deal on slick deals and had to pounce. effectively 50% off of what you&#x27;ll pay in retail stores.</li>

            <li> The product is good, I just never got a pack of 6.</li>
            <li> A great scrub and a good value but if you wait until this goes on sale at CVS or Walgreen, you can end up getting it cheaper. Alll in all though, a good deal.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  I have used it for years.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Best face scrub that i&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> My forehead and nose are my two oily spots.  However, in addition, since having kids, my chin has sprouted unwanted hair.  I remove the hair, but end up with inflammation from ingrown hairs.  Horrible!  Using this product daily removes both the oily grease from my forehead and nose and significantly reduces the issues with my chin.  I am nearly 40, so I would have been helpful to know about this stuff in high school.</li>
            <li> Great deal and product - I just place the bottle in the shower and wash my face, dry elbows, etc with it every shower. It&#x27;s done wonders for my skin and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling dried our or irritated.</li>

            <li> I have been using this for years.  It works great and I love the little scrubbies in it.  At such a great price, I don&#x27;t know why everyone doesn&#x27;t use this stuff.</li>
            <li> Love...&lt;br /&gt;- how it smells!!&lt;br /&gt;- how affordable it is!!&lt;br /&gt;- how my skin feels afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly on my face but will sometime use on my back, shoulders and arms. It leaves my skin so soft and smooth!! My husband is a big fan too!! He uses it daily on his face. I probably use it every other day.</li>
            <li> This facial scrub is not too harsh and I love that it smells great. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like most other scrubs do, but adding a little moisturizer wouldn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;It does actually keep my acne at bay, which, for the great price, is just astounding to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using St. Ives skincare for about six years and have never been disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;Even bought their exfoliating facial cloths for when I go to the gym after work.</li>
            <li> Use all the time and keeps my body smooth</li>
            <li> My girlfriend goes nuts over this stuff</li>
            <li> Much better value purchasing through Amazon than at the drugstore.  I&#x27;ve used this for decades.  I tend to have large pores that want to develop blackheads on my chin.  I use this everyday and the problem is solved.  Everyone compliments me on my skin.  My face does not feel clean if I&#x27;m without my Apricot scrub!</li>
            <li> Have always loved this stuff. Inexpensive, works well.</li>
            <li> This stuff really seems to work.  My daughter thought that 6 containers was too much and started giving them away.  She&#x27;s glad I stopped her before she gave them all away.  It works really well.</li>
            <li> have acne, now u dont...keeping it clean, scrubbed morning and night before bed will rid you of 98% of any facial acne. Of course you gotta stop eating beef and sugar...despite what some tell you, acne can be very linked to food and allergens. Red meat has hormones in it that they gave the cows and is passed on to already over-active glands acne ridden people have. In my case &amp;#34;foliculitus&amp;#34; i believe was the diagnosis, turns out the majority of the world actually has small pores, and all u need is to keep it clean (scrub away dead cells) and this scrub is magic.</li>
            <li> The only scrub I use, even compared to other St Ives scrubs - this one really works for my oily skin that gets sebum build up and needs a good scrub to clean the pores. I combine it with using my cheap $20 version of the clairsonic scrub brush, which together really smoothes my skin. I&#x27;m never without this scrub, I have to have another when this runs out. I notice fewer/none acne breakouts when I use this. If I forget it at home during vacation, I really miss it.</li>
            <li> Very affordable face scrub. Not overwhelming perfumed like some of the others. Really seen great results so far and intend to continue buying the product.</li>
            <li> Feels Great, smells good enough, and works. Only thing I use anymore</li>
            <li> This is the perfect exfoliation not just for face but for body as well. It leaves my face a little dry after washing but nothing too that face creme can&#x27;t handle.</li>
            <li> it instantly changes my face. love it. its the right consistency, not too soft not too harsh</li>
            <li> this stuff is great, worked wonders for me</li>
            <li> I have been using the St IVes scrub for a couple of months and am really pleased with it. I jumped at the opportunity to by the pack and have it delivered to my house. Speedy delivery. Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to add to my review for people wanting to compare this scrub with others on the market, say Ance Free or the ones advertised on the TV. This scrub has a more abrasive character. It is almost the consistency of a foot scrub. I love it but for some it may be too abrasive which is the reason I am amending my review.</li>
            <li> I love St. Ives Apricot Scrub. It&#x27;s more coarse than most face scrubs I&#x27;ve used but it feels amazing. It also smells refreshing which is always a plus. As far as controlling blemishes &amp; blackheads, it definitely helps but does not do the job by itself (at least for me). I recommend it to everyone, it&#x27;s priced well and does not dry out my skin.</li>
