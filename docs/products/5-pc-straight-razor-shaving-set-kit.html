            <li>have nothing but good things to say about the brush, soap, and I</li>
            <li>think the razor will turn out to be good</li>
            <li>It was a good purchase for my husbands birthday gift, he has always wanted one.</li>
            <li>GOOD RAZOR</li>
            <li>It was a gift for a good friend.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I was impressed with how fast it arrived.</li>
            <li>Excellent value in a complete kit.</li>
            <li>The grip to the razor,  while cheap feeling I think it should hold up fairly well.  </li>
            <li>Quality was great though and worth the price</li>
            <li>I can however say it shaved a spot on my arm that was very smooth.</li>
            <li>He loves the brush and the soap - he says the soap has left his skin the best out of any product when he shaves.</li>
            <li>but I think i&#x27;m gonna look into a better stone and strop.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just started using a straight razor and this kit comes in very handy.</li>
            <li>Probably the most important point: the razor itself is just a prop.</li>
            <li>Good product and do recommend to anyone who wants a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li>Good quality brand new stuff.</li>
            <li>The description is accurate to what you get but it leads you to believe that it is what is in the picture.</li>
            <li>the packing was excellent and the kit contained everything necessary to shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li>really excited to try strait shaving</li>
            <li>WITH SHAVE LOTION WOLD BE COOL TO COME WITH SOAP,DOSE COME WITH A SHARPENING STONE</li>
            <li>I enjoyed the soap and the brush was decent.</li>
            <li>BUT ALL WORTH THE PRICE.COMES</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using it right now.</li>
            <li>but overall I feel this is a great start up kit for someone that wants to try something different.</li>
            <li>Get something higher quality.  </li>
            <li>The whetstone simply doesn&#x27;t work, and the cream is just okay.  </li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t really give a review on the quality of shave it gets.</li>
            <li>Ordered this to get a start into straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>The brush is boar hair, so it&#x27;s nothing of real quality, but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>so I would have to say the blade wasn&#x27;t completely shave ready,  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have had at least a pamphlet.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to shaving with this type of razor</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have particularly  sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I purchased this product because I was looking for an inexpensive way to try out straight razor shaving and it seemed to have all the equipment necessary to get started immediately.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it does not come with instructions and the blade was not sharp at all.  </li>
            <li>The blade was not sharp enough to cut the hairs on my face.  </li>

            <li> The blade was not sharp enough to cut the hairs on my face.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really convinced the stone and possibly the strop provided are quality enough to get the blade up to shaving status.</li>
            <li> The stone isn&#x27;t enough to hone the razor hands down, don&#x27;t buy if you think it&#x27;s an all in one kit.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase, but if you are a beginner like me you may get frustrated with the stone and strop, so maybe plan on also needing to get a stone and strop separately.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come sharp, and one side was rounded while the other had a bit of a flatness.</li>
            <li> Any way I can get it sharp to shave with?</li>
            <li> However, he is struggling to get the blade sharp.</li>
            <li> the strop is thin and short, but it gets the job done, and it&#x27;s got webbing on the back for honing compounds.</li>
            <li> He has spent hours working on it with very little to no progress.</li>
            <li> The blade is just about worthless, It won&#x27;t hold an edge, and it oxidizes easily.</li>
            <li> The strop is thin fake leather, the brush is boar, which isn&#x27;t bad, bud not that great either.  </li>
            <li> the razor is really hard to get properly sharp.  </li>
            <li> The blade is still dull.  </li>
            <li> , the razor does not come honed (or at least mine didn&#x27;t)</li>
            <li> In fact we have not accomplished getting it sharp yet. :(</li>

            <li> Excellent value in a complete kit.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Good quality brand new stuff. I&#x27;m new to shaving with this type of razor so I can&#x27;t really give a review on the quality of shave it gets. I can however say it shaved a spot on my arm that was very smooth. The shipper had it sent certified mail and it arrived in just 2 days. Good product and do recommend to anyone who wants a good product at a decent price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come sharp, and one side was rounded while the other had a bit of a flatness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with my purchase. It arrived when stated. I&#x27;m using it right now. Just started using a straight razor and this kit comes in very handy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have particularly  sensitive skin so I would have to say the blade wasn&#x27;t completely shave ready,  it has tugs and pulls but nothing  I can&#x27;t handle. The grip to the razor,  while cheap feeling I think it should hold up fairly well.  The steel I think is fair quality.  The shave soap it comes with is low end,  or perhaps I&#x27;m just not loading the brush properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have yet to use the sharpening equipment as of yet,  but overall I feel this is a great start up kit for someone that wants to try something different.</li>

            <li> I enjoyed the soap and the brush was decent. That is about it. Razor wouldn&#x27;t even start to shave my face. When it showed up it was nothing like the picture. The description is accurate to what you get but it leads you to believe that it is what is in the picture. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone. I did not receive a kit bag. Looking back I would just order individual items instead of this kit.</li>
            <li> Belt does not help sharpen the blade</li>
            <li> I purchased this kit for my fiance. He loves the brush and the soap - he says the soap has left his skin the best out of any product when he shaves. However, he is struggling to get the blade sharp. He has spent hours working on it with very little to no progress. Makes me wonder if I should have gone with a more expensive brand.</li>

(also I can&#x27;t find any indication as to what the grit of the stone provided is)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really excited to try strait shaving but I think i&#x27;m gonna look into a better stone and strop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pleased with the purchase, but if you are a beginner like me you may get frustrated with the stone and strop, so maybe plan on also needing to get a stone and strop separately.</li>
            <li> This item was a Christmas gift.  the packing was excellent and the kit contained everything necessary to shave with a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I was impressed with how fast it arrived. It was a good purchase for my husbands birthday gift, he has always wanted one. I do however recommend that you buy a book on how to hone, strop and lather up the soap that comes with it. There are no instructions what so ever. It would have been nice to have had at least a pamphlet.</li>
            <li> GOOD RAZOR NOT ALL OF THE BLADE FINISHED HAS FLASH AND GAGGED LOOKING PARTS BUT ALL WORTH THE PRICE.COMES WITH SHAVE LOTION WOLD BE COOL TO COME WITH SOAP,DOSE COME WITH A SHARPENING STONE</li>
            <li> It was a gift for a good friend.</li>
