            <li>The make up is great but the bag is cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>I really apreciate the purchase, it matches perfectly my expectations about the product</li>
            <li>I reach for this one more often than any that I currently own (and believe me, I own a LOT of eye shadow palettes).</li>
            <li>I love the lipsitck the shawdow is ok and the mascara works good</li>
            <li>Pretty lipstick color and great colors for the eye shadows too.  </li>

            <li>and I love the colors.</li>
            <li>Looks cheap!</li>
            <li>Enjoyed getting to try the serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li>Make sure you look closely at this set.</li>
            <li>The picture makes it look like much more.</li>
            <li>They improve the mascara now is better than before</li>
            <li>(lancome still better for eye shadows and blush)</li>
            <li>but I still love the colors of my palette</li>
            <li>Im changing my givenchy eye liner for estee lauder  and love the creams after my moisturizer of course</li>
            <li>delivery was fast and packaging was great.</li>
            <li>Obviously many of these people leaving reviews haven&#x27;t ever done a GWP.</li>
            <li>Loved the eye colors they are true to color and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li>, the shipment was fast, I received just in a while, price was good</li>
            <li>I am glad to make the decision to buy this set because all that came in, it will be very useful.  </li>
            <li>I was able to split up the kit among my female family members for great stocking stuffers.  </li>
            <li>The container is so attractive and enough to keep more pieces</li>
            <li>The palette included in this GWP is better than all of the full priced items.</li>
            <li>pigmented!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bonus that I also use Advanced Night Repair and needed a travel version.</li>
            <li>one of those sets you get for FREE with purchase in macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom.&lt;br /&gt;Only</li>
            <li>I GAVE THIS RATING BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT GIFT IDEA, ESPECIALLY SINCE I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT KINDS OF MAKE UP TO BUY, THIS COMES WITH IT ALL</li>
            <li>I just didn&#x27;t like the purse thingy look cheap in person.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s here seems very nice but some other gift sets are a better value.</li>
            <li>I find that these are perfect to take on overnight trips, although you do have to be pretty careful sharpening them.</li>
            <li>this is definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>So many great items in one little bundle.</li>
            <li>This is something you can get free when you purchase any estee lauder products from Nordstrom right now.</li>
            <li>I always LOVE Estee Lauder and love that I can still get the gift when I miss the actual Gift with purchase sale!</li>
            <li>I recomended to buy it because it is a clasic gift set that it is very helpful for any circumstance and easy to carry on.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s much more convenient to purchase through Amazon for less than $40, since when you get it in the store you have to spend more to get this gift.</li>
            <li>you lol only receive 4 products in total !!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m enjoying the entire group.</li>
            <li>To Small , but the pruducts are really good</li>
            <li>Far from worth the price paid.</li>
            <li>it is ok as a gift for someone you are not very close to.</li>
            <li>The creams and the make up are just amaizing, I do prefer blue shadows with all this light colors that match smoky eyes.  </li>
            <li>I had to fill it with tissue paper to look decent when giving it as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li>The sample-size skin care is half-way decent for a sample-size.</li>
            <li>they are way more smaller than we expected.</li>
            <li>At the same time, I purchased several full priced palettes by Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier, etc.  </li>
            <li>Thank you for bringing them early.</li>
            <li>There was something for everyone - young and old.</li>
            <li>It comes in small sizes like it was sample and free .</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> Great gift package. Love it!</li>
            <li> Too expensive compared to another product of the same quantity and quality!</li>
            <li> these are like sample sizes. not worth it.</li>
            <li> enough to use. The items are small and portable. Should carefully choose the color before pủchasing coz&#x27; I did not and my lipstick color is ...urgh...</li>
            <li> Super product stays on and the lotion it came with works awesome</li>
            <li> I received this palette during a big Nordstrom&#x27;s sale. At the same time, I purchased several full priced palettes by Bobbi Brown, Laura Mercier, etc.  The palette included in this GWP is better than all of the full priced items. I reach for this one more often than any that I currently own (and believe me, I own a LOT of eye shadow palettes). The colors are spot on and most importantly, the quality is amazing. So silky and buttery and pigmented!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bonus that I also use Advanced Night Repair and needed a travel version. And I don&#x27;t want to forget the usefulness of the mini eyeliners. I find that these are perfect to take on overnight trips, although you do have to be pretty careful sharpening them. They tend to break in a regular eyeliner sharpener.&lt;br /&gt;Usually I use one or two items from a Gift with Purchase and then give the rest of the bag to my daughter. Not this time! I&#x27;m enjoying the entire group.</li>
            <li> Im not satisfied with this product. It comes in small sizes like it was sample and free . Not good for gift at all. I feel disappointed.</li>
            <li> They show a picture with a lot of products while at the end you lol only receive 4 products in total !! And they are just samples .. Shame on them</li>
            <li> The make up is great but the bag is cheap plastic. It&#x27;s also GIANT and the make up takes up like 1/8 of the bag. I had to fill it with tissue paper to look decent when giving it as a Christmas gift.</li>
            <li> good product, you will like it</li>
            <li> I really apreciate the purchase, it matches perfectly my expectations about the product, the shipment was fast, I received just in a while, price was good so I&#x27;m very satisfied with this purchase!</li>
            <li> Not what I expected.  The plastic little case inside, what is it?</li>
            <li> I received this today and love Estee Lauders Makeup this has some basic must have items for anyone and I love the colors.</li>
            <li> This was just a bag of the &amp;#34;freebies&amp;#34; that get sent out with an order from Estée Lauder. Far from worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It&#x27;s Estee Lauder. Products are great. My skin loves it.  i have to say, even with the travel size of the product the last well enough.... I would buy it again.  Case is sintetic plastic.</li>
            <li> Thank you for bringing them early. I am very happy for that. It&#x27;s a very beautiful and wonderful . I&#x27;m happy for this experiment</li>
            <li> So the makeup is a beautiful, quality looking kit. The thing that will require a double look is the &amp;#34;chic&amp;#34; clutch. The makeup is completely dwarfed by the size of the clutch with the small pieces swimming around in the oddly shaped, completely flattened from shipping, makeup bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The makeup does to seem to be legit Estee Lauder, but I can&#x27;t wrap my head around how to present this &amp;#34;gift set&amp;#34; to mother and make it look presentable. In the pics, the makeup looks as if it would fill at least half of the bag. In reality, 1/8 of the bag would be generous.</li>
            <li> This is something you can get free when you purchase any estee lauder products from Nordstrom right now. All the products are sample size but very good quality</li>
            <li> The purse looks nothing like on the picture. the content is as expected. it is ok as a gift for someone you are not very close to.</li>
            <li> one of those sets you get for FREE with purchase in macy&#x27;s or Nordstrom.&lt;br /&gt;Only bought it because my friend asked me to get it for her, and there were no offers at the time&lt;br /&gt;The bag does not look as fancy as the picture at all.Looks cheap!</li>
            <li> I was able to split up the kit among my female family members for great stocking stuffers.  There was something for everyone - young and old.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a gift and I was not able to choose which moisturizer I wanted for my mom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And they are way more smaller than we expected.</li>
            <li> I GAVE THIS RATING BECAUSE IT IS A GREAT GIFT IDEA, ESPECIALLY SINCE I DON&#x27;T KNOW WHAT KINDS OF MAKE UP TO BUY, THIS COMES WITH IT ALL</li>
            <li> not as pictured/discribed.</li>
            <li> The mini pencils and mascara are perfect for a travel bag.  Pretty lipstick color and great colors for the eye shadows too.  I put the eyeshadow with it&#x27;s included brush into my purse for touch ups.  Enjoyed getting to try the serum and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I loved the products. So many great items in one little bundle. The clutch is perfect as an evening bag.</li>
            <li> Make sure you look closely at this set. You only get 7 pieces. The picture makes it look like much more. Deceiving if you aren&#x27;t paying close attention. What&#x27;s here seems very nice but some other gift sets are a better value.</li>
            <li> El producto lleno mis expectativas y me parece excelente</li>
            <li> They improve the mascara now is better than before (lancome still better for eye shadows and blush) but I still love the colors of my palette Im changing my givenchy eye liner for estee lauder  and love the creams after my moisturizer of course this set is a perfect purchase.</li>
            <li> I got 2 for christmas presents, they were taken very good. The container is so attractive and enough to keep more pieces</li>
            <li> To Small , but the pruducts are really good</li>
            <li> The makeup was great... but the bag was really different.  Loved the eye colors they are true to color and go on smoothly.</li>
            <li> i haaaaaate it ...waste of money yuuuuuk</li>
            <li> this is definitely worth buying! delivery was fast and packaging was great. i love being able to try things before i buy, so this is perfect!!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice make-up for a great price. The lipstick, mascara, blush and eyeshadow are full-size. The sample-size skin care is half-way decent for a sample-size. Recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> I love the lipsitck the shawdow is ok and the mascara works good I just didn&#x27;t like the purse thingy look cheap in person.</li>
            <li> Obviously many of these people leaving reviews haven&#x27;t ever done a GWP. This is all sample sizes and it&#x27;s much more convenient to purchase through Amazon for less than $40, since when you get it in the store you have to spend more to get this gift. I always LOVE Estee Lauder and love that I can still get the gift when I miss the actual Gift with purchase sale!</li>
            <li> Totally disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I am glad to make the decision to buy this set because all that came in, it will be very useful.  The creams and the make up are just amaizing, I do prefer blue shadows with all this light colors that match smoky eyes.  I recomended to buy it because it is a clasic gift set that it is very helpful for any circumstance and easy to carry on.</li>
