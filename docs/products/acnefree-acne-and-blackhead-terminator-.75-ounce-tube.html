            <li>Works great though.</li>

            <li>is a good amount to use.)&lt;br /&gt;Step 4</li>
            <li>Anyways, I think it&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li>This stuff is really good</li>
            <li>But you WILL need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I always use benzoyl on my zits and this one has been doing a good job.</li>
            <li>Its good for the price and recommend to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with my results.&lt;br</li>

            <li>After about a week almost all of my acne was gone and now this stuff is like my holy grail for getting rid of acne especially fast !!</li>
            <li>It dries out your skin though so be sure to lotion with it!</li>
            <li>love this!</li>
            <li>Does not work great but works fine.</li>
            <li>BUT it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>Amazingly, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like it is clearing up quite nicely with this.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found and gives fast results.</li>
            <li>I actually own two of these</li>
            <li>--- honestly, it&#x27;s a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t effective.  </li>
            <li>Love love love this product!</li>
            <li>Great product... Really stops inflammation of blemishes and helps reduce the appearance of it!</li>
            <li>i have seen an improvement, however, be safe - it is definitely strong!</li>
            <li>value for money , easy to use and effective</li>
            <li>These products are amazing and approved for use while pregnant!</li>
            <li>Very good so far.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>Make sure you still wash your face and apply when needed ( I do it mornig and night)</li>
            <li>LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li>WAY better than Proactiv.</li>
            <li>but I found this works better on isolated spots.</li>
            <li>I have also used an otc topical steroid (cortisone), and the best effect is when I use both.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Best there is, this gel actually works and I hope it wont be removed from amazon US department.</li>
            <li>OR, for the close to bursting ones - wonderful visual there, I know -</li>
            <li>/&gt;Now, as we learned in Once Upon a Time, all magic comes with a cost:&lt;br /&gt;a)</li>
            <li>1 - Make sure your face is washed.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not paid for this review, I did not receive a free sample, just my honest experience using this product.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li>Everything is okay except for the expiration date.</li>
            <li>I merely won&#x27;t be able to expend 4 tubes till October.</li>
            <li>Great for the whole face to keep it nice and smooth or just the one zit.</li>
            <li>I am hopeful that another two weeks will help even more.</li>
            <li>had a derm script for another brand as one of my many pre accutane acne control</li>
            <li>has always been my favorite.</li>
            <li>I love this range of products and would reccomend it to anyone who has suffered with acne like I have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is way better than proactive in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>Still love and ordering this product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Soooo many acne treatments from Rx to Proactive and none had seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li>and I can confidently say it does</li>
            <li>Glad I did:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many acne spot treatments and none of them worked like this</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective in our situation.</li>
            <li>Works better than proactive</li>
            <li>Caused my skin to break out even more around the chin and forehead area.</li>
            <li>This product works great, so it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from repurchasing it, but the cover design really could use some work.</li>
            <li>Just in case I get more whiteheads.</li>
            <li>This product works great, so it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from repurchasing it, but the cover design really could use some work.</li>
            <li>Just in case I get more whiteheads.</li>
            <li>This is a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li>Works great and fast to get rid of them.</li>
            <li>CLEARASIL WORKS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li>I know I need to change my diet and take better care of myself if i want clearer skin</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>In desperation, I stopped at CVS on my way to work to get more spot on ointment.  </li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m glad I did-</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed significant redness reduction, but I am happy with the product at the price point and find it to be much more effective than salicylic acid formulations.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used dozens of products, none work as effective and quickly as this.</li>
            <li>To top it all off it is soooo cheap</li>
            <li>Works great even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I used accutane and that completely stopped my acne while I was on it and greatly reduced it afterwords.</li>
            <li>But again, even though I gave it a good amount of time, it didn&#x27;t really take care of the comidones.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t even grow to a full size!</li>
            <li>WOW, this really helps with my acne, its perfect , burn all my acne out...</li>
            <li>** 10% benzoyl peroxide worked within a week and the bottle color made it easy for her to remember to apply it.  </li>
            <li>Easy open/close snap lid.</li>
            <li>This stuff is way too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t over use, because this product is strong.</li>
            <li>My kids have mild acne and found that this product is the only effective treatment along with tea tree oil for successful acne therapy.</li>
            <li>it works well for my husband, but it irritated my daughter &#x27;s fine skin.</li>
            <li>It works immediately and you&#x27;ll see quick results within 10-15 minutes!</li>
            <li>This is an accurate product for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>Huge mistake.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I broke out with two insanely huge zits</li>
            <li>It has made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li>I use acne free cleanser with the loreal</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s cheap and I would recommend trying</li>
            <li>acid wash twice a day to keep your skin free of breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Works great on the red, or infected, inflamed bumps.</li>
            <li>this today I am breakout free and pray it continues.  </li>
            <li>but works great for deep cysts</li>
            <li>but so far things are good.  </li>
            <li>This product has worked better than most others and has a high BP percentage.</li>
            <li>My derm warned me about this when I originally tried BP but its not a severe side effect and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my skin but it does dry it out a bit.</li>
            <li>work great, will dry your face though.</li>
            <li>Otherwise my face will be once again full of acne that look like bee stings.</li>
            <li>I can see how doing a full face of this could burn, but that&#x27;s not what I use it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s magic - and fast....</li>
            <li>It seemed to be just another acne cream that promised way more than it was capable of.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Because it works so good at taking down the swelling and drying it out, this a great product for the huge bumps you might find on the back or neck.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and it&#x27;s maximum strength is like a lot of other products</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great product, and I will keep it on hand.</li>
            <li>Other than that, this is a great product, and I will keep it on hand.</li>
            <li>formulated to work better or differently so that  it works quickly and the breakouts seem to shrink overnight!&lt;br /&gt;Got to love that.</li>
            <li>I sometimes get acne on my shoulders and this dries it up quickly.</li>
            <li>Delivered quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li>and I have mild acne</li>
            <li>works pretty good but will bleach your sheets or cloths if your not careful.</li>
            <li>Clears and dries pimples up quickly.</li>
            <li>My skin started to feel better after the first use and surprisingly I think it&#x27;s even gotten rid of a lot of the black heads on my nose.  </li>
            <li>As my headline mentions, this stuff is POWERFUL.</li>
            <li>which was kind of gross.</li>
            <li>May be worth a try, depending on your acne situation.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s well worth it just for getting rid of the pimple pain.</li>
            <li>Effective, but does NOT blend in -- aka stays very white on my skin.</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s extremely rare for me.</li>
            <li>The Neutrogena Rapid Clear is MUCH better.</li>
            <li>After a couple more days, they will be gone completely.</li>
            <li>I rarely get a pimple now.</li>
            <li>It will remove a certain level of redness and inflammation over night, if you clean your face before.</li>
            <li>I use clean and clear oil free lotion</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve used it on other spots on my cheeks and forehead and both have shown good results.  </li>
            <li>zapped my zits right away.</li>
            <li>Once a couple hours before bed, and then right before bed.</li>
            <li>Used right</li>
            <li>I would suggest just making sure you do a realllllly light layer - if you can see any white, that&#x27;s way too much on there.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure if I used it more it would work faster, but I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like to use anything on a daily basis because I always seem to have a reaction, and severe dryness.  </li>
            <li>I usually never write reviews but because I LOVE this product sooooo much</li>
            <li>So strong it irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using this method my skin is never dry, yet is getting better every day.  </li>
            <li>wow this is strong and seems to do job.</li>
            <li>, it took many years of experimenting before I cam across this loving Terminator who, like Arnold, did an amazing job at destroying the alien infestations of P. acnes over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>perfect for those random spots.</li>
            <li>and it is definitely looking better than the salicylic alone.</li>
            <li>I definitely do notice more break</li>
            <li>the problem spots and not wash your face first, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The first couple of days I started using this cream, I saw no immediate effects.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this acne cream to anyone who is looking for more products to control embarrassing pimples.</li>
            <li>One of our teen&#x27;s favorite products for acne.</li>
            <li>If you need an acne treatment for all over use I would recommend the acne.org treatment which only has 2.5% benzyl peroxide but worked so much better for my skin than this one</li>
            <li>First I don’t slather it on my skin</li>
            <li>I started using this spot treatment when I first noticed the blemish</li>
            <li>did try a 2.5% benzoil peroxide treatment from Neutrogenia that I had first.</li>
            <li>so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and the first tube has been doing the job.</li>
            <li>This really works!  </li>
            <li>Buy this product it really really works like nothing else before!</li>
            <li>I will reorder this brand over the clean &amp; clear</li>
            <li>The whole part that I put this on became even more red.</li>
            <li>but that is usually the case with any good acne cream</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t over dry like most do</li>
            <li>I break out in certain locations all the time...</li>
            <li>I have never had pimples this large and swollen and they hadn&#x27;t improved in weeks.</li>
            <li>im certain spots if I dab the area.</li>
            <li>It will though, dramatically reduce appearance and size overnight, preventing full eruption and possibly scarring if used right away.</li>
            <li>I only use it at night and it has done a good job at shrinking present acne and preventing new ones.</li>
            <li>Happy ending was that by the day of the wedding my acne were tiny things that a little make up couldn’t cover</li>
            <li>I personally really like this treatment.</li>
            <li>Works but really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li>I really like this stuff</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re going to use this during the day another benefit I would say it has is that it really mattifies oily skin.</li>
            <li>It really helps, within a day or two.</li>
            <li>and I now feel comfortable going out in public.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>so I tried it not expecting much from a $5 dollar product.</li>
            <li>my skin &amp; you can&#x27;t really use it on problem areas</li>
            <li>If you are looking to get rid of acne fast, this is the product you want.</li>
            <li>The microencapsulation REALLY does make</li>
            <li>but sometimes i don&#x27;t know if its really working.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li>complaining cuz everything else doesn&#x27;t help as fast.</li>
            <li>I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it, it&#x27;s life changing.</li>
            <li>Got this for my grandson and he says it really works well.</li>
            <li>Acne Free Terminator clears them up in only a couple weeks</li>
            <li>It started shrinking fast and it really does help with redness</li>
            <li>But the salicylic acid wasn&#x27;t really working, so I decided to try the benzoil peroxide.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t remember how much I paid for it, but I think it was between $4 and $6.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But nothing else I&#x27;d tried had really worked.</li>
            <li>shipping was fast</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t put too much on tender places (like under the eyes).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of acne</li>
            <li>All kind of acnes are disappered after a few days use.  </li>
            <li>If you are a bit overzealous with your application at first and it is causing irritation that isn&#x27;t an allergic reaction, just mild irritation, then I suggest you adjust your application times until your skin gets used to frequent use you before you completely give up on the product.</li>
            <li>Personally, it stings very rarely and not even close to &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>(Though I can use tretinoin often, other things really make my face bright red and rashy).  </li>
            <li>It seems to work better than other 10% creams.</li>
            <li>Works better than the other brands in my opinion.  </li>
            <li>My skin gets dry easy</li>
            <li>Works great, but does dry the skin out a little</li>
            <li>The generic version does just as good a job for less money.</li>
            <li>I am not going to write a long detailed review.</li>
            <li>I still have them but after using this product for a couple days, the swelling has gone down dramatically and they look much, much better.</li>
            <li>Hands down, my favorite.</li>
            <li>This blows Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clear, and even natural masks like bentonite clay and Australian olive clay right out of the water.</li>
            <li>Put it on one night, and itll shrink half and then put it on another night and its basically gone or almost not see able anymore.</li>
            <li>If you are tanned you may be able to tell a slight difference in your complexion.</li>
            <li>i use this product once a day and it does a decent job of keeping acne under control.</li>
            <li>And I ONLY use it as a spot treatment for white-head pimples and mild recurring chest acne.</li>
            <li>Decent.</li>
            <li>I recommend this product for women with mild to moderate (including hormone induced) acne.</li>
            <li>/&gt;You will feel a little better after two weeks</li>
            <li>and WOW did it work!!</li>
            <li>have to admit, I was more than a little worried about trying the 10% benzoil peroxide treatment.</li>
            <li>You hardly have to use any product at all to be effective so a 1 oz.</li>
            <li>It helps clear up blemishes fast.</li>
            <li>Acne forms for many reasons (oil, dirt, dead skin block the pores</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have them for more than a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has cleared up my normal breakouts</li>
            <li>; This is true, the reason I went to something different was because my skin is oober sensitive.</li>
            <li>Then gradually my skin returned to normal.</li>
            <li>Good, not great.  </li>
            <li>Most of these acne meds are a big fail - this one works pretty well if you are consistent and use it right on the hot spots.</li>
            <li>Its meant to dry out the pore forcing the left over pus to the top.</li>
            <li>Cannot seem to find a product strong enough to knock out the teenage acne.</li>
            <li>I see some boxes say \\&quot;new gentler formula\\&quot;</li>
            <li>This will be my new staple.</li>
            <li>So maybe the salicylic acid mainly combats the blockage not the bacteria while the benzoyl peroxide also takes on the bacteria directly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not only does this cream continue to keep my face free from red spots and noticable acne, it has helped me regain my confidence again.</li>
            <li>I have somewhat sensitive skin, but I was surprised that this stuff doesn&#x27;t cause that much irritation.</li>
            <li>My VERY sensitive skin can handle it</li>
            <li>I use it for a couple days and have clear skin!</li>
            <li>Read the top reviews that were made within the past year.  </li>
            <li>it helps the process if you take a shower first to open your pores and then apply immediately after.  </li>
            <li>That being said I do apply it generally over my whole face and at night</li>
            <li>First product that I have found that will actually prevent and minimize acne.  </li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>It is so effective, my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it anymore, and now when I see a few pimples that are starting to form</li>
            <li>ive tried other ones including the clean and clear one</li>
            <li>Within an hour my acne sights were HALF the size they were originally.</li>
            <li>easy to apply and rub in without leaving a white smear like other products.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s hard to completely isolate what&#x27;s been working better.</li>
            <li>also goes on clear, another</li>
            <li>but of course wanted to have completely clear skin.</li>
            <li>this BP Creme all over face.&lt;br /&gt;Apply clear aloe vera gel to lock in</li>
            <li>It worked on my cystic acne and now my face is clear.</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve put it on at night and have not seen it bleach my sheets.</li>
            <li>(I have bought 3 so far).</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>And my face has not dried out.</li>
            <li>Still, I keep it far from my eye area so it doesn&#x27;t migrate</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my 12 year old son.</li>
            <li>It seems to be working well so far.</li>
            <li>Works just as long as you wash your face with just water first, then apply this to problem spots.</li>
            <li>and because I knew how sensitive I was</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>However, if there is over drying and your face is really sensitive to face lotions</li>
            <li>But I was also pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>You really have to pull to get the cap open.</li>
            <li>You really have to pull to get the cap open.</li>
            <li>well marked with plenty of time before product is reportedly not useable.</li>
            <li>This has worked really well on our teen age son. ..</li>
            <li>A negative I notice is that it&#x27;s so drying that if I get it near my eye area the next morning I will have very visible fine lines in my eye area</li>
            <li>For 12 year old major acne problem.  </li>
            <li>So for cystic acne, I highly recommend this product it helps reduce the deep swelling and heals up a lot</li>
            <li>I use the Acne free face wash and then dab a small amount of this product on my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that changed in my routine and I am on minocycline for acne as well so normally things are in control.  </li>
            <li>I used Melaleuca to help calm my skin down and it went away.</li>
            <li>First of all I have sensitive skin and sometimes the acne treatments I choose make my acne worse, because of this I don&#x27;t really experiment much anymore with acne treatment products</li>
            <li>I think 10% might be a bit too strong for me and will order something a little less intense.</li>
            <li>Too much will over dry and cause redness and irritation.</li>
            <li>Instead of getting better it got worse, at the end of day 8 I started using Rapid Clear from Neutrgena (Which works wonders for my backacne) after 24 hours nothing changed</li>
            <li>Caused major allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li>It definitely dries out my skin if I use it heavily for more than 2 days on the same spot, but I use Simple lotion/cleansin products and Ponds Makeup Wipes once a day.</li>
            <li>in 3 hours, the color had reduced by half from a bright, fire engine red, to a crayon pink, and the swelling had gone down as well.  </li>
            <li>This product works well at reducing acne in general.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I ignored all of the recent, negative reviews because this stuff actually works.</li>
            <li>so I only apply it directly to the breakouts after washing.</li>
            <li>Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I happen to have terribly sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone.</li>
            <li>I was within hours of making a medical appointment after my face swelled up and developed hives from this product.  </li>
            <li>If I catch the cyst early enough, this has helped it from even reaching the outer layer of the epidermis and when the cyst has reached the surface, instead of lasting for a month, they only last about 2 weeks and do not get as large or as red.</li>
            <li>The extra cream you squeeze out of the tube and do not use dries up quickly into a dried liquid white-out</li>
            <li>This really only works on large fresh pimples, not old scars, fading ones, or small clusters.</li>
            <li>They sell it within a whole set of cleaners, toners and other things</li>
            <li>But I was very nervous about trying the benzoil peroxide because I have extremely allergy prone skin.</li>
            <li>If you put too much on, you&#x27;ll try out other areas of your face&lt;br</li>
            <li>, it works well for me and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I generally use creams salicylic acid in my daily routine to control acne.</li>
            <li>This is much cheaper than proactive and less consuming.  </li>
            <li>(I am 24 years old) that I normally do not have.</li>
            <li>Normally a cystic blemish (for me) takes months to go away, even with other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Going on BC brought down the intensity, but not the frequency and because of OCD, I obsess over the particularly noticeable blemishes.</li>

            <li> This stuff is really good</li>
            <li> But you WILL need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I always use benzoyl on my zits and this one has been doing a good job.</li>

            <li> love this!</li>

            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found and gives fast results.</li>
            <li> I actually own two of these</li>
            <li> --- honestly, it&#x27;s a lifesaver for me.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t effective.  </li>
            <li> Love love love this product!</li>
            <li> Great product... Really stops inflammation of blemishes and helps reduce the appearance of it!</li>
            <li> i have seen an improvement, however, be safe - it is definitely strong!</li>
            <li> value for money , easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> These products are amazing and approved for use while pregnant!</li>
            <li> Very good so far.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li> Make sure you still wash your face and apply when needed ( I do it mornig and night)</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS.</li>
            <li> WAY better than Proactiv.</li>
            <li> but I found this works better on isolated spots.</li>
            <li> I have also used an otc topical steroid (cortisone), and the best effect is when I use both.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line: I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Best there is, this gel actually works and I hope it wont be removed from amazon US department.</li>
            <li> OR, for the close to bursting ones - wonderful visual there, I know -</li>
            <li> /&gt;Now, as we learned in Once Upon a Time, all magic comes with a cost:&lt;br /&gt;a)</li>
            <li> 1 - Make sure your face is washed.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not paid for this review, I did not receive a free sample, just my honest experience using this product.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
            <li> Everything is okay except for the expiration date.</li>
            <li> I merely won&#x27;t be able to expend 4 tubes till October.</li>
            <li> Great for the whole face to keep it nice and smooth or just the one zit.</li>
            <li> I am hopeful that another two weeks will help even more.</li>
            <li> had a derm script for another brand as one of my many pre accutane acne control</li>
            <li> has always been my favorite.</li>
            <li> I love this range of products and would reccomend it to anyone who has suffered with acne like I have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is way better than proactive in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> Still love and ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Soooo many acne treatments from Rx to Proactive and none had seemed to do the trick.</li>
            <li> and I can confidently say it does</li>
            <li> Glad I did:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many acne spot treatments and none of them worked like this</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective in our situation.</li>
            <li> Works better than proactive</li>
            <li> Caused my skin to break out even more around the chin and forehead area.</li>
            <li> This product works great, so it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from repurchasing it, but the cover design really could use some work.</li>
            <li> Just in case I get more whiteheads.</li>
            <li> This product works great, so it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from repurchasing it, but the cover design really could use some work.</li>
            <li> Just in case I get more whiteheads.</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal product.</li>
            <li> Works great and fast to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> CLEARASIL WORKS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li> I know I need to change my diet and take better care of myself if i want clearer skin</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> In desperation, I stopped at CVS on my way to work to get more spot on ointment.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m glad I did-</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really noticed significant redness reduction, but I am happy with the product at the price point and find it to be much more effective than salicylic acid formulations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used dozens of products, none work as effective and quickly as this.</li>
            <li> To top it all off it is soooo cheap</li>
            <li> Works great even on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I used accutane and that completely stopped my acne while I was on it and greatly reduced it afterwords.</li>
            <li> But again, even though I gave it a good amount of time, it didn&#x27;t really take care of the comidones.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t even grow to a full size!</li>
            <li> WOW, this really helps with my acne, its perfect , burn all my acne out...</li>
            <li> ** 10% benzoyl peroxide worked within a week and the bottle color made it easy for her to remember to apply it.  </li>
            <li> Easy open/close snap lid.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way too strong for my skin.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t over use, because this product is strong.</li>
            <li> My kids have mild acne and found that this product is the only effective treatment along with tea tree oil for successful acne therapy.</li>
            <li> it works well for my husband, but it irritated my daughter &#x27;s fine skin.</li>
            <li> It works immediately and you&#x27;ll see quick results within 10-15 minutes!</li>
            <li> This is an accurate product for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Huge mistake.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I broke out with two insanely huge zits</li>
            <li> It has made a HUGE difference.</li>
            <li> I use acne free cleanser with the loreal</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s cheap and I would recommend trying</li>
            <li> acid wash twice a day to keep your skin free of breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Works great on the red, or infected, inflamed bumps.</li>
            <li> this today I am breakout free and pray it continues.  </li>
            <li> but works great for deep cysts</li>
            <li> but so far things are good.  </li>
            <li> This product has worked better than most others and has a high BP percentage.</li>
            <li> My derm warned me about this when I originally tried BP but its not a severe side effect and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my skin but it does dry it out a bit.</li>
            <li> work great, will dry your face though.</li>
            <li> Otherwise my face will be once again full of acne that look like bee stings.</li>
            <li> I can see how doing a full face of this could burn, but that&#x27;s not what I use it for.&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s magic - and fast....</li>
            <li> It seemed to be just another acne cream that promised way more than it was capable of.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Because it works so good at taking down the swelling and drying it out, this a great product for the huge bumps you might find on the back or neck.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it&#x27;s maximum strength is like a lot of other products</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great product, and I will keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> Other than that, this is a great product, and I will keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> formulated to work better or differently so that  it works quickly and the breakouts seem to shrink overnight!&lt;br /&gt;Got to love that.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get acne on my shoulders and this dries it up quickly.</li>
            <li> Delivered quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> and I have mild acne</li>
            <li> works pretty good but will bleach your sheets or cloths if your not careful.</li>
            <li> Clears and dries pimples up quickly.</li>
            <li> My skin started to feel better after the first use and surprisingly I think it&#x27;s even gotten rid of a lot of the black heads on my nose.  </li>
            <li> As my headline mentions, this stuff is POWERFUL.</li>
            <li> which was kind of gross.</li>
            <li> May be worth a try, depending on your acne situation.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s well worth it just for getting rid of the pimple pain.</li>
            <li> Effective, but does NOT blend in -- aka stays very white on my skin.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s extremely rare for me.</li>
            <li> The Neutrogena Rapid Clear is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> After a couple more days, they will be gone completely.</li>
            <li> I rarely get a pimple now.</li>
            <li> It will remove a certain level of redness and inflammation over night, if you clean your face before.</li>
            <li> I use clean and clear oil free lotion</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve used it on other spots on my cheeks and forehead and both have shown good results.  </li>
            <li> zapped my zits right away.</li>
            <li> Once a couple hours before bed, and then right before bed.</li>
            <li> Used right</li>
            <li> I would suggest just making sure you do a realllllly light layer - if you can see any white, that&#x27;s way too much on there.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m sure if I used it more it would work faster, but I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like to use anything on a daily basis because I always seem to have a reaction, and severe dryness.  </li>
            <li> I usually never write reviews but because I LOVE this product sooooo much</li>
            <li> So strong it irritated my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using this method my skin is never dry, yet is getting better every day.  </li>
            <li> wow this is strong and seems to do job.</li>
            <li> , it took many years of experimenting before I cam across this loving Terminator who, like Arnold, did an amazing job at destroying the alien infestations of P. acnes over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> perfect for those random spots.</li>
            <li> and it is definitely looking better than the salicylic alone.</li>
            <li> I definitely do notice more break</li>
            <li> the problem spots and not wash your face first, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The first couple of days I started using this cream, I saw no immediate effects.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this acne cream to anyone who is looking for more products to control embarrassing pimples.</li>
            <li> One of our teen&#x27;s favorite products for acne.</li>
            <li> If you need an acne treatment for all over use I would recommend the acne.org treatment which only has 2.5% benzyl peroxide but worked so much better for my skin than this one</li>
            <li> First I don’t slather it on my skin</li>
            <li> I started using this spot treatment when I first noticed the blemish</li>
            <li> did try a 2.5% benzoil peroxide treatment from Neutrogenia that I had first.</li>
            <li> so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and the first tube has been doing the job.</li>
            <li> This really works!  </li>
            <li> Buy this product it really really works like nothing else before!</li>
            <li> I will reorder this brand over the clean &amp; clear</li>
            <li> The whole part that I put this on became even more red.</li>
            <li> but that is usually the case with any good acne cream</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry like most do</li>
            <li> I break out in certain locations all the time...</li>
            <li> I have never had pimples this large and swollen and they hadn&#x27;t improved in weeks.</li>
            <li> im certain spots if I dab the area.</li>
            <li> It will though, dramatically reduce appearance and size overnight, preventing full eruption and possibly scarring if used right away.</li>
            <li> I only use it at night and it has done a good job at shrinking present acne and preventing new ones.</li>
            <li> Happy ending was that by the day of the wedding my acne were tiny things that a little make up couldn’t cover</li>
            <li> I personally really like this treatment.</li>
            <li> Works but really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re going to use this during the day another benefit I would say it has is that it really mattifies oily skin.</li>
            <li> It really helps, within a day or two.</li>
            <li> and I now feel comfortable going out in public.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> so I tried it not expecting much from a $5 dollar product.</li>
            <li> my skin &amp; you can&#x27;t really use it on problem areas</li>
            <li> If you are looking to get rid of acne fast, this is the product you want.</li>
            <li> The microencapsulation REALLY does make</li>
            <li> but sometimes i don&#x27;t know if its really working.&lt;br /&gt;Like</li>
            <li> complaining cuz everything else doesn&#x27;t help as fast.</li>
            <li> I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it, it&#x27;s life changing.</li>
            <li> Got this for my grandson and he says it really works well.</li>
            <li> Acne Free Terminator clears them up in only a couple weeks</li>
            <li> It started shrinking fast and it really does help with redness</li>
            <li> But the salicylic acid wasn&#x27;t really working, so I decided to try the benzoil peroxide.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t remember how much I paid for it, but I think it was between $4 and $6.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But nothing else I&#x27;d tried had really worked.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t put too much on tender places (like under the eyes).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of acne</li>
            <li> All kind of acnes are disappered after a few days use.  </li>
            <li> If you are a bit overzealous with your application at first and it is causing irritation that isn&#x27;t an allergic reaction, just mild irritation, then I suggest you adjust your application times until your skin gets used to frequent use you before you completely give up on the product.</li>
            <li> Personally, it stings very rarely and not even close to &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> (Though I can use tretinoin often, other things really make my face bright red and rashy).  </li>
            <li> It seems to work better than other 10% creams.</li>
            <li> Works better than the other brands in my opinion.  </li>
            <li> My skin gets dry easy</li>
            <li> Works great, but does dry the skin out a little</li>
            <li> The generic version does just as good a job for less money.</li>
            <li> I am not going to write a long detailed review.</li>
            <li> I still have them but after using this product for a couple days, the swelling has gone down dramatically and they look much, much better.</li>
            <li> Hands down, my favorite.</li>
            <li> This blows Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clear, and even natural masks like bentonite clay and Australian olive clay right out of the water.</li>
            <li> Put it on one night, and itll shrink half and then put it on another night and its basically gone or almost not see able anymore.</li>
            <li> If you are tanned you may be able to tell a slight difference in your complexion.</li>
            <li> i use this product once a day and it does a decent job of keeping acne under control.</li>
            <li> And I ONLY use it as a spot treatment for white-head pimples and mild recurring chest acne.</li>
            <li> Decent.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for women with mild to moderate (including hormone induced) acne.</li>
            <li> /&gt;You will feel a little better after two weeks</li>
            <li> and WOW did it work!!</li>
            <li> have to admit, I was more than a little worried about trying the 10% benzoil peroxide treatment.</li>
            <li> You hardly have to use any product at all to be effective so a 1 oz.</li>
            <li> It helps clear up blemishes fast.</li>
            <li> Acne forms for many reasons (oil, dirt, dead skin block the pores</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have them for more than a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has cleared up my normal breakouts</li>
            <li> ; This is true, the reason I went to something different was because my skin is oober sensitive.</li>
            <li> Then gradually my skin returned to normal.</li>
            <li> Good, not great.  </li>
            <li> Most of these acne meds are a big fail - this one works pretty well if you are consistent and use it right on the hot spots.</li>
            <li> Its meant to dry out the pore forcing the left over pus to the top.</li>
            <li> Cannot seem to find a product strong enough to knock out the teenage acne.</li>
            <li> I see some boxes say \\&quot;new gentler formula\\&quot;</li>
            <li> This will be my new staple.</li>
            <li> So maybe the salicylic acid mainly combats the blockage not the bacteria while the benzoyl peroxide also takes on the bacteria directly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not only does this cream continue to keep my face free from red spots and noticable acne, it has helped me regain my confidence again.</li>
            <li> I have somewhat sensitive skin, but I was surprised that this stuff doesn&#x27;t cause that much irritation.</li>
            <li> My VERY sensitive skin can handle it</li>
            <li> I use it for a couple days and have clear skin!</li>
            <li> Read the top reviews that were made within the past year.  </li>
            <li> it helps the process if you take a shower first to open your pores and then apply immediately after.  </li>
            <li> That being said I do apply it generally over my whole face and at night</li>
            <li> First product that I have found that will actually prevent and minimize acne.  </li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> It is so effective, my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it anymore, and now when I see a few pimples that are starting to form</li>
            <li> ive tried other ones including the clean and clear one</li>
            <li> Within an hour my acne sights were HALF the size they were originally.</li>
            <li> easy to apply and rub in without leaving a white smear like other products.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to completely isolate what&#x27;s been working better.</li>
            <li> also goes on clear, another</li>
            <li> but of course wanted to have completely clear skin.</li>
            <li> this BP Creme all over face.&lt;br /&gt;Apply clear aloe vera gel to lock in</li>
            <li> It worked on my cystic acne and now my face is clear.</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;ve put it on at night and have not seen it bleach my sheets.</li>
            <li> (I have bought 3 so far).</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And my face has not dried out.</li>
            <li> Still, I keep it far from my eye area so it doesn&#x27;t migrate</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 12 year old son.</li>
            <li> It seems to be working well so far.</li>
            <li> Works just as long as you wash your face with just water first, then apply this to problem spots.</li>
            <li> and because I knew how sensitive I was</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> However, if there is over drying and your face is really sensitive to face lotions</li>
            <li> But I was also pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> You really have to pull to get the cap open.</li>
            <li> You really have to pull to get the cap open.</li>
            <li> well marked with plenty of time before product is reportedly not useable.</li>
            <li> This has worked really well on our teen age son. ..</li>
            <li> A negative I notice is that it&#x27;s so drying that if I get it near my eye area the next morning I will have very visible fine lines in my eye area</li>
            <li> For 12 year old major acne problem.  </li>
            <li> So for cystic acne, I highly recommend this product it helps reduce the deep swelling and heals up a lot</li>
            <li> I use the Acne free face wash and then dab a small amount of this product on my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that changed in my routine and I am on minocycline for acne as well so normally things are in control.  </li>
            <li> I used Melaleuca to help calm my skin down and it went away.</li>
            <li> First of all I have sensitive skin and sometimes the acne treatments I choose make my acne worse, because of this I don&#x27;t really experiment much anymore with acne treatment products</li>
            <li> I think 10% might be a bit too strong for me and will order something a little less intense.</li>
            <li> Too much will over dry and cause redness and irritation.</li>
            <li> Instead of getting better it got worse, at the end of day 8 I started using Rapid Clear from Neutrgena (Which works wonders for my backacne) after 24 hours nothing changed</li>
            <li> Caused major allergic reaction.  </li>
            <li> It definitely dries out my skin if I use it heavily for more than 2 days on the same spot, but I use Simple lotion/cleansin products and Ponds Makeup Wipes once a day.</li>
            <li> in 3 hours, the color had reduced by half from a bright, fire engine red, to a crayon pink, and the swelling had gone down as well.  </li>
            <li> This product works well at reducing acne in general.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ignored all of the recent, negative reviews because this stuff actually works.</li>
            <li> so I only apply it directly to the breakouts after washing.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I happen to have terribly sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone.</li>
            <li> I was within hours of making a medical appointment after my face swelled up and developed hives from this product.  </li>
            <li> If I catch the cyst early enough, this has helped it from even reaching the outer layer of the epidermis and when the cyst has reached the surface, instead of lasting for a month, they only last about 2 weeks and do not get as large or as red.</li>
            <li> The extra cream you squeeze out of the tube and do not use dries up quickly into a dried liquid white-out</li>
            <li> This really only works on large fresh pimples, not old scars, fading ones, or small clusters.</li>
            <li> They sell it within a whole set of cleaners, toners and other things</li>
            <li> But I was very nervous about trying the benzoil peroxide because I have extremely allergy prone skin.</li>
            <li> If you put too much on, you&#x27;ll try out other areas of your face&lt;br</li>
            <li> , it works well for me and does not dry out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I generally use creams salicylic acid in my daily routine to control acne.</li>
            <li> This is much cheaper than proactive and less consuming.  </li>
            <li> (I am 24 years old) that I normally do not have.</li>
            <li> Normally a cystic blemish (for me) takes months to go away, even with other products I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Going on BC brought down the intensity, but not the frequency and because of OCD, I obsess over the particularly noticeable blemishes.</li>
            <li> I tested it first and was fine and upon the second application, there was a two inch radius around the pimple that was red, itchy and painful for about 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> and I am so sensitive I have to be very careful with the products I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> I dabbed it on the larger pimples and they were less visible the next day and completely gone by the day after that.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and glad it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of artificial ingredients and salicylic acid!</li>
            <li> Average results for 14 year old.</li>
            <li> A few days later my sensitive reaction left and my acne was almost gone.</li>
            <li> The list of things my skin has reacted to is long, so that is a definitely plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t dry up and leave a white film on my face.</li>
            <li> only drawback is that it does dry out</li>
            <li> Only dry out my skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this four stars because it does dry out skin</li>
            <li> The only downfall I&#x27;ve come across is it begins to dry out your skin after a continual use, so I&#x27;ve been using lotion on my face 1-2 hours after I use it.</li>
            <li> if smear around on skin, can make dry and flaky so only apply to zit problem.</li>
            <li> Be careful though as it could bleach your clothing or linen, my pillow case will never be the same with 2 yellow bleached marks.</li>
            <li> If you use it 2-3 times a day you can completely clear up average acne breakout!</li>
            <li> This works a little too well at first, completely dried me out.</li>
            <li> Great product.n&#x27;t bad, but the cap is really hard to open and close.</li>
            <li> but really that&#x27;s expected at 10% benzoyl peroxide vs. the usual 2-5%.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say, every product is different for every person.</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about those embarrassing spots all over face as long as I keep using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put some on at night and by the time I woke up my blemishes were smaller and less noticeable, especially in redness.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t leave red marks the morning after like other creams do.</li>
            <li> I tried putting some on each side of my chin on a larger area and it burned a little, was red and hurt.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other Acne Products, even clinique.</li>
            <li> This is the only 10% benzoyl peroxide acne medication I&#x27;ve used (and I have used several different brands) that doesn&#x27;t make my face either shiny or excessively flaky.</li>
            <li> tube lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause my skin to get dry and cracked either.</li>
            <li> when my skin gets dry</li>
            <li> and yes it makes it itchy and sometimes dry.</li>
            <li> Also the skin became so dry and itchy too..</li>
            <li> The rest of my face is dry and needs moisturizer, but not my forehead and chin.</li>
            <li> All it did was dry my pimple.</li>
            <li> Do buy this product but do not overdo with the usage of this one because it will dry ur skin.</li>
            <li> It does have my face a bit dry though</li>
            <li> I actually had dark spots.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried washing my face with soap and water and other times with wet wipes, both ways gave me the same outcome.)&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I put it on twice a day and as long as I dont mess with anything the pimple is gone the next day.</li>
            <li> a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It helps the Benzoyl Peroxide get further down into the pores to kill almost all of the bacteria.  </li>
            <li> solves a lot of problems if I have an event and don&#x27;t want to look like an alien with a giant red dot on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I experience some dryness with this product but not much, I just use Cerave lotion over it after it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
            <li> Just be careful if you have sensitive skin, start out with small amounts and use once a day gradually brining it up to 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab on the affected area and let it dry...</li>
            <li> I decided that maybe I was using it too much and to slow down in my usage.</li>
            <li> Other products use an unfairly low amount of the active ingredient, like 2 or 2.5%.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed since theres great reviews.</li>
            <li> I really, really liked this product but when I bought a new tube I started breaking out horribly.  </li>
            <li> There was a little drying at the spot of application, but went away will a tiny drop of lotion.</li>
            <li> Cap sticks a little, but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Now its not miracle cream, like most people think and review it bad.</li>
            <li> At least they&#x27;re starting to heal finally.</li>
            <li> These are easily (at least for me) fixed.</li>
            <li> It has helped, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it eliminates all areas, but that is to be expected.  </li>
            <li> (I&#x27;d say a dab roughly the size of your finger nail</li>
            <li> You have to be careful to not get this on your clothes or on your hand towels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 2nd supply in a few months.</li>
            <li> A few days ago, one such spot popped up below my lip.  </li>
            <li> So please be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> do, however, have one major complaint about this product.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> THIS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN.</li>
            <li> This was not worth the $2 something I spent.</li>
            <li> It may do the trick for small, occasional breakouts.</li>
            <li> Warning that it will bleach dark colors, like your towels if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> It might work for other people.</li>
            <li> You only need a small dab.  </li>
            <li> Did not find this drying as other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> These other products helped a lot but this benzyl peroxide put the nail in the coffin for my acne.</li>
            <li> I am doing other regimen on my face too</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything to battle my cystic acne, but it did dry out my whiteheads a little.</li>
            <li> Just smear a thin amount over the white crater, and in a couple of days the white pus stuff you used to cream out of your face will have disappeared and some temporary redness will remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Well, those days of being down in the dump are decreasing due to this Terminator.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit drying but less than other benzyl peroxide I&#x27;ve used in the past(I</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time remembering to do things on a daily basis that it&#x27;s hard to tell if its working or if my face is just letting nature take</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Zits would go down overnight.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even make them go down the tiniest bit.</li>
            <li> My teenage son really struggles with bad skin.</li>
            <li> I was initially disappointed because the first several days it caused some irritation.</li>
            <li> as it will discolor you fabrics it will also slightly bleach your skin.</li>
            <li> It soothes the redness which make the pimple less noticeable.</li>
            <li> yes, there is slight burning sensation</li>
            <li> Be careful though, will bleach your clothes/linens :/</li>
            <li> helps slowly and makes the skin dry</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the AcneFree 2 in 1 wipes for a little under a week</li>
            <li> My holy grail for little zits...</li>
            <li> and it does reduce this a little.</li>
            <li> A little peeling on the skin after applying, so recommended rest a day then continue using.</li>
            <li> I dab a little all over my face after washing.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure how well it&#x27;d work in extreme cases, but it works well for me as a spot treatment.  </li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of spot creams in my life in which all of them did not work, i thought it would not harm to try this one too and to my suprise within a few weeks</li>
            <li> I use this cream everyday under my make-up to prevent break-outs during the day.</li>
            <li> I started using this after not using any benzoyl peroxide products for a few years.</li>
            <li> purchased this item a few times.</li>
            <li> I had been using proactiv for a few months and it was no longer working.</li>
            <li> Its a white, thin lotion-like consistency.</li>
            <li> once every few days</li>
            <li> I remained hopeful, however, and continued to apply the cream everyday before I went to bed.</li>
            <li> and it was so harsh</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with skin discoloration or itching or anything</li>
            <li> Applied at night and pimple dried out overnight.</li>
            <li> I only use this in emergency cases because it can be quite drying and irritating</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 32, and suddenly started having break outs all over my face, lots of black heads, and now I have back acne, never had this before, and it&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> I only have mild acne at my worst, so spot treatment works well for me.</li>
            <li> face with raw honey.  </li>
            <li> That really helped, I switched to every other day during breakouts and slowly worked my way up to 2x applications on bad breakouts with no problems.</li>
            <li> I have a couple small clusters of whiteheads that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for the past few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a little baffled by the negative reviews</li>
            <li> This works just as well, if not better than Oxy 10.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the small size tube fool you.  </li>
            <li> I used a Q-tip to apply to the small needed  area</li>
            <li> I would recommend this as a next step for acne if the usual remedies have failed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d usually apply it two times before going to bed.</li>
            <li> I use it on small pimples that pop up every now and then.</li>
            <li> The one I usually use was out of stock, and in desperation, I grabbed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually see a difference with one use</li>
            <li> The cap is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> It stains worse on T-shirts than other material for some reason.  </li>
            <li> ITS NOT VERY GOOD</li>
            <li> Saw small changes, at least there was some improvement</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, or even irritate it, but it also doesn&#x27;t do anything for those random pimples that pop up.</li>
            <li> I will be switching brands because I am tired of the mess.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back because my skin has gone crazy.</li>
            <li> So at least 2 of them will be expired.</li>
            <li> negative you should know about the product:&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, it helps to wash one&#x27;s face at least twice a day</li>
            <li> , this works well, at least it did for me.</li>
            <li> Works well, but loses a star because of the bleaching.</li>
            <li> If you plan to use this on your back or neck or places where the cream will be in contact with your clothes, it will stain your clothes and spreads like crazy.  </li>
            <li> This stuff does make it disappear immediately, I didn&#x27;t expect it to, but it has faded the blemishes slowly</li>
            <li> ( I use my usual face wash before hand) usually by morning there is a dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> The tube itself isn&#x27;t bad, but the cap is really hard to open and close.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have severe acne, just the very occasional white head that decides to make my chin and mouth miserable.  </li>
            <li> works really well for me to help control the hated zit problem.</li>
            <li> I had one of those deep and painful pimples forming on my check and was terrified that it wouldn&#x27;t be gone by the time I leave for my trip this weekend.</li>
            <li> It was painful, VERY red, and</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed when I do a thin layer</li>
            <li> The size and number of the comidones have decreased dramatically.</li>
            <li> ---that is a bad thing for acne, as well as some other oil is there.</li>
            <li> Whatever new formula they&#x27;re using, it is absolutely terrible.  </li>
            <li> My skin became SO red and itchy and peeled like crazy!!</li>
            <li> all my acne was gone within a few weeks!!!!</li>
            <li> I was standing in the acne aisle desperately looking for something that wasn&#x27;t going to make this worse.</li>
            <li> I take a pea size amount and put a VERY THIN layer where it is needed</li>
            <li> I had the worst reaction from a dry shampoo I had tried and I tried acne washes, tretinoin (Retin A), and anything else I could get my hands on to help me with these pustule like breakout from hell.</li>
            <li> But a warning, this will stain your clothes like crazy.  </li>
            <li> had terrible breakouts for past 15 years.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I prefer to use this on bad break outs.</li>
            <li> and I find myself offering some to my guy friends when its absolutely bad.</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten used to these chemicals, I guess I&#x27;ll have to find something else &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I wish this worled for me. :(</li>
            <li> This product works well (as do all 10% benzoyl peroxide products that I have tried), but I absolutely hate the lid on this.  </li>
            <li> IT VERY BADLY.</li>
            <li> Worst cream ever usef</li>
            <li> Seems to keep it from going insane but still does not prevent my problem areas from  always being a problem.</li>
            <li> The packaging is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> It burned my daughter&#x27;s skin and made her face red!</li>
            <li> I threw this out immediately after I found bleach marks on my pillowcases.</li>
            <li> WOW, this really helps with my acne, its perfect , burn all my acne out...</li>
            <li> Damaging to skin. Used differin for years and wanted something OTC. I only use when pimples occur, not daily. When used my skin started drying and peeling. I used it 2 months ago and still see where my skin was damaged.  Would not recommend this product</li>
            <li> It has helped, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it eliminates all areas, but that is to be expected.  For oily, acne prone skin, you will still get breakouts and acne needs time to heal.  It will though, dramatically reduce appearance and size overnight, preventing full eruption and possibly scarring if used right away.</li>
            <li> I like it. Clears up acne and redness at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> This works just as well, if not better than Oxy 10. This doesn&#x27;t dry up and leave a white film on my face. It doesn&#x27;t seem to cause my skin to get dry and cracked either. So far, I&#x27;ve put it on at night and have not seen it bleach my sheets.</li>
            <li> I really, really liked this product but when I bought a new tube I started breaking out horribly.  I went on the web to find ingredients since I threw away the box, and I am finding different ingredients listed so I don&#x27;t know if they changed something.  This is the only thing that changed in my routine and I am on minocycline for acne as well so normally things are in control.  I see some boxes say \\&quot;new gentler formula\\&quot; and some sites list algae in their ingredients---that is a bad thing for acne, as well as some other oil is there.</li>
            <li> My kids have mild acne and found that this product is the only effective treatment along with tea tree oil for successful acne therapy.</li>
            <li> I have been using this with the AcneFree 2 in 1 wipes for a little under a week and I&#x27;m in love. These products are amazing and approved for use while pregnant!</li>
            <li> This is an accurate product for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Items received in good conditions</li>
            <li> I have tried dozens of spot creams in my life in which all of them did not work, i thought it would not harm to try this one too and to my suprise within a few weeks i started to see improvement in my skin! To top it all off it is soooo cheap so i have no problem using this cream on a regular basis and my skin is marvelouse!!!! Thanx to this cream!!</li>
            <li> perfect for those random spots.</li>
            <li> Works great. Bought this because the brands in the store just don&#x27;t work that well. It seems like it is clearing up quite nicely with this.</li>
            <li> zapped my zits right away. doesn&#x27;t leave red marks the morning after like other creams do. also goes on clear, another plus so I don&#x27;t look like a dork for my hubby!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and it&#x27;s maximum strength is like a lot of other products but this one seems to&lt;br /&gt;be formulated to work better or differently so that  it works quickly and the breakouts seem to shrink overnight!&lt;br /&gt;Got to love that. Best to buy more than you think you need because I have yet to find it in a store at this price.</li>
            <li> For 12 year old major acne problem.  Different things work for different skin.  Had son try all kinds of things then realized they were ALL salicylic acid based.  Acne forms for many reasons (oil, dirt, dead skin block the pores, bacteria grows).  So maybe the salicylic acid mainly combats the blockage not the bacteria while the benzoyl peroxide also takes on the bacteria directly. Anyway we now us salicylic wash and this as spot treatment and it is definitely looking better than the salicylic alone.</li>
            <li> I personally really like this treatment. I use acne free cleanser with the loreal go 360 cleanser and then follow it up with this. when my skin gets dry I use clean and clear oil free lotion and it works excellent on my skin. ive tried other ones including the clean and clear one but this works the best.</li>
            <li> Works but really dries my skin out.</li>
            <li> I sometimes get acne on my shoulders and this dries it up quickly. Best product I&#x27;ve found and gives fast results. Ginger/Chicago</li>
            <li> As my headline mentions, this stuff is POWERFUL. I can put it on a pimple one day, and then find no pimple the next day It&#x27;s GREAT. Although there are times when it takes 2-5 days for the pimples to decrease to nothing. But still! I have moderate acne and I am still in my teen years. I would recommend this product. (I have bought 3 so far).</li>
            <li> My holy grail for little zits... Works every time but beware that it causes redness, dryness and skin might peal off.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin. DO NOT use this product, it will burn your skin just like what it did to mine. I should have know since it&#x27;s maximum strength but it didn&#x27;t do anything to the acne spots but irritated and burned the skin around it. I had to use healing skin ointment after using this product. Threw the rest in the trash.</li>
            <li> the product expires in a month...</li>
            <li> Cleared up my face in three uses! My skin gets dry easy so I only used it once a day; not twice as recommended. And my face has not dried out. I couldn&#x27;t believe it. Very happy.</li>
            <li> This works so well its my go-to-item for those sudden pimples. Put it on one night, and itll shrink half and then put it on another night and its basically gone or almost not see able anymore. Make sure you still wash your face and apply when needed ( I do it mornig and night)</li>
            <li> Worked great on my skin but it does dry it out a bit. I recommend it for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff, it works well for me and does not dry out my skin.  This is the best acne cream I have found, but it is sparce in stores, so it is nice that I can get it on Amazon and have it sent to my house.</li>
            <li> I use this cream everyday under my make-up to prevent break-outs during the day. This product has worked better than most others and has a high BP percentage. When my face begins to break out around &amp;#34;that time of the month&amp;#34; I will add this product to my night routine prior to bed and will wake up with significantly smaller atrocities on my face.</li>
            <li> This was on sale for $2 so I thought what the hell, I&#x27;ll try it out.  Big mistake.  My skin became SO red and itchy and peeled like crazy!! Huge mistake.  Whatever new formula they&#x27;re using, it is absolutely terrible.  Read the top reviews that were made within the past year.  This was not worth the $2 something I spent.</li>
            <li> I started using this after not using any benzoyl peroxide products for a few years. I only use it at night and it has done a good job at shrinking present acne and preventing new ones. When I don&#x27;t use it I definitely do notice more break outs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the redness reducing effect, I guess it does work as advertised. I have very, very fair skin which gets pink/red at times and it does reduce this a little. If you&#x27;re going to use this during the day another benefit I would say it has is that it really mattifies oily skin. A negative I notice is that it&#x27;s so drying that if I get it near my eye area the next morning I will have very visible fine lines in my eye area (I am 24 years old) that I normally do not have. But these lines do go away after washing and moisturizing... Still, I keep it far from my eye area so it doesn&#x27;t migrate and so I don&#x27;t get wrinkles:P</li>
            <li> purchased this item a few times. easy to apply and rub in without leaving a white smear like other products. Works great even on sensitive skin. Does not make my face red and does not burn. Like putting lotion on.</li>
            <li> i use this product once a day and it does a decent job of keeping acne under control. Not much else to say, every product is different for every person. Give it a try</li>
            <li> works really well for me to help control the hated zit problem.</li>
            <li> Worst cream ever usef</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my 12 year old son. It seems to be working well so far. Delivered quickly and as promised.</li>
            <li> One of the best drug store spot treatments I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;ve been using this for years and I keep re-purchasing. Anytime I see this on sale, I gotta stock up. It really helps, within a day or two.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS. PUT IT ON A PIMPLE AT NIGHT AND IT WAS 80% GONE IN THE MORNING.</li>
            <li> It seems good&lt;br /&gt;You will feel a little better after two weeks</li>
            <li> So strong it irritated my sensitive skin. BUT it works amazingly. Zits would go down overnight.</li>
            <li> This product was no miracle worker for me. It didn&#x27;t do anything to battle my cystic acne, but it did dry out my whiteheads a little. It also left a sticky white residue on my face ..which was kind of gross. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for hormonal or severe acne. It may do the trick for small, occasional breakouts. May be worth a try, depending on your acne situation.</li>
            <li> I have struggled with acne for almost 30 years...but, this stuff is the best. WAY better than Proactiv. It does a very good job of keeping things under control and spot treatment. I also get a lot of redness/inflammation..this product does wonders.</li>
            <li> I had the worst reaction from a dry shampoo I had tried and I tried acne washes, tretinoin (Retin A), and anything else I could get my hands on to help me with these pustule like breakout from hell. I was standing in the acne aisle desperately looking for something that wasn&#x27;t going to make this worse. (Though I can use tretinoin often, other things really make my face bright red and rashy).  I&#x27;ve used this for almost 2 days and I now feel comfortable going out in public. Thank you so much. Warning that it will bleach dark colors, like your towels if you aren&#x27;t careful.</li>
            <li> Works just as long as you wash your face with just water first, then apply this to problem spots. If you just put this n the problem spots and not wash your face first, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well.</li>
            <li> Does not work great but works fine.</li>
            <li> This product literally works overnight and maybe a day for those tougher areas.  You only need a little dab on the affected area and let it dry...I use it overnight and rinse it off the next morning.  it helps the process if you take a shower first to open your pores and then apply immediately after.  You won&#x27;t buy another product after you try this.  The price is great.  Don&#x27;t let the small size tube fool you.  It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I gave this 3 stars .... it works well for my husband, but it irritated my daughter &#x27;s fine skin. She is a preteen. So I think it Is hit or miss. But on my husband it is doing what it claims. So ou might want to give it  a try.</li>
            <li> I actually own two of these and I prefer to use this on bad break outs. Its a lot cheaper than the proactive healing lotion but I found this works better on isolated spots. Now its not miracle cream, like most people think and review it bad. Its meant to dry out the pore forcing the left over pus to the top. That&#x27;s so it can heal faster and you will stop picking at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it works so good at taking down the swelling and drying it out, this a great product for the huge bumps you might find on the back or neck. I always try to keep it in my purse and I find myself offering some to my guy friends when its absolutely bad.</li>
            <li> It might work for other people. In my case it burt my face. I actually had dark spots. Threw it away.</li>
            <li> after applying this cream - left my face feeling itchy and burning sensation&lt;br /&gt;please note - I used a Q-tip to apply to the small needed  area</li>
            <li> So I went to walmart one day and was looking for an acne spot treatment and I saw this so I tried it not expecting much from a $5 dollar product. After about a week almost all of my acne was gone and now this stuff is like my holy grail for getting rid of acne especially fast !!</li>
            <li> I have cystic acne and I have tried all kinds of remedies: herbal, OTC, mixed products, etc. I have found that this works the best. I have also used an otc topical steroid (cortisone), and the best effect is when I use both. A layer of this cream and a layer of the cortisone, twice a day. If I catch the cyst early enough, this has helped it from even reaching the outer layer of the epidermis and when the cyst has reached the surface, instead of lasting for a month, they only last about 2 weeks and do not get as large or as red.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because a co-worker recommended it but I didn&#x27;t like it at all... probably wouldn&#x27;t recommend to my friends going forward</li>
            <li> I am impressed and happy to have found a spot treatment that works. First of all I have sensitive skin and sometimes the acne treatments I choose make my acne worse, because of this I don&#x27;t really experiment much anymore with acne treatment products but for some reason I decided to try this. I was initially disappointed because the first several days it caused some irritation. I was using it daily 1-2x a day and because I knew how sensitive I was I stopped using it after the 3rd day. A few days later my sensitive reaction left and my acne was almost gone. I decided that maybe I was using it too much and to slow down in my usage. That really helped, I switched to every other day during breakouts and slowly worked my way up to 2x applications on bad breakouts with no problems. It is so effective, my skin isn&#x27;t sensitive to it anymore, and now when I see a few pimples that are starting to form I start applying this under my make up and then again after I wash my face at night and it sometimes prevents them from forming and always speeds up the healing process so I don&#x27;t have them for more than a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I love this stuff. If you are a bit overzealous with your application at first and it is causing irritation that isn&#x27;t an allergic reaction, just mild irritation, then I suggest you adjust your application times until your skin gets used to frequent use you before you completely give up on the product. My VERY sensitive skin can handle it and I am so sensitive I have to be very careful with the products I put on my skin.</li>
            <li> Best there is, this gel actually works and I hope it wont be removed from amazon US department. (It was removed from UK department) Otherwise my face will be once again full of acne that look like bee stings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I&#x27;m a little baffled by the negative reviews --- honestly, it&#x27;s a lifesaver for me. I break out in certain locations all the time...recurring white-head pimples beneath my nose, on my chin, forehead, and chest, as well as my back. And they hurt like HELL. The second I feel one coming on, I dab just a smidge of this on throughout the day (about every 4-5 hrs) and it not only alleviates the pimple pain and decreases the redness, but they basically shrink and go away without me having to pop them (OR, for the close to bursting ones - wonderful visual there, I know - it makes &#x27;em get over and done with exceedingly faster). Personally, it stings very rarely and not even close to &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34;. I would suggest just making sure you do a realllllly light layer - if you can see any white, that&#x27;s way too much on there. And I ONLY use it as a spot treatment for white-head pimples and mild recurring chest acne. I can see how doing a full face of this could burn, but that&#x27;s not what I use it for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, it&#x27;s magic - and fast....solves a lot of problems if I have an event and don&#x27;t want to look like an alien with a giant red dot on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as we learned in Once Upon a Time, all magic comes with a cost:&lt;br /&gt;a) It definitely dries out my skin if I use it heavily for more than 2 days on the same spot, but I use Simple lotion/cleansin products and Ponds Makeup Wipes once a day. And once the pimple is gone, the lotion from Simple floods the area with moisture and we&#x27;re all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s well worth it just for getting rid of the pimple pain.</li>
            <li> Works great! It dries out your skin though so be sure to lotion with it!</li>
            <li> I had been using proactiv for a few months and it was no longer working. I was getting so frusterated with my break outs! So I decided to give this a try and WOW did it work!! My skin was clearer in one day! There was a little drying at the spot of application, but went away will a tiny drop of lotion. I will be purchasing this again!</li>
            <li> I like that this can massage in where I can wear my make-up over it through-out the day.</li>
            <li> Did not anything for my acne after going through almost the entire tube. All it did was stain towels (Even after I tried to wash it off my hands) and make my skin greasy.</li>
            <li> As a senior, I still get the occasional breakout, but this immediately takes away the tenderness and clears it up, even before it&#x27;s come to the surface of my skin.  You only need a small dab.  Good product, and I can get it without the rest of the AcneFree products included.</li>
            <li> Effective, but does NOT blend in -- aka stays very white on my skin. Did not find this drying as other reviewers mentioned.</li>
            <li> I am not going to write a long detailed review. Basically, this product is a gem. It works well and is a bargain for its price. Applied once a day and one week later had cleared up a cluster of pimples. Bravo!</li>
            <li> Great item! Great price!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t over dry like most do</li>
            <li> Its a white, thin lotion-like consistency. Cap sticks a little, but not a big deal. Works great! Buy as a subscribe and save item and get it for around $3.50.</li>
            <li> I bought this a while back because my skin has gone crazy. I&#x27;m 32, and suddenly started having break outs all over my face, lots of black heads, and now I have back acne, never had this before, and it&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s cystic and leaving scars. I bought this since I was trying anything and every thing and nothing was working.  This stuff does make it disappear immediately, I didn&#x27;t expect it to, but it has faded the blemishes slowly and I noticed I don&#x27;t break out as often. I don&#x27;t use it daily, once every few days so I&#x27;m sure if I used it more it would work faster, but I have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t like to use anything on a daily basis because I always seem to have a reaction, and severe dryness.  I experience some dryness with this product but not much, I just use Cerave lotion over it after it&#x27;s completely dry.</li>
            <li> Acnefree Spot Treatments Terminator 10 is the only cream I&#x27;ve found that actually works when I&#x27;m having a breakout.  I also use a tiny amount daily in the T-zone to prevent acne.</li>
            <li> This stuff works amazingly! I don&#x27;t see any difference between the strengths so I would recommend getting the lowest. I do not have sensitive skin and I have mild acne</li>
            <li> love this! I use it for a couple days and have clear skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 2 months, applying the cream every night before bed. I&#x27;m very pleased with my results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of days I started using this cream, I saw no immediate effects. It seemed to be just another acne cream that promised way more than it was capable of. I remained hopeful, however, and continued to apply the cream everyday before I went to bed. After about 4 - 5 days of this routine is when I started receiving the results I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does this cream continue to keep my face free from red spots and noticable acne, it has helped me regain my confidence again. I don&#x27;t have to worry about those embarrassing spots all over face as long as I keep using this cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my nightly routine:&lt;br /&gt;Step 1 - Make sure your face is washed. (I&#x27;ve tried washing my face with soap and water and other times with wet wipes, both ways gave me the same outcome.)&lt;br /&gt;Step 2 - After you wash your face, let your skin air dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 3 - Apply cream on desired areas. (I&#x27;d say a dab roughly the size of your finger nail is a good amount to use.)&lt;br /&gt;Step 4 - Await results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this acne cream to anyone who is looking for more products to control embarrassing pimples.</li>
            <li> Leaves a stain on clothing/towels. Works great though.</li>
            <li> even a tiny amount makes my skin burn, and yet it still didn&#x27;t seem to have any impact on the spots requiring spot treatment.  I&#x27;ve had much better (though not perfect) results with Neutrogena&#x27;s salicylic acid spot treatment.  The hunt continues</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I ignored all of the recent, negative reviews because this stuff actually works. I bought it because I broke out with two insanely huge zits actually they were cystic pimples and that&#x27;s extremely rare for me. I have never had pimples this large and swollen and they hadn&#x27;t improved in weeks. I still have them but after using this product for a couple days, the swelling has gone down dramatically and they look much, much better. At least they&#x27;re starting to heal finally. So for cystic acne, I highly recommend this product it helps reduce the deep swelling and heals up a lot quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that it does dry out my skin &amp; you can&#x27;t really use it on problem areas it&#x27;s just a spot treatment only. I tried putting some on each side of my chin on a larger area and it burned a little, was red and hurt. Anyways, I think it&#x27;s a good product, it&#x27;s cheap and I would recommend trying it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not paid for this review, I did not receive a free sample, just my honest experience using this product. I got the 10% btw.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this product. If you are looking to get rid of acne fast, this is the product you want. Hands down, my favorite. I put a dab on at night and by the morning, its litterally almost gone. By the second morning gone totally.</li>
            <li> This is about the best stuff out there.  The microencapsulation REALLY does make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;It helps the Benzoyl Peroxide get further down into the pores to kill almost all of the bacteria.  The anti redness&lt;br /&gt;additives they put in there also avoid that undesirable side effect.  It also helps to add in a microencapsulated&lt;br /&gt;salicylic acid wash twice a day to keep your skin free of breakouts.  That helps dissolve what the bacteria feed on.</li>
            <li> It will remove a certain level of redness and inflammation over night, if you clean your face before. This really only works on large fresh pimples, not old scars, fading ones, or small clusters.</li>
            <li> Everything is okay except for the expiration date. All 4 tubes will expire in 10/2014. I merely won&#x27;t be able to expend 4 tubes till October. So at least 2 of them will be expired.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm! Great for the whole face to keep it nice and smooth or just the one zit.</li>
            <li> This stuff is really good but sometimes i don&#x27;t know if its really working.&lt;br /&gt;Like it will help up to a point but then it stops.&lt;br /&gt;Not complaining cuz everything else doesn&#x27;t help as fast.</li>
            <li> Awesome! My teenage son really struggles with bad skin. He uses this twice a day and after two weeks we are really starting to see a difference. I am hopeful that another two weeks will help even more. There is no drying either.</li>
            <li> Does not work at all. Should&#x27;ve gone for a bottle of tea tree oil instead.</li>
            <li> This stuff is way too strong for my skin. I tested it first and was fine and upon the second application, there was a two inch radius around the pimple that was red, itchy and painful for about 3-4 days. I used Melaleuca to help calm my skin down and it went away. I think 10% might be a bit too strong for me and will order something a little less intense.</li>
            <li> This product works well at reducing acne in general. I used accutane and that completely stopped my acne while I was on it and greatly reduced it afterwords. After reducing the acne by about 80% I was happy but of course wanted to have completely clear skin. While(and before) using this product I also use Alpha Hydrox Foaming Face Wash, apricot face scrub w/ salicylic acid, and  Alpha Hydrox AHA Enhance. These other products helped a lot but this benzyl peroxide put the nail in the coffin for my acne. That being said I do apply it generally over my whole face and at night - both are not the recommended usage. It is meant to be used as spot treatment and will also work well as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some negative you should know about the product:&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit drying but less than other benzyl peroxide I&#x27;ve used in the past(I had a derm script for another brand as one of my many pre accutane acne control attempts)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product will discolor anything you get it on the same as bleach would. You have to be careful to not get this on your clothes or on your hand towels. It will discolor your pillow if you use it at night, some people will place a towel on their pillow to avoid this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just as it will discolor you fabrics it will also slightly bleach your skin. If you are tanned you may be able to tell a slight difference in your complexion. My derm warned me about this when I originally tried BP but its not a severe side effect and doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Very good so far. No additional pimples from when i bought it. This will be my new staple.</li>
            <li> Other products use an unfairly low amount of the active ingredient, like 2 or 2.5%. This stuff uses 10% and it works great. I put some on at night and by the time I woke up my blemishes were smaller and less noticeable, especially in redness. I have somewhat sensitive skin, but I was surprised that this stuff doesn&#x27;t cause that much irritation. I really recommend this product.</li>
            <li> One of our teen&#x27;s favorite products for acne.</li>
            <li> This product is great. The only product that has ever worked on my acne. Works overnight, and in the morning,  the acne is gone. My whole family uses it, it&#x27;s life changing.</li>
            <li> I like this product - it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. It dries my skin out a bit so I only apply it directly to the breakouts after washing. The only thing I need to work on now are the acne marks and blemishes ... the product takes time to work so you need patience when using it. Also, it helps to wash one&#x27;s face at least twice a day</li>
            <li> It seems to work better than other 10% creams.</li>
            <li> This works a little too well at first, completely dried me out. Then it worked perfectly and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. My skin has gotten used to these chemicals, I guess I&#x27;ll have to find something else &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> This didnt work for me at all. I put this one every night and did nothing for my pimples. Only dry out my skin im certain spots if I dab the area. Very disappointed since theres great reviews. I wish this worled for me. :(</li>
            <li> work great, will dry your face though.</li>
            <li> has always been my favorite. A little peeling on the skin after applying, so recommended rest a day then continue using. Thats what I do</li>
            <li> Works great on the red, or infected, inflamed bumps.</li>
            <li> Works on my acne when I have them on my face. My acne would start going away the next day.</li>
            <li> This stuff does almost NOTHING for my face. I put it on before I go to sleep and take it off in the morning, it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin, or even irritate it, but it also doesn&#x27;t do anything for those random pimples that pop up. It doesn&#x27;t even make them go down the tiniest bit. It&#x27;s not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Got this for my grandson and he says it really works well.</li>
            <li> This works geat, for my acne I put it on twice a day and as long as I dont mess with anything the pimple is gone the next day. I love this range of products and would reccomend it to anyone who has suffered with acne like I have.</li>
            <li> I used this in conjunction with the 4 step kit. I dabbed it on the larger pimples and they were less visible the next day and completely gone by the day after that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving this four stars because it does dry out skin but really that&#x27;s expected at 10% benzoyl peroxide vs. the usual 2-5%. I&#x27;m in my mid thirties and have for the last five years, suffered with acne and cystic acne. I&#x27;ve tried everything, literally, that you can purchase over the counter. THIS STUFF WORKS. Normally a cystic blemish (for me) takes months to go away, even with other products I&#x27;ve used. Acne Free Terminator clears them up in only a couple weeks and I don&#x27;t get the swelling, redness, and pain like I used to with them. It has cleared up my normal breakouts entirely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For combination skin, this works well, at least it did for me. But you WILL need a good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> effective, good price</li>
            <li> I would only recommend this as a spot treatment for people who get the occasional pimple. I tried this when I had severe cystic acne which meant I had to apply it all over my face and it was so harsh I woke up the next day with a completely red face. If you need an acne treatment for all over use I would recommend the acne.org treatment which only has 2.5% benzyl peroxide but worked so much better for my skin than this one</li>
            <li> Great product... Really stops inflammation of blemishes and helps reduce the appearance of it!</li>
            <li> Good, not great.  The generic version does just as good a job for less money.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t effective.  The Neutrogena Rapid Clear is MUCH better.</li>
            <li> It is the best product I have ever used.  All kind of acnes are disappered after a few days use.  Wonderful!</li>
            <li> Probably the best acne cream on the market. I&#x27;ve used dozens of products, none work as effective and quickly as this. I&#x27;m on my 2nd supply in a few months.</li>
            <li> Helps keep breakouts at bay.  Works better than the other brands in my opinion.  Not loaded with silicones.  Lots of these type products has pore clogging ingredients.  This one did not and the difference showed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had terrible breakouts for past 15 years.&lt;br /&gt;As I type this today I am breakout free and pray it continues.  My routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wash face with raw honey.  ( sometimes mixed with citric acid.)&lt;br /&gt;Apply Dr Lin salicylic acid wipes&lt;br /&gt;Apply this BP Creme all over face.&lt;br /&gt;Apply clear aloe vera gel to lock in some moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this method my skin is never dry, yet is getting better every day.  I am terrified of acne returning but so far things are good.  Life changing.  I won&#x27;t go a day without this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is way better than proactive in my opinion.  Proactive has ingredients in their BP Cream that clog pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit.  Still love and ordering this product.  If I skip it I break out.</li>
            <li> THIS NOT GOOD FOR PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN. PLUS ITS NOT VERY GOOD AT REDUCING REDNESS AND SWELLING. THIS STUFF MADE ME IT VERY BADLY. ALMOST WENT TO THE DOC FOR A SHOT TO STOP THE ITCHING.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Soooo many acne treatments from Rx to Proactive and none had seemed to do the trick. I applied this to my face before I went to bed and when I woke, my face was noticeably different..?! I&#x27;ve been using This product for 5 days now and I can confidently say it does it&#x27;s job. The only downfall I&#x27;ve come across is it begins to dry out your skin after a continual use, so I&#x27;ve been using lotion on my face 1-2 hours after I use it. Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, I happen to have terribly sensitive skin, and it&#x27;s not going to work for everyone. But it&#x27;s only $5 for 1 oz so I decided to give it a try.. Glad I did:)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried various other Acne Products, even clinique. I had a wedding coming up that I was going to in 10 days. 8 days I used Clinique religiously as directed. Instead of getting better it got worse, at the end of day 8 I started using Rapid Clear from Neutrgena (Which works wonders for my backacne) after 24 hours nothing changed and I decided to go back to this product. Within an hour my acne sights were HALF the size they were originally. Happy ending was that by the day of the wedding my acne were tiny things that a little make up couldn’t cover up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now you may have noticed in my comment I stated &amp;#34;I decided to go back to this product.&amp;#34; This is true, the reason I went to something different was because my skin is oober sensitive. Yes it reddens my skin and yes it makes it itchy and sometimes dry. These are easily (at least for me) fixed. First I don’t slather it on my skin I take a pea size amount and put a VERY THIN layer where it is needed ( Mine is on my cheeks). I do this after my shower before I go to bed ( I use my usual face wash before hand) usually by morning there is a dramatic difference. I&#x27;ve noticed when I do a thin layer the reddening of the face doesn&#x27;t happen neither the over drying. However, if there is over drying and your face is really sensitive to face lotions I can&#x27;t speak highly enough about Clinique&#x27;s deep moisturizing gel.....A-Mazing. As for the itching....well I just don&#x27;t scratch it, it doesn&#x27;t bother me enough to notice it 24/7. This is also a product I don&#x27;t use every day, just spot treatment.</li>
            <li> Works well, but loses a star because of the bleaching.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many acne spot treatments and none of them worked like this did. I had one of those deep and painful pimples forming on my check and was terrified that it wouldn&#x27;t be gone by the time I leave for my trip this weekend. I started using this spot treatment when I first noticed the blemish and it didn&#x27;t even grow to a full size! It started shrinking fast and it really does help with redness</li>
            <li> Average results for 14 year old. Cannot seem to find a product strong enough to knock out the teenage acne. Have scrub, toner and cream...</li>
            <li> Decent. Depends on your acne and how senstive your skin is. Seems to keep it from going insane but still does not prevent my problem areas from  always being a problem. It is great for when your skin is under control and need it for a blemish or 2. I&#x27;d recommend trying it. Just be careful if you have sensitive skin, start out with small amounts and use once a day gradually brining it up to 2 or 3.</li>
            <li> This product worked to eliminate moderate-severe acne in my daughter. Inexpensive. This **continuous release** 10% benzoyl peroxide worked within a week and the bottle color made it easy for her to remember to apply it.  They sell it within a whole set of cleaners, toners and other things but this part was the only part she used.  I think it is the continuous release part that made it work.  Cheap and effective in our situation. I would recommend this as a next step for acne if the usual remedies have failed.</li>
            <li> wow this is strong and seems to do job. if smear around on skin, can make dry and flaky so only apply to zit problem.</li>
            <li> Works better than proactive</li>
            <li> Caused my skin to break out even more around the chin and forehead area. Do not recommend this product at all!!</li>
            <li> I have a couple small clusters of whiteheads that I&#x27;ve been trying to get rid of for the past few months. I tried 3 different salicylic acid treatments, that got rid of some of them. But some of them were closed comidones (whiteheads which have completely plugged and clogged the pore) I found a site online that said for regular whiteheads use salicylic acid, but for comidones, use benzoil peroxide. I used the salicylic acid every day for about 6 weeks on the comidones with no effect whatsover. But I was very nervous about trying the benzoil peroxide because I have extremely allergy prone skin. I was also concerned about peeling and irritation. But the salicylic acid wasn&#x27;t really working, so I decided to try the benzoil peroxide. I bought this on a whim at Walmart. I don&#x27;t remember how much I paid for it, but I think it was between $4 and $6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try a 2.5% benzoil peroxide treatment from Neutrogenia that I had first. But again, even though I gave it a good amount of time, it didn&#x27;t really take care of the comidones. But I was also pleasantly surprised. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or trigger any type of allergic reaction. The list of things my skin has reacted to is long, so that is a definitely plus for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to admit, I was more than a little worried about trying the 10% benzoil peroxide treatment. But nothing else I&#x27;d tried had really worked. Amazingly, it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it every night before bed. I&#x27;d usually apply it two times before going to bed. Once a couple hours before bed, and then right before bed. It has made a HUGE difference. The size and number of the comidones have decreased dramatically. Every day they get smaller and smaller. After a couple more days, they will be gone completely. I haven&#x27;t had any trouble with skin discoloration or itching or anything like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do, however, have one major complaint about this product. The packaging is terrible. The tube itself isn&#x27;t bad, but the cap is really hard to open and close. You really have to pull to get the cap open. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s easier to just unscrew the cap and squeeze it out that way. This product works great, so it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from repurchasing it, but the cover design really could use some work. Other than that, this is a great product, and I will keep it on hand. Just in case I get more whiteheads. Great product.n&#x27;t bad, but the cap is really hard to open and close. You really have to pull to get the cap open. I&#x27;ve found it&#x27;s easier to just unscrew the cap and squeeze it out that way. This product works great, so it wouldn&#x27;t keep me from repurchasing it, but the cover design really could use some work. Other than that, this is a great product, and I will keep it on hand. Just in case I get more whiteheads. Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best acne cream I have ever tried. A little bit goes a long way. It worked on my cystic acne and now my face is clear. You do have to watch for drying of the skin though but that is usually the case with any good acne cream</li>
            <li> This is a phenomenal product. Admittedly I haven&#x27;t tried everything out there, but this is an unbeatable spot treatment. I only have mild acne at my worst, so spot treatment works well for me. This blows Proactiv, Clean &amp; Clear, and even natural masks like bentonite clay and Australian olive clay right out of the water. You hardly have to use any product at all to be effective so a 1 oz. tube lasts for a very long time. I don&#x27;t know why I would even bother to try anything else.</li>
            <li> Works great, but does dry the skin out a little</li>
            <li> No miracle in a bottle--er tube--but does an impressive job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does its thing well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a former pimple picker who has tried a lot of home remedies (lemon juice, baking soda, changing pillowcases, you name it), it took many years of experimenting before I cam across this loving Terminator who, like Arnold, did an amazing job at destroying the alien infestations of P. acnes over my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have severe acne, just the very occasional white head that decides to make my chin and mouth miserable.  Well, those days of being down in the dump are decreasing due to this Terminator.  Just smear a thin amount over the white crater, and in a couple of days the white pus stuff you used to cream out of your face will have disappeared and some temporary redness will remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;(1) If you put too much on, you&#x27;ll try out other areas of your face&lt;br /&gt;(2) The extra cream you squeeze out of the tube and do not use dries up quickly into a dried liquid white-out (Hello 90s generation!) semi solid like stuff that can&#x27;t be used again.</li>
            <li> shipping was fast but i dont think this works for my skin. I felt like the skin is burning when I put this on. The whole part that I put this on became even more red. Also the skin became so dry and itchy too.. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use this</li>
            <li> I use it on small pimples that pop up every now and then. Works great and fast to get rid of them.</li>
            <li> Works very well, and glad it doesn&#x27;t contain a lot of artificial ingredients and salicylic acid!</li>
            <li> I always use benzoyl on my zits and this one has been doing a good job. I am doing other regimen on my face too so it&#x27;s hard to completely isolate what&#x27;s been working better. This one notes that it reduces redness (don&#x27;t they all) so I figured I&#x27;d give it a try and the first tube has been doing the job. I will reorder this brand over the clean &amp; clear i was buying at target.</li>
            <li> I applied onto my face before I go to sleep, then I found my acen become smaller the next morning. I think it works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and still get breakouts. I use the Acne free face wash and then dab a small amount of this product on my forehead and chin. I rarely get a pimple now. The rest of my face is dry and needs moisturizer, but not my forehead and chin. Just a tiny bit of this every day is enough. Don&#x27;t over use, because this product is strong. Too much will over dry and cause redness and irritation. Used right Acnefree does a great job.</li>
            <li> Most of these acne meds are a big fail - this one works pretty well if you are consistent and use it right on the hot spots.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  First product that I have found that will actually prevent and minimize acne.  I&#x27;m a believer</li>
            <li> Lot number and expiration date well marked with plenty of time before product is reportedly not useable. Easy open/close snap lid.</li>
            <li> I have such a hard time remembering to do things on a daily basis that it&#x27;s hard to tell if its working or if my face is just letting nature take it&#x27;s course.</li>
            <li> CLEARASIL WORKS WAY BETTER</li>
            <li> I know I need to change my diet and take better care of myself if i want clearer skin but in the meantime i had to do something about this acne in order to face the world.  I&#x27;ve never tried an over the counter product  which works before this.  This really works!  I dab a little all over my face after washing.  My skin started to feel better after the first use and surprisingly I think it&#x27;s even gotten rid of a lot of the black heads on my nose.  This is much cheaper than proactive and less consuming.  It is a bit drying though, I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to deal with that.</li>
            <li> If you use it 2-3 times a day you can completely clear up average acne breakout!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Benzoyle Peroxide... nothing else to say. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> It does help to treat the spots.</li>
            <li> My teen loves all the AcneFree products she has tried! She uses several of them and there is definitely improvement and healing.</li>
            <li> This is very effective. Applied at night and pimple dried out overnight.</li>
            <li> Saw small changes, at least there was some improvement</li>
            <li> If you have acne you must!! Buy this product it really really works like nothing else before! Trust me! I usually never write reviews but because I LOVE this product sooooo much I had to. Please buy it it will change your life!</li>
            <li> i have seen an improvement, however, be safe - it is definitely strong! don&#x27;t put too much on tender places (like under the eyes). but works great for deep cysts</li>
            <li> Ive bought this product in store before, It runs out every couple months. Its good for the price and recommend to anyone with acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these and I&#x27;ve gotten these for my family members too. It works immediately and you&#x27;ll see quick results within 10-15 minutes! Love this product.</li>
            <li> At the age of 29, I thought I was done with acne, but since my teens I get periodic breakouts.  Going on BC brought down the intensity, but not the frequency and because of OCD, I obsess over the particularly noticeable blemishes. A few days ago, one such spot popped up below my lip.  It was painful, VERY red, and my oxy-pads did nothing to reduce the swelling or color.  In desperation, I stopped at CVS on my way to work to get more spot on ointment.  The one I usually use was out of stock, and in desperation, I grabbed this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had never tried AcneFree before, though I&#x27;d seen the line in various stores for some time, choosing to stick with products I knew like Neutrogena, but I figured I&#x27;d try it.  And I&#x27;m glad I did-in 3 hours, the color had reduced by half from a bright, fire engine red, to a crayon pink, and the swelling had gone down as well.  Since then, I&#x27;ve used it on other spots on my cheeks and forehead and both have shown good results.  I&#x27;m definitely an AcneFree Severe convert.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, enough said.</li>
            <li> Works..but it takes a couple of days. Don&#x27;t expect that big zit or pimple to go away in a matter of minutes with this. It soothes the redness which make the pimple less noticeable. I only use this in emergency cases because it can be quite drying and irritating but it does its job. I generally use creams salicylic acid in my daily routine to control acne. Be careful though as it could bleach your clothing or linen, my pillow case will never be the same with 2 yellow bleached marks.</li>
            <li> Usually see a difference with one use</li>
            <li> This product works well (as do all 10% benzoyl peroxide products that I have tried), but I absolutely hate the lid on this.  It gets all gunky no matter what I do.  I will be switching brands because I am tired of the mess.</li>
            <li> works pretty good but will bleach your sheets or cloths if your not careful.</li>
            <li> Clears and dries pimples up quickly.</li>
            <li> This is the only 10% benzoyl peroxide acne medication I&#x27;ve used (and I have used several different brands) that doesn&#x27;t make my face either shiny or excessively flaky. I haven&#x27;t really noticed significant redness reduction, but I am happy with the product at the price point and find it to be much more effective than salicylic acid formulations. I&#x27;ve found that my acne is not a problem when I use this product and flares up every time I run out. I recommend this product for women with mild to moderate (including hormone induced) acne.</li>
            <li> All it did was dry my pimple. I guess we all have different skin</li>
            <li> Caused major allergic reaction.  I was within hours of making a medical appointment after my face swelled up and developed hives from this product.  Then gradually my skin returned to normal.</li>
            <li> i did work for my pimples. have used it couple of times and the pores and redness also seems to reduce. Do buy this product but do not overdo with the usage of this one because it will dry ur skin. just apply it at the places which requires treatment yes, there is slight burning sensation but it is no big deal.</li>
            <li> WOW! all my acne was gone within a few weeks!!!! Love love love this product! Buying again!!</li>
            <li> Works to reduce acne.</li>
            <li> helps slowly and makes the skin dry</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work for me, not even making the redness go away.</li>
            <li> This is not a miracle cure but definitely speeds up the process.</li>
            <li> pimples dont go away until after 3 days</li>
            <li> value for money , easy to use and effective</li>
            <li> This works almost instantly. Pimples are reduced overnight! It does have my face a bit dry though</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a whole lot of acne so I&#x27;m not sure how well it&#x27;d work in extreme cases, but it works well for me as a spot treatment.  But a warning, this will stain your clothes like crazy.  I&#x27;ve had to throw away several T-shirts because of it.  If you plan to use this on your back or neck or places where the cream will be in contact with your clothes, it will stain your clothes and spreads like crazy.  Yes it spreads, seems like washing your clothes just make the stain spot spread.  It stains worse on T-shirts than other material for some reason.  So please be careful when using it.</li>
            <li> Works great, dries out spots immediately. Be careful though, will bleach your clothes/linens :/</li>
            <li> This has worked really well on our teen age son. ..</li>
            <li> The cap is difficult to open.</li>
            <li> I am using this in combination with a Stridex wash and it works great. It helps clear up blemishes fast.</li>
